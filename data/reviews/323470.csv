"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070971855/recommended/323470/","76561198070971855","The Coolest Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070971855/","50 products in account","If you're a fan of Dragon Ball Z, this game is a must have for you.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe new storymode is interesting and isn't the same ol', same ol'. Lots of interesting plot twists, and the gameplay is really good. If you've played Battle of Z, they carried over the 3 - 4 way fighting system, and the combat is really fun. There are a lot of great customization options for you to buy or unlock through playing the game, and you get to customize your own character from the ground up. You can choose to have a balanced build, an energy based build, or full on melee combat.\n\nThe game also introduces parallel missions, where you can team up with either your favourite heroes or villains, i.e Frieza, and take down Goku, collect dragon balls, etc. They have a random chance of having a rare event, which is really neat. In one of the missions I went through, Ginyu stole Goku's body, and a rare event unlocked where he transformed into a super saiyan.\n\nYou get points as you level for stat distribution, and you'll unlock different inconic skills throughout your time playing the game,\n\nThe game also introduces a mentor system to the series, several main characters/villains will pop up later in the game, and you'll be able to learn their unique skills. Ever wanted to use body change as a customized character? Now you can.\n\n\nThe somewhat bad:\n\nDon't expect to just pop into the game, complete the story mode, and be done with it. You're going to have to do a lot of parallel missions to the point of grinding in order to progress through the story. You won't unlock your transformations through the story, i.e Super Saiyan, which is a bit of an annoyance. You'll either have to repeat the same parallel mission numerous times until you get lucky enough for a rare event to occur, and then have a 10% chance of getting super saiyan, or buy it for 40,000 zenni from skill shop.\n\n(You should have enough by the time you get to the point in the story where you can buy it.)\n\n\nTranformations:\n\nSaiyans get three transformations, kaioken, Super saiyan, and Super saiyan 2. They also get two alternatives to super saiyan, which is Super Vegeta 1, and Super Vegeta 2. (Looks like  ultra super saiyan from the anime, makes your character bulkier. Only cosmetic as far as I know.)\n\nThe other races didn't have as much work put into them transformation wise, if you play as a non-saiyan, all you're going to get is kaioken, which can go up to x20. (Not sure how kaioken works, but you have to unlock the more advanced forms of it, i.e kaoiken x3 and x20.)\n\nIt's disappointing that non-saiyans only have one transformation, especially since the overworld of the game is heavily inspired - taken over and revamped from the Dragonball Online MMO. Namekians could've had their gigantic super namekian form like Lord Slug and from the MMO, and Majins could've transformed into super majins, i.e Super Buu, and had a second transformation that turned them into a kid form, i.e Kid Buu.\n\nYou may argue that for humans it wouldn't have made sense for them to have a transformation besides Kaioken, but they could've given humans a third eye transformation like Tien, some form of unlock potential, high tension like from the budokai games, or hell, even just a "Super human" transformation. It's Dragon Ball Z, I don't think anyone really cares whether it makes sense or not.\n\n\nCustomization:\n\nCustomization is definitely a big part of this game, but for such a large part of the game... it feels limited. As you progress through the story, you'll obtain clothing items from iconic characters, like Piccolo's turban, Trunks' GT outfit, etc, and you have a lot of options here, but you won't be able to alter the colour of the clothing from the iconic characters, which is a major annoyance, especially since that's mainly what you're going to be using.\n\nI wanted to wear Hercule's outfit, but it provided a very marginal benefit to my stats, and even lowered some of my more important stats. Because of that, I felt forced into wearing Lord Slug's outfit, which provided more substantial buffs to the areas that I wanted.\n\nYou're also unable to change your character's physical appearance unless you collect the Dragon Balls and wish for it, which is just plain stupid. Want to change your hair colour or hair type? You can't unless you collect the Dragon Balls.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nDragonball Xenoverse is a great game, but it's incredibly grindy. If you're used to MMORPGS, then you're not going to mind it that much, but if not, you're going to have to put a lot of effort into leveling up your character, and depending on random chances for the things that you want. Luckily, you can buy mostly everything from the shops in the game, but there's a point between meaningful character progression and tedium.\n\nIn order to unlock more character slots, you're going to have to complete the main storyline at least once, which will take you ten hours to complete. Completely unecessary in my opinion, you should just be able to create multiple characters from the get go. So be prepared, make sure you create a character to your liking, or you'll have to delete him and re-make.\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThis game had insurmountable potential, I feel like they could've done so much more! The transformations are really lacking apart from super saiyan, the customization is very limited, and you have to grind to progress through the storyline. I love the mentor system, and the fact that I can actually learn body change from Captain Ginyu and switch bodies with other characters in vs. mode, but there's a lot lacking.\n\nThe parallel missions could've been done a lot better, there's so much damn potential with them. As I mentioned earlier in my review, my friend and I were beating the ♥♥♥♥ ouf of the Ginyu force, and we ran into Goku stuck in Captain Ginyu's body, then found Captain Ginyu in Goku's body, fought him, beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of him, and then Captain Ginyu in Goku's body transformed into a super saiyan. Moments like that are ♥♥♥♥ing incredible, but could've been expanded upon greatly.\n\nI feel like if they put more focus into the parallel missions and actually made them a full on story sequence with ingame cutscenes and additional content, we would've had a ♥♥♥♥ing master piece here. I would've LOVED to have seen Goku react to Captain Ginyu TURNING INTO A ♥♥♥♥ING SUPER SAIYAN WHILE IN HIS BODY, BEFORE GOKU COULD EVEN TURN SUPER SAIYAN.\n\nWe've all watched the story a million times and watched different renditions of it through the games, but they had the chance to do something really interesting here. The whole game is a gigantic WHAT IF scenario, and they could've expanded on that.\n\nI can't help but feel like it's a prototype, it just doesn't feel like a complete experience.\n\nFor what it is, it's an incredible experience, and if you're a Dragon Ball fan, buy it right ♥♥♥♥ing now.\n\nIf you're just a regular gamer, not really into Dragon Ball Z? Wait for it to go on sale, it probably isn't for you.\n\nIf you've stuck out through the whole review, thank you. I feel like everyone is just buying into the hype and giving out undeveloped opinions, so I wanted to say my piece.\n\n","February 28, 2015","true","28.7"," 1,103 of 1,143 people (97%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","97","103","1","56","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nefmiyama/recommended/323470/","nefmiyama","Nef Miyama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nefmiyama/","94 products in account","Whether or not to recommend this game is rather difficult, because it depends on what you're looking for. If you just want an action-packed romp through childhood nostalgia, Dragonball Xenoverse will serve you well. Ultimately this game is competent and you can get many hours of enjoyment out of it, but it does have some noticeable flaws that dirty a game with a lot of potential. I'll list some positive and negatives about each key feature I can think of.\n\nCreate-A-Character\n+ Being able to create your own avatar is very enjoyable, and you can customize everything about them, from what race and gender they are, to how tall or wide they are. You also distribute stat points to determine how much health, ki,  and stamina the character has, as well as how powerful each type of attack (basic, strike, ki) is.\n+ Large variety of clothing types that you can mix and match (some can be custom colored, some cannot).\n+ Huge list of skills and special attacks for you to use.\n\n- Character features, such as hair, eyes, etc. are somewhat limited. Hairs in particular have very few unique styles; many are based off existing characters.\n- A potential annoyance comes from how much effort is required to respec stats and redo appearance options (more on that later).\n\nStory Mode\nThe story mode of this game revolves around you. You're a member of the Time Patrollers, who make sure time doesn't get messed up. Obviously, the plot dictates that it does, and you get thrown into the DBZ storyline at certain points.\n\n+ Hits all of the key arcs, has some unique twists. It's nothing mind-blowing, but this is DBZ, so you kind of expect that.\n- Rather short; probably 6-7 hours worth, max. I wouldn't buy this game if all you're interested in is the story.\n\nGameplay\nYou'll be doing one of two things in this game; exploring the hub, known as Toki Toki City, or fighting things. Exploring the hub lets you buy items and clothes, talk to NPCs, and so on. But the whole core of this game is in the latter aspect, and it's what you'll be doing 90% of the time. When it comes to fighting things, you have a bit of variety in how you go about it. First, there's story mode, as you'd expect. Second, there are what are kind of like 'side-missions' known as Parallel Quests.\n\nParallel Quests can be done offline with NPCs (or by yourself), or online with up to 2 other players. They are how a large number of clothing and special items, as well as special attacks, end up being obtained. They are entirely co-op; you and everyone else work towards the main goal of the mission, which differs depending on what it is. There are basically two varieties; beat all enemies and collect the dragonballs while beating enemies.\n\nAnother important aspect of Parallel Quests are that they have conditions for unlocking special events that trigger an 'Ultimate Finish'. For example, you might have to beat a certain character before another character, or the special event won't trigger, which may lock you out of a certain skill unlock reward. Parallel Quests can be completed any number of times however, and there are a few reasons to do so, whether it be ranking or... farming items/skills.\n\nYes, everything you can receive from a Parallel Quest is based on a roll of the dice. On the one hand, this gives the quests some replayability, and on the other, you might find this frustrating when you really want a certain skill or clothing item and find yourself farming the quest for hours without it dropping because you were unlucky. It didn't bother me much as someone who plays a lot of RPGs and Roguelikes, but I can certainly see how it could get on a person's nerves.\n\nAnother thing you find in the Parallel Quests are the Dragon Balls. Yes, you can summon Shenron and make a wish, which is the only way to obtain a few of the many unlockables in this game. However, it is also the only way to respec your character's stat points, or change their physical appearance/voice set. Since collecting the Dragon Balls can take an hour or two even when you know the most efficient way to 'farm' them, it can be very annoying if you find out your build sucks and want to redo it.\n\n+ RNG aspect and special events give some decent replayability to the game.\n+ Gives a much-needed co-op 'PvE' option where you and a couple other guys can just beat up on Cell or something.\n+ Getting a new skill or item to try for a little while as you get more makes you feel less pressured and overwhelmed.\n\n- RNG aspect can also cause frustration through repetition or for people who dislike the thought of farming.\n- Dragon Balls, and therefore character respec and appearance edit, are locked behind RNG. Since your only other option is to level up a new character, this can be a problem.\n\nThere are also a number of PvP options, including 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 player matches, 1v1 ranked matches, and Endless Battle, which is similar to any console fighting game player lobby system, where two players fight, and everyone else in the room (up to 6 players total) spectate. There is also a (as of this review) unreleased World Tournament mode. Unfortunately, this is easily the weakest aspect of the game for me.\n\nI'll put it simply; PvP is broken. Even after bug fixes to some of the worst offenders, playing PvP in this game is rarely satisfying, in part due to the flexibility of CaC, letting you mix and match the strongest skills, and in part due to some questionable design choices for some skills and Z-Souls (special ability items basically). In some respects, due to the way these function, if you want to PvP, you may be required to use specific skills if you want to be able to play at all. I'll give you an example.\n\nSuper Saiyan. In this game, Super Saiyan lets you use all Super and Ultimate attacks that cost Ki for free. Normally, these cost 1 and 3 Ki bars respectively. The downside is that Super Saiyan will slowly-but-constantly drain your Ki while active, but during this time, you'll be able to fire off way more Ultimate attacks than you could have otherwise. So if someone goes Super Saiyan and starts spamming an Ultimate with super armor (which prevents flinching/interrupting the attack), you are going to die quickly and can't do much about it. There are counter skills, such as Change the Future, which can let you deal with this strategy to some extent. But there are some more powerful setups you can't do anything about.\n\nTo be fair, these issues could be patched, but that's the state of the game right now. And when you do find an opponent who doesn't use a 'win-button' strategy (which is rare), it is pretty fun.\n\n+ Modes do exactly what you'd expect and want the game to.\n+ Combat in general is deep due to the number of skills and unique movement options.\n\n- PvP is hard to enjoy due to a few overpowered skills, attacks, and Z-Souls.\n\nSound\nThere's not much to say here, the sound effects are classic and the soundtrack is memorable and well done.\n\n+ It's good.\n\n---\n\ntl;dr - Buy if you're a DBZ fan, don't mind RNG unlockables, and either don't care about PvP or are okay with DBZ-levels of power that goes on within it. This is a good, but flawed, game.","March 15, 2015","true","100.1"," 565 of 593 people (95%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","95","565","593","19","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/323470/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","If you're a fan of Dragon Ball in any capacity, the chances are that the story is now embedded deep within your psyche – especially if you've played even just a few of the licensed games over the years. It's hard to surprise a fan, then, because they already know the plot inside out from start to finish. Any sort of story mode is just going to be retreading the same ground again and again – and that's partly where the concept behind Dragon Ball XenoVerse comes into play.\n\nInstead of once again watching Earth's greatest warriors kick the crap out of the universe's biggest bad guys, XenoVerse incorporates time travel into a plot about Dragon Ball's history, and how it's being changed by an unknown force. Venturing to different points in the well-known timeline, it's up to you to set history back on its intended course. For example, what if the evil Raditz had avoided Piccolo's killer blow, and had emerged victorious from the fight that was meant to be his last? What if body-switching alien Ginyu had stolen Vegeta's form, and stomped our heroes before Goku ever arrived to save the day? The developer has clearly had some fun thinking up these alternate realities, and fans should really enjoy some of the more subtle touches throughout the game's story missions and subsequent cutscenes. In fact, the whole title's filled to the brim with references and nods to the original work, while the graphics recreate the universe well, with bright colours, flashy visual effects, and lightning quick animations.\n\nThe best part of it, though, is that you play as your own custom character. Choosing from a selection of five different races, which includes Saiyans, Namekians, Earthlings, Majin, and Frieza's race, the character creation isn't the deepest that you'll see, but there are enough cool options on offer to keep most players happy. Your fighter is at the heart of everything that you do, as you level them up, learn new skills, and kit them out with fantastic looking accessories and clothes, many of which are taken straight from the source material. They'll even appear in cutscenes, and although your avatar isn't voiced, the franchise's consistently stellar art style still fills them with personality. You work together with many of Dragon Ball's main cast, and the game does a decent job of making you feel like you're playing an important part in Dragon Ball's legacy. All together, the story missions will last you around ten hours, but there's little doubt that if you stick around that long, you'll be trying your hand at a lot of other stuff on the side.\n\nXenoVerse certainly isn't your standard fighting game. It's far more Dragon Ball Online than it is Budokai 3, and as such, if you were looking forward to a somewhat traditional brawler, you'll be a bit disappointed. You can still play one-on-one battles both online and offline with a relatively large and unlockable character roster to pick and choose from, but with the way that the whole title's set up, you'll be much better off approaching it from a different angle altogether. Put simply, this is more of a role-playing game than an out-and-out fighter, and although it's difficult to pin the title to any specific genre, the real meat of the release comes from developing your custom character as you tackle myriad optional quests and the aforementioned story missions.\n\nSpeaking of which, parallel quests are where you'll be spending a lot of your time. Essentially smaller objectives that have you taking on specific opponents in varying arenas, you'll nab rewards upon victory, which can include new techniques, clothing, or accessories. As far as special moves go, the game features just about every attack that's ever appeared in the source material, and being able to equip you own character with a slew of iconic moves will prove to be incredibly enjoyable if you're a fan.\n\nToki Toki City is your hub, where you'll buy, sell, and combine items, as well as pick up your missions. It's also the place where you'll meet other players, challenging them to duels or adding them to your team for the next quest. You can interact through a list of short phrases, from greetings to more specific comments, and you can even perform often comical actions and pull dumb looking poses if you're keen to be the centre of attention. Many of the mentioned interactions are taken from the original work, too, so once again, fans will adore their inclusion and appreciate the attention to detail. That's not to say that the title's only playable online, though. It's perfectly enjoyable if you prefer to be alone, but you'll be missing out on some brilliantly designed player characters. Indeed, you can take a seat in the city and just watch as countless great looking fighters go about their business, and then you can take a look at their personal stats, and see what sort of rare gear they've managed to get their hands on. All in all, the developer's built a surprisingly social addition to Akira Toriyama's ever-popular creation, where fans can gather and celebrate his work.\n\nXenoVerse's outer shell is well-realised and very enjoyable, but the core of any Dragon Ball game is always going to be its combat. Unfortunately, the battle system that's on offer here isn't the best that the property has seen, but it still manages to be a competent, and above all, fun take on the source material's outrageous brawls and over-the-top action. Anyone familiar with Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z's mechanics will likely grow into this with relative ease, but here, things are more accessible, and tuned to a much better degree. You can choose to grow your custom character however you see fit, turning them into a long-range powerhouse or a melee combat specialist, for instance, and while some tactics are arguably more effective than others, any sensible build should be enough to see out the game's single player content.\n\nWhether you're taking part in a one-on-one duel or a team battle, combat is quite deliberate, and forces a certain tactical awareness. Alongside your health bar, you've got stamina and ki gauges, each of which are used to perform certain actions. Special moves deplete your ki, while stamina drains every time that you block, dodge, or make use of an evasive skill, meaning that it's particularity important to understand when it's best to use up your resources, especially near the beginning of the game, when you can only seem to manage a single teleportation before you're out of breath. At first, combat seems quite limited: you make do with the same few basic combos, a couple of not-so-special techniques, and fights quickly become repetitive. However, stick with it, and battles really begin to open up as you make use of longer combo strings, eye-watering super moves, and teleport to your heart's content. As mission difficulty increases, the artificial intelligence gets much cockier, too, which results in some pretty spectacular looking brawls as you and your opponent zip around the wide open arenas, trading blows and firing off massive beam attacks. Of course, all of the classic Dragon Ball sound effects are here as well, which gives combat that much needed oomph.\n\nIf you've been holding out for a more traditional Dragon Ball fighter, Dragon Ball XenoVerse isn't it. It is, however, a well realised and refreshing take on Akira Toriyama's universe, which allows fans to appreciate the source material from a whole new angle. Accessible, fantastic combat, entirely customizable characters, and some fantastic online functionality give the game a unique identity, and arguably make it one of the most ambitious licensed titles that we've seen in years.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400086386\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","March 1, 2015","true","93.9"," 257 of 286 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","257","286","10","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Equinox147/recommended/323470/","Equinox147","Equinox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Equinox147/","358 products in account","Alright, I've played this game like crazy over the past weekend of launch, and I have to say, it has to be one of the best games within the Dragon Ball series. There are many reasons for my love of the game, however I have a few slight issues at the same time, which I will explain below (long review ahead, I really wanted to put effort into this):\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics of this game are easily the most touched up and crispy visuals I've ever seen from the series of games, yet alone most games in general. Beautiful colors, appealing constructions, realistic grounds, buildings, skies, the list goes on. As soon as I saw my first Kamehameha in the game, I realized instantly that the developers of the game heavily made sure there were no dull, unappealing textures or visuals to turn your eyes away, and that a good amount of time went into making it look flashy without overdoing it. Seriously, take a look at some screenshots, those in-game graphics are very smooth and luscious. Graphics options in a game are also a great thing to have as well, right? Well, you've come to right place. Xenoverse has many options to accomodate to many computers, even if you may not have the best PC known out there. Such options include... V-Sync, Frame Rate, Antialiasing, Resolution Size, Motion Blur, Voice Language (English, Japanese), etc. Even if you may possibly worry about how intensive the game may be with its eye-inducing graphics, the options in the game are very flexible to give the gamer his/her best preferred look and feel of gaming. Honestly, the graphics alone made me want to buy the game, but of course, I had to research more into the game before carelessly buying such an expensive title.\n\nCharacters & Stages\n\nNot much to say in this section. Character roster is solid, includes many characters that played major roles within the series, however some may feel disappointed with others being taken out from previous games. Everyone in the game has their own way of having an advantage over others with their movesets and abilities, and can actually stand up to stronger characters, such as Transformation and Fusion characters, which posed as a serious problem in the past games. Stages are easily manuverable and can be explored to your heart's content. Small barriers prevent you from going out of bounds, but mostly the whole battlefield can become your playground for exploring and destruction. Excellent designs and visuals for the stages as well, no problems there.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay for Xenoverse relies on a previous title, known as Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z. Personally, I did not like Battle of Z for the new style of fighting it introduced as a whole, and should've been revised before officially being released. However, this game rebuilds the fighting mechanics of its predecessor and greatly improves on the combo system, combo canceling, follow-ups on combos, everything you would expect from a good fighting game. Xenoverse emerges you into a setting where you can feel comfortable trying to string together long, powerful combos to ensure your upper edge on the opponent. Xenoverse also includes a format of fighting that allows you to team up with other players to fight against several forces, bypassing the usual restriction of having to deal with a quest that possibly may be too difficult for just one person. Unlike Battle of Z, the teammates' AI actually attempts to help you by reviving you or other downed allies in battle, even going so far as to following up from a combo that you've done to your opponent! This doesn't mean that you are able to just mash buttons and possibly try to loop your opponent and cause infinites on them. Xenoverse limits this possibility with Ki and Stamina bars, each going up to a certain amount, depending on the characters chosen. You'll have to play smart in order to play effectively with these bars in mind! Overall, I believe the gameplay is very solid and can be picked up easily with only an hour or two of practice.\n\nStory\n\nMostly every Dragon Ball game out there has a story mode that just shows you a boring timeline and you reenacting the events from the anime. Lame, right? Well, in Xenoverse, you're able to actually able to play through the story that we all know and love, while also having its own twists and turns with a completely new element of story replayability, which shows the events of the anime rewritten to the point where the complete opposite, or even something absolutely different happens! For example, when Goku and Piccolo fight Raditz as the first threat to Earth in Dragon Ball Z, usually Raditz and Goku die from a Special Beam Cannon. The twist of this event includes Raditz escaping Goku and being able to kill both him and Piccolo. This alone brought my attention to the story more than ever, I sat at the edge of my seat waiting to see the other distortions that could occur. You'll have to play the story for yourself to see exactly what could happen with other events, but I would easily recommend knowing the original story before trying to learn the distorted story. I also recommend the story for anyone who would like to experience a detailed, thrilling storyline that makes you wonder what could happen next.\n\nCharacter Creation and Leveling Up\n\nNow, with the story's way of execution explained, character creation is the next subject to get into. Normally, playing with the fabled hero of the specific event you go through in Dragon Ball Z has always been a recurring event that may never get old for some. Xenoverse allows for you to create a character to go through the actual events in a different perspective! With 5 classes to choose from (Saiyan, Namekian, Earthling, Frieza Clansmen, and Majin), the possibilies are quite endless. Though there are only female classes for everything (except the Namekian and Frieza Clansmen), that alone does not bar the imagination someone could have for them. Leveling up is also another bonus the game includes, which gives the character opportunities to become stronger in the areas that are wanted, such as Health, Ki, Stamina, Basic Attacks, Strike Supers, and Ki Blast Supers. Playing through the game at your own pace allows for diversity between how you want to distribute your bonuses to your character to your preference. You're even able to give your custom character special clothing, accessories, and even Z-Souls (given for special advanages, many to find, all are different) to make them stand out more than usual. Very good execution of the system into the game, while overall adding a new experience for new and old fans of Dragon Ball Z.\n\nIssues\n\nThere's never a game out there that has no problems with it, including an amazing title as this. Personally, I do not feel as though there are many issues with the game, but I do have a few that I would like to point out.\n\nCamera Scrolling: Feels slightly too fast or too slow, even when moving the meter up or down to a considerable setting. Also feels as if there's no middle setting to make the camera move at a normal speed.\n\nVoice Sync: Though this isn't such a big issue for myself, others who may be picky with having the mouths of the characters move in sync with the text and dialogue on the screen will see this as a problem. Sometimes, either the mouths are severely delayed, or go too fast to stay on pace with the text, which can become irritating for some to bear.\n\nAgain, not much, but still deserved to be mentioned.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, I love the way Xenoverse presented itself as a whole to Dragon Ball fans. Excellent music, character roster, stages, character diversity, leveling up, going on quests, having masters from the series, fantastic graphics, suspenseful story, and the ability to play together with your friends. As a player of many previous games in the series, I recommend this game for any fan of it.","March 2, 2015","true","70.9"," 223 of 245 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","223","245","13","11"

Not only is the game excellent, nice graphics, good peformance, good dragon ball z gameplay but it runs well and the mouse and keyboard controls are totally usable. This is probably the best dragon ball z game since the ps2 games. Also if for some reason you like the japanese voices (I didn't ever personally and I usually hate dubs) there is a voice language select.\n\n\nThe character customization is great. You can find different equipment to put on that will raise (and lower) stats. You do this by doing missions and then drop from enemies similar to mmos. Special moves and ultimate moves work the same way. You can also choose a master to learn moves from (krillin, vegeta, and even the villians). They teach you their own move sets depending on how long you are their apprentice and how much you level up.\n\n\nThe story is pretty good, you are basically a time warrior fixing problems in time due to histories changing and helping the z warriors in different battles.","February 26, 2015","true","24.4"," 354 of 412 people (86%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","86","354","412","28","5"

Most important events within the DBZ & DB: GT timeline start changing in the worst way, Trunks is forced to request the help of a strong warrior who will help him to keep the timeline in the correct way.\nYou can choose from five races: Buu, Human, Saiyan, Namekian and a Frieza Race. Each race comes with differing stats. The character's look can be customized in a variety of different ways.\nAfter the character creation part you are brought in by Trunks, who is a member of the Time Patrol and the action directly starts.\nThe gameplay is simple. You have 2 attack buttons and an energy shot button, a ki bar, a stamina bar, 4 super attacks, 2 ultimate attacks  and an escape move. Supers and Ultimates use ki and teleporting/guarding/escape moves use stamina.\nThe story mode is immersive, it is packed with interesting scenarios and intense battles.\nXenoverse operates like an MMO. Beyond leveling up and applying points to various statistics, you can purchase and use an assortment of clothing and special techniques for your fighter.\nAlongside the story missions are offline and online Parallel Quests, which act as supplemental scenes to the main narrative. Here you also fight on the side of the evil guys instead of the actual good guys.\nOnce you unlock the entire roster, you will notice a huge lack of important missing character transformations and movie fighters, e.g. Master Roshi, Janemba, Majin Vegeta, Baby and more.\nThere is local multiplayer as well as an online arena. Unfortunately, most people who will challenge you for a PVP battle are using god mode. So, if you want to battle other players, you have to be careful with the decision for an opponent.\nThe visuals look pretty good. Characters look accurate and well made. The graphics are perfect for a Dragon Ball game.\nThe soundtrack is amazing. The background music, the music during fights and cutscenes fits perfectly. Of course you can also find the song "CHA-LA, HEAD CHA-LA!" in the game.\nFrom time to time there can be online server issues and you will get disconnected or you just can not connect.\nOverall, it is still a must have for fans of the Dragon Ball series. For others who are not familiar with the series it is probably too repetitive.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","August 20, 2015","true","52.2"," 173 of 192 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","173","192","11","5"

MY OPINION IS BIASED AS HELL AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT LIGHTLY\n\nAlright, so I've been waiting for a game like this FOR YEARS. I've always wanted a DBZ game where I could create my own character and go through the story of DBZ. Believe it or not, I actually had daydreams of this EXACT story, going through the timeline as my character fighting alongside Goku, Gohan and the others. Well, not EXACTLY the same, but pretty damn close.\n\nThis game knocks it out of the damn ballpark for DBZ fans looking for not only a fun fighting game but a new take on the classic DBZ story. The fighting is fun and interesting, reminds me a lot of the Budokai games mixed together with the BT games. It plays well and once you get the hang of the controls.\n\nI really feel like I'm a part of this world, and I feel like my "training" and battles are paying off in leveling up my character and upgrading my equipment. Being very connected to the Universe helps a lot with this.\n\nI will say the game starts off slow but if your into DBZ don't give up on it, it really picks up during the vegeta saga and gets a lot more interesting.\n\nNow, this game is made for a particular audience, DBZ fans. If your not a DBZ fan don't even bother, but if you are, this is arguably the best DBZ game in recent memory and definitely the most interesting.

A distortion in time has occured, and you must be the one to stop it. You will be summoned by Trunks, and the story revolves around your custom-made character. I have seen many comments on the combat, and how it seems shallow. I don't really agree with this, though, as I found the combat to be rather fun. You can choose to button-smash, but if you have skills and timing, you can get a long way. A controller is highly advised though, as it makes everything easier.\n\nPROS:\n- Interesting story\n- Lots of skills and clothes\n- RPG-elements\n- You don't have to purchase the DLC, but it's a nice addition.\n- Custom characters (!!)\n- Parallel quests\n- Masters you can train under (Frieza, #18, Cell and many more!)\n- Multiplayer is fairly stable now\n- Collecting Dragon Balls can be grindy, but summoning Shenron and wishing, definitely makes it worthwhile ;)\n\nCONS:\n- I highly recommend a controller. I had a hard time playing with keyboard & mouse.\n- Tokitoki city is pretty big, and you have to walk around to each seperate booth to get things going.\n- Lacks some characters (Zarbon, Dodoria, #16 and the likes)\n- The DLC doesn't add a whole lot, yet is expensive (25 euros for season pass)\n- I found the Great Apes to be a bit clunky, but I suppose it is understandable with those huge models.\n- You have to grind levels quite a lot\n- Combat is pretty simple, and I understand why passionate fighting-genre fans would find it shallow. I enjoy it, nonetheless.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you are a fan of Dragon Ball, you will most likely enjoy this game (get a controller, though!)\nIf you are a fan of the fighting genre, and want in-depth combat, you should probably look elsewhere.","June 14, 2015","true","80.0"," 105 of 107 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","105","107","6","0"

This game is good but theres a few flaws you need to aware of. I bought this game thinking building my own character would be very interesting! and it is! how they put it into the story makes me actually feel pretty unique. Though..After you beat the game and unlock additional character slots you won't be able to actually replay the story mode unless you go and replay missions you already completed. Thats actually kinda upseting but it's alright.\n\nThe other thing you need to be aware of is that end game revolves around two type of players, An android build which never uses Ki Blasts and just lives off fighting, or the SSJ Spammer. After making both these characters that is all that is in the game.\n\nHopefully, They update the horrible servers and patch some of the souls. Some of them are just terrible, even taking hours to unlock it.\n\nAll in all, good game, needs a bit of updates to make it a real gem.","March 4, 2015","true","72.8"," 105 of 122 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","105","122","5","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/presidentgoku/recommended/323470/","presidentgoku","President Honoka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/presidentgoku/","850 products in account","March 7th: The review has been updated. Check the bottom of the review for more details\n\nHave beaten the game a few days ago. Now, if you are looking for a review with some details, and if you are still not sure whether you should buy this game or not, then read on.\n\nFirst, many people seem to be talking about the whole connection issues, and yes, it appears you need to be connected to the Xenoverse server in order to even play offline. But do you get disconnected so often that, it is almost unplayable? Not really. Most of the time, the offline mode works without any issues. But usually the online mode is off, and you most likely will end up seeing the message stating that the Xenoverse online is currently off. But yes, this game basically requires you to level up and all anyway (Unfortunately I have not done the online mode yet, so I might add some more to this review when I get my hands on it), so in the end, you should have no problem playing the game, at least the offline mode. And I will explain why the game is made like an MMORPG later in the review.\n\nNow, let me point out the things that make this game "good".\n\nFirst, the combat system. If you are thinking this game might be the Battle of Z 2.0, then please give it a chance. This is ABSOLUTELY nothing like the Battle of Z, and feels nothing like that game, either. First, Battle of Z, as far as I know, is pretty slow when you want to rush right into the enemy, in fact, you can't really do that. And many people complained how the game feels a lot more like a strategy game. But thankfully, as the game was made by different company (Dimps, the company that made the most famous DB game ever, Budokai 3), this game really focuses more on action, and the game is quite engaging. Many of the missions can be pretty hard, in fact, you must keep grinding in order to even stand a chance against stronger opponents and beat harder missions (So yes, this game is like an RPG game). And you might be thinking "Are you serious? I am not buying a game like that, that sounds like wasting a lot of time", but it shouldn't take much time to level up fast, only if you knew where to level up. But yes, just like an RPG game, there are status effects like poison and such. Probably this is the first fighting game that has so many RPG elements in it.\n\nAnd yes, the game might be hard, but compared to the Battle of Z, this game is very forgiving and a lot easier to unlock more characters. The game is challenging, but it is challenging enough to make you come back and grind more, so if you like the Dragonball franchise and good fighting games, you will most likely be playing this game for hours.\n\nThere are many (But not THAT many as far as I know) clothes that you can buy, and also there are many skills that you can buy as well. And getting trained by the DB characters and get new sets of skills is pretty interesting, too.\n\nNow, on to the problems of the game.\n\nAs I have mentioned, the whole combat system is fun and engaging. However, in most cases, the environments can not really be destroyed. Sure, there are houses and many places that are breakable, only making the game look far more fancier during the battle, but when you use wave-style beams and such, you can see the ground being destroyed due to it, but the destroyed part disappears instantly. It is pretty much a small thing to think about, but I really wish the destroyed parts could just stay destroyed.\n\nAnd I wish I could see how big the map is. When I try to run away from strong enemies, I end up finding myself pushing the invisible barrier, as the barrier does not appear until you are right near it. This can be pretty irritating, as the enemies can come right at you pretty fast and you just don't know how big the stage is. Well, probably you will understand when you play the game, especially when you want to run away from real tough enemies.\n\nAnd now, I really am not sure why Dimps had to just put the elements of Dragonball Online. Towa and Mira, the main enemies of Xenoverse are basically the original characters that first appeared in Dragonball Online. And the whole character creation idea and such basically is from the DB Online as well. Dragonball Online is the Korean-made MMORPG that failed to be successful, and probably Bandai Namco just could not let go of the elements from DB Online, so I am assuming that led them to make the Xenoverse like a "successor" to the DB Online. But in reality, because of this, basically there are times that you can not even play offline since you need to be connected to the Xenoverse server. The chance of not being able to play the offline is around 10%, which is not a lot (And most of the time you can just log in when you just try again anyway), but it still can be pretty irrtating for many players. And since the game functions more like an MMORPG, if you want to play 1 vs 1 or 3 vs 3 type of game modes, you must first "log in" and then go to the place where there are robots and ask them. I am not really sure why anyone needs to be walking all the way just to play those modes (Even though it takes around 10 seconds to get there from the starting point, if my memory serves me correctly).\n\nI mean, I can see Bandai Namco wanted an MMORPG type Dragonball game, but I think they could've made this a little bit easier and more convenient.\n\nBut honestly, as you can see, my complaints are pretty much minor things. The story mode is all about a new story, so you will enjoy the story mode if you are a fan of Dragonball franchise, and I believe as a Dragonball game, I can just tell you that it is very entertaining.\n\nAnd I can say personally, this is "the Game of the Year".\n\nAnd maybe I could say, finally "the Game for the Dragonball Fans".\n\n530,000 out of 10 (You'd know what 530,000 is, if you know DB)\n\n\n*UPDATE*----\n\nLet me point out some more things that I forgot to mention.\n\n*Graphics: 9.5 out of 10\n\nNow, many people have wondered what kind of graphics it will get. A PS3 version or a PS4 version. Turns out, both versions are not all that different in the end. The main difference between them was the FPS. And guess what, the PC users can enjoy 60FPS, so I would say the PC version is as good as the PS4 version, if not the same (My Steam FPS counter usually says I get around 58~62FPS). So, if you are worried about the graphics of the PC version, don't be. In fact, I never really cared about the graphics throughout the entire game, and I bet no one really does.\n\n*Gameplay: 9.5 out of 10\n\nThe Battle of Z felt really slow, weak and the difficulty of the game was a nightmare. I personally liked DB Raging Blast 2, but I actually like this one more since the game can be a lot more chaotic once there are so many enemies against you or when it is 3 vs 3. I just beat the secret campaign which unlocks two of the very famous Saiyan characters and the first mission, my goodness was it hard. But that mission surely tested my skills fully, and when I beat the mission, I was pretty happy with the fact that I could've finished it. It really is that thing that makes this game so fun. Challenging, very engaging and rewarding.","March 5, 2015","true","255.9"," 100 of 123 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","100","123","15","24"

I was worried at first I admit, but the people behind Dragon Ball: XENOVERSE put a lot of care into this game and I haven't even completed all of it yet! But I have played enough to understand and get a grasp of things.\n\nPros:\nYou get to create a character of your own based off the DBZ races ... even Buus!\nCharacter creation holds a lot of variety, even though some sections are limited.\nMost if not all cutscenes show your character in them, executed with swell animation.\nFighting mechanics are well done, action packed and gives you that rush per battle.\nAble to customize your skills with almost any ki / martial art that exists in the DBZ universe.\nSide quests aren't annoying and reward you with loot that's worth working for.\nCo-op is extremely awesome in this game, and can make quests way funner.\nBoss battles are fair, challenging but fair ... also difficulty doesn't change if you bring friends along.\nThe mini map is simple and very helpful in finding what section holds what.\nDialogue isn't cheesy and sometimes the actors will cuss, satisfying those who like that.\nYou're allowed to have 4 pages of taunts, which your character + other people's can do for fun.\nYour character's build can go however you want them to be, either powerful in melee, ki blasts, or other.\nAble to join the villains in their optional quests to take down the heroes.\nThere are trainers in which will teach you very useful abilities, along with sometimes aiding you in matches.\nAble to customize your character with clothing / armor you've unlocked and most can have their color changed.\nExtremely addicting game with a ton of replayability and benefits for which race you go as every time.\nEasy to make friends in this game because of how important each player is during a mission.\nNPCs will start to respect you the more you level up, sometimes even wanting to be trained under you.\nMain campaign is interesting, villains are cool and yes you can eventually obtain their armor.\nAble to play as any DBZ character you unlocked outside of your created character during any side quest.\nSome cutscenes are animated that match the show, while the voice acting is well done since most dubs suffer.\nCons:\nNPCs in PvP is somewhat unbalanced, while custom characters in PvP is absolutely broken. Some characters can one shot you with 3 bars of ki off the bat, while others have abilities that they can spam and stun lock you for ages. Most of the PvP also consists of hackers & cheaters, leaving people avoiding PvP altogether which is a shame.\nSometimes, even doing a quest / mission flawlessly will leave you with a C ranking simply becasue you didn't trigger the optional random event. These events happen at random, which is usually out of the player's control.\nFor very good loot, you sometimes have to grind for awhile. Performance doesn't trigger a better chance of obtaining loot.\nIf you're playing with three people, sometimes they can hog the enemy which leaves you having to race in landing a hit. This is especially true if you need to melee enemies to gather ki.\nCertain abilities that you can get early outmatch the late game ones by a landslide, making the game too easy.\nDuring certain parts of the mission, you will be given horde rush of enemies leaving you either bored or hurting.\nIf your partner is down and you need to revive them, it's likely you will be unable to because it takes awhile to fully revive them while the enemy is constantly beating on you.\nThere's no feature to see how clothes / armor will look on you when shopping... so it's only when you have obtained the equipment are you allowed to see how it'll look.\nCertain enemies will transform in a cutscene, even while you're doing a combo or using a special attacking, meaning you've wasted that because the cutscene kicked in.\nCertain side quests are brutally harder than 7 stars, despite they're only 4-6 stars. Some 7 stars are laughably easy.\nCannot change or alter your stats without having to make a whole new character.\nMost armor / clothing until late game is useless for stat benefits. Some even harm you by going negative on an important section, hindering you despite wanting to wear it for fashion purposes.\nYou can fail a mission because an NPC died on yah, despite you've done everything to ensure survival.\nTakes a long while at first to earn XP or zin (money) unless a friend is willing to let you ride with em on very difficult levels for the benefits of getting easy XP and zin without earning it.\nHard to understand the mechanics since the game doesn't do a good job explaining things. Only experience and playing will help you understand what does what exactly.\nLips don't move while characters are talking sometimes, breaking immersion.\nAll in all, this game is amazing though. The pros for certain, outweigh the cons and I adore what we've been given here. This is a game that DBZ fans will love for months while non fans shall still enjoy the daylights out of this game. You want to be a Sayian who looks like you, but can still go Super Sayian and do all the things you've seen in the show? You can! Want to be Freiza's race and wreck everything with death beams or super spirit bombs with one hand? You can! Want to have a female Buu who's super adorable but can kick the crap out of Broly hand-to-hand?? You can! This game lets you have that, and I appreciate it. I especially love seeing my custom character in the cutscenes being vital to the story. Not to mention this game is only $49.99 right now on Steam and will definitely go on price during Steam Sales. Worth full price in my eyes.","April 11, 2015","true","38.7"," 72 of 83 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","72","83","3","9"

But all the reviews are painfully outdated, just like the game.\n\nIt's not worth buying. The only way to right this is probably a free weekend followed by a sale.\n\nCons\n\n-No one plays anymore. It is VERY hard to find a duel with someone at your skill level, no one plays ranked, barely anyone ever plays co-op. Even at Peak NA hours, or right after school for kids, or weekends, I've tried them all lately and seen a max of 10 people online.\n\n-The game was designed as an MMO, unlike other DBZ games. Right now with no playerbase, the party fighting system feels pretty clunky to solo the game with.\n\n-The grind. It follows a normal MMO-grind system, if it was at release; you had people to party with for the quests making the grind seem less. But you don't anymore so you are forced to play with:\n\n-Absolutely terrible AI. You won't notice it at first, but after you start getting more skilled at the game and learning mechanics, you'll see just how terrible the CPUs are. They don't break guards, they don't dodge super abilities with charge up times, (Think kamehameha- while you charge, they just sit there, dont even block). And generally they have the reaction time of potatoes. This was okay, because the game was designed to be played online, with other players, to quest together- but no one is left to do that.\n\n-Stat modifiers are tied into what outfit you're wearing. So, wanna fire badass kamehameha's? Don't equip Goku's Beerus Gi, it reduces your Ki attack modifier by the maximum. ChiChi's world tournament outfit helps that stat more.\n\n-Certain abilities are still IMBA as hell. Regeneration's tick rate in the game is determined not by time, but by your FPS. So if you have 100+ FPS with regeneration skills, you're broken.\n\n-Price still $50.00\n\n\n+Redeeming features\n\n+Gorgeous manga style game\n+Really good original story\n+Combat really makes you feel like your in the original series\n+Character creation is really nice, There are 5 races, each with their own racials, mostly balanced\n+Height, weight, and even gender effect a characters balance between health, speed, Ki, and striking techniques\n\n\n\nI was late to the party. I really enjoy the single player story but without people to play a game that was designed to be an MMO at its heart, its dreadfully boring. Imagine playing world of warcraft without players, and you get the idea.\n\nIf you think $50 for a single player beat-em-up with a grindy level system set in the Dragonball universe is worth it, I'd still recommend it. But I expected to be able to have online matchmaking at the very least.","March 17","false","21.7"," 91 of 117 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","91","117","7","5"

It took me awhile to figure out what it was holding me back, but after some replaying and hearing my friend’s experiences I figured out what it was.\n\nI'll start with the pros of this game\n- Finally a good online for the DBZ Universe\n- Good replay-ability\n- Great character customization\n- All the skills you could hope for\n- Level up system\n- Just enough grinding to keep you interested\n- Tons to do with friends or by yourself\n- And the graphics somehow make everything feel better even the negative things\n- More...\n\nAnd here are my cons\n- Bad launch day servers\n- PVP is not balanced\n- SSJ is about spamming skills not powering up....\n- All playable characters are EXTREMELY WEEK compared to custom even the ones you have to wish for\n- Unsecure servers (Hackers/Glitches/Exploits)\n- And here is the main reason that weighs on me why this game does not get a 10/10... The storyline, first time I played through the storyline I felt like wow that's pretty cool I get to see every one of the Z warriors right? Well the fact is not only is the story line short, but it is weak in plot and the worst part about is that the fact that your character is basicly NON EXSISTANT! I would go back in time wanting to be part of the Z warriors hear Goku say wow your strong lets battle sometime, but no every person I run into is like wait was someone just here? I understand it's to balance the timeline and all, but it still felt overall lacking and the main reason I can't give this game a 10/10.\n\nSo in short this game is amazing it gives you almost everything you can want in a DBZ game from skills to characters, but it lacks just enough where it matter to earn a 9/10 it would be lower but the game is great enough to carry its own slack of having a poor storyline where you feel nonexistent and some non balanced moves and exploits/glitches.","March 9, 2015","true","80.6"," 83 of 105 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","83","105","4","6"

Let's be real, this is the main selling point and it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.\n\n-CaC has 5 different races with unique racials and quite a few different costumes to play dress up in. There's a small variety of body types and pieces, so for the most part you'll end up with something that looks close to that OC you made when you were 7.\n\n-It plays like the Budokai Tenkaichi series; it really captures the feeling of Dragon Ball battles. Movement feels great and there are a lot of different movement options available to you.\n\n-3v3 (or more when playing against the AI) is really chaotic and fun, even if it's not perfectly balanced.\n\n-The master system adds some amusing lines from many different characters. Cell would hug you if that's something he did.\n\n-They tried to mix up the story with revisions in history. I always enjoyed the What If story modes in previous Dragon Ball games; in this installment What If is the main story.\n\n-There are so many different supers and ultimates in this game, and quite a few have utility beyond dealing huge damage.\n\n\nTHE BAD\n-The servers are absolutely awful. It's unlikely you'll get into the multiplayer lobby on your first 5 tries, and even if you do there's no guarantee you won't be booted back to the title screen after one mission. I cannot stress this enough, you can't even play single player if the servers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves, which they often are. There's no excuse for this; I should not have to struggle this much to play offline single player even.\n\n-While the CaC is awesome in concept, there are few physical customization options. You will see many characters that look almost identical to your own. This extends to the clothing options. While there are many to choose from, you soon realize how little outfits there really are, especially since many of the lower parts, for instance, are identical except for color changes.\n\n-Combat is very fast paced but also very simplistic. Your combo list is comprised of when you start pressing Y instead of B. Due to the lack of balance, you can breeze through most fights by maxing your Ki Blast Supers parameter and just spamming supers and ultimates. Any depth really comes from loadouts and movement.\n\n-The game seems to lack polish. For instance, when your character turns Super Saiyan your hair doesn't change models, it just turns gold. That was quite a let down. Another example is the dialogue found in story mode. There are numerous typos and scripting errors, and the lip sync simply doesn't exist. Sometimes it's funny (Yamcha will declare that he defeated Cell), but regardless it shows a lack of care.\n\n-The hub world seems very lifeless and flat. The only way to traverse it is by walking or jumping, which does nothing of value. You can't fly or run. While you can pose your character with a handful of emotes, you can't really interact with anybody in the hub world. Chat is restricted to premade phrases, and characters will pop in and out of existance before your very eyes. There's also no guarantee you'll end up in the same instance as your friends, so trying to team up with them can be a little frustrating, especially when paired with the server problems.\n\n-The look of the game is very bright, neon, and harsh in my opinion. It is overwhelmingly bright and full of bloom.\n\n-There seems to be many DLC character packs in the works for this game. While DLC isn't necessarily a bad thing, I doubt the pricing will be fair, especially when they're offering a season pass.\n\n-I praised the game's story mode earlier, but I have to say that as far as What If stories go, this game's story lacks depth. Most revisions of history happen in the prologue of each saga--that is to say you don't actually experience any of these revisions. Mostly what you experience are the same fights that happened in the series, except your enemy will revive 3 or 4 times. They could have done a lot more with this and it's disappointing that the main selling point aside from the CaC is so shallow.\n\n-The grind is real in this game. Due to some messed up RNG, the secondary phase of each quest isn't guaranteed to take place even if you satisfy the requirements. Even if it does happen, you're not guaranteed to get a drop, much less the drop you want that's specific to that mission. This leads to a lot of frustrating repeats of the same mission over and over while you pray that the skill you want finally drops. God help you if you're going for a full outfit. God can't help you if the servers are having a tough day.\n\n\nDespite the descrepency of pros listed compared to cons listed I really want to recommend this game, but I just can't. I'm glad a Dragon Ball game has been released on PC, and I'm glad they finally implemented a character creation system in a Dragon Ball setting. I have fun when I play this game, but I recognize that the fun I have stems almost entirely from watching my character in action, and it's despite many glaring flaws. That fun is also combined with a large helping of frustration. My hope for this game is that it's the Budokai 1 or Budokai Tenkaichi 1 of the series; those two games were enjoyable but objectively flawed games that led the way to spectacular and inovative second and third installments. A Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 or 3 that followed that pattern would be absolutely astounding.\n\nFinally, if you are a diehard Dragon Ball fan, you will enjoy this game. If that's you then go ahead and get it. You probably won't regret it.","March 2, 2015","false","33.1"," 396 of 612 people (65%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","65","396","612","33","45"

You can customize your character's costume, skills, moves etc.\nI just wish there were beam struggles and ki Clashes like the previous game, but its understandable that its not possible to include those in co-op play.

If you're a Dragon Ball fan, you're gonna want to buy this. It's probably the greatest DBZ game in years, if not ever. The biggest selling point and the biggest reason why it's so good is the character creator. You can choose between 5 different races: Majin (male or female), Saiyan (M or F), Earthling (M or F), Namekian, or Frieza Clansman. It's really difficult to choose, not only between race and gender, but between all the different appearance options available and will keep you busy for quite a while. That's the nature of a good character creator. Every single special move in the game can be unlocked and equiped by your character, allowing a lot of possibilities. Iconic costumes and other equipment can be bought or unlocked to personalize your character. RPG elements allow you to level up the way you want to by putting points into different stats.\n\nThe fighting system can best be compared to the Budokai Tenkaichi series. You can move/fly around freely in an arena and lock on to opponents. It's fun but probably not too deep, though there is room for creativity with the custom move sets. There's an interesting story mode that puts a new spin on the all too familiar storyline of DBZ. It's great to see them doing something original with a story that has been done to death in practically every game in the series. It doesn't go over everything, only important fights, so some characters you may have expected aren't present. That being said, the character roster isn't huge like Tenkaichi 3's, but your custom character is probably the only one you'll end up using most of the time.\n\nToki Toki city, the game's central hub is a bit cumbersome to traverse. Instead of using a menu you have to use the "services" in this city to access things like online battles and quests. Some faster movement speed or more streamlining would have been nice. Speaking of quests, the game employs an RNG system with item drops, turning the game into a grind sometimes. Each quest has certain possible items as rewards, but since it's random you'll end up playing the quest again and again until you get what you want. You either hate or tolerate this. If you don't mind this Monster Hunter-esque grinding it's probably not a big deal. You'll have to grind for experience anyway, since some of these quests and missions are brutally difficult, sometimes unfairly so.\n\nThe biggest problem right now is the Xenoverse server. It's unreliable and goes offline at the drop of a hat. I've been able to play offline most of the time, but I've frequently been booted back to the main menu because the server went offline (luckily this only seems to happen while in the hub area and not during quests or missions) . I've also been stuck on the "logging in" screen 2 or 3 times. It's an issue I hope will be fixed. I don't see why I need to be logged in on the server if I want to play offline. Online matches work decently in my experience, some annoying lag sometimes, though you can do online battles even when you're in the single player lobby. You can also do online co-op for the quests (not the story), which is great!\n\nGraphics and performance wise there's nothing to criticize. It looks and runs great. Maybe some more AA would have been nice, but oh well. I noticed putting the glare to high eats up the framerate a bit, but I found it to be painful to the eyes anyway.\n\nI could go on and on about the things I would have liked to see more of, like bigger roster, voice acting for the custom character, more destructible terrain etc. Maybe a possible sequel will deliver that. What's here is totally worth full price if you're a Dragon Ball fan. Gave me a serious fangasm for sure. And trust me, I didn't talk about everything that makes this game so awesome. You'll have to see for yourself.","March 11, 2015","true","96.8"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","39","48","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agimizer/recommended/323470/","Agimizer","Agimond","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agimizer/","202 products in account","I must admit this game is pretty good but at the same time it has a few niggly bits that irritate me.\nThe story mode itself is impressive, I 100% enjoyed the campaign missions from start to finish and the story was well done with all the action packed interaction with the DBZ universe that you would want your own character to have.\nI love the combat, I love the customization I love the Mentor system and I love the nostalgia this game has ripped from my childish heart and thrown back into my face giving me a renewed love for the Dragon Ball Series in general.\n\nThe problems start for me when you get to the Parallel Quests (PQs), The Dragon balls, The Transformations and the large neglect of the simple feature of charging your Ki in battle.\n\nTo kick off the rant lets go straight to the major one for me, or rather the major pair, Transformations and Ki Charging.\nIn Xenoverse your character can have 4 super abilities and 2 ultimates and 1 evasion skill. Now the Evasion skill is cool, Its costly to use but grants you instant escape from deadly situations as long as you remember to use it (and use it wisely). No issues there, but then we get on to the supers. Kaioken, a transformation ability which as we all know grants you alot of power with a massive strain on the body, This is utilised as a Transformation that grants you a small increase in stats that constantly depletes stamina and should you at any point run out of stamina you are thrown back into "Normal Mode". Great, but its a super skill. . . . Not a stand alone skill slot. Well I can live with that I have 4 Super skill slots after all but then we move to super saiyan, No explanation required here but the transformation to super saiyan give allows you to spam and I mean NON STOP CONSTANTLY USE ONE AFTER THE OTHER any skill that requires Ki and they don't use up energy, Instead Super Saiyan itself constantly drains Ki but if your only in SSJ1 then the depletion is very slow, and its placed in an Ultimate slot, So first off the issue is, Why didn't transformations get their own skill slot and their own key binding. This would have made alot more sense and I can't sit here and pick off all the bad and good points of the implemented system but I guess if you play it yourself you would probably agree with me in the end that the Transformations needed their own function. Next, SSJ, Over powered and not the somewhat balanced unless you use it right kind of way, I mean out right game breaking, sure you have to get to the right saga and unlock it through PQs or buy it from the shop but once you get it you can steam roll the rest of the game (and i know, Thats how I completed it the first time) by simply equipping SSJ and Final Flash to your ultimates, Charging your ki to the max at any given time, Transforming and spamming the living S*** out of your target til it dies. This is also a tactic used in PVP sadly which turns DBZ into a long range sniping game rather than its original Martial arts style fights.\n\nThis brings me on to the next one which is charging your Ki, You can charge your ki in the game, Yup indeed you can, If you equip it as a skill. In all other previous DBZ titles that I have played charging your Ki was a bread and butter skill that everyone could do and it didn't need to be set as a skill or anything, Now if your looking to charge ki it must be set as a Super Skill. Sure ok 1 of 4 no problem, but then you want to add Kaioken... Now your down to 2 skills slots, and the Saiyans have 3 skill slots and a transformation. It may seem like I'm calling out the saiyans as overpowered themselves but the actual base character stats and abilities at the beginning of the game make for good even fights. Its the progression that eventually breaks them up and sends saiyans flying to the top of the pile (Fair enough thats what the dragon ball universe did but this is a game, should it not be a level playing field?).\n\nWith those out of the way lets move on to the gripes that people will indeed share with me, Parallel quests, the main thing you will be doing in the game because you will probably hit a wall in one of the story mode missions and need to beef up.  The hold all the skills, Items, Costumes and other things that you will want for your character or to unlock new clothes/setups for the preset DB Characters (Which cannot be editted btw, you mearly select different setups).\n\nThese PQs are a Grind fest, and unfortunately its an RNG fun fest, You could be there minutes, you could be there hours, it all depends on what the game feels like at the time. This turns what is a key component of the game into a Key Flaw and you will feel the rage within your first day or 2 of playing and you will feel it sooooo hard.\n\nThis leads on to the Dragonballs, Dragonballs can only be collected from Certain PQs and only if certain conditions are met for some them, RNG is back with a vengence with these little blighters, I got really lucky with my first set and I aquired the whole 7 in 2 days (2 6 hour sessions) but after that I have hit the mother load of walls and aches and pains and rage session and just disappointment. I have 3 Dragonballs and have not seen another one in a week, I played for about 3 hours each day and I only played the missions where the dragonballs or rather the "Time Patrollers" who you have to defeat to get them, Appear. Its too much and I'm repeating the same things over and over and it has got really tedious.\n\nBut now that the b******* is over I can move on to a suprising conclusion. The game is irritating, It is sometimes soul crushing but I would not stop myself from buying it if I had trunk's time machine. For what its worth its a great throw back into Dragonball. The Custom Character interactions with the Dragonball universe made me feel awesome, Immersion was there, the fun, excitement and fan girlish screaming all included. Although I went in depth on the flaws they are the only ones that Irritate me, everything else about the game is brilliantly done.\n\nOverall 7/10, Worth the money, Worth the time and if you can play multiplayer with your friends, even better.","March 22, 2015","true","50.0"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","30","34","2","1"

That being said ill just be honest and that can be that.\n\nSo... First off...\n\nFighting mechanics so far seem to be pretty simple to learn if you go through the tutorial, given that you experiment once in a while with different button combos (How i learnt to super move). Fighting in teams can get a bit hectic to say the least and some large boss battles can one shot you with out telegraphing their moves at all.\n\nOnline so far has been ok, not much lag as long as you connect to higher connectivity rooms. Not met people to emote yet but thats not an issue. Matchmaking can be quick or it can be slow. Most of the time personally its been just slow enough to irritate but never enough to stop me playing. You will want to jump into the first room you see as they seem to fill up fast at the moment.\n\nItems and customization wise the game seems pretty good so far although there isnt that much considering you probably want to look unique. I know eventually the publishers will probably be updating and adding more via DLC....maybe some free, i dont know.\n\n\nTL;DR I'd say i recommend this game to any anime fan or Tenkaichi(3) fan. If you didnt like Tenkaichi's fighting style then im going to go out on a limb and say this game probably wont be what you want. If youre looking for Budokai(3)'s fighting in this game youll be disappointed too. Otherwise its good. Honestly first impression wise id give this a 8/10.\n\nDone. The Review is over. Stop reading.

Someone [/1] is messing with the familiar timeline, causing famous series battles to change. You, as one of the Time Patroller, must intervene and re-correct the changes.\n\nSTORY SPOILERS BELOW - BEWARE\nYou later find out that the two people named Mira and Towa are causing the distortions in an attempt to free the Demon Realm to their world. In addition, Demon God Demigra is attempting to break out of his prison and destroy the Time Vault to change history in his favor. You and Goku then face Demigra in the final battle. Towa takes the last remaining peice of Mira and swears revenge against you and your allies.\n\nGameplay/Features\nThe game uses a 3d movement system, complete with a lock-on mechanic that locks the camera on the opponent. Maps are varied and open, with one even traking place in space! However, only a few have destructable environments, such as the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and a few others. USING A CONTROLLER IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The controls are simple: X for light attack, Y for heavy attack, RB for blocking, etc. Special moves are displayed by holding the Right Trigger and pressing A, B, X, or Y, as well as Ultimate moves, that require both Triggers to be held down. The attacks and speed of which the game plays makes you feel like a total badass against the heroes and villians of the series. Characters even chime in during battle with generic yet sometimes entertaining dialogue. Later in the hub world of Toki Toki City, the player can go into different quests to grind and level up, visit shops, or battle other players.\n\nWhat I Hated Throughout the story mode, I found there were a few random difficulty spikes, especially near the end of the game. Some characters even have special parameters applied to them, such as the opponent or opponents never flinching  (♥♥♥♥ing Beerus and Whis are annoying with this)  In addition, you can't preview any clothing or accessories before purchasing them, meaning you'll have to rely purely on your knowledge of the series or else you'll have to buy it and hope you like how it looks. Oh, and Saiyans are BROKEN. When a player goes Super Saiyan, they have an unlimited amount of Ki. This means most versus matches against Saiyan players will devolve into dodging Ultimate Move spamming.\n\nFinal Verdict Dragon Ball Xenoverse earns an 82/100.\nThe gameplay is fun, fast-paced, and will make you feel like a tank, but there are a few things holding it back from being closer to perfection.","September 6, 2015","true","22.8"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/323470/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","Dragon Ball Xenoverse makes it abundantly clear that it is a Dragonball game for today. It capitalises greatly on the ability to connect with other players and play together with very few hurdles. However, it is still a very Japanese game, with all the issues this pertains.\n\nBack when Dragonball Z first hit the airwaves here in the Netherlands it was already ancient anime history for Japan. Yet, it became a huge hit and influenced action-adventure culture here just like Superman and Star Wars did years ago. There is something about screaming off the top of your lungs to suddenly spring sick abs and pecs along with a sweet gold dye job that allows you to brutally maim and vaporise your greatests enemies. Dragonball Xenoverse capitalises on this tempation by allowing you to create your own Dragonball fighter and take him, or her, out on a cruise through DBZ history and beat up everyone.\n\nDragonball Xenoverse pushes something resembling a plot, which is highly unusual for a DBZ game. You're mighty warrior, brought forth by the eternal dragon to help Trunks patrol the past. It appears that some overdesigned bonus villain is causing trouble in and accross the Dragonball Z timelines. You are sent back in time to prevent any horrible changes to the timeline and to save the world in the process.\nIt works. Dragonball has been retold so many times that it is nice that they actually took the time to find a excuse for fighting Vegeta, Frieza, Cell and Buu again. Because Dragonball is currently being revived in Japan (á la Frankenstein's monster mind you, with new parts sewn to it) it also includes the new stuff that barely makes any sense on a power scale; but we'll roll with it because no one is going to complain about extra content in game.\n\nThe game revolves around combat. You control one guy/gal who can fly, punch and shoot beams from his/her hand. Over time you learn new moves like the iconic Kamehameha, Galic Gun, Final Flash, Spirit Bomb, Death Beam and the "Big Ball of Destruction". Your character levels up and you can allocate the points to your liking. Want to shoot more beams? Pump more points into Ki. Need more oomph? Put some into attack. You get the gist. At the very beginning you get to choose and build your character. You get to pick from humans, saijins, nameks, buus, and frieza's race (they didn't name them...) Each has its own ups and downs, but the end result is up to you entirely. I went with a frieza in the hope to transform four times in a row while making deragatory remarks at my foes. But, alas, only Saijins get to go blonde. Friezas get fast, very fast. So fast in fact that my final build focussed exclusively on chasedowns and pinball style beatdowns in favour of big beam attacks. It's fun, and even if you feel like you mess up you can collect the dragonballs to redo your design. Your character will quickly take a place among the steroid enhanced cast as you mingle with them and fight alongside.\n\nThe game can be divided into three different modes. First is the story mode; which as mentioned sends you back in time to fight a major battles again. Second are the Parallel Quests. A large collection of battles against the CPU. Each battle contains a different challenge for you to tackle, but most of it can be brought down to: beat up the enemy -fast-. You can do these quests with up to two other players. Completing quests unlocks new attacks, costumes and other powerups. Last, there are the VS modes where you fight other players.\n\nDiving into the game will quickly show you how Japanese this game is. Hardly anything is explained to you. The past two decades in game development created a distinctive rift between western and Japanese games. Where western games are generally more refined and contain clear instructions on what to, the Japanese games generally are filled to the brim with content and fan service without a single hint on how to unlock any of it. This the daunting problem Dragonball Xenoverse presents. Especially on a western developer focussed platform such as Steam, this can come across as a bit of an obstacle. Luckily punching stuff does wonders, but getting in deep, like knowing where to get the attacks, the costumes and the hidden trainers will require you to search the web. The lack of a proper learning tool quickly alienates newcomers, especially the ones who try VS first and quickly find out that the cool battles they were looking for are not here. Most battles revolve around spamming beams faster than the other player.\n\nThe uncommunicative nature of game is found more jarringly in the unlock system. The entire system; no matter how good you are at the game, is based on luck. Everything drops at random. Many legends circle the web about how to force certain drops, but the methods are so far apart you're never able to pick the one that works. The randomness of the game is rather annoying. Especially if you want your character to learn Frieza's Death Ball, but the game won't drop it; even after playing the same mission over and over again. Much worse, the hidden stage missions also trigger at random. So you're not even sure if you can actually roll for a drop. This could have been streamlined by actually making drops related to the method used to beat the enemy; like killing Cell with a Super Kamehama would force a drop from Cell. Instead the game would have you shoot Cell with said beam 100 times before giving you something you didn't want in the first place.\n\nThe drop system will turn people off by the dosen, however, the game's presentation and content will ensure people will keep coming back for more. Each character is modeled and shaded pretty well and it really emulates the modern anime style. On the other hand though, sound effects and animations are a bit lacking. The voice actors from the anime reprise their roles in both English and Japanese which only adds to make the Dragonball universe come to life.\n\nThe game also comes with ready to ship DLC in the form of GT chapters and the latest film release. Be forwarned as the content is not even close to justifying its pricepoint; especially since most it is tucked away behind the aforementioned random drop wall; even after you put in you're hourly wage.\n\nAll in all, Dragonball Xenoverse is an excellent Dragonball game that is sure to satisfy fans. The content is rich and the chracter creation will keep you coming back to build a new guy for a while. The presentation is tight and inclusion of the original voice actors is a real treat. On the other hand, the drop system is unfair and the game in general is unwelcoming to the uninitiated. Still, I can recommend the game to fans of Dragonball and people who want to play an explosive beat 'em up with friends.","April 22, 2015","true","45.8"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

There are a lot more characters you can unlock than I expected and online battles against players are really crazy compared to AI, so tense! Unfortunately the game has barebones online system. You have no Idea how strong the character is your opponent will choose. Say you want to play as Videl, but your opponent chose Bills the God of Destruction. Good Luck. They could easily fix this by putting every character into a Tier and making a setting for lobby to set which Tier they want to fight in and both players have to choose 1 character from that Tier. Still, the fights themselves are so much fun and if you have people to play local then this isnt a problem for you so yeah :D. Also story mode has some really epic moments at the end!\n\nFinally! A Dragon Ball game for PC and a good one too! But is it as good as Budokai Tenkaichi 3 and Raging Blast 2? What is all this MMO stuff? And is it a proper PC Port? There are many things the first and only Dragon Ball game on PC has to do right to please the fans. For fans of the show the purchase is definitly an easy decision to make, but for people who dont know anything about Dragon Ball I recommend waiting for a sale.\n\nGameplayFirst you start with creating a character. The character creator is not the most complex creator, but it gives enough options to make it feel not unnecessary. Still, your own character is what makes this game motivating to play, at least its singleplayer, because of the rewarding progression system. Boost attributes, equip new costumes, learn new KI Blast, Super Attacks and Ultime Attacks. You can buy stuff at traders, but you can get them earlier by doing side quests where you get them as rare drops (the good Skills like Super Saiyan for example). Also progressing through the main story will unlock new characters, some of them can be your masters and teach you their skills, for example Vegeta teaches you his Gallick Gun skill and so on. Choosing a master is cool and all, but I dont know if its just me, but it takes forever until my master has a new training session for me, which is a little frustrating, but I guess it makes sense cause youll get their most powerful abilities at the end.\nBut all of that doesnt matter if the combat system doesnt work, so lets talk about that. Budokai Tenkaichi already had a fantastic combat system and Raging Blast 2 did it even better in my opinion. Xenoverse´s combat system is like those 2 games, however it feels a little simpler, BUT maybe it just feels that way because until now I only played against AI. Cant test multiplayer because servers are ♥♥♥♥ currently and I have no one to play local with (in 1 week I will have someone).\nI like the new control scheme (well I changed it to Type C, then it was fine to me). I like that you have 2 Ultimates now and 1 Evasive skill and I like that you have a seperate Stamina bar. There are a lot of small changes like that which make sense, but there are some small things which feel like they are the way they are only because the game has 2v2 and 3v3. Like some things are balanced a way that 2v2 and 3v3 dont get too crazy, but that makes 1v1 a little bit more dull, just a little bit though.\nThey changed the "Sprint"-Attacks or whatever they were called in previous games. Now when you do one of those skills you dont get a cutscenes, but the fight just goes on and your character does the move, and I like that. In previous games those cutscenes mid-fight were annoying and made the fights less dynamic and other players now dont have to wait for you cutscene (I guess this is another change due to 2v2 and 3v3).\nOverall I dont want to give my final judgement for the combat system yet, since I still have to play vs real players, but so far I like it but sometimes its A LITTLE dull.\n\nNarrativeThe character creator is fine as I explained, but it is at the cost of DBZ lore. You can make pink namekians, but afaik there are only green namekians, also you have male and female Buu which doesnt make sense, since Buu was a demon without a gender or anything like that and having so many powerful characters in the world makes the main series characters less important which is not something I like that much. Thankfully they still have their special moments in the story mode and side quests, and in boss fights against Cell or Frieza or even Goku in Super Saiyan form they still feel really powerful because your hits do not stun them.\nWhat I like the most about Xenoverse´s  story is that the devs knew they need a story like this to make a good game for Dragon Ball, because with this story you first of all can re-experience the main DBZ show, but with a new twist (which is your own character) and at the same time you can fight in many different scenarios, for example fight along side Frieza against Goku or something like that.\nThe story itself though is surprisingly good, its not really well written, the voice actors are terrible, and the 2 new villains are boring and uninteresting, but its fun and interesting to follow. At least the cutscenes are well made. Its motivating and gives your fights some context, especially because every character has some sentences mid-fight depending on team-mates and enemies.\nAnd there are some really cool moments, my favorite was when SPOILER ALERT Ginyu changed his Body with you instead of Goku. SPOILER END\nI only wish there were more anime scenes.\n\nAesthetics/ GraphicsUPDATE: Actually Im stupid, sorry guys. This game looks MUCH MUCH better than Raging Blast 2 and Ultimate Tenkaichi, I had wrong memorys of those games. Especially the KI Blasts like Final Flash look ♥♥♥♥ing awesome with fantastic sound. Whats dissapointing is the stage-destruction, not because it looks bad, but because it looks so good! Problem is the damage only stays for like 1 second, if this game was current-gen only they could make persistent stage-destruction which would be fantastic.\nThe PC Port is REALLY good. Keyboard+Mouse controls are fine but only in singleplayer, in local combat there are a little bit worse because of different camera angles. The game is always at max fps, no problems with alt+tab or anything like that. When you switch between Keyboard and Controller the button prompts ingame change accordingly. Really no problems with the port.\nServers got updated, its better now, still has problems.\n\nSoundtrackOh my god this is one of the worst soundtracks ever. The music in the hub world is annoying as hell and the music in combat is very generic and random and you barely notice it. I dont understand why they dont use the original soundtrack from the show which would be ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, nerd-gasm guaranteed.\nWell, lets hope there will be mods to fix this, but not for poor console gamers :P","March 4, 2015","true","32.4"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","41","57","3","3"

Fun in multiplayer too.\n\nFor those who are unsure about the character selection: you play as a custom character throughout the story mode, but every other mode gives you the option to play as the characters you know and love (such as Goku, Vegeta, Trunks, Gohan (Kid/Teen/Adult), Kril-I mean, Frieza, Cell etc.) and most characters have multiple setups that change their attacks, stats and appearance. For example, you can play as very early Saiyan saga Goku through to late Buu Saga Goku (base Kaioken to SSj3! + Super Saiyan God Goku as a seperate character), and every appearance inbetween up to the recent movie.","March 15, 2015","true","31.9"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","72","41","57","8","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomebro/recommended/323470/","welcomebro","Toucan Bane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomebro/","283 products in account","I'm a huge DBZ fanboy and I have been for my entire life. I was really excited for Xenoverse but I lowered my expectations because DBZ games haven't been very good for quite a while. I was ready for disappointment and disappointment is exactly what I got. Please excuse the shoddy writing, as I had to cut down the length of this review due to Steam's character limit.\n\nXenoverse is the first DBZ game to have a character creator that doesn't entirely suck. The customization is superior to Ultimate Tenkaichi's, but is also inferior in some ways. You can choose between five different races (Humans, Saiyans, Majins, Namekians, and Frost Demons), gender, height, weight, hairstyle, eyes, and more. Could've had more, but it gets the job done. You can also select several different pieces of iconic Dragon Ball fashion to dress your character in. There are a multitude of special attacks like the Kamehameha and Gallick Gun for you to use.\n\nNow, here come my faults with the customization. You don't have a whole lot of control of over the body. Human/Saiyan males are extremely buff and blocky whereas the females are very petit. Male majins take after fat Buu, whereas the females take after kid Buu. See what I'm getting at?These major differences in gender feel unnecessary. Next: Race, gender, height, weight, and the clothes you wear all affect your character's stats. From a competitive standpoint, it is a massive problem. Want to be a female striker? You'll never be as good as the males. Want to be a male ki blaster? You'll never be as good as the females. Chances are, making a character the way YOU want them to be will make them very inefficient. If that wasn't bad enough, the clothes you wear also affect stats. I wanted to use Broly's clothes but they're intended for melee fighters and I was a Ki blaster. Clothes should be purely cosmetic. If I want to make my character efficient, I can't wear what I want to wear. Also, you can't recolour clothes. So, you're dressed the exact same as everyone else wearing it.  Even UT let you recolour. My last complaint with customization is fighting styles. Every male human has the same style. Every female has the same style. Do you see where I’m going with this? Aside from looks and super moves, certain race/gender combinations are identical. Better options would've been to A) Let us create our own fight styles or B) Let us choose from pre-made styles.\n\nSo, the customization is somewhat mediocre but how's the gameplay? The game offers battles of up to 6 people which work surprisingly well. The battles are enjoyable... at first. The combo system is incredibly shallow with just a few X/Y variations and nothing else. This wouldn't have been a major issue if combat was, say, much faster like in the Tenkaichi games. There are two sides to fighting game combos. The DBZ side, which features incredibly shallow and easy combos that require zero skill. Then you have the Dead or Alive side where many of them are almost impossible to do. Good fighting games are in the middle of the combo spectrum where Soul Calibur 2 is: A place where combos are somewhat difficult but aren’t impossible either.\n\nXenoverse is too simplistic and just gets boring. It's not terrible but some things really suck about it like the terrible blocking. It's very delayed so you'll only block a little bit after you've pressed the button and taken the hit. Another absurdity is the fact that huge ultimates can be easily blocked. Why the hell can Krillin block my Perfect Kamehameha? That makes absolutely no sense. Also, the teammate A.I. is really bad.  They're not good for much besides getting in your way and dying. Oh, and when they die, you fail the mission. The hit detection isn't the greatest on both basic AND super attacks. Although, super attacks all feel different and are useful in different situations. In other games, the attacks were all mostly the same but only differed in aesthetics. I hope this is an aspect of Xenoverse that they keep for future games. However, these awesome attacks can be spammed easily by becoming a Super Saiyan, which grants you infinite ki. Terrible decision. Last thing I have to say about the combat is transforming. I hate the way they handled it here. Remember when Goku and Gohan managed to stay transformed for the ten days before the Cell games? In Xenoverse, they can stay transformed for like less than a minute. They feel more like temporary power ups. Xenoverse's combat is nowhere near as intense as games like Budokai Tenkaichi 3 or Burst Limit.\n\nWhat about Toki-Toki city? Yeah, what ABOUT Toki-Toki? It doesn't really feel special since there isn't anything to do besides go to fights or buy stuff. It could've used some mini games or anything else to make it feel like a fun place. It's basically the game menu. You have to walk to offline/online battles, PQs, and story missions. I would’ve rather just had a menu for that stuff.\n\nNext, the campaign. The star is isn't Goku, it's you!  Someone is screwing with the DBZ timeline, so it's up to you to travel to the different discrepancies in time and fix them by beating up someone. No one came to this game for the story and I don't think the mediocrity of it surprised anyone. At least it did something different rather than telling me the same story I've experienced in every other game. But that is the only strength of this story: deviation, not writing or any of that good stuff. However, the actual DBZ story is told very poorly here. If you don't know the story, you won't walk away from Xenoverse knowing it.\n\nI enjoyed fixing the timeline with my character and I did like a few moments like the Ginyu arc. There are a lot of missions that suck like the Majin Buu and Bardock battles. I wish the custom character could've interacted with the DBZ cast some more instead of making gestures and changing facial expressions. Again, something UT had that this game didn't.\n\nWhat'll take up most of your time are the Parallel Quests. These are battles relating to the story of DBZ experienced from the perspectives of both heroes and villains that can get you items. These missions have certain sub-objectives that can trigger an "Ultimate Finish" which summons another fighter or resurrects one, giving you a chance of getting better gear.\n\nI saved my biggest complaint for last... the RNG. Jesus Christ, this may as well have been called "RNG: The Game". I will never understand the thought process that went into coding this. You will play the same damn PQs over and over again until you get what you want. It gets even worse: There are layers of RNG. Remember the Ultimate Finishes I mentioned before that have a chance of granting you better loot? Well, you may not get an ultimate finish even if you meet all of the requirements because it's random. The ultimate finish giving you items is also random. That is RNG on top of RNG and it is absolute feces. Grinding is NOT good game design. I've seen many fanboys defend this godawful choice by saying that they add hours to the game. Sure, they add hours. Hours of PAIN. RNG is an extremely cheap way of extorting time out of a game. Most of your hours should go into having FUN and not doing the same repetitive garbage.\n\nXenoverse is a pretty game. It's colourful and the lightning effects are better than any other DBZ game but some of the textures like battle damaged models and the environments are kinda terrible. But the worst thing is the aliasing. It's really bad here. I must commend the PC port. It's very good. Better than a lot of western PC ports, actually. I never had a crash or framerate issue once.\n\nIf you're a Dragon Ball purist, you'll probably look past a lot these issues and find some enjoyment. But if you're not, then I really can't see you having fun at all. I'd recommend it after a price drop.\n\nStory: 12/20\n\nGameplay: 22/40\n\nGraphics: 12/20\n\nSound: 8/10\n\nPerformance: 10/10\n\nFinal Verdict: 64/100","August 4, 2015","false","78.2"," 150 of 250 people (60%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","60","150","250","12","39"

Game of the century I tell ya!\n\n100 Raditzes out of Krillin getting owned Counter.\n\nOnto the serious side now. I honestly do not understand why some bash on this game with sayings like "It sucks! enjoy your wasted EU/$/Pounds. After near 3 hours in and 1 spent on the char creation, I can say that it's at least a decent game in my opinion. Not to mention that I did not meet any bugs to speak of in this short first impression in it...unlike other....you know...black sheep, with missing face models? know what I'm talkin' about? just sayin'.\n\nAnyway, the gameplay feels, how should I put this, natural but a bit convoluted. The statement about the controller was not a joke by the way. I have never used a controller to move the camera around and such in any game since I game on the PC and don't own any consoles. I would mark it down, but that would not be fair as I am just not used to this tipe of control scheme. I also say a bit convoluted because, again I am not used to using multiple button holds to bring up other menus and such.\n\nThe things that you can do in the game pretty much sum up my expectations from what the devs wanted to deliver. Yes, it may have been nice to have other things here and there in addition but I feel that that's just nitpicking. You get to buy gear, which is also visually represented on you, special equips, like the scouter and such and of course, your custom character can have pretty much a mish mash of all the specials and ultimates that you want to. Want to be a sayain, using special beam cannon in super sayan 1? You can do it. That's about it for now. I may return in the future with a more firm grasp on this.\n\nFor now the final verdict is this. If you have been waiting for it and didn't raise your expectations through the roof and was realist about the game, then buy it. If you are a die hard DBZ fan, definately buy it, you get to fight alongside all your favorite characters or against them too, as them or as your own custom char from different races and with diffterent skills and such. However, if you are neihter a fan and just saw this and wanted to try it out, you maaaay want to wait a bit  for a sale or check out youtube lets plays, more detailed reviews. I fully admit that it may not be everyone's cup of tea.\n\nUpdate 1: As of now, the game seems to be still having issues with the server connection. I am not going to give the game a free pass on this one. I love it, but pulling a blizz expansion launch on us with server capacity/other server issues is a mark down in my point of view.\n\nGetting a good extra 7 hours or so in the game I can say a bit more. Of course, I like it even more. If you want an easy time for all the rewards this is not the game for you I can tell you that. You will have to farm and farm for some skills and stuff but I find it very rewarding in the end when you do get it. Simple as the stages are, I still get this feel of an epic battle every time I do a mission.\n\nThere are statements that the Dev/Publisher are working on the server stability issues and such and let's hope that they fix it soon. My oponion is still unchanged, though you may want to consider waiting for a server fix just a bit to be sure you get a better experience.","February 26, 2015","true","47.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","18","20","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iZNrocks/recommended/323470/","iZNrocks","iZN1337","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iZNrocks/","351 products in account","Note: This review is spoiler-free!\n\nFirst of all hats off to the development team for providing such awesomeness on PC, I missed Dragonballs too much, and this is one of my most favourite anime from the childhood.\n\nI've watched the first series and others aswell which includes Dragonball Z, all DBZ movies and Dragonball GT (non-canon ik ik). I've also read the original manga, so being a huge fan of DB series, this is my review.\n\nOVERALL RATING: 9000+/??? (you get the idea, ITS OVER 9000 / 八千以上だ!) (or 8000 from the original Japanese dub)\n\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is straight and simple, most have heard it already, and probably noticed in the trailer. I won't be giving any info about the story but it's pretty great, it really does revives the original series.\n\nPORT:\nBest PC port ever? I cannot say anything about it, it runs SO smoothly, anybody who is complaining about the FPS issue, it's probably because of VSync (enabling/disabling it might fix the FPS), or most probably issues related to display driver. Otherwise, I don't see any bad things about it\n\nFIGHTING MECHANICS:\nFighting mechanics of this game is so great, it kinda reminds of the older games like Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and 3. It takes time to get along with the controls and you will have probably analyze them, once you get used to them, it'll be nothing. I'm playing with X360 controller, and I feel like they're equally matched like DBZ: Budokai Tenkaichi series or maybe even better. Last time I played that game on PS2 was like 6-7 years ago so yeah, it's pretty long since I even remember how the mechanics were actually.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nI don't think anybody would be caring about the graphics, because the anime is in 2D but they still did a fascinating job with the 3D looks like the previous games.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nCharacter customization is pretty great I guess. They've added multiple sort of modifications which can change your character look like a badass, or a funny one. I've messed up with the customizations, and I'd say there are alot of things to change which includes skin colour, hair type/colour, pupil/eyes type/colour, all sort of clothing, you can even make your character look like Krillin (yeah love his dashing nose, eyes and hair), actually you can make your character look like any sort of Dragonball-character, the one you probably like..\n\nComplete Roster of DBXV Characters w/ information about unlocking "secret" characters:\n\nhttp://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-ball-xenoverse/Characters\nhttp://www.idigitaltimes.com/dragon-ball-z-xenoverse-every-secret-character-game-unlocked-420996\n\nVegeta SSJ4 is only available for pre-order, but there are ways that can be used to unlock it but bare that in mind, there's no guarantee it might get you banned (until now, they haven't added any VAC support so not sure)\n\nAbout the races, there is (currently) Buu race, Saiyan race, Earthling race, and Frieza Race. They should've added race like Cell's (yes he was made with mutliple cells, but it could be like Bio-Android race) one, Kai (maybe not just a good idea because they're kindof higher authorities, and also plays greater roles) or Android too? (Android could be different since they're both Earthling and Android)\n\nOther stuff like character customization is pretty good. You can edit everything possible, even the face, eyes, hair, gi colour, etc.\n\nONLINE GAMEPLAY:\nOnline gameplay is pretty rad I must say. You can enjoy doing quests with your friend or have fun doing 1v1, 2v2, and even 3v3! There is alot of opportunity. The only con of online (at the moment) are the server availability issues, they've confirmed that they're working on them and soon they will be working fine perfectly. Most of the reviews are about "CANNOT PLAY ONLINE!" "OMG I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS ♥♥♥♥ GAME" etc reviews which are pretty ignorant. The game is not only about playing online, you CAN enjoy locally, and solo aswell.\n\nBUGS:\n- This is not a bug, but still wanted to include it, DO. SOMETHING. ABOUT. THE. ♥♥♥♥ING. CHEATERS. I'm so fed up with the 100% stats guys, they are ruining EVERYTHING!\n- The AI for partner is totally stupid, they won't even go SSJ, nor they would do much work, unless you make them like kicking enemy's ♥♥♥, only that time they would do "something" about it.\n- Latest DLC added one of the new attack, Final Shine, it's not visible for other players, it's like a invisible shine attack now.\n- (more like a temporary issue) Online servers are down, but they're resolving it I believe so. (09/03/2015) Seems fine for now, but still disconnects while you've finished some PQ or main quests.\n- Fix the vanishing! It's really depressing when you just appear in front of the opponent while vanishing. Solved!\n- I've noticed that sometime it fails to target any special beam/energy attack after you've just performed 3x times vanishing slam. This happened with me multiple times and I think it's a bug since it fails to target after the 3rd vanishing slam to the ground. The workaround for this is that, you may want to move abit then fire the beam/energy. not an issue, just the fighting mechanics work like this\n- Crashes after getting disconnected from Xenoverse server multiple times. This issue happens very rarely but it's annoying. Solved!\n- Guard timing sucks, I've tried my best to guard myself but I always get hit even after pressing guard key on time. Just needed abit of practice, and tbh, flying away from the attacks is best way possible. To avoid normal ki, simply move.\n- Scouter view is clunky.\n- Sphere attacks are impossible to defend.\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n- Pre-made texts for chat is stupid, we're playing on PC, not on a console.\n- There should be a shortcut menu for selecting any PQ or even Time Patrol missions, it's pretty annoying that you've just walk down to the place and then you can select them. OR give us a chance to fly around? It'd be really fun to fly around atleast in Toki Toki City.\n- There should be something like after fighting any opponent, you can find one of their weakness and then use that weakness to attack them. All characters must be having some weakness? Or maybe some information about it would be good too!\n- Keep DLC level to lowest as possible, even though I've bought Season pass, but it's pretty unenjoyable when the game developers tends to earn some more money by just adding more content, why not just add them to the full game? weird trend of DLC nowadays.\n\nUSEFUL LINKS:\nI've researched alot so thought I'd share some of the links that are quite useful who are playing this game.\n\nCharacter Guides[www.shonengamez.com]\nLearn moves with masters/Do more damage with Z-Assist[www.saiyanisland.com]\nGathering all Dragon balls quick\nDifferences Super Saiyan, SSJ2, Super Vegeta, Super Vegeta 2\nInformation about Dragon Balls in-game\n\n\n[01-03-2015] I'll be updating this review after I find something interesting, or some other info which might encourage other fans to actually try this game out. If you've questions related to the review or the game, leave it to the comment box!\n[02-03-2015] Added three new sections. Corrected year.\n[09-03-2015] Edited bugs section.\n[26-03-2015] Added some more bugs information that I've faced, edited character section, and edited few more stuff.","March 1, 2015","true","95.0"," 51 of 80 people (64%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","64","51","80","11","5"

All fantastic games. Dimps always stuck to 2D style fighting but their foray in 3D style like Spike's Tenkaichi/Raging Blast is wonderful, leagues better than Spike's and on their first try to boot.\n\nPC version wise, this is a fantastic running game.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone that has been playing the yearly releases of Dragon Ball games since the 90s.\n\nHopefully someone at Bamco decides to bring the Budokai HD collection to PC as well!\n\nI'd also like to add, the first DLC is really underwhelming, but there is apparently more to come so that's a good start.\n\nAlso I'd like to address a few things. Avoid PVP for now, It's just a mess of bad connections and there are a (few) people who a trainer to edit their stats. So for the moment until everything is fixed don't expect a consistent online PVP experience.\n\nAnother thing, is meta. You can't avoid this with any online game. People will find and use the most broken things and all you can do is simply play around it or find out how to combat it. Dimps still has a little ways to go with patching so don't expect balance at the moment.\n\nAlso, why so little Nameks? Everyone is a Saiyan grill that just spams ki attacks? Where is the variety? If there is another game in the series the Create a Character can be more expanded upon to stop people from being so cookie cutter. Just my 2 cents.","March 4, 2015","true","142.0"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","0"

And, the story is that these time-guys are disrupting the timeline of the ♥♥♥♥, (If you hadn't seen the anime it doesn't really matter that much because you pretty much play the whole thing in the game).\nThe DLC adds the cool gameplay from GT, the DLC skips the ♥♥♥♥♥ parts and uses the action parts from the show like the Shadow Dungons and the super Android guy\nI really enjoy the OST and gramfix of the game very enjoyable\nI've heard once before that keyboard and mouse is horrible for this game thats not true I'd say because I b gucci w/it dawg\nCons:     I wanted more gameplay, I played alone the entire game.

The game felt smooth, history started looking pretty good and the rewards of the side quests  made me REALLY want to go and grind and repeat all of them to get all the possible rewards.\n\nBut then, the Xenoverse servers attacked and all seemed lost.\n\nGet ready to see the this screen: http://i.imgur.com/GOQ1kOn.jpg a whole lot. The only real issue here is that the game is not going smooth on the connection to the server, even for off-line play. The only "fix" so far is to stay with steam in off-line mode and that makes impossible to talk with friends on steam and a whole lot of other functions.\n\nThe game is FUN, the combos you can do and possibilities of characters and customizations are all awesome.\n\nEDIT: Now that i have played more of the late missions and suchs, there are a few more cons to add. I will give better details here and update the cons list.\n\nMany enemies (AI) use very cheesy moves to escape a onslaught by the player part and even use moves time and time again that would be impossible for the cost (the close quarter defensive explosion, yes the one that cost 300 stamina). Some times, they will literally use them every single time that you even start a combo and in a way that is either impossible for you to actually do anything due being mid animation on a combo or forces you to do a very "♥♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ out" strat to just spam simple ki blasts and kick the enemy away whenever they make a bee-line toward you.\n\nThis can make some quests and fights get very boring or just result on a flat out lose due the time limit. And may all have mercy on your soul if you have made you character focused on hand to hand fights.\n\nEDIT 2: They have updated the servers, now is possible to stay online for lenghty ammount of time, but still some times it takes quite a while to be able to connect.\n\nPros:\n+Game runs smooth as ♥♥♥♥\n+All the combos, skills and ki stuffs are very well balanced\n+If strung right, you can push out massive insane combos and ki blasts\n+On-line play is fun. You can do quests with other players and the game punishes those that troll\n+Massive amounts of clothing and accessories\n+Awesome RPG Elements\n+Kamehameha\n+Great Apes\n+Motha♥♥♥♥ing bigger Kamehameha\n\nCons:\n-Server connection improved, but still no ideal\n-Awesome RPG Elements\n-Cheesy AI\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThe RPG elements and grind focused nature can be a bit too overwhelming for those that want a action focused or pure fighting game.\n\nBut, if you are a Dragon Ball fan and MMORPG fan, get this game right ♥♥♥♥ing now!\nIf you are a Dragon Ball fan, but don't like MMORPGs, consider getting the game on a sale.\nIf you are a MMORPG fan, but don't like Dragon Ball... Dude, what the actual ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you?","March 1, 2015","true","17.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","15","19","7","1"

PERIOD. NONE.\nSolid Combat. Some of the moves and combos have little deadzones, but you don't need Street Fighter Reflexes to feel satisfied playing this.\nCreate a Character is VERY rewarding, Even if you need to stack either Ki and Supers or Melee attacks. It's very Dragon Ball Z in that regard.\nStoryline and Voice acting is Great. For myself, Very engaging.\nParallel Quests. This is a very fun and interesting take on setting up extra fights and it's a great time sink.\n\nCONS:\n\nOnly Race with a transformation is Saiyan.\nItem/Skill drops are VERY random and can get VERY frustrating grinding for one skill. Same goes for special events in PQ's.\nWhis and Beerus smashing you into submission to the point where you basically lose the will to live. Yup, that fight sucks.\n\n\nThis is an amazing addition to the DBZ franchise. A beautifully crafted fighting game, with very little actual game engine flaws.\nA MUST for and DBZ Game fan, and a MUST for any fighting game fan.\n\nNeeds offline mode, However, The Devs regularly update on the forums and through other sources, so it is clear they are aware and working on the issue. 2 Thumbs Up.\n\nUPDATE: Server has been nice and stable for a while now. Can't say much about matchmaking, but at least the lobbies no longer kick you after every match.","March 11, 2015","true","66.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","16","21","4","0"

An example of this would be (Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler) Raditz at the start of the saiyan saga, instead of the usually weak raditz people know he's taken on a much stronger form and nobody knows why, you have to go and help goku and piccolo fight the now stronger raditz and make sure it ends in the way it did originally, with goku and raditz getting hit by piccolo's beam.\n\nAfter story missions are completed, you slowly unlock side-missions relating to the story missions you did, an example of this would be to kill saibermen who were working with raditz, these give you experiance, mission rewards and a ranking from D-S (As far as I can tell)\n\nYour character is fully customisable, with most of the moves used in dragon ball available, such as the famous Kamehameha and the galick gun and some more lesser used ones. When you gain enough experiance, you will level up and be able add points into your Ki amount, Health, Stamina amount, basic attack, super attack or super blast, which in turn makes the stat of it higher and boosts it. So it's very possible to make a character that uses a full close combat loadout and still have it as a viable tactic. On top of this, you can buy, find, or earn custom clothing in order to bost stats, such as Lord Slugs garb, or Turles's battlesuit, a wide range of clothing is available to suit your characters cosmetic and stat needs.\n\nThe combat itsef is very satisfying especially when you use your own custom character, it's very easy to pull off a combo even with limited understanding of the mechanics, whether it be shooting a kamehameha x10 or beating someone to a pulp in close range, it feels very responsive and fluid compared so some of the previous games (I'm talking about you, Battle of Z) The keyboard controlls are just as viable as using a gamepad, so people without one need not worry.\n\nIf I were to pick some negative aspects that push the game down for me, it would be the servers (Now mostly fixed) which disconnect you randomly, meaning you have to wait to log back in. And a lack of some of the movie characters and lack of character clothing, but it's still made up by what is available. Another problem i've found is that some special attacks are down right over or underpowered, the father and son kamehamea does the tiniest bit more damage than a normal one, while taking three Ki bars, while the blue swirl used by burter can deal nearly 3/4 damage of someones HP if they get in the whirlewind at the start, and this has a large AOE, so potentially you could destroy the whole team with one move.\n\nOverall i'd give it a solid 7.5 out of 10, if it were to be pushed up to an 8 or a 9, the moves would have to be balanced out a bit more, and the servers would have to be working better, I would reccomend this to fans of the show who want a good game, but to those not into the game, it might be better to wait for some of the problems to be fixed, though I'd imagine they'd still have a lot of fun playing this.","March 16, 2015","true","29.0"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","21","31","2","0"

Combat is not as in-depth nor as cinematic as Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 (the best DBZ fighter, in my opinion), though the game is still fun and it brings the new experience of fighting with or against your friends in a battle with several characters fighting simultaneously.\n\nAnother aspect of DBX that brings some added enjoyment to the game is the ability to create your own characters.  The characters can be humans, saiyans, namekians, majin, or friezan.  As you progress through the semi-unique, not overly impressive story and fight your way through repeatable parallel quests, you'll unlock new gear to equip (which changes your appearance) as well as abilities.  Nothing made me happier than when I finally managed to unlock Galick Gun on my saiyan.\n\nAll in all, this is an enjoyable game that is significantly more fun if you have friends to play it with.  I recommend it for both Dragon Ball fans and fans of the fighting genre in general.","July 20, 2015","true","22.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

My thoughts? VERY much worth it to any DBZ fan, anyone else should wait for a price drop.\n\nPros:\n\nAmazing storyline. Although not written by Toriyama himself, but rather Dimps, it follows true to the Dragon Ball heart. It stays close enough to what has been presented before so that it remains believable and memorable, but strays just enough to keep you on your toes to see what happens next. Ends up in an ending that is neither overly impressive nor unimpressive, just satisfying.\n\nLarge selection of characters. While Base/2nd/3rd form Frieza and base/2nd form Cell are missing, along with characters like Dabura and Androids 16, 19, and 20 (Gero), they still have plenty of characters to choose from, all of them feel unique in their own ways.\n\nCharacter creation. Not as immersive as some games have it, but you can change your race, gender, hair, facial features, voice, and name. While your character doesn't typically speak outside of yelling attack names, these changes presented are still nice, with enough for them to improve upon in future sequels.\n\nAmount of content. I've played over 50 hours and still have yet to do everything the game has to offer, and I've yet to start the DLC. Grinding for the next move you want or to get the Dragon Balls remains ever fun, training with mentors to learn new skills, and playing through the story as well as battling with friends and taking on quests with people from around the world, the game gives plenty for you to do.\n\n\nCons:\n\nSimple battle system. You have light attacks, heavy attacks, ki blasts, 4 swappable Special Moves, 2 swappable Ultimates, and a single swappable Evasive skill. It leaves a lot to be improved upon in future releases, though is passable.\n\nControls. You'll probably want a gamepad, as the k/m controls are, while functional, a bit awkward. Not deal-breaking IMO, but if you're planning on using your trusty keyboard and mouse, you'll need to get used to the inputs.\n\nLimited options. You can change the resolution, framerate, motion blur, and anti-aliasing, but that's about it. Better than Naruto, but not as good as some big release PC games.\n\n\n\nOverall, great game geared towards fans of Dragon Ball Z.","April 13, 2015","true","26.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kokoronis/recommended/323470/","kokoronis","i dont fuckin know","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kokoronis/","205 products in account","I'm a huge fan of Dragon Ball, and I've played a number of the games since Budokai. I bought this week one in excitement for the release. I've played the game to storyline completion, and completed almost half of the PQs so far. I've generally enjoyed it, but frustrations are building and I'm no longer certain this was a good purchasing decision.\n\nPROS:\n+Customer characterization is cool! You can play as multiple character races from the series, including Frieza-type aliens. Customization allows for specific builds which employ moves or skills from multiple DBZ characters, allowing for an interesting fusion of styles. There's a variety of cool costumes that call back to even the most obscure (such as an outfit Bulma wears on one Dragon Ball manga cover, Arale from Dr. Slump's hat, and the hats Goku and Krillin wear when they attend their first Budokai Tenkaichi).\n+Control scheme is simpler and more approachable to those who may not be as experienced with the DB fighting games.\n+There are new, original characters for the game's storyline, including the Supreme Kai of Time and Demon God Demigra.\n+In the multiplayer lobby, you can goof around by doing hilarious character poses, like the Ginyu Force poses, or Great Saiyaman's entirely too elaborate poses.\n+At its strong points, combat feels great, with the exaggerated sound effects, combos, and dramatic camera angles adding a lot of excitement, reminiscent of the show.\n\nPROBLEMS WITH ONLINE PLAY:\nOnline play is a complicated, fickle beast. There's a lot of problems here.\n-First, you have to play online unless your internet connection is off. There's no offline option within the game settings. It will always log you onto the servers. This can be aggravating when there's a lot of server downtime. It can take a long time for the game to boot because it spends a while connecting to the server. Even in single player lobby, if the servers go down, you'll be booted from play and have to log back in.\n-Connections can be very unstable. Characters lag across maps and sometimes freeze in place, or enemies don't spawn in. Sometimes the quest will simply freeze upon completion, until one character forcibly closes the entire game. Often, one or more participants will not receive credit, experience, money, or items upon completion. While grinding for items with friends, this can be very frustrating. I am doubtful that this is entirely to blame on my internet connection speed, and feel that measures could've been taken to deal with the issue.\n\nOTHER CONS:\n-Item droprate is utterly brutal. Some equipment is purchasable for large sums of zeni in the in-game store. However, some of the more desirable equipment must be unlocked via Parallel Quest. The problem is that it's highly specific and randomized. Quests have secret requirements in order to unlock extra battles or equipment within them. There is very little information to go off of within the game as to what these requirements are (sometimes context or character relationships could provide insight). Sometimes, when you do fulfill these secret requirements, the battle finishes early anyway. And if you do complete the requirements, you still have a random chance of getting the item. This can be extremely time-consuming if there's a particular look or build you're trying to create for your character.\n-The difficulty curve can be awkward at times. Computer AI can vary from relentless to completely ignorant. One battle, I might get stunlocked into a corner, another, I might be able to stand next to my opponent and freely charge to super saiyan without so much as a single glance in my direction.\n-Some design elements feel cumbersome and purposeless. You are required to walk to whatever game option you want to play. While the idea of Tokitoki City is nice in concept, in execution, it results in players taking one to two minutes to select play options as opposed to seconds. While grinding for item drops, this can cause a lot of annoyance (though the distance is shorter to the PQ desk).\n-Sometimes characters can become stuck on objects, forcing players to either end the game in the lobby, or accept a KO in matches.\n-Some gameplay mechanics aren't explained to the player, resulting in some early game confusion.\n\nI'm hoping that the developers will consider a number of the major issues, which have been vocalized numerous times by the community, and work to improve this game so that it can achieve its potential. For now, I would advise against most from purchase, though avid fans who are willing to look past problems may find themselves enjoying the highlights.","March 20, 2015","false","55.6"," 85 of 153 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","85","153","5","2"

Well.. if you dont like it move along because Dragon Ball Xenoverse is all about fast paced combat and incredible effects!\nStory\n\nThe story might be the weakest part of the game(writing-wise, else its quite well executed for what it is) . Someone is rewriting the history and you need to stop them but first you need to set history on its normal course which means that you gonna take part in big fights from the manga/anime. There are cutscenes in both anime(2D, trying to make you nostalgic) and in-game(3D) style. The story is quite short(I needed 6 hours to beat it)  but in between each Saga you can do side quests to level up. By doing story missions you unlock masters and side quests to bother with later on.\n\nGameplay\nHere comes the important part of the game.\n\nCombat\n\nCombat is Faaaaantastic. It almost grasps the feeling from the manga... apart from the long charging scene filled with useless dialogues... there is none of it...  but the fast paced action is there to stay.\nDuring fights you have 4 basic attacks : normal and heavy attack, range attack and throw attack(combo from guard and range) . You can also dash from danger, then you have 4 super attacks that can be ki bursts,strikes(physical attack), transformation,power ups and "other" . If you decide to save up Ki you can use ultimate attacks which often are varietion of super attack but stronger. At at the end there is 1 last skill slot for evasive moves. I used controller and didnt really made sense to me to have 7 skills and having 1 empty button. 8th skill could be for transformations but thats only my opinion.\n\nAt times combat may feel repetetive(only if you make it so) because you may end up doing same combo over and over again until you change your skill set.\n\nYour own Avatar\n\nThe game lets you make your own Avatar in DB universe(you can still play as other characters if you unlock them). Creator isnt that great imo but still does the job just fine. You can change height body,hair,skin and such but the variety isnt big. There is even voiceover but yet to hear my character say a word.\n\nGear up and consumables\n\nIn the game you can wear different kind of clothing and can even try to make yourself to look like your favourite character. Sadly the clothing is bind to different playstyle so you either pick your skills first or your clothing and work from there.\nAlso a bummer is that not all clothing can be dyed the way you want so you may end up just like everybody else.\nYou have 4 clothing slots(top,lower,hands,feets) that nets you bonus stats. Then you have Accessory of your own choice that is only visual gimmick.\nLast but not least is the Z-soul that offers passive and active bonuses(those active during combat but its RNG based for most part).\nLets not forget and the consumables. You have 4 slots to use during combat so pick carefully what capsules you gonna bring with you. There isnt much variety but they usually either provide regeneration to HP,Ki,Stamina.\n\nSide and Parallel quests\n\nApart from main story, game offers side and parallel quests. Side quests are often links between different main story events while parallel quests let you redo main/side quests but from different perspective(in main you fight against vegeta but in parallel you both are allies) . By completing main/side quests you unlock parallel quests that you can farm with other players for items/skills(unlocking stuff in general). While you can do parallel quests with other 2 players(either online or offline(in offline they are NPCs)), in side and main you are on your own.\n\nMasters\n\nGame features Master system. What does that mean? That you can be a student of manga's character and if you train enough he can teach you new skills and even help you out in fight. To unlock masters you need to finish main story missions. Then you have to find them in Toki Tiki(there can be only 1 master spawned at a time and they refresh after every completed quest). Once you pick a master, they will teach you one of their signature skills, use it in combat to master it and then go to be tested by the master.  Rinse and repeat till you fully unlock the master. Then you can change your master and do it all over again. Over time you can talk with you master and they can give you consumables or materials to help you out.\n\nFinding Materials,Items and Dragon Balls\n\nDuring missions if you use your scouter(you always have it even without having it in your accessory slot) you can find items on the group to pick them up.\nWhen you defeat your opponent there is a chance to get material,clothing or even learn a skill.\nWhile getting drops is RNG based, finding the dragon balls is squared RNG.\n1. You need to find a mission that can spawn time patrol(aka other player's character) 2. Start the mission and find where and how it spawns 3. Hope the NPC spawns(its RNG based) 4. If it spawns and you beat it hope it drops Key Item(aka Dragon Ball aka RNG based). It often drops 2 items and usually the key item is 2nd notification if it drops.\nI find this way to get Dragon Balls kinda stupid but oh well... its something .\n\nShenron and wishes\n\nOnce you gather all 7 balls(can take 1-2 hours grinding if you put your mind on it) you can summon Shenron and pick one of those wishes : More money, Rare item, Clothing Item , Z-soul materials, Level up, new Ultimate attack,New Super attack, a playable character or to reset your stats or appearance. Once your wish is granted you ... can go grind them back again, you dont need to wait another year.\n\nXenoverse Online\n\nThe thing that can make your game useless in the future. Everytime you play you need to connect to it .. even for single player . While it provides neat options like Online PvP or co-op parallel missions it still can hurt player's experience if you cant connect to the darn server. Anyway, you can still do "offline" pvp/parallel missions with playable character you unlocked OR you can hire player's character(the higher the lvl, the higher the cost). At first the cost may seems high but that changes quite fast.\n\nLip Syncing\n\nAnnoys me.. or more likely the lack of annoys me during the cutscene. At times is fine and at times is either missing or not timed correctly.\n\nOverall\nIts a great game. Combat is well made. Progression system is fun, clothing feels limited but the skill variety is big enough to keep you busy.\nIs it worth it to get the game for the combat? Definitely!\nIs it worth it to get it for the story? Nope, not a chance. Afterall the game is more about unlocking stuff than just beating the story.\n\n\nEdit 1: Prepare to rage quite a lot of if you try to finish all side quests(not parallel) after you are done with the story. Quest 47 is just pain the ♥♥♥♥ ... " Quest Designer "Hey guys,you know that ppl hate those troll players who spam same skill all over again?" " Yeah,what about those?" " Well I just thought of quest that put 2 or 3 of those kind of troll AI characters at 1 spot so our player can try to fight them in 1v2/3 . I'm sure players will appreciate my creativity""\n\nEdit 2  : For Parallel Quest are better off to play with friends, else you will get mad at your stupid ally AI... for real while enemy uses ultimate attack when they can, your AI prolly wont even fight or use any skills ....","August 9, 2015","true","73.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","14","20","5","0"

I use a Dualshock 4 controller and the game recognized it no problem. The only downside is all the on-screen buttons are for the Xbox controllers, so you'll have to memorize which Xbox buttons correspond to which Playstation buttons.\n\nThe only downside is in order to play the game, you need to be connected to the "XENOVERSE" server. There is no offline mode, even for 1P vs CPU. The game just came out so there have been some problems, but perhaps over time things will smooth out and possibly (hopefully!) get an offline mode!\n\nOther than that one thing, this game is really amazing, and I have absolutely no regrets!","February 27, 2015","true","66.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

There are some drawbacks in the gameplay department but the pros outweigh the cons.  If you're a fan of the Dragonball series and the world that Akira Toriyama has created then this game is a must buy.  If you don't really care for Dragonball but are interested in the gameplay it is a solid game but packed with fan service that will probably go over your head.  You will also probably be less forgiving of its flaws and may not get enough enjoyment out of the story and the Dragonball world to offset them.   Character customization is definatley the high point of the game, everything from looks to stats to skills is up to the player.\n\nLong review:\n\nIf you like the Dragonball universe and the past Dragonball games then there's a great chance that you'll love this game.  There's a ton of fan service here for those that know the story well.  There's also a nice refreshing take on the old story with a new Time Patrol twist.  Your character feels like they belong in the Dragonball universe and they become important to the story of the Xenoverse game.  With the way they did the story it feels like your character is an important part of the Dragonball history and not just some voiceless, tacked on nobody that you get to customize.\n\nThe customization is great too.  Being able to choose between human, namek, saiyan, maijin or changeling is a great start and there's a variety of body builds and looks that you can use to personalize your DB avatar.  It probably isn't the most in-depth character creation you've ever seen but it offers enough variety for you to individualize your avatar.  Each race starts with it's own unique bonuses.  Namek's, for example, get natural regen when their health is low.  Saiyans get a bonus to offense but have lower health than other races, etc...\n\nYou'll get to dictate what skills are available to your character by earning them through quests or by choosing a mentor.  Your mentor will be a well known character from the Dragonball universe, they include heroes and villains, and they will give you quests to complete in exchange for learning their skills.  After you've mastered one set of skills you are free to move on to the next mentor (or, if you don't like the skills you're getting, you can select a new mentor at any time).  If you want to be a Maijin who goes Kaokenx20 and then blasts people away with Piccolo's special beam cannon, Krillins destructo disc and Vegeta's final flash all in one match, you can.  Feel free to change it up in-between fights as often as you see fit.\n\nYou'll also have control over your stats.  Your character will receive 3 attribute points each level to put into Health, ki, stamina, basic attacks, strike supers (which are physical super attacks) and ki blast supers (which are energy attacks) up to a max level of 80.  It's completely up to you what your character will excel in.  You can specialize in ki blasts and have weak physical attacks or vice versa.  Or you can try to be well rounded and do a little bit of everything.  It's completely up to you.\n\nWhen you finish up the main quest line you'll have access to 55 Parallel Quests with a wide range of difficulty.  Each quest has a random chance to drop skills, items and gear relative to the difficulty and the characters that appear in the quest.  Your reward will be directly related to how well you perform and you'll be given a score that ranks your performance from D at the low end up to Z at the high end.  You can choose to do these offline with NPC teammates or online with other players.  You'll also gain access to pvp battles ranging from 1v1 to 3v3.  This is all in addition to the main quest line which can probably last you anywhere from 10-15 hrs depending on how adept at fighting games you are.  You can easily put 40-60 hours into your first character.\n\nThere are some cons.  Right now the biggest con is the server stability.  Sometimes multiplayer is great, sometimes it's completely broken and you can't log in at all.  The game is also a bit grindy.  If you're unlucky you can spend a whole day grinding for an item in the same Parallel Quest over and over again and never get it.  You're also going to run into hackers who are giving themselves godlike stats to cheese you in pvp, but what game doesn't have this problem to some degree?  Very rarely, I've had missions where an enemy npc will get stuck in a mountain, where they aren't supposed to be and I have a hard time getting to them to KO them and finish the quest.  This problem hasn't occured but maybe 2-3 times in 56 hours of gameplay for me.\n\nThere's a really good amount of content in this game and for those of us that just want a Dragonball world to get immersed in and be a part of this game will somewhat scratch that itch. The pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion, and there is enough game here to play offline if you absolutely had to to make it worth the $50.00.  More than likely in the worst case scenario, you would be unable to log into the "Multi-Lobby", which is a hub city where you can meet players and form teams.  You would probably still be able to queue up for online Parallel Quests with other players and online battles in a single lobby (a hub city populated by npc's that you can recruit to help with quests) but without the multi-lobby it is a bit harder to keep track of the people that you want to play with again.\n\nOverall this game is still worth the time and the price even if it does have some flaws at the moment.  If you aren't the biggest Dragonball fan and really don't know the story or care for the DB universe too much then I would suggest holding off.  The drawbacks will probably be a lot more difficult for you to forgive if you're not into Dragonball in the first place.  If you're a fan of the series and know the story like the back of your hand then the new "Time Patrol" approach is a nice refreshing take on a very familiar story.  The game is a grind but doing the same quest over and over for gear isn't so bad when your character is so versatile and customizable.  Part of the fun for me is changing up my skills as I acquire new ones to figure out what works best (and you can do this as much as you want in-between quests).  So even if the scenery doesn't change for a bit, your character can, and that can keep things interesting.","March 6, 2015","true","104.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastuck/recommended/323470/","mastuck","Mastuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastuck/","394 products in account","TL:DR at the end!\nI do like this game but there are some things you should definitely be aware of if you consider buying it. But let's start from the beginning.\n\nCharacter Customization:\nDo not rush it! Check out builds and guides to choose which race and gender fits your playstyle. Your first character is the most important because it takes a really long time to unlock the other slots. You can delete the character and all skills and items you got so far will be saved but it would still be a waste of time.\nThe cosmetic customisation has some variety. You can definitely create something more or less unique...or werid.\nThe part where the customization truly shines is the skill-system. There is a massive amount of skills and equitment that will make you character unique. Sadly the skills aren't well balanced.\nMost gear isn't dyeable. Only the starting gear and some high-end Sets.\n\nTutorials:\nI personally found the tutorials to be bad. I had to figure out most of the controls myselfe wich brings us to the next point.\n\nControls:\nThey have their flaws especially in close-combat but you should get used to minor issues. Controller is strongly recommended! But overall it's easy to learn unless you want to memorize some insane combos.\n\nOnline:\nConnecting takes way too long. Some people like to call it an mmo-something. It is not! Between Battles you are walking around in an interactive Lobby called Toki Toki City. If you have an internet connection and chose Multi-Lobby you will see other people running around as well. (but not blocking your path) You can recruit them to fight with you as NPCs. If their level is above yours you have to pay for it. This also works in offline mode but only with NPCs integrated by the developers.\nYou can battle with or versus other people. Beware of lags! I mean serious lags! Most people you will encounter will have lvl 80+ characters so make pvp with friends at the beginning or just wait for your character to become strong enough.\n\nPort:\nYes, it's not the best port but not the worst either. Toki Toki city is seperated in 3 areas. 4 if you count the time-thing. These areas should be one for pc-users in my opinion. Every pc that can run this game should be able to run the whole city at once without loading screens.\nThe inventory isn't really sortet. There are ways for mouse and keyboard to make it way better but i guess the developers really wanted us to play with a controller anyway.\n\nStory:\nI don't like it! For me it feels like the developers were looking for a way so you can have a custom character AND replay battles from the series. Well it worked but the story around it feels forced. The battles are still fun even if some of them feel unfair and maybe 1 out of 30 jokes was funny!\nThe Storymode has no co-op!\n\nParalell Quests:\nThese are sort of sidemissions you can complete with 2 NPCs or 1-2 players online. As rewards you can get skills, outfits, playable characters, items, dragonballs,... Well nearly everything in the game comes from Paralell Quests!\nParalell Quests are usually fun but if you're going for a specific skill or item you may throw your PC out of the nearest window. Some things just have an insane, luck based droprate. Wanna farm that item? Do that Quest 40 times!\nDragon Balls also take a lot of farming but if you're trying to grind your way to level 100 you will have more than enough.\n\nLeveling:\nEvery time you level up you'll get 3 Skillpoint. That means you'll have a total of 300 Skillpoints to invest IF you rech level 100. With 300 points you can max out 3 stats. If? It takes FOREVER! As soon as you hit level 85 you will curse the developers for how asian the amount of exp you need to level up becomes!\n\nGameplay:\nSo far i pointed out a lot of not-that-great-stuff but now it's time to praise the game!\nThe gameplay is really fun! Making your own character in the DB-Universe to fight with or against well knows characters from the series is a unique Experience. The combat is fast and you will often rely on muscle memory for making combos. Each build is it's own experience more or less. Each fight has little, unskippable cinematics (without lip-sync) that might be a little annoying if you repeat the stage for the 10th time. But those are usually about 3 seconds long so not a big downside. Usually they are like *character appears* "I will totally defeat you even if you killed me x times before!".\n\nMentor/Master System:\nVery early in the game you can get a Mentor. Those are original Characters from the DB Series who will teach you skills and sometimes give (and sometimes demand) items. You fight them first. Then you make a lot of story/paralell quests to get to the next stage and fight again. Repeat this three times and you've completet a Mentor.\nThere are two downsides. First Mentors spawn randomly in Toki Toki city. If you look for Cell for instance that means you might have to restart a game a few times before he appears. The other downside is the time it takes to get from one stage to another. It's not too bad if you grind for stuff anyway but it still gets annoying.\n\nDLC:\nO-V-E-R-P-R-I-C-E-D-! Yes, they add content to the game.

From the 4 hours I've played so far, this game is awesome and addicting. You can CREATE your own character, which I imagine a lot of fans wanted, certainly myself. The story is fresh, brand new. It feels like you're playing through a new Saga from the show, I find it quite interesting. Customization for your character is pretty good, you get stuff like accessories, skills, capsules, clothes, etc. You level up in every battle, and are rewarded attribute points to increase your stats and you earn money, which for me, substitutes the idea of "Training", and that's awesome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenCat77/recommended/323470/","GreenCat77","Meowmaritus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenCat77/","36 products in account","If you liked the Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball: Z, and/or Dragon Ball: GT series', ESPECIALLY if you liked the gameplay of the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series and the Dragon Ball: Raging Blast series, I can already tell you that you will LOVE this game. While the gameplay does feel like a little bit of a simplification of the fast-paced, EXTREMELY skill-based combat of the Budokai Tenkaichi series, this is only because the game is more about RPG-based leveling and MMO interaction with other players. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the gameplay is shifted a bit away from skill and a bit more toward strategy. However, the BEAUTY of this game is how it's still extremely fun to play, with MUCH more emphasis put on supers, making the fights seem more action-packed by giving the players loads of ki from melee attacks. This kind of shorter battle makes the online play more bearable, as well.\nThe story of this game is just awesome. It's actually a totally unique story involving a new foe, who conveniently alters the timeline, requiring the players of the game to "fix it" (i.e. fight various battles from the original DBZ timeline but with changes). For these fixes, you are first shown a cutscene of the situation the characters are facing, such as a gruesome scene with Piccolo firing the Special Beam Cannon, impaling Goku but......missing Raditz completely?! O NO! Yes some of it is a bit cheesy, but overall it's really fun, with tons of fully-animated cutscenes (FULLY LIP-SYNCED TO THE JAPANESE DUB, btw), as well as an AWESOME soundtrack, featuring synth-based orchestral pieces that sound like the original Japanese soundtrack and the Bruce Falconer soundtrack had a baby that was this game's soundtrack (ok that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but still it's great).\nThe thing that truly makes this game fun is getting to connect with friends and strangers alike and share your custom DBZ characters, playing VS matches online, and doing Parallel Quests online, allowing you to replay many parallel-timeline missions, which have various battle scenarios, some branching from the real timeline and others being completely changed ("what-if" saga, anyone?). Parallel Quests allow you to have fun with your friends (OR by yourself), while leveling up your character and giving you Zeni, allowing you to buy skills, consumables, clothing, and accessories from the game's vendors. You can replay a single quest as many times you like, as there are not only RNG-based loot drops but "ultimate" finishes which you can attain by meeting various (unlisted) requirements for each mission, which are often simply absolutely reking the bejesus out of the mission and completely dominating the whole thing in a short amount of time.\n\n\n\nSo, with all that being said, if you liked the anime itself and the skill-based Budokai Tenkaichi and Raging Blast series' of DBZ games, you will probably have loads of fun with this game, likely playing it for hundreds of hours. However, if you don't have the extra elements of nostalgia as well as familiarity with the gameplay itself, this game does have its drawbacks, such as a lack of polish on a few of its parallel quests, and, especially with me coming from a background of playing lots of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, not the most impressive amount of equipment, but still a huge amount. Additionally, if you are a person who dislikes games that make you earn your fun by being extremely difficult (such as Dark Souls), then you will likely dislike this game as well, because that's exactly what it is: really challenging but extremely awarding.\nEven if you aren't a total diehard DBZ fan, taking the minor drawbacks into account and everything, you will likely still get a lot of enjoyment from this game, and for me to say that must really show a lot about how great this game is.\n\n\nMy final rating of the game: 9.5/10","March 26, 2015","true","50.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

Arguably the best, or at least one of the best Dragon Ball games ever made.\n\nPositive points:\n* Cha La Head Cha La\n* Nice combat + fighting system\n* Possibility to have 3v3 fights\n* Character customization\n* List of characters\n* Endless gaming time because of tournaments and online battles\n\nNegative points:\n* Story might be a little short\n* Personally I feel that there are some characters missing:  There's no Majin Vegeta, nor Janemba (and a fairly unknown character I would have loved to see especially with the 3v3 combat: Gine. Goku's mother, so you could play in 3v3 with Goku and his parents (Bardock and Gine))\n\nIf you read the negative reviews they don't really have a solid ground.... they're mostly about connectivity issues etc. Since you have to be online all the time, I don't really see a problem with this as it makes it more fun. I'm seldomly ever offline when I'm on my PC anyway. They all state that they actually like the game, even though they post it as a "negative review".\n\nEDIT: Steam Trading Cards are coming soon for this game!

Being able to put your own custom made character into the Dragon Ball story is the cherry on top.\n\nThe combat, while fairly simple, is actually fun, fast, and very responsive.  The ability to have 3 on 3 fights in a large arena where you can fly around in is awesome.  The character customization also allows for you to equip moves and ultimate abilities from other Z fighters at any time outside of combat.\n\nKeyboard controls are awkward, but it works great if you have an Xbox (or similar) controller.\n\nThere is also a small element of exploration in which you can search for items in the arenas, these can be used for crafting in your hub world.  While not necessary, since you can just buy said items, it helps to do that to save money for the large variety of clothing and accessories available for your character.  Most of which change your stats in some way.\n\nOverall this game has a lot of content for the player to unlock.  And a lot of bang for your buck.\n\nBefore I go into the bad, the only other thing that I can say that makes this game purchase sort of iffy is the difficulty wall.  It's easy enough up until you beat Freiza, but then after that there's definitely a skill wall that you need to climb up.\n\nThe bad thing about this game is the awkward interface and hub world.  For example, it's really awkward to have a 2 player offline fight.  You need to sign in, and then pick your character, then run through the hub world to the npc that'll allow you to do this.  There's no way to pick it from a menu at the title screen.\n\nThe other  bad thing I can say about this game is that, at the time of writing, the online mode is completely broken. Often getting disconnected even while playing in single player.","March 2, 2015","true","42.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

But the main story got my interest in the What-If situations. I started doing a ton of research on the game to see if its any good, I even asked a friend and they said it was awesome. What really got me to buy the game is because it was developed by Dimps, the original developers that created DBZ Budokai 3 for the PS2 back in 2004. If anyone knows how to make an awesome DBZ game, its Dimps, with Budokai 3, Shin-budokai and a few other good games.\n\n\nPros:\n+Really good story, alot of what-ifs, mostly lets the evil win\n+awesome combat and gameplay\n+tons and tons of skills and items for the ultimate character customization\n+five different character races to choose from, even the majin and frieza race are playable\n+easily one of the best soundtrack music in the series, but Budokai 3 still has the best music\n+very good voice acting, male voice #8 is best choice, everyone loves Ghost Nappa XD\n+online co-op missions\n\n\nCons:\n-The story skips all of the androids saga,and goes straight the final fight with Perfect Cell. That means no android 16, no android 19, and no imperfect Cell\n-Diffcuilty can spike up to rage inducing levels. Beerus and Whis fight will make you wanna rage quit\n-energy charge is a skill, It should not have been a skill, it should have been a default ability\n-the so called enchanted armor is BS, it makes the game unfair\n-SSJ forms spams ultimates\n\nOverall, I love this game, so totally worth the buy.","March 20, 2015","true","37.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Creating your own DBZ character and then mixing it up in famous battles from the show is engaging and new even for someone who is a veteran of the DBZ games. Plenty of side missions, easy access to special moves and ultimate attacks, and new hand drawn animation specifically made for the game round out this amazing package. Best DBZ game since Budokai 3, and a good compromise between that game's tight action and the series' ongoing insistence of including full flying controls.","February 26, 2015","true","5.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The graphics are pretty nice and stick to the original anime. You can create a cusotm character just like an RPG. And you can upgrade your attributes with each level up. The game has three types of attacks, basic, super, and ultimate. Each goes up in Ki/Stamina cost and damage output.\n\nThe combat was fun in the first 5 hours, then it becomes monotonous. If you are playing saiyan race, get super saiyan skill. Then each time go supersaiyan, unload your ultimate attacks because in the super saiyan mode they cost zero Ki. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe second point is for many skills, you have to do the side quests multiple times because the skill is a random drop. It gets a bit dull. Feels like grinding in a single player game.\n\nOverall this game is really nostalgia, combat and loot system could use a little work :)","May 5, 2015","true","13.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Most of the PVP players have moved onto playstation anyways, leaving the PC version practically deserted. The gear your character can equip has an effect on your stats, MANY of which contradict the very characters they are based on. Such as Piccolo and Bardock who're straight Blast type characters having outfits that weakens Blast type moves.\n\nThe game was a decent attempt to bring us something new to the franchise. A new story, two new characters and the ability to create our own. But many things in the game needed to be double checked before release (such as the gear's effects) or even completely removed (such as the RNG and gear stats all together).\n\nThe only reason this game was said to take 100 hours to complete was because of the RNG on loot drops. I'm here months after release and still haven't gotten everything. Not because there is so much to get, but because the game refuses to give me my rewards. I've lost track of how many times I've played the same mission over and over, only for it to not drop what I want.\n\n\nThe final DLC attempts to fix the RNG problem with a Z Soul that dramatically increases your chance to get loot drops. Unfortunately, you have to be level 93+ to train with Elder Kai and max out his training before you can get it from him, and that takes a LONG time to achieve. Level 99 is the max and it takes like 60 or something PQ's to max out training with a master. By the time you even get this Z Soul, you've probably beaten the game, reached max level and have grinded so many times you've grown bored by this point!\n\nAlso making people pay money for a better chance to get loot in the form of DLC was not cool.","September 24, 2015","false","186.5"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","21","36","3","0"

(Kamehameha / Short range masenko / Final flash, and a destructo disc barrage on one character for example).\n\nThe only complaint I have is that every DBZ game I have played besides burst limit has handled the dodging mechanic in a rather poor way and this one is no exception.","February 26, 2015","true","67.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LionInk/recommended/323470/","LionInk","Barrett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LionInk/","156 products in account","First Impressions:\n\nLet me just start off by saying I'm definitely one of those 90s kids who grew up with Toonami and all that, so the nostalgia factor has been pretty intense from the moment I started the game up with Cha La Head blasting.  I'm not a DBZ fan in particular, but I did enjoy it.  I picked this up during the sale because I don't mind grindy, MMO-esque games, as long as they're vibrant and fun to play.  So far I'm not disappointed, but I can imagine if you're a fan of the hardcore DBZ fighting games that this might not be up your alley, since combat feels fairly simple once you take your lumps in the first few missions.\n\nThe most appealing aspect was being able to make my own character in the DBZ universe, and there's a decent amount of options for the races they offer.  You can change armor and even armor color later pretty effortlessly, too.  They're all presets however, no sliders here, so that may be an issue for some.  Your race matters too, and some characters will take note of just who you chose to be.\n\nThe world hub has some convenience flaws, like not being able to dash to get to where you're going faster.  You're given some decent preset motions and texts to interact with others, which helps bring your character alive a bit more outside the story's cutscenes.  It's a bit confusing at first as nothing is unlocked and you're vaguely told to go talk to everyone.\n\nController support is good, but I'm using a DS4 and the game insists on thinking I have a numbered gamepad instead of showing the buttons for a 360 controller, which is easier to translate in my head.  Once you learn what's what it's fine, but makes learning a bit difficult if you're a player who's going to be using a Dualshock.\n\nRunning on a 970 on Windows 10, no framerate issues at all or tearing after I turned v-sync on.  Everything looks crisp, bright, and shiny.  Music's good quality and clear, voices are.. fairly what I'd expect, for better or worse haha.\n\nSo far, it's definitely a recommend if you're coming in expecting a fan experience, but not some groundbreaking, amazing game.\n\nUpdated impressions @ Lv. 50:\n\nDefinitely leaning more toward recommending only if one is a DBZ fan.  The atmosphere and experience do make up for a lot of the flaws and some odd design choices, like slipping in super hard Parallel Quests in the lower tiers where it seems like the enemies never stop coming.  Frustrating stuff.  Combat gets a lot smoother as you power up and learn, but the game really does not hold your hand at all through the process of learning about armor, stats, and builds so you can succeed.  Being able to preview gear before you buy it would have been a welcome feature as well.\n\nTook me about 14 hours to get through the story with some Parallel Quest grinding.  Lots more replayability than just those hours of course, as there are still characters and places I have yet to encounter.","September 11, 2015","true","26.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, some more work could have gone into the lip-syncing At times the combat can get a little ech, but this is coming from someone who's playing the game with a mouse and keyboard. They could definitely have added some characters, it would have made a lot more sense plot-wise. But when you look past all that, this is truly a unique experiance that any Dragon Ball fan would enjoy (not counting the scattered continuity errors).\n\nP.S.: If I had to some this game up in 7 words, it would be "Dragon Ball OC Generator: The Video Game"\nP.S.S.: I know full and well that this game isn't being updated anymore, but they should really go back in and fix a certain mission in the Ginyu saga. If you've played up to that point, you'll know which one I'm referring to.","November 17, 2015","true","98.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sagasage/recommended/323470/","sagasage","Sage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sagasage/","99 products in account","It's a Dragonball Z MMO done right, something people have been trying to imagine for years and it's finally a reality. An absolute must for any fan of Dragonball Z, anyone who has played previous Dragonball games and enjoyed them, or for people who just like to beat the sense out of someone before they can even blink.\n\nYou can either create your own character from the five playable races they have available or play as one of the many well-known characters from Dragonball Z, Dragonball GT, and even characters from some of the movies (some need DLC). Customize the way you fight and put together your own set of iconic moves; from Death Ball to Instant Transmission, this game has pretty much everything.\n\nThe story is pretty original as far as Dragonball goes and it's pretty cool to have characters like Frieza, Cell, and even Goku as your training master. They can teach you their powerful signature moves you can utilize to destroy anyone who so much as looks at you wrong.\n\nYou can even invite people to help you out on missions; so team up with a friend to take on the challenges, or fight them one on one for sport. Trust me, hilarity will insue.\n\nThere's also a crafting system, because what MMO doesn't have one right? On top of that you can buy new clothes and costumes to make the hero or villain you envision, or to just look like one of the canon characters instead to confuse everyone around you.\n\nSo if you're looking to buy Dragonball Xenoverse, I fully believe this game is definitely worth the asking price.","September 11, 2015","true","114.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I was a huge fan of Dragon Ball Z as a kid and I have always enjoyed playing the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai games so of course I was excited for a PC Dragon Ball game that allows you to create your own character. And I can tell you that this game is worth the wait. This game has a great fighting mechanics as they are easy to learn and very fun.The graphics are very nice and fits the art style nicely. But the biggest draw for me is the story. We finally game a DBZ game with an original story. Going though the original DBZ timeline and seeing it change and offer new possibilities was very enjoyable. The voice acting was also good but I wish my created character actually spoke some lines of dialogue. Why choose a voice for my characters if they don't speak to people. While this game has a lot of pros it also has some cons. One major con is that the online multiplayer is somewhat unbalanced with some characters being way to overpowered. But since they are still updating the game at the time of this review, I hope that they balance the game more.  In conclusion, rather you are a DBZ fan or not, you will have fun with this game.","June 13, 2015","true","201.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

While I still enjoy the game, it's not acceptable for servers to be like this on release. Still a good game and playable without the online but if I can't access features of a game on release that's just terrible. So I take what I said about online back for now, will update when servers are fixed.\n\nDragon Ball games on home console have not been that great recently, but with Xenoverse brings us a decent console Dragon Ball game (don't ask me about the ps3 and 360 versions though) and for the first time a PC Dragon Ball game! First off, looking at the specs recommended for the game when they were listed got me thinking this game was either going to be well optimized or that they were faking us and we'd get a ♥♥♥♥ port. Lucky for us, Dimps brought us a well functioning port, where there could maybe be one or two more graphical options but they're perfectly fine the way they are. The gameplay is also good. I did not go into this expecting anything amazing, this is a licensed game. Granted I expect a bit more than most license games with the Dragon Ball games, but the gameplay is nice and fun, camera can be a little iffy on a rare occasion but nothing game ruining. The online is also working really well, and while there have been DBZ games with more characters, everyone feels different enough for once where I'm not too upset by this. In the end, it's a great game for fans of Dragon Ball. Should you play it if you're not a fan of the series? ♥♥♥♥ no, why would you play a game from a series you don't like?","February 26, 2015","true","32.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You gain points to put into different stats such as basic attacks, energy blasts, supers, health and stamina.\n\nThe story is a completely new story within Dragonball, it uses both the original story that we all love and adds a ton of new ideas and concepts to it such as time travel, making certain foes within the DBZ timeline more powerful then they used to be and by allowing your character to fight alongside iconic characters within the DBZ World.\n\nThe game runs awesomely on PC, I was worried that it would be a butchered port of a console version of the game, however it does seem that this was also made with the PC in mind throughout development so kudos to DIMPS for that.\n\nHowever I do have a few issues with the game as nothing is perfect. The first being the difficulty: The game starts off easy enough, however about an hour into the game, it becomes punishing. Not so that you can't win but you do have to think about how you are going to fight. Later on the game becomes even harder but if you train enough (level up and gain points for stats) you can win any fight with some challenge.\n\nSorry for the long winded review!

One main thing I have a problem with is even though you try to play offline single player mode, it still has to log in to the Xenoverse servers. Which as of right now are not working properly. I'm either stuck at the server loading screen until I force quit, or I get to play one level and it boots me out of the hub area. I did however get to play it extensively when it came out. The fighting is very similar to Budokai Tenkaichi, but seems slightly less complex. Still a better fighting system then recent DBZ games, but it can get a bit repetitive. The hub area is very big, which makes getting around a bit annoying. There needs to be a run button or some kind of quick travel to get around better.  The character creator is a plus. There are all kinds of things to choose from for your race, hair/alien head shape, sizes, eyes, and colors. There are also tons of clothing to earn or buy, to deck out your own character. Lots of fighting moves to earn and buy also. It also has a RPG like status system, Though I don't know what a few stats even do. They did not go over what each stat does in the tutorial. The game starts off a little slow, but picks up  after a few missions. Though the game has some issues that need to be addressed, it is still a entertaining DBZ game. So if your a fan or enjoy the games then add this to your collection. I'm gonna hope that time will fix most issues with patches.","February 28, 2015","true","98.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Story line is awesome because it is a little different from many of the previous Dragon Ball games and has a cool twist to the end. Parrelel quests are a good feature, it adds a whole lot more content to the game and cool drops so you can repeat the same quests waiting for a skill or a piece of clothing to drop. I also find that the fact you can change your characters skills into being an all melee type badass to a Kamehameha blasting maniac gives the game a lot of variation in terms of what you want your character to be, also choosing the right race with the right stats can give you a massive boost of power in battle.\n\nI would say the things to improve on this game is more options for your character such as more hairstyles, I would like to have more hairstyles such as Raditz's and Vegeta's style, the ones we get for them are pretty lame as almost everyone in DBZ has a cool looking hairstyle and we get these  Also a nerf on the character's skills would be nice as when I like to go pvp you get people maxing out everything into one stat and you get 1 combo'd with melee attacks or an ultimate skill which is not that fair or fun in my opinion.\n\nOther than that this game is good if you are a dragon ball fan or even if you are not a fan pick it up and within a week you could be sat there watching the whole Dragon Ball series! This is the first game I have picked up of the Dragon Ball series so I can not compare it to any others but this being my first game I was blown away when I first got in and was fighting frieza\n\n","December 30, 2015","true","46.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Here I am 10 hours into the game STRAIGHT after downloading it.\n\nHell yeah its freaking FUN. Mashing all those buttons as a Z-Fighter fighting all those villians. It's an awesome feeling. The game seemed to run at solid 60 fps which is a good thing! Usually a japanese game like (something like monster hunter) would be locked at 30fps. Even the new DQ warriors would be 30fps locked. A plus for this game!\n\nCo-op\n\nThe game has a simple co-op function. You could join a lobby filled with other players and take on quests together. It worked flawless if you're in the same region. Although I played with someone from EU, the latency was quite bad but the you could still fight just fine (well a couple of misses here and there because of the lag)\n\nOverall I'll give this game 8/10\n\nIts really fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeanV255/recommended/323470/","DeanV255","[SIN7]\m/ Dean \m/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeanV255/","1060 products in account","Amazing to finally have a Dragon Ball game on Steam, and I like many others on steam hope it is one of many to come. However this review will not be quite as glowing as the other reviews as I’m going to give the developer’s some tough needed love on certain aspects of the game.\n\nGameplay and Story:\nGameplay is overall excellent, you can start by making your own character from the the different races that been “Majin, Saiyan, Human, Namekian, Freezer’s Clan” apart from the last two each has Female and male and the game has just enough slots for each type of character and gender for you however you must first beat the game to unlock all the slots. From my playing and findings I find each class to have its own uniqueness to them however in my honest opinion you just can’t beat a good Saiyan, specially one who knows Super Saiyan 2 and certain moves, as they naturally have the strongest strength and Kai averages making them very powerful and can be even more powerful with the boots such as going super.\n\nThe game consists of 3 major gameplay implementations, the story that is okay, its accommodated by some nice cut scenes at certain points of the game like the Anime however I noticed the frame rate of those cut scenes to be noticeable and low but it was just cut scenes that were enjoyable. Most of your time you will find yourself doing PQ short for Parallel Quests, these are the side quest that you must do to grind for items (and when I say grind I mean, chuffing grind for them) and grind for levels specially at the later stages and finally your online PVP system that is sadly plagued with hackers at the time of writing this.\n\nOne of the finest parts of the game is getting the gear and new moves, getting the get up you want really makes it Fashion Ball Z but is regardless an integrated part of connecting to your character. The best way to think of this game is a very strong solid pillar of what to support, however as your hours of the game start to delve into it deeper you start to see the support structures holding it up are a bit weak and or lazy in many areas.\n\nSo moving onto some negatives on the Gameplay; The tutorial is basically non-existent, the game did tell me how to grapple an enemy but I soon forgot and it was half of the game before I relearnt it to deal with touch enemies, normally I would have look at the Skill list to learn all the moves, sadly it doesn’t exist, if it does I have not found it. There is a Skills List but all it says is “Y X X X” for combo basically, that’s it and this is very disappointing as if you want to Master combat and haven’t played any of the games say since Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and 3 you are going to be left perplexed, I still don’t know how I do a vanish chase but sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t.\n\nAnother flaw I must mention is the hub you spend your time in the game, it’s a little too big and empty and after you beat a PQ it puts you right at the pods and you must walk all the way back to the PQ area to get another or do the same one again, this is just lazy, put me back or give me an option to pick another or retry.\n\nGraphics:\nNothing much can be said about the graphics, they are decent and nice looking, the game itself runs perfectly fine however I have one graphical bug that sometimes the Ki moves show, and sometimes they do not. Some fixes fix this temporarily so waiting for a patch from Nvidia or the developers to resolve this.\n\nOverall I loved the many hours I have already put into this game, I never thought I would like a Dragon Ball game again since Budokai Tenkaichi just because the wish the combat system was like those games as they were perfect but Xenoverse does a great job at nailing this combat even with the lack of proper Skills List that I won’t hold my breath for.\n\nOverall I give the game a 7/10, harsh love has to be dealt to learn from mistakes but would recommend this game to hard core fans such as myself as it is very enjoyable when you take a small blind eye to the flaws.\n\nPros:\n-	Lot of content such as items and fighting moves\n-	Good combat system\n-	Nice graphics\n-	Combat is fast and at time hectic\n\nCons:\n-	Lazy corners were taken with the support of the game\n-	No proper Skills List\n-	Lazy spawning and making it awkward and time consuming for the PQ\n-	Some bad voice acting in the Story, all mainly from trunks","March 1, 2015","true","30.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlashFrame/recommended/323470/","FlashFrame","FlashFrame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlashFrame/","193 products in account","Dragon Ball Xenoverse... the name is... odd, to say the least. However what lays under Xenoverse's strange title, is a game that I'd awaited for literally, years.\n\nMy personal history with Dragon Ball games goes back to the early 2000's, playing SNES rom's of the fighting games and RPG Super Saiyan Legend. As well as the Playstation 1's Ultimate Battle 22 and Dragon Ball Z Legends.  Of course, Xenoverse has more in common with the later Tenkaichi games than with say, Ultimate Battle 22 [which is of course a great thing.]\n\nThe prior game in the series that even comes close to Xenoverse gameplay wise, is Ultimate Tenkaichi, which was released for the PS3 and Xbox 360. Where Ultimate Tenkaichi had a relatively minor create a character ability, allowing one to create a custom male saiyan, Xenoverse throws it to the wind, and gives us a full host of 5 races, 3 of which have 2 genders, and each has different, underlying stats. Xenoverse offers up the ability to create Majin's [buu's race], Saiyans, Humans, Namekian's[only male], and Freeza's race [only male, and named Freeza Race].\n\nThese create a characters are the bread and butter of the game frankly. With a host of customization options, including super moves, ultimate moves [the big attacks], and various clothing pieces, scouters, swords, ect. You're able to create damned near anything you want, from re-creating a character that may not be in game from Dragon Ball lore, to your own special snowflake super saiyan 2 god.\n\nThe combat in Xenoverse is about the level of the prior Tenkaichi games, with some refinement in my opinion. The controls feel good and the camera decent, while wonky in some aspects, leads Xenoverse to be a fairly fun action fighter.\n\nHowever, not everything is sunshine and rainbows in DBZ land. Apon launch, Xenoverse saw a huge influx of players, that the developers and publisher had no idea was going to hit numbers far exceeding the ability of the servers to handle.  While this was remedied in a fairly timely fashion, Lag is a continual issue in online battles. Speaking of online battles, the Multiplayer of Xenoverse is, especially on PC, full of hackers. With the decision to house player data locally, players have been able to utilize various cheating tools to give themselves outragious statistics [100 in everything, which is impossible.] As well as access characters and content not even available to the average player. And god mode hackers have been seen topping the leaderbords in PVP.\n\nThe other shortcoming of Xenoverse lays in it's loot system. Which awards you on a pure RNG system. You could play the same mission 20 times and get Raditz boots half of that time, and never see his chest piece. As an example. And while this isn't a huge issue, for those of us who wish to get complete sets of gear, it does tend to be rather tedious, especially when some things don't trigger properly, or are not explained in the most helpful of ways. And even if you trigger the ultimate win conditions, you could STILL not get the item you're attempting. And be awarded nothing but XP.\n\nDespite Xenoverse's Shortcommings. Dragon Ball Xenoverse is a solid entry in the long line of DBZ 3rd person fighters, that has it's roots in the Tenkaichi series over all others.  All that's holding Xenoverse back, is a relative lack of some playable characters, and a rather tedious RNG system that seems almost punishing at times. However, the storymode is solid for a DBZ title, and the customization is decent for the first major title with customization.  I have to give them points also for, well, offering this iteration up on PC, as this is the first Dragon Ball title, outside of the now defunct Dragon Ball Online, to have been offered up on PC.\n\nDragon Ball Xenoverse rates a solid 7/10 in my book. A damn fine dragon ball z game, but lacking as a game on the whole. Despite that it's a solid game that's worth the buy.","March 23, 2015","true","136.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaniTheHero/recommended/323470/","DaniTheHero","DaniTheHero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaniTheHero/","50 products in account","Before I even review the game I want to point out something important.\nThis is the first Dragon ball Z game to be released on PC in years (About 10 years give or take)\nThat alone is enough of a reason for you to buy it.\nWhy you may ask? Because the second game developers and publishers understand that it's popular here as much as it is on console (they can make money from us PC gamers),then every new game will also be released on PC as well.\nThink about the Naruto ninja storm games. They released 3 for PC, and it turned out to be a big success. They also released Revolution on PC alongside the console releases as well.\n\nIn short support this PC/Steam release DBZ game for future titles for the master race.\n\nNow for the actual review.\n\nAs a person who has had the chance to play most of the modern Dragon ball Z games to date.\nI'd say Xenoverse is AMAZING.\nGranted it does have it's flaws, but it does try to be different in a good way, and it has succeeded.\n\nPros:\n-Outstanding soundtracks! I've found myself listening to a couple when not the game.\n-An actual GOOD character creation (Looking at you Ultimate tenkaichi)\n-A lot of moves to choose from and since there aren't many "bad" ones you actually have a varity of choice, rather than everyone using the same ones.\n-The different races are actually fairly balanced and have a simliar pick rate. At first i thought the game would be populated with super saiyans, but i was wrong everyone is creative and picks different looks and skills making players actually feel unique.\n-Team battle done right. (Yeah looking at you "Battle of Z")\n-An actual challanging experience.Unlike most DBZ games you don't slide through every quest and mission with one attempt. I've personally spent dozens of attempts on a couple of missions myself and i enjoyed the challenge.\n-Very appealing visuals\n-The most SMOOTH game play i have ever experienced in a DBZ game for a while.\n-MMO Feel. Actual intercation with other players.\n-Towa's model\n-Steam release!\n\nCons:\n-It's been quite a while and the server issues are still not fixed, so online may be a bit sluggish for now. (Ignore this once the servers are fixed)\n-The voice acting isn't really great. Granted most of the original cast was present, but the script and the acting itself was average from past games preformance's.\n-The subtitles are sometimes incorrect. Showing something that isn't relevant to the actual speech. I suppose that's a translation error.\n-The rooster isn't that large. And while I am aware that I'm obviously not gonna play EVERY character that BT3 represented. I do feel the lack of specific things bothering, such as "Future Gohan",Not SSJ "Teen Gohan","Zarbon" ,"Dadoria","Friezas" 2nd and 3rd forms, and a few other metionables..\n-RNG factor. As much as I'm aware that Grinding and lucky drops are part of any MMO atmosphere. Repeating a task over 20 times just to receive something that isn't worth it gets on your nerves eventually.\nThat being said that same RNG factor is present in AI battles.\nWhen sometimes a specific "boss" battle the enemy spams ultimates on you non stop making it impossible for you to win. Or the complete opposite  can happen and they NEVER use the ultimate and you win without difficulty.\n-HUB world has no sprinting/hovering and even though it's fairly tiny there's still 4 different sequences that are separated by portals which is fairly annoying. I get it that this was made cause of the consoles but any PC spec would be able to handle the game without this.\n-PVP is extremly fun,but not entirely balanced.Yes i have stated that the game is oddly balanced earlier in the Pros,but what i mean in by not balanced is,since most of the abillties are equally OP,you find yourself being completly destroyed against most combos,Since not ONE move is praticually op, but most are fairly broken you get to a point where most matches end in about 15 seconds.","March 7, 2015","true","177.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But before you rush toward the purchase button, please read through my criticisms and ask yourself- are any of these issues deal breakers? If you're a fan of Dragonball, they probably will not be. If you are not a fan, well... Read on.\n\nThe hub world, Toki Toki City, has a fair share of issues. Not having an option to move faster in town is kind of irritating, especially when you need to visit several locations. This is exacerbated by the fact that the game already has quick move controls. Being dropped half a map away from the parallel quest desk after each one you take part in is a serious drag. If we could get that changed out, that'd be great. There isn't much to do in Toki Toki City overall, which is really too bad because it's interesting visually. I feel like they could have mashed it all into one or two sections and have lost very little. Maybe they figured they needed the space for players to meet up?\n\nThe battle system is hardly flawless either. Control seems a bit sloppy, and comboing is unintuitive- I keep kicking the air behind me when I instinctively try to mix up a combo. Fighting multiple enemies is a pain well beyond the measure it ought to be, even when you're several levels above your targets. Combat is very much about being more powerful than your opponents, and not enough about beating them out through skill, which dissapointed me. Though I've heard talk of counters and such, the tutorial is NOT clear enough on this point. Speaking of the tutorial, a mention of how to use items during it would have been nice. I got through the Cell stage before I learned how to use them.\n\nThe designed character seems pretty weak too. Your avatar being a 'mute' with no personality is rather disappointing. The option to pick an overall personality (cocky, cowardly, brave, rowdy, exciteable, possibly others) and giving them a few lines based on it would have been nice. Instead you only get to hear certain attack names. The only ones I've heard my character use are Kaioken and Masenko, though I haven't used many, and have not made it very far into the story. Also, I created a female saiyan, and while the other characters recognize my race just fine, she has been addressed as though she's a man on multiple occasions. It breaks the immersion pretty bad. Also I was pretty disappointed when I found that equipment has an effect on stats- I would sooner have kept it entirely cosmetic, so I could pick and choose what bits of outfit to wear without it affecting my capabilities in battle- Especially considering how hard it seems to be find sets that boost atk and beams at the same time.\n\nAll that said, I'm having a lot of fun with it despite the flaws. Landing supers and ultimates is satisfying, and the story is fresh even to long time dragon ball fans. There are lots of skills and items to discover as well, so there's a lot to do. But really, I'm just glad I didn't drop nearly $80 on another Ultimate Tenkaichi!","March 1, 2015","true","60.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

You might think by my recommendation that I made a mistake, but I don't think anyone other then a die hard Dragon Ball Z fan would enjoy. It feels like a game made 10 years ago. Tons of design and balance decisions feel silly and it's another Japanese RPG that doesn't explain what each stat does. It does so many things poorly, but at the end of the day it provides an outlet for you and a buddy or two too make a group of Dragon Ball Z fighters and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of space monkies.

(excluding the network issues)\n+Trading cards\n+Archivements\n\nCons:\n\n-To many hackers (Having all stats maxed out, already moving before battle starts etc...) in multiplayer.\n-Still some gamebreaking bugs for multiplayer. (Players losing in ranked battles just shut down the game and terminate connection to the servers, so that they won't lose points...)\n-Publisher taking no actions against mentioned issues above.\n-Server Issues (DCs, Lags etc... but seems like it got better after they upgraded the servers)\n-Storyline only playable once. (You can replay the story like doing other side quests, but there is no real playthrough again)\n-Quests are just repetative.....\n-No difficulties to choose from in Single or Co-op game. ( All in all the game is to easy)\n-No VAC (critical in my eyes if a game is depending on playing online)\n-No original japanese language avalable (In my opinion original language should always be avalable in any game.)\n-Limited to 7 skills to equip (4 Super,  2 Ultimae and 1 Evasion skills). Could be few more in my eyes to secure a wider variety in your fighting style.\n-The ingame chat it rather useless than usefull. Only good for saying HELLO\n-Ingame mechanism to find friends or other players is rather broken...\n\nImpression:\n\nAbout the gameplay, it feels more like an action-simulator rather than a real action game. The combat itself looks speedy if you have checked out some videos, so you might think you will be very busy while playing that game, but that's not right.\nIt will be more like this. You have to press a certain button combination (mostly left or right trigger button + any of the buttons A,B,X,Y on your gamepad) to start 1 of those 7skills that your char has equipped, then you can relax for the next 2 to 5 secs (sometimes up to 10secs) while your character is performing that action.\nOf course in real it won't be that relaxing, since your char might get disturbed while performing his action, but compared to other fighting games like Street Fighter, Tekken or DoA, you won't be that busy in DBX.\n\nThe singleplayer story is short (still enjoyable for 1-2 days) and just a joke that you can play through the storyline only once. (You are able to replay it like the other side quests, but you won't have that feeling of a storyLINE again, like when you play through it on your first time). You are only able to play through the story with your own created custom character. So it might happen that you face some problems at some point of the story, if you care less about optimazing your characters attributes.\n\nSo what else can you do then, especially in endgame? You could do the same parallel quests either online or offline over and over again, at least that's 1 of the few options you got. If you want to own every avalable skill or skin in this game, I guess you have to do it anyways, since you will get the most of those items and skills rewarded  by the end of the stages as a random drop. But it also feels like grinding over and over again in a typical MMORPG nowadays. Easy to imagine how it will get boring from day to day.......\n\nSo, the only real content you have in endgame are the muliplayer PVP matches, where you can choose between ranked and non ranked matches. In non ranked matches you have the choice of 1 on 1, 2 on 2 and 3 on 3. The ranked fights (if you win you earn points, if you lose you lose points) are all 1 on 1, and these can be pretty fun. I my self enjoyed it a lot, and woul'd have enjoy it even more if there wasn't some problems...\n\nA big problem in this multiplayer is the massive amount of cheating players. If this game would'nt have all that hackers and all those bugs (some were fixed by now , but there are still enough critical ones left), it would be a decent pvp action/fighting game. But sadly it seems that Bandai Namco is taking no action against all those people.\nSo, this ranking points makes no sense at all, since you can have a win streak against 5,6 fair playing players to earn some points, just to lose those points to someone who plays with activated hacks etc...)\nAnd just a short look on that ranking table is enough to see, that some people even hack their points...\n\n(*seems like a weeks after this review was originally written, the amount of cheating players in multiplayer is decreasing, but still they are present and no actions taken against them by the publisher)\n\nWell anyways, in my eyes, it was just an expensive lesson for me to learn that you should never buy a game again thats focusing on online playing and that has no VAC implemented. At least I will be carefull in the future if there is no VAC and the game depends heavily on online playing.\n\nSo if it's just about DBX as a game, I woul'd rate it as a positive game. But unfortunately, combining it with the community and the lack of support by the publisher for those players trying to enjoy the game, is forcing me to give it a negative rating.\n\nSo, no recommandation from my side.\n\n*I think $29,99 USD would be a fair price for this game.","March 24, 2015","false","186.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","3"

For those people... I can't recommend it highly enough.\n\nThe graphics are perfect (It really does feel like playing an episode of Dragon Ball Z), the combat is, for lack of better summary, excellent, the story was incredibly well done (Historical battles are faithfully represented, cut scenes closely mimic the manga, timeline alterations are tasteful and fit well), and Cell's voice acting is at least 30% better than in the TV show.\n\nNow that's all well and good, but the avatar creation and character customization take the cake. Placing your hero alongside the Z Warriors is pure, concentrated childhood wish-fulfillment. The feels you'll feel the first time you go Super Saiyan are hard to describe, but fall somewhere between "Boner-rific" and "Worth the price of admission".\n\n$50 is a small price to pay to go Super Saiyan.

You can create a character of almost any popular species from the game, choose gender, size, and many other things. You can later customize special attacks, clothing, and accessories to make your character look more original.\nThe combat system is different from any DBZ game I've played before, and while it can be a little complicated and difficult to figure out, once you get the hang of it, its a lot of fun!\nOne thing I love about this game is that it's not just a simply "button mash win" game.

When I first got the game, I had felt some regret of buying since the games of Dragon Ball Z going downhill, I believe that I'm just going to play one of them for the first time and hate it. Yet, This game proves me and my friends wrong with it's incredible opening, RPG Elements, Storyline (Which I have to admit is quite interesting for a change) and the fighting system that I mentioned earlier.\n\n+ RPG Elements adds purpose to fighting in the new quest system as well as the Story, giving you experience for your fully-customizable character (Which I forgot to mention that is interesting since you can choose from 5 different races to support your playstyle of your wish.)\n\n+ Addictive Fighting System which allows you to form combos in a fast-paced combat along with super abilities that will deal huge amount of damage to your opponents, There is also the transformation system which is not as depth as the other games, but can support you against strong opponents such as Frieza (Which I have to admit that I struggled against for some time)\n\n+ 3V3 is awesome, it adds more depth to the combat whether you are fighting with computers or other players, supporting your allies with different kind of skills while the fighting the opposing team.\n\n+ Martial art Tournament I don't know much of at the current moment due to it not being open yet, but I bet It's gonna be fun.\n\n+ Hercule and Videl are Playable, I like those two characters from the series and I am happy to be able to play as them in this game.\n\n+ First time on PC, Dragon ball has been said to never have a game on PC before and this seems pleasing for a computer game.\n\n+ Story is something new and wish not to spoil it due to it being different, but I have to say it is interesting.\n\n- Has some bugs in certain places which very rarely bother me from time to time\n\n- Short Roster which has good reasons of why it's short\n\n- Required to grind alot to fight strong opponents and consumes a lot of time (Don't recommend game to those who want to get to level 100 quickly because it's takes a long time to get there)\n\nMy final score for this game is a 8.4 out of 10 due to some of the cons, but I recommend this game to fans of the series New or Old.","February 27, 2015","true","83.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Parallel quests are like side quests of the main missions, but the difference is that you can do them with 3 people! and they can be at different parts of the map, making it really fun to try and see who can get the best speeds and run-times on these missions, as you can really get tactical there\n\nThe items and unlockable movesets in the game are extensive, even more so than Budokai 3.\n\nThe servers have been spotty for me, but I really doubt it's the same for everyone, and seeing it is launch day for PC I'm not upset.

You are meant to do side missions, improving your time and ability each time you do them, for the experience, money, and item drops. You then use the money to buy better skills, or learn them from a trainer. If it sounds tedious it certainly can be, but the combat is what keeps the game from devolving into being boring. I really didn't mind that I was grinding because the combat was just THAT fun.\n\nThis goes without saying that your nostalgia and how much of a DBZ fan you are will have a huge impact on your ability to play this game. If you loved DBZ as a kid (or hell, even now!) and you always wanted to play a fighting system that let you do the crazy stuff you see, then this is the game for you.

(It's a fighting game, what do you expect?)\n- $25 season pass, DLC is always a Con.\n\nOverall Opinion:\n--\nAbout the $25 Season Pass, Please Devolopers/Publishers, go back to the roots. Include everything into the game and give it out for free. Or if companies have to make money on DLC and it worked like GTAV, where consumers had the option of purchasing ingame currency (which you can aslo make online for free), I'm ok with that as well. Either way, That keeps the hype train alive and people will continue to spend money on your hardwork. Otherwise than that, and the cons I listed, theres nothing really bad about this game that kept me from playing it.\nIn my opinion, it's one of the best DB games ever created. The fact that the original author (Akira Toriyama) did the story and artwork makes it even better. Recommended for the most hardcore of DB Fans.","March 1, 2015","true","52.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/screampunk/recommended/323470/","screampunk","Princess Rachel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/screampunk/","97 products in account","Alright, so let's start with my first comment: BUY THIS GAME. It is absolutely fantastic and a vital piece of gaming media for a Dragon Ball fan. I didn't think I'd like it, then I played it and now it's one of my favourite online games.\nI can assure you, you will love it.\n\nNow, let's get down to pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n\nEasy to pick up gameplay, tricky to master but not exactly "hard".\n\nA fun, engaging experience that will have your attention for hours on end.\n\nA steady levelling system that has you work for it, but doesn't grind your face in the dirt or require you put in hours to get a single level.\n\nGameplay and advancement are well-paced and don't require too much effort, though you're not just handed everything either.\n\nNice simple graphics that don't tax an average rig too much even at full power; a good offset to the major problem of PC gaming.\n\nSmooth, comfortable integration of USB controllers, although the keyboard controls are just as easy to learn.\n\n==\n\nCONS:\n\nSome ridiculously difficult Parallel Quest scenarios that will have you seething with rage as if you were playing Street Fighter or KOF.\n\nServer can be a bit laggy and interfere with multiplayer experiences at times; I played with someone only a few miles away and we still had a tricky time with collision detection and movement lag.\n\nCustomization. It's another game that presents itself as being highly customizable in terms of character creation, however when you actually get down to it, it's pretty limited. You can only change colours on a very small selection of outfits; the others are based off outfits from the franchise, and as you would expect, they kill the "character creation" function because the moment the average gamer is given a creativity toy, their first instinct is to make things they already know, so everyone thinks they're Goku, everyone thinks they're Gohan, etc. and very few people actually bother to make an original character in this.\n\nIt's a Namco Bandai game. They do this all the time; they bring out a great game that shows so much promise, only give it a little bit of content expansion and then abandon it to work on an inferior title, in this case that new One Piece thing. With SoulCalibur V, they did the same thing to work on TTT2 which was massively inferior. So while they make great products, they're a rather careless and irresponsible company that don't care much for their own products (although they're definitely no Konami or EA).\n\n==\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n\nNeeds more interactive environments, especially in the hub world.\n\nThey should put in at least quite a few more expansions that focus on character creation. Most specifically, let us colour any outfit and let Majin go barefoot; perhaps also some footwear like sandals or ankle guards. What we have is extremely limited despite being presented as bigger than it is.\n\nAn actual chatbox so players can talk to each other with text. I appreciate the effort to filter out spam by giving us preset messages, but come on - a private chat window at least.\n\nI hate to sound like a feminazi, but there are SO many great female fighters in the Dragon Ball universe that you completely ignored. There are about a half dozen playable females in this game and several dozen males. Just look at the Dragon Ball Wikia and take your pick; you should put in at least 10 more females.","August 31, 2015","true","100.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was the last person among all my friends to have the game downloaded, yet i had the most played hours in just one day XD\nThis game is absolutely the best DBZ game i've ever played in my life... but it has its cons, like low number of characters (but the amount of good characters and variations outweigh that).\n\nPros:\n- Best DBZ Game Graphics!\nAlthough graphics don't matter, this game captures the DBZ feeling so well!\n- Gameplay mechanics are easy-to-learn, hard-to-master\nFor some reason, as i progressed through the game, i started using less complicated combos, but i should be practicing them in the future.\n- Create your own character\nWho doesn't wanna be a Z-warrior? and to top it off, you have 8 different variations of gender/race\n- A ♥♥♥♥TON OF REPLAYABILITY!\nThe parallel quests are seemingly endless, and you'll find yourself replaying the same thing over and over again (still having fun with it) just to get that one skill or item...but you end up finding a hidden condition or something that rewards you with better stuff :D\n- All-new Story\nWithout spoilers, i found the story really awesome (though it felt like a Time Squad rip-off xD), i loved the fact that there are 2 endings (if you defeat the final boss fast, before a certain somebody could come and aid you, you get the secret ending).\n- Deep interactions, like characters recognizing your CaC's race and commenting on such, or fun interactions like Vegeta SSJ4 with Beerus\n- A lot of other stuff like the Master System and such\n\nCons:\n- Gathering the dragonballs is a pain in the butt, i still haven't gathered them all :\\n- Some missions you'll be pitted against 2 or 3 super saiyans at the same time, and those mofos keep spamming their ultimate because of their seemingly infinite ki, it kinda gets annoying especially when you need to finish the quest for an item or such\n- There's a bunch of glitches that happen often, though they're not that major and i'm sure they'll be fixed\n- Some missing characters/transformations (although some could be understandable)\n- The whole DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t...tbh i feel with those people who were waiting for reviews to see if they should get the game or not...and they had a low chance of guaranteeing a "preorder" copy of the game on any platform... seriously? ssj4 vegeta for DLC when goku and gogeta ssj4 are in the game? and i found files for great ape baby in the game...that's supposed to be $10 DLC\n\nOverall 9/10\nWhy? the game is way better than the whole PS3/X360 gen games, and possibly better than Budokai 3 and Tenkaichi 3. the downsides are just technical things that can be fixed, but the DLC thing is an issue (if anyone is familiar with the DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that the game Evolve had, this is kind of the same thing). So, should you get the game? ♥♥♥♥ YES! would you enjoy the game? depends on your taste.\n\nHope you found my review helpful.","February 27, 2015","true","134.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is fun by youself but is 100 times better with friends. The leveling system is kind of broken and the unbalenced tho. And the game all so suffers from repetition, making you do side quest till you get the desired attack or outfit you want. And once you beat the game you will feel unsatisfied. The fighting is really fun, its easy to lean how to play and you can do local co op with a friend at home. A major problem is the severs tho they are garbage. I would have to keep reinviting friends. and once you finish a mission with your friends it takes you all the way out to the main hub and you have to go all the way to the parrell quest start it and reinvite. theres all so 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. But they are very disapointing. In the game if you are a saiyan when you go super saiyan you get infinte ki (energy) so people will spam. some people would even let you get their health low and then at the last second use a healing item. Which makes them win. So the online battles are based on health not skill. In the furture i wanna see  freeroam, better multiplayer, destructible environment, no time limits, All characters from dbz universe and the movies, new races, another original story like this one, more customization, better music for the hub world and main menu. I left out a lot of things. BUT IN CONCLUSION THE GAME IS DEFINITELY WORH BUYING I RECOMEND IT FOR DBZ FANS AND I LOVE THE RPG ELEMENTS ALSO. FORGET WHAT IGN AND GAMESPOT SAID THE JUST MAD CUZ THEY SUCK AT IT, ITS NOT A 6 I GIVE IT A 8.5/10-DEATHXWISH","January 28","true","228.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

From the freedom it allows you when creating you character's fighting style, to the many activities and types of missions you can play on your own, with friends, against them, or even with total strangers. Playing with friends is a literal Blast.\n\nAt first seems simple and botton mashy, but there is a deep combat system to master, and the fighting feels just as good as it did in Budokai Tenkaichi 3, but way more varied and thoughtful. Also there are tons of unlockables, and when you create a new character all skills and gear is shared, so you dont have to grind back again for "that rare skill" you really need. In terms of lasting appeal, you really do get your money's worth.\n\nIn other parts the game feels a bit rushed sadly, small details, like Saiyan hairs don't spike up when transforming, to bigger ones like the block being a total unresponsive joke for the most part. To solve that, just play crazy offensive, and you won't need to block anyways.\n\nI say is the second best Dragon Ball ever, and the first Dragon Ball game in history to run at 60fps.","June 23, 2015","true","182.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're a fan of the series, this is a must.","December 6, 2015","true","32.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is fun by youself but is 100 times better with friends. The leveling system is kind of broken and the unbalenced tho. And the game all so suffers from repetition, making you do side quest till you get the desired attack or outfit you want. And once you beat the game you will feel unsatisfied. The fighting is really fun, its easy to lean how to play and you can do local co op with a friend at home. A major problem is the severs tho they are garbage. I would have to keep reinviting friends. and once you finish a mission with your friends it takes you all the way out to the main hub and you have to go all the way to the parrell quest start it and reinvite. theres all so 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. But they are very disapointing. In the game if you are a saiyan when you go super saiyan you get infinte ki (energy) so people will spam. some people would even let you get their health low and then at the last second use a healing item. Which makes them win. So the online battles are based on health not skill. In the furture i wanna see  freeroam, better multiplayer, destructible environment, no time limits, All characters from dbz universe and the movies, new races, another original story like this one, more customization, better music for the hub world and main menu. I left out a lot of things. BUT IN CONCLUSION THE GAME IS DEFINITELY WORH BUYING I RECOMEND IT FOR DBZ FANS AND I LOVE THE RPG ELEMENTS ALSO. FORGET WHAT IGN AND GAMESPOT SAID THE JUST MAD CUZ THEY SUCK AT IT, ITS NOT A 6 I GIVE IT A 8.5/10-DEATHXWISH","January 28","true","228.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snickerbar/recommended/323470/","snickerbar","Sinic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snickerbar/","125 products in account","coming from mostly Budokai 3 and a bit of Budokai Tenkaichi 3 as my two favourite games back on the PS2, i had low expectations for this game due to its lack of traditional fighter mechanics and more of a beat-em-up game similar to Naruto Storm (but a bit more out of control due to the 3 dimensional fighting, which i personally thought was a complete mess in budokai tenkaichi 3, having me favour Budokai 3 for it's more controlled, 2D gameplay)\n\nbut holy damn this is addicting and i completely regret my doubts for this game, atleast from what i've seen so far, the gameplay is very controllable, easy to use, but isn't too mindless to just call it a simple "beat-em-up" and for an anime fighting game, it's PC port is perfect (60 FPS, great audio, great graphics). I also didn't like the idea of making your own character, mainly just from me seeing people's stupid creations with blinding bright hair and clothes that make them look gayer than the ginyu force, but after realizing how many different abilities there are present in the game, and how this is the first DBZ game with a (rather simplified) power level system that is actually balanced based on the strengths of the characters during the anime; the game's progression system and character creation is simply amazing.\n\nmy only complaint is how there's no duller colours for the character customisation, either you make your guy completely black, or you choose blinding colours. took me around 10 different iterations before i found a look for my guy that didn't look too autistic\n\nidk / 10, still need to play more. still recommended\n(i'm still waiting for Budokai 4 with online multiplayer cmon bandai)\n\nApril 24, 2015 (137hr of gameplay review):\nmy views on the game have changed a lot compared to when I first purchased it two months ago.\n\nAfter reaching the [new] level cap of 85 for a male human striker and a female Saiyan ki-user, there's a lot of negatives that I notice in the game that make me, rather than find a lack of hope for the Dragonball Xenoverse game, give me more hope for a sequel.\n\nIn short, the game is terrible for PvP once you reach level 85. Sure, you may think, "Wow, but isn't the max level where you want to be so you can reach to the fullest of your power when facing other opponents who are the same?"...\n\nNo, absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing not. Let's start off with my first complaint:\n\n- Clothing items give stats, not just any stats. Stat multipliers, this means the more of one stat you have attributed to your character, the more it can be amplified or compressed depending if you wear a piece of clothing that gives a positive multiplier, or a negative amplifier. You know what this means? When you're low level, who gives a single ♥♥♥♥ that you have clothes that only give -3 in each important stat (to your specific character) yet they look cool as balls, because in the end, it'll only reduce a fraction of your low-as-♥♥♥♥ stat by a bit because it's a MULTIPLIER. Not a flat amount.\nTherefore, the amount that is lost or gained by your character's clothing is directly proportional to the attribute's stat itself.\nHave 100 in ki-blast and wearing a +5 multiplier? That'll increase it to around ~135, which ALSO multiplies damage in-game by a percentage based on a value starting at 100%. Therefore you have ~235% the original damage on your base 500 damage ability, making it ~1175 damage. Having 0 to 50 points in one stat really makes ♥♥♥♥ all of a difference as it'll only go up from from 0 to ~69. And seeing how that stat you invested in is probably the only stat you even have points in because you're pre-lvl 80, you're only affecting one stat and very minorly. Do you see what late-game players wear dumb looking ♥♥♥♥ if they have over 3000BP? Because they have to do, to do well in PvP.\n\nDBXV is a game where unlike Budokai 3 or BT3, you can power-level a single stat on your character to the point of disgusting damage. At level 80, you have 237 points to spend. At level 85, you have 252 points to spend... (will write the rest later)","February 26, 2015","true","140.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

There are a lot of other areas that seem lazily overlooked however when it comes to the details.  RNG is a scourge in this game... and it's way too much emphasis on grinding.  Some moves/builds are completely overpowered and cheap.  Preorder exclusive access to SSJ4 Vegeta is complete horse♥♥♥♥♥hit (you cannot access him unless you preordered the game and got a passcode... a core main character in one of his coolest transformations... locked.  But they have every lousy version of Trunks in the game EXCEPT the older, way cooler and stronger future Trunks (just the younger future trunks, before training in the HBTC).  Custom saiyan characters' hair does not transform when that character goes super saiyan.  No playable android custom characters, although you can make a human character that looks like an android.  TONS of missing fighters, monsters, and transformations from the roster, compounded by ridiculous inclusions.  No Baby Vegeta-- not playable or as an enemy-- just the stupid Golden Oozaru which they call "Golden Ape", but Nuvo and Eis Shenron made it, why I don't know.  Also, GT trunks...whyy him and not all those good people?  No Dabura, none of the Kais, but Cell Jr is playable, and so is Saibaman.  Wtf?  Who made these decisions? Also... the saiyan armor constructed by Bulma during the Cell saga is inaccessible.  Wtf).\n\nLol... anyway I started writing this to update my old review and it turned into a rant.  Lol.  Honestly, you should play this if you are a DBZ/GT fan.  It's probably the best DBZ game there is.  But, I can't help but complain about these annoying oversights in the game... and I wouldn't recommend it to non-fans because of how overly grindy the game is and unrewarding due to the extremely bad RNG.","April 3, 2015","false","148.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You will love it if you are a Dragonball fan. It feels like a Dragonball game, and now you can put yourself in the game as well. Want to make your ultimate move Frieza's Death Ball but also want Goku's Kamahameha? Go for it. Want to wear Lord Slug's attire from the movie? Want to be in your underwear? (I'm judging you) Or mix and match attires from many other recognizable DB characters? Go right ahead. Want to bring Gogeta SS4 and Vegito with you into battle? WHO CAN STOP YOU? As a DB fan, I recommend this game, it's been a long time coming for a Dragonball game to arrive on PC.\n\nHowever, the game is not without it's flaws. I am not trying to bash the game, I just feel these are issues that hold the game back from being truly amazing. These are a couple of issues you should know if you are considering purchasing the game. As I love this game and I love the DB lore I will be extremely critical of this game because I want it to improve, I want what's best for it.\nThe ending itself. I will try my best not to spoil it but my god, if they could sequel/dlc bait any harder they may as well name it "DB:XV Part 1".\n\nThe depth of the game itself feels a bit shallow, the customization of your fighter seems a bit limited. With only about 10 eye types, 10 chin types, 12 hair types, 11 nose types (some are barely different). and 4 ear types It gets the job done but being a main selling point of the game it feels a bit incomplete. They couldve at least allowed you to morph your features or face a bit to give us variety. When you think about all the unique DB characters that existed and they could've copy and pasted a few of their features into character creation you feel a bit disappointed.\n\nThey could've added more moves that obviously should be in the game but aren't which points to either DLC or they completely forgot about it.\n\nSome notable characters are left out of the game/story completely, including: Zarbon, Dodoria, Dabura, Dr. Gero, All Androids except 17/18/Cell, King Cold, Super/Garlic Jr., Nail, Babidi. Master Roshi, Kami/Popo, Dende, Pikkon, Chiaotzu, King Kai, Surpreme Kai. IF YOU CAN GIVE US APPULE WHY NOT THESE GUYS? Appule couldn't handle a shot of Raspberry Schnapps. They give us Cell Jr, Appule, pallete swaps of Saibamen, Raspberry, Videl (I've never heard anyone say "Boy, I can't wait to play as Videl!") But they can't give us some characters that are cooler and more relevant to the story?\nNot including characters/storylines in movies (which they did use a few such as Broly, Beerus, & Bardock) Some of these characters not included are: Janemba, Cooler, Tapion, Chilled, Lord Slug, Turles. Bojack.\n\nYou look at Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 released in 2006 and the character roster of that game makes 2014's DB:XV almost pale in comparison. Not including the ones I named previously that appear in DBZ:BT2:  Kid Goku, Mecha Frieza, Baby Vegeta, Mercenary Tao, Super 17, Hirudegarn, Meta-Cooler, Salza, Zangya, Yajirobe, Uub, GRANDPA GOHAN, King Piccolo.\n\nThe fighting aspect of the game is fun, if you have competent people to play with. If you're planning to play with AIs especially through parts where you fight more than one person, you're going to have a bad time. Your AI allies will watch you get gangbanged helplessly while they choose to float in mid-air almost brain dead. You will find yourself yelling "GOKU CAN YOU F*CKING HELP ME YOU GODD*MN USELESS PIECE OF SH*T I HOPE YOU DIE" You will also be infuriated that your AI allies will suddenly become competent and immediately attack once you start using an ultimate move so your target goes flying from your blast and you wasted your ki energy.\n\nAs I cannot review the online aspect of the game fairly without flying into a rage that would make Angry Joe blush, I will hold off that portion of the review until they fix the servers.\n\n[reserved for online portion]\n\nThe story itself is almost criminally short. If you do not grind your level up like the game wants you to and play through the story itself in it's entirety you will be left feeling gypped like you did that one Saturday night when you found out that $10 hooker was really a cop. MANDATORY GRINDING SHOULD NOT BE USED TO MAKE YOUR GAME LONGER. It feels so short which is a shame because there was excellent animated cutscenes like it would look in a DB movie but these are far too rare. The story basically sets up about maybe at most 2 minutes of in-game cutscene before the next fight. It's a shame to see how much potential this game could've had storywise, instead of going with just the required sagas that made DBZ, they could've added movie sagas, VASTLY change the story sagas since it is about changing history, fleshing out more cutscenes. adding more characters that should've been there.

If you played the Budokai games  in High/Middle/Elementery school with your buddies you'll probably enjoy this.\n\nIt's definitely a return to form for the DBZ games and the time travelling story is presented well. I don't have much to complain about in the combat and single player department. It has a strange, almost Monster Hunter-like system where there are side missions you can do over and over and get different/better rewards each time, and you can also do these co-op online in addition to the story mode. Unlocking most characters is pretty easy and seems to be done just by progressing the story, along with kitting out your own custom character.\n\nMy complaints are pretty minor: The script lacks much originality and the acting is passable but you can tell they didn't have great lines to work with in the first place. It's also annoying that it dumps you about 35 steps away from the quest counter after a side mission and you have to walk back over to get a new one, and there is no run or dash in the hub area. You also can't preview equipment before you buy it, and the stats they give you are pretty vague but luckily don't seem like they're extremely important.\n\nFemale Buu's are way too cute!","March 2, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

Other tahn the expected oddities with specific graphics cards, it runs at 60fps with no slowdown at max settings for me. The controls are responsive and intuitive for the most part. You can do keyboard controls (I don't know if you can change them because I'm using a controller) and the controller has many different options (but no individual button changing). The default controls make sense and I haven't felt a need to change it.\n\nGraphically it looks fantastic. It looks like a great transition from the 2D anime to 3D cell shading. The voice acting is the original people from the show as far as I can tell and it's as good as it was back then.\n\nThe story is very goofy and dumb and more just an excuse to allow character creation while revisiting the big fights of the Dragonball series starting from the Saiyan saga. It also has a reimagining of various scenarios through the Parallel Quest system, which is basically just more fighting with a bit of reasoning on top of it.\n\nThe character creation is varied enough, you get slider options for height and weight (which just means how wide or narrow your character is) along with a selection of the races that have different stats and abilities. You can change the color of your hair and skin and there's a large range of colors there. You also get equipment through missions and shops and can customize your character that way too. It's limited but not terribly so, you can still get a personalized character and I haven't seen any characters similar to mine.\n\nThe online mode is extremely fun. Playing with a friend and being able to just wreck the CPU is unbelievably fun. You just do it for the Parallel Quests and can't do it for story mode, which considering the difficulty of the story missions makes you wish they had allowed it.\n\nThe game is flashy and chaotic and fun. If you liked the old Budokai games then you probably already own this. If you like fighting games and DBZ then you should get this. It's a fantastic port of the game and the online component is great when it works. Unsurprisingly, it being the launch of the game, the servers are getting hammered so there's a few problems with that at the moment but that won't matter in the future.","February 28, 2015","true","37.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Fun to play, extremely challenging (which is actually sometimes one of the most annoying parts about it), interesting story.  My only gripes are the amount of grinding you have to do to get Dragon Balls (because they're a random drop from an opponent who RANDOMLY appears), the lack of transformations (the fact that your created character can only transform into anything as the Saiyan race, and even then, you only have like 3 equippable options- where's the Super Saiyan 3 and 4 options??), and the lack of actual Dragon Ball Z characters' transformations (I was furious when I realized they had left out Frieza's second and third forms, not to mention Cell's, and Buu's absorptions).  But other than that (which I still regard as absolute horse s**t), I still recommend the game.

Other tahn the expected oddities with specific graphics cards, it runs at 60fps with no slowdown at max settings for me. The controls are responsive and intuitive for the most part. You can do keyboard controls (I don't know if you can change them because I'm using a controller) and the controller has many different options (but no individual button changing). The default controls make sense and I haven't felt a need to change it.\n\nGraphically it looks fantastic. It looks like a great transition from the 2D anime to 3D cell shading. The voice acting is the original people from the show as far as I can tell and it's as good as it was back then.\n\nThe story is very goofy and dumb and more just an excuse to allow character creation while revisiting the big fights of the Dragonball series starting from the Saiyan saga. It also has a reimagining of various scenarios through the Parallel Quest system, which is basically just more fighting with a bit of reasoning on top of it.\n\nThe character creation is varied enough, you get slider options for height and weight (which just means how wide or narrow your character is) along with a selection of the races that have different stats and abilities. You can change the color of your hair and skin and there's a large range of colors there. You also get equipment through missions and shops and can customize your character that way too. It's limited but not terribly so, you can still get a personalized character and I haven't seen any characters similar to mine.\n\nThe online mode is extremely fun. Playing with a friend and being able to just wreck the CPU is unbelievably fun. You just do it for the Parallel Quests and can't do it for story mode, which considering the difficulty of the story missions makes you wish they had allowed it.\n\nThe game is flashy and chaotic and fun. If you liked the old Budokai games then you probably already own this. If you like fighting games and DBZ then you should get this. It's a fantastic port of the game and the online component is great when it works. Unsurprisingly, it being the launch of the game, the servers are getting hammered so there's a few problems with that at the moment but that won't matter in the future.","February 28, 2015","true","37.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's the DBZ game I've wanted for almost 10 years now! So good. The story is fun and enjoyable and the multiplayer is also great. The difficulty is high enough that you won't get bored but low enough that you can still have fun while learning the game. Some of the Parallel Quests are seriously tough!\n\nOnly down-side is that the game is pretty  grindy. You will have to replay missions many times to get all of the unlockable equipment and skills. The plus side of the grindiness is that it gives the game a lot of replay value. Additionally, since you can (after you complete story mode) make new characters while maintaining your equipment, skills, and scores, it lets you level up additional custom characters without having to completely start over (although you are level 1 again so you will have to level up!)\n\nAll of your favorite characters are available as playable characters in Parallel Quests, although you'll be required to use your custom character to complete the main storymode.\n\nIf you're a fan of Dragon Ball, this is a game you cannot pass up.","July 5, 2015","true","42.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

The game has 5 races to choose from and they all have perks exculsive to them.

BUT.. are you a Dragon Ball Z fan? 'Cause if you are, that changes everything! To a DBZ fan, this game is a dream come true! Unlike pretty much.. every DBZ game ever, this game doesn't just rehash the same old sagas. This game takes place outside of time where you revisit those sagas trying to prevent some bad dudes from changing history! You get to actively take part in DBZ history fighting alongside Goku, Vegeta, Trunks and all the other DBZ legends as your own custom guy. Finally your dream of becoming a Super Saiyan can come to fruition!\n\nThe game is still not without its faults: The clothing system is pretty limiting and you might have to end up looking like a doofus to get the best stats, the combat is kinda clunky and no where near as polished a product as you'd get from a Capcom fighter, and if you wanna become the best, it does get kinda grindy at times; but to a DBZ fan, this is currently the definitive DBZ game.\n\nIf you're just a random guy, this is just another game to you, but if you've grown up on DBZ and loved its universe, you owe it to yourself to snatch this game up and fight for the future!","April 2","true","9.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If grinding levels, key items hidden behind double RNG, and repetition are for you, then I can safely recommend the title.\n\nOtherwise, Xenoverse is only for the most hardcore Dragon Ball Z fans blinded by sheer nostalgia. There's just too much BS you have to sift through to find the gold. If you are just a casual fan, either wait for a STEEP sale ($20 or less) or the inevitable Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, which ideally will correct and streamline many of this game's wrongs.\n\nI'm not really sure why the game is getting such widespread positive reviews... it's NOT a good game.  Maybe people are really excited to make their "Original Character Do Not Steal" DBZ fan creations, so excited in fact that they overlook all the game design travesties committed in Xenoverse.\n\nGo in knowing what kind of game this is.  This isn't as straight forward as the Budokai or Budokai Tenkaichi series, and there are frustrating game design elements at EVERY turn.\n\nUltimately it feels wrong to tell someone not to play this game.  My recommendation is less of a recommendation and more of a friendly warning towards Dragon Ball Xenoverse.\n\nBuy it only if you know what you're getting yourself into.","March 6, 2015","true","55.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Nah, probably not.\nThose encounters happen rarely (in my case) and if you are lucky to get a drop no one says its not one you already have.\nI am sure you can imagine how frustrating it is to try and get a full set of gear (body, pants, gloves and boots)\n\n... let the grind begin.\n\nFazit:\nEven if the game can probably be beaten in a single day if only the necessary levels are played (and grinded) it is still a fun game. Trying to max your char(lvl80), getting the skills together you want and boosting your stats with the right gear to break your opponent with powerfull attacks gives quite the satisfying feeling as long as long as you have the patience to roll the dice a mio. times.

There is even a unique story for you, the player, to have your mark on the Dragon Ball Universe, and it's actually very good! I can honestly say this is easily the best DBZ game I've ever played.\n\nI still have to complete all the bonus sagas and gain another 20 or so levels before I hit the max level, and I've already invested a lot of time into the game. This isn't even including the future content that will come from the three DLC packs, which will offer more time patrol missions (main story), parallel quests (side quests), more special moves, more playable characters, more costumes, more mentors, etc. This game is going to have an incredibly long life, as long as DIMPS continues to support it.\n\nMy only criticism is the online connectivity is incredibly unstable as of now. Sometimes it will work. Other times it won't. Luckily, you don't actually have to be on the multiplayer lobby in order to do coop and PvP with friends. That being said, it is rather frustrating to not have one of the major components of the game working as intended. Hopefully, this is something DIMPS will have sorted out sooner rather than later.\n\nIt's certainly not terrible to the point of being broken, but online stability definitely needs some attention. Other than that, if you like Dragon Ball, enjoy a fighter/MMORPG experience, and always wanted to make your own story and character in that universe, this is the game for you. Even if you aren't a fan of the show, there is A LOT of content to be found here. I highly recommend this title. Great game.","March 1, 2015","true","112.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Your character is much more customizable. It allows for great variations between characters. In addition, instead of being a Saiyan, you can choose from 4 other races, including Majiin Buu and Frieza's. Your character's stats can be altered through spending attribute points and new attacks can be bought or learned. You can even change your clothes from Pilaf's clothes to Raditz's armor.\n\nThe gameplay is great. Instead of charging Ki directly, you gain major amounts of Ki by attacking and being attacked. The key to victory is timing. You have to know when to block, attack, dodge, use a super, etc. Unlike Ultimate Tenkaichi, Supers and Specials are not cutscene triggers. Each attack is different and you will have to practice to know how to use your supers. Ki is plentiful but you'll still be set back if your Kamehameha misses.\n\nDBX also takes a new aproach to the game's story. In every DBZ game, the DBZ story is expected to be followed, leading every DBZ game to mimic the story of the show perfectly. In DBX, however, they take a clever twist on the story. Instead of following Goku's journey, you play as your customized time hero and have to travel to major battles in the story which have been altered(e.g: Ginyu switches with Vegeta instead of Goku). To repair the alterations, you must defeat enemies. People who enjoyed following the story of DBZ may want to try a different game but TBH, if you only want to follow the story, just watch the show again.\n\nIn conclusion, Dragonball Xenoverse is a great fighting game and the best DBZ game. In fact, the only obvious problems I found was that the game would occasionally crash(especially during the Cell saga) and the online servers were inactive during the time I was playing. Although, servers going down is common during releases and I don't doubt that this problem will be fixed soon.\n\nTL;DR: DBX is a great fighting game and the best DBZ game so far. The online connection may be down if you buy now so watch out!","February 28, 2015","true","23.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Abilities and items usually aren't just handed to you, you actually have to work to get them. All in all, I think it's a great game.\n\nBUT... as of March 1st, 2015, the servers make the game almost unplayable. Sometimes they are perfect and other times you can't even log in. I'm sure this will be fixed in the future and because it's more of a casual game it doesn't bother me TOO much. So I would say don't listen too much to the negative reviews that are coming out at the moment.

Where should I start?\nThis will be a honest review and definitely not one of those fanboy or hype reviews.\nNo, also no Kuririn died review...\n\nWhen this game was announced and it was hyped as hell I actually got interested into it.\nEspecially after all the bad DBZ games that have been made. Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was the last good for me and is still the best of all DBZ games of all time. I dont get it why they dont make a new Budokai Tenkaichi like 3. This would be amazing and a must buy for me. Just make it Namco. Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or whatever you have in mind. Maybe just make a cheap BT3 Remake with some new characters and Sagas like Golden Frieza. I dont even need a completely new developed game. Also do it for PC though!\n\nWell, after that was said it should be obvious that I didnt really enjoy Xenoverse.\nYeah, I did not. It was one of the better DBZ games but none which I would like. Maybe I expected it too much to be like Budokai Tenkaichi, because its not at all like Budokai Tenkaichi. For me the gameplay feels boring. Its actually like a MMORPG. And since I dont like MMORPGs this game falls flat for me. People who like MMORPGs and DBZ will probably have the time of their life. I dont. The main story is actually well made! How it was implemented NOT. In fact you had to level up your character to do the Story. Also the difficulty is sometimes too easy and sometimes too high. The devs werent really able to make something between. Thats the burden of a MMORPG I guess. Also for me nearly all fighters played the same. There was nothing really unique to them. Beside that their super attacks were extremely boring made. Thats what I love Budokai Tenkaichi for. Every player feels unique especially with all their transformations and super attracks. It was interesting though to create your own fighter. This was one of the, for me, very few good aspects of the game. Also for some reason the armor and clothing aspect is stupid because it gives you extra stats. Like that everybody is forced to use something specific and not just what he or she likes.\n\nThe PC Version is quite good, not perfect though. The fact that any sort of Anti Aliasing is absent is horrible because the game just screams for Anti Aliasing. There is a way to force it over Nvidia Inspector with a Anti Aliasing "hack". AMD users have bad luck though and have to live with horrible FXAA. Also what annoyed me to hell was the waiting times to connect to the Xenoverse server, even if you just wanted to play Singleplayer. This is nearly impossible by the way...\nThe devs also released several DLC packs for the movies and DB GT and stuff. Those are totally overpriced though and should have been in the game for free. Money milking at its finest. To this comes a Pre Order exclusive character. There is no other way to get this character without Pre Order. And another horrible implementation... To this comes now the dropped support from the devs. Probably they are doing Xenoverse 2 which will just be like the first. Sadly it got a trend to make always the same game with maybe a different story but the rest is the same. Naruto is one of the glory examples of this. Those games sadly developed into the same ♥♥♥♥ that CoD is nowadays. Always the same boring crap filled with DLCs and after a few months support is dead and the next is on the line. People still buy it though. Which I will never understand. People will buy it anyway and even Pre Order to get unique characters. I will definitely not buy Xenoverse 2 and rather wait for a new Budokai Tenkaichi sort of game, if we will ever get one again...\n\nPositive:\n- Dragon Ball\n- Good soundtrack including music from the original series\n- Many playable characters including latest ones from the movies\n- Interesting way to create an own character\n- Great art design\n- Nice designed worlds\n- Also available for PC, port is good, not perfect\n\nNegative:\n- Too much MMORPG, not enough Dragon Ball\n- Characters all feel and play the same\n- Difficulty not balanced\n- Clothing and armors give extra stats...\n- Proper Anti Aliasing is missing\n- Long connection times for the server\n- DLC Milking\n- Dropped support\n- Pre Order exclusive DLC\n- Overhyped? I would say yes.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nFor me this game is not what I hoped for and also not what hits my taste. Since I do not count my own preferences into reviews I totally skip this aspect of it. I stopped to play it quite fast actually. A MMORPG fan maybe will have a nice time with it. But the game is riddled with questionable design choices. Also the developers dropped any sort of support and DLC money milking is present. Including a unique Pre Order character. I can not recommend a game like that. Seriously. Rather save up your money and invest it into a hopefully better Dragon Ball game but if we have bad luck we will just get Xenoverse 2...","March 21","false","7.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/323470/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This game could have been far greater than it actually is. I recommend to DBZ fans (as any hardcore fan can make it through any kind of related game), but as for players looking for a new detailed ground-breaking fighter, this simply isn't it. Get ready for a grind ladies and gents and get ready to break your X and Y buttons from repetitive mashing. In short, I like the game but it's hard to recommend for this price range.\n\nIt's well done, but if feels like it could have been done so much better. The general Toki Toki City area you get to "freeroam" is slow paced at most, and for some reviewers, a shot in the dark and grind to do the next mission. I find simply moving about the level is a nuisance at most. Why not allow for flying? You have great characters and such a rich ability range to incorporate into the game, in and out of fighting! For something that could be so good, it's simply decent. Not only that, half the stations you go to are oddly "closed" or unable to process your request. When they do work though, online parrallel universe fights with other players add some replayability to the game.\n\nThere are two basic modes to the game : freemode and fight mode. In free roaming mode, you essentially get to run around and either shop (for new skills, items, or clothing), talk, upgrade and change your personal stats, or choose between different game modes from either the story line or the online/offline parrallel universe modes (which are comparable to single matches). In fight mode, you get to do the juicy stuff like fly around and throw wild energy balls everywhere.\n\nThe story character creator is satisfactory, while the story itself is well integrated into the series. Maybe it's because I chose Namekian that I'm limited in options, it doesn't seem otherwise there is much to choose from in variety. Either way, the story line is a good addition to re-visiting old DB episodes. Gameplay itself isn't too shabby, but can sometimes seem all over the place. Flying is slightly choppy and isn't as smooth as it could be. The fighting seems nominal once you get how the teleportation and fighting system work, as well as the stamina. There is a lot of tutorials that slowly creep up on you, rush through them and it can be a rough play through. To me personally it seems at times random combo's and teleportation from side to side happen. In all honesty, I'd like to be in full control if I can dodge VIA teleporting or teleport to bounce the opponent to the other side of the map. The fighting has it's ups and downs, but when buttons start matching up to what your character is doing, there is a nice flow to what your watching in addition to being in control of. What was disappointing to me was there was no real feel of impact when you sent an opponent flying into the ground (there is an animation for it). Granted, there is some landscape that can be broken but it feels like crumping cardboard paper toghether, then it quickly unraveling back into perfect shape. The damage animations (not effects) are nice as breaking a tree with your opponents back but that permanent damage isn't there.\n\nVisuals are nice and the custom character looks really good in cut-scenes. The fighting sounds seem on par, but addition of a few more sounds (especially collisions) would have enriched the auditory experience. What really drives me nuts is the music in the free roam. If being on repeat isn't bad enough, get ready to go nuts hearing the same song over and over. They have also incorporated built in phrases and actions the player can perform (such as waving or sitting). Credit definitely has to be given to the level creators as the places you can fight are all in the DB saga. Some locations you get to fight in are Kami's lookout, planet Namek, different places on Earth and even a stage outside of the Earth.\n\nThis game is good, but no where near worth it's stated price. I'm a huge DBZ fan and for what it's worth, I wish they gave a little more into the game. I like it because it's something I can relate to. Will you like it based on it's gaming aspect, or it's content? I have to give the game credit though for trying to give the player more than a story to play with. WIthin TokiToki city, you may run into a Ginyu force member or even Gohan asking you for help (with a sidequest). You can also ask different characters within game (like Vegeta or Piccolo in TokiToki city) to be your trainer. That voice will follow you to every debrief after every quest.\n\nFor future DBZ's give some freedom for the player to use the specials whenever, or at least have the choice to fly or walk in free roam. The incorporation of actions such as waving or squatting added a bit of depth to the open world. That I definitely liked and would like to see that again. Also, the attacks were well done (minus button mashing X and Y at times) but I feel there needs to be improvement for the vanishing system. Dodging consist of jumping in the air while doing a front flip, which is fine, but the actual trait of disappearing and ending up behind an enemy is the whole fun of the Dragon Ball universe! I'd like to be able to vanish half the map for half or more of my stamina, but the closer I am, let me jump around my enemy for a bit!\n\nIf this game was $15-20 I would recommend it, as of now though, no. To true Dragon Ball fans : I think you will enjoy the game and play a decent chunk of it. You may find the money's worth.\n\nRating : 7.35/10\n\nPS - I think the DLC's are overpriced.\n\nScreenShots :\nWhy the game deserves a decent rating\n\nCustom character in scenematic\n\nGraphic quality of scenes\n\nYou can't fly in free roam, but you can fly in parrellel missions (or fights). Even then, feels sort of stiff, even when landing\n\nHey cool they incorporated damage...\n\n...or I guess they didn't\n\nCustomizing skill sets\n\nUsing one of the elevated special attacks\n\n(Potential spoiler) Here is a level where combatants are fighting in space\n\nMy character has the sharpest sun glasses in the game\n\nYou can dance, pose, sit, and even squat in game","June 21, 2015","false","20.8"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

(You may have up to 7 presets for easy swapping on character select screen.)\n\n-Play solo or with others. (You must play alone 100% til you clear the beginning tutorial sections.)\n\n-Get destroyed by multiple opponents....over and over again!\n\n*-*-*-*-*\nInfo:\n\nI saw the Credits after a bit of suffering from some difficult adversaries.  I got to the "end" by about level 40 (It depends on how you play).  It was an interesting journey which made me definitely change my fighting style every so often.  But there are still plenty more quests to do and levels to gain.\n\n*-*-*-*-*\nReview:\n\n-Playstyle: Very fast paced, sometimes spam-like, but enjoyable.\n\n-Graphics: Simple and pleasant. Tends to be bright like anime (obviously).\n\n-Controls: Fairly decent. Using a controller makes my experience better for such a game.\n--Camera can get awkward depending on how close a wall section is to your character.\n\n-Replayability: Varied enough. Multiple races with different bonuses.  Different fighting styles / skills also add a large difference in how a battle is approached.\n\n-Entertainment Value:  Great for Dragonball Fans. Very good for fighting genre lovers.  But it can easily get boring if you tend to lose interest in battling against AI and/or other players over and over again.  Though you do have the option to choose if you want to be alone or not.\n\n-Multiplayer: I cannot comment much on this as I have yet to play with others. But I noticed there might be an NPC that allows you to play local co-op (Probably Versus) if you have more than one controller.  So I just think that is a very nice feature to have and mention.\n\n*-*-*-*-*\nConclusion:\n\nIf you don't have a crazy lust for this game at the moment like I did, then just wait for a discount price. You won't be missing that much.\n\nIf your mind is bent on it, you love Dragonball / Z / GT / etc, like to play fighting games, just get it!  But the DLC doesn't seem worth it in my opinion for the content. (No, I did not purchase the DLC.)","April 2, 2015","true","109.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't stand when people are complaining about the server issues. Ever since they fixed issue about a few days ago, I have NEVER been kicked out of the server. During the launch date, the server were not stable and had gliches. After a few quick fixes, the server is good and running on my end. I played for 4 hours straight and left the game running for 20 minutes while having lunch and still had a strong server connection.\n\nAlso, for any complaining about the story, the game wasn't supposed to be about giving the entire story like in previous games where you played through the whole story over and over again. In this game, it concentrates on the "What If" scenarios and alternative endings. In a pevious review, I read that someone was complaining about how your character does not interact with the storyline and you simply disappear. I confidently say that is not the case with this game. For example, when you are facing off against the head boss, Goku appears and helps you to beat him. The dialoge is all there and at the very end, Goku even offered to fight you. Like seriously. There are tons of interactions, including with Trunks.\n\nFinally, I cannot (and I mean CANNOT) stand anyone who complains about the online fighting mode. People complain about how it is unfair to versus against people who are higher leveled than you and stuff like that. Seriously...if you are entering an online battle and you are level 30, you might as well quit now. Wait until you beat the entire storyline and complete a decent amount of the time quests. Also, make sure you train with many of the masters (like Andriod 18, Cell, Vegeta, and so on) in DBZ and master them to unlock very good moves. This is simple. Just be patient and wait until you are strong enough (like around level 55 or above) before even considering playing online. Unless you and a friend are just having a friendly, non-competitive fight.\n\nMy Rating: 9/10","March 13, 2015","true","97.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fighting side of the game is a lot of fun, and controls very well compared to older DB-series fighting games.  The movements are fluid and attacks are aesthetically pleasing.  There is enough variety in creating your skill-sets to keep the combat interesting and unique.\n\nHowever, the rest of the game has it's issues.  The scripting/acting in the story leaves much to be desired. Cut-scenes are laden with bugs and visual glitches.\n\nSingle-player (offline) quests run smooth enough, and don't have the netcode issues plaguing the online versions of the same quests.  Oftentimes you'll find yourself stuck in a quest, waiting for the timer to run out because an NPC failed to spawn.  Other times, your character will be stuck in-place, unable to assist your teammates.  This can happen even when it looks like everyone's latency is acceptable.  Yet, it happens far too often.\n\nDrop-rates on items and skills are a mixed bag.  Some people farm entire days to finally get something to drop, while others will get it on the first try.  There's a lot of RNG praying involved.  Would it not be better to put the drops on the stores after you Z-rank a mission, perhaps?\n\nThe "secret" goals on missions keep it fun, but it's difficult to coordinate with online players without using voice chat.  This is an online game - Why not open up typed chat, rather than using pre-scripted chat options?\n\nThe interface in the hub city could use some work.  But once you find where all the menu options are, it tends to flow.\n\nPvP is unbalanced, and there are cheaters taking advantage of bugs that make them nigh unbeatable.  There is no in-game report function.\n\nI find the experience is far better playing offline until the netcode issues are resolved.\n\nIf you're a fan of the DB series, it's probably worth playing when it goes on sale.  The character variety and fun combat will keep you entertained for many hours.  But if you're not into the series, it's probably not worth your money as a fighting game.","March 23, 2015","true","28.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I am really enjoying it.\n\nThe multiplayer gameplay is not what I was thinking by the way. I was thinking this game will be like MMORPG where you can see all the other players walking and talking with others etc and you walking around a world, etc. Instead, the game seems to be only in a limited location where you can buy items, enter to missions, etc, and one of the options is to do some multiplayer missions, where you need to wait for other players to join to a fight like any of the previous DB games.\n\nBut aside from my missunderstanding about how the game will be, I like the way the game is.\n\nWhat I do not like is the multiplayer part due to you need to wait for other players, while is MMORPG you chat directly with the people and you know you are with people there to do the mission, instead of having to wait so long for someone that will probably never come, and you unable to know that, because you see no one. The game shows other player characters in the scenario, but they are just static, and you can pay them to join to you team, but I think those ones will be just the characters to be playing with Artificial Inteligence on your offline battles.\n\nSo, the game is good to be played in single player, and once you finish the history, you can try doing online battles, but if trying to gain experience from online battles, that will just delay you a lot.","February 26, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great Story! but much needs to be improved. i am neither kami or piccolo z soul makes fighting in ranked almost impossible to end before time runs out, since all the player has to do is run and heal back up. there are already  hackers and most the time you will know, when they start to do things like never run out of stamina or ki... or recover health twice as fast as the z soul i am neither kami or piccolo. or even use DLC characters or skills not suitable towards race. finding someone to play aginst online either takes a while or is not an option. maybe its just me but i can almost never find anyone to play with. i have to create a room and wait for someone to join to fight online.. but besides these problems, the story mode is hella challanging when you are 1st starting off. the character creation is great but i find a lack of armor to fit ANY build. for example, if i want to make a character who is strong in melee and ki supers. there is no clothing/armor that would suit that build type. so you are pretty much forced into the catagory of range or melee beacuse the clothing/armor normally takes from one stat to give into another. so my ki supers or basic attacks get lowered while the other is raised. so a balanced build isnt really possible clothing wise. but all in all this game is great and i still find enjoyment within the game. i just wish clothes didnt give any stats cuz now people will go with what gives the best stats over how they look ending up with a bunch of look alike players.","March 5, 2015","true","104.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As with all Dragon Ball games this one is best reserved for fans of the series. It's less of a traditional fighting game and more of a brawler with fighting game inspired themes. The gameplay regardless is solid and responsive. The A.I. does seem to have a few advantages over the player in single combat, being able to react and counter more quickly than human players are able even with the best of reflexes, but it forces the difficulty factor up a notch.\n\nThere is a learning curb to this game, and no luxury of a difficulty mode to chose from. Getting stronger will help with those super tough fights, which is paramount to the Dragon Ball theme. Some seem to have it better than others. I was able to plow through the story and mission modes with relative ease, encountering few road blocks on the way, whereas my friend spent a good 2 hours trying to kill Saibamen and failing... miserably.\n\nMost everyone you'd care to see in a Dragon Ball Z game is in the roster, with few overlaps in "Form based" characters. The custom characters hold well to Akira Toriama's style and overall the game looks well polished. Add in the expansive and engaging gameplay with the story it's a great game. There are some notable bugs, but nothing that can't be patched in the future.\n\nAt present the games servers are marred with connectivity issues. The most negative thing I can say about the game is the programers made a huge error in the way the game format is meant to run as an MMO. To even log in you have to make an initial connection to the "Xenoverse server" which is glitchy to the max. If you're lucky you'll make it to the character select screen. From there you're lucky if you can make it into the actual game to play a mission or two before losing connection to the server and rolling the dice to see if you can get back in again. Namco games has made it public they're aware of this issue but one week since release we've yet to see any fixes yet.\n\nFor now you're best off stowing your money towards something until they fix the connection issues and make the game more stable. There is a way I discovered to get an uninterupted session but it requires a lot of luck, and doesnt persist through changing characters. Definatly keep an eye out for the fixes though and be ready to dive in. There will be many hours of fun awaiting you.","March 6, 2015","true","154.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a Dragon Ball fan at all this game is a must own.\n\nPros:\n- Character customization is nothing short of spectacular. Pretty much any combination of styles or any race you want to be from the series is here and it's fun to customize your character just the way you want them.\n- Character progression is great. Customization doesn't stop at just appearances you get to control the type of fighter you want and customize the move set to fit your play style.\n- Fighting mechanics are easy to pick up and learn but at the same time have an incredibly frenetic pace that is a bit hard to master which makes for just the right amount of difficulty in my opinion.\n- New and interesting story that isn't just a bland rehash of the same plot we've seen countless times.\n- Tons of content and  missions to keep you playing for hours.\n\nCons\n- Team mate AI is absolutely atrocious. Sometimes so much so that some battles come down to luck instead of skill. NPCs have two different modes, one is gang bang your opponent to the point where you can't get a hit in edge wise and the other is to stand around like faceless blithering idiots in a Bruce Lee movie waiting for their turn to get their face smashed in by the enemy. Either way they could use some tweaking.\n- Hit detection can seem a bit unresponsive and wonky. It's not HUGELY noticeable but it's there.\n- Shady day one DLC practices. I don't like character DLCs, I think that's essentially piecing out the game for money and it's wrong.\n\nOverall this is the kind of fighting game the franchise has needed for a long time. The core fight mechanics are great. It's got a great hook with the character customization, letting fans create their own hero which is something touched upon just barely in previous DBZ games. It's got a great story that breathes new life into the otherwise stagnant and repetitive narrative we've seen from these games in the past. (I love the DBZ story as much as anyone BUT there's only so many times I can play a game with the same story).  You'll spend hours customizing your character, unlocking new moves, increasing your characters strength and just all around enjoying the new story and atmosphere the game has to offer.","February 27, 2015","true","66.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only that, but I've had a chance to play some Dragon Ball console games like Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Budokai 3, Raging Blast 2- and I believe that Dragon Ball: Xenoverse is the best Dragon Ball game up to date. The combat is extremly intuitive while remaining very challenging at the same time. I'd say that 50% of Xenoverse is a fighting game, the other 50% is like a typical MMOrpg game. We level up, distribute our skill points, learn new techniques and attacks. I just wish there was more options to choose from when creating our own character- like hairstyle, eyes, and so on. But maybe I'm just needy. I also wish there were more characters in the game roster... They've missed out some- like Zarbon, Dodoria, Android 16, Dabura, and few more. Still, the game is great and I'd recommend it to every Dragon Ball fan.","February 27, 2015","true","92.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Clothing and powers are solid, camera can be touchy but otherwise the fighting is fluid and interesting.\n\nNEGATIVES -\nI'm playing a female character. Why are you calling me a dude? I've been staring at my ♥♥♥ for like 13 hours, dude. Is there something I need to know?\n\nThe game has issues but its still extremely enjoyable. The biggest problems are graphical in nature. The textures not put together and checked thoroughly enough and a lack of caring for matching up mouth movements, verifying that cutscene elements don't conflict.. It happens, its kind of a gimme.\n\nThe other thing is the character roster setup. Kind of a step back from earlier games who had the formula perfect. Lots of overlap but they don't condense the form to core characters. Not ALWAYS, at least. Frieza takes up 3 slots when, in theory, he should only take up one and have form escalations.\n\nThe NPCs are pretty poor as well. Using SSJ2 Goku, SSJ1 Future Trunks but they never use their form changes, they simply rely on their most basic super attacks and fail to coordinate or think past that. It can be a bit frustrating as you are pulling all the weight in fights.\n\nIf any of this is fixed along the way, I'll update the review accordingly. Otherwise its a very solid game, engaging and had me on it first day for 13 hours. This is a feat that is rarely ever accomplished with me as I have vidya ADD.\n\nLong story short: Should you play this game? Yeah, bruh.","February 26, 2015","true","50.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHellspawnHero/recommended/323470/","TheHellspawnHero","The Hellspawn Hero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHellspawnHero/","53 products in account","Dragon Ball Xenoverse is not a perfect game, but it's probably the best Dragon Ball Z game we've got right now.\n\nThe combat is simple, and fairly easy to learn. Each button corrosponds to a single action (light attacks, heavy attacks, ki blasts, etc) with little to no need to string together complex button presses or move the control stick around to do combos, sort of like a hack-and-slash game. You've also got Special moves (all of which cost 100 Ki) you can do using the same buttons while holding down the left trigger, and a couple Ultimate skills (costs 300 Ki) and an Evasive skill (costs 300 Stamina) that can be used the same way, just while holding down both triggers. Over all, combat is simple and easy to learn, but still manages to be fun, especially when it comes to mix-and-matching skills on your characters to see what works well together.\n\nThe story isn't too special, but in a way, it also kind of is. Most Dragon Ball games have us play through the same story that we all know and love, maybe with a few details changed around. But overall, it's still usually the same story. This gamedoesn't quite do that: Instead, Dragon Ball Xenoverse's story sort of picks up important things from the now-defuct Dragon Ball Online, an MMO with a lot of original ideas that didn't get to last long enough to see them properly executed. The Time Patrol returns, and your character is one of them, having been summoned by Trunk's wish on the Dragon Balls for a warrior who can help him fix up the timeline. Yes, you're exploring the story of DBZ... sort of, but the point this time is that critical moments in the story have been changed, and your job is to fix these continuity errors by correcting the outcome of battles that Towa and Mira have used their magic to change. An interesting twist that allows for newer elements without leaving the classic characters and settings behind.\n\nEveryone gets to create their own original character for the game to use as their avatar for the HUB world and story quests, and there's a pretty good amount of customizability for your character. There are a number of races, all with their own distinct strengths, and even a character's sex makes a small difference, encouraging the player to make multiple characters to try out all the different combinations. Your character can also equip virtually every technique and article of clothing you could think of. Want to be able to use Hercule's Dynamite Kick and Freiza's Death Beam at the same time? You can do that. As long as you're willing to work for it, you can get it for your character, and there are very few limits as to what kind of character can equip what kind of skill. Your imagination really is king, here.\n\n... Or at least it would be, if not for one little factor: The RNG. There's a large random factor to a few things in the game (NPC location, drop rates for skills and equipment, etc.) in the game, and it's far from generous. The drop rates in this game are quite stingy, and the missions are typically fairly long unless you are grossly over-leveled, so going through a 5-to-15 minute quest, only to not get anything out of it, can be annoying, especially if it happens multiple times in a row. Sadly, the rank you score on a mission doesn't really seem to affect drop rates, only how much EXP you get. Thankfully, EXP gains are pretty generous, especially if you rank high on a mission, so leveling up is fairly quick. You're likely to level up ever other mission you do, as long as its level and yours match up evenly enough. Each mission also has multiple "stages" to it that can be unlocked if you complete certain tasks within the mission in a specific way. However, these tasks aren't made clear to the player, and even if the player does everything right, it's still random as to whether or not the game thinks it counts, meaning you can do everything perfectly as the game wants you to, and still not get an Ultimate Finish based purely on luck.\n\nMy opinion on the audio is... complicated. The voice acting is generally good, but there are enough lines that have been mistranslated, or have the wrong audio play every time the line comes up, that the issue can't be ignored. Cutscenes are also much louder than gameplay, which, save for the sound effect (which are way too loud by default), is fairly quiet. The game also has a tendency to stop the battle music if you back off from an enemy for more than 4 seconds, which kind of ruins the moment, even if you're still fighting them and are just trying to get some distance.\n\nBack to gameplay issues again, the enemy AI has a tendency to outright cheat (knocking you out of moves that have full super armor with a single Ki blast, any character who goes Super Saiyan stays Super Saiyan, dodging attacks and grabs that clearly connect with them, etc.), while your partner AI is generally dumber than a sack of rocks. Sometimes, they're outright liabilities. If you can, try to do Parallel Quests with friends; You get more competent partners, and it's more fun than playing alone! Everyone wins!... as long as there isn't a connection issue. Then things might get a bit laggy, or someone may have to disconnect.\n\nUltimately, Dragon Ball Xenoverse is a game that does well when it comes to its core concepts and mechanics, but little things like issues with the AI, the RNG being a bigger deciding factor than it needs to be, and the occasional connection problem with the server, prevent it from being as good as it could be. And these are all things that could be fixed with some patches fairly easily. It's a good game that gets held down by small problems that pop up often enough to prevent it from reaching its full potential.\n\ntl;dr: If you're a fan of Dragon Ball Z, you'll probably love this game, but may be frustred by its small problems and how much presence they have. Still, I would recommend this game, because the good really does outweigh the bad.","April 7, 2015","true","289.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Inventive story, great visuals and lots of easter eggs all over the place. The combat feels as true to the source material that you could probably get and the created character campaign portion is inventive (written by Toriyama, expect nothing less than great). The new MMO-esque social hub has replaced a traditional menu system and I can understand how it can bother someone who doesn't want to run for 10 seconds to get to a certain menu but I appreciate what they've done with it. Ultimately it all helps add to the emersion into the DBZ universe and make you feel like a character in the series and not just a videogame player. It might get more annoying later, but for now I like it. But that is not the game...that's just a social system and the game is awesome. I looked at most of the poor reviews and none of them really gave any valid reasons for not recommending this game. People whined about the game having an MMO hub world as a menu, or that the game was too hard. Or that they didn't understand where to go. ♥♥♥♥ing read the text instead of button mashing through the tutorial and then writing a poor review because you're too impatient to sit through 5 minutes of guidance. The controls are just fine, you can't custom edit the control scheme but the defaults are just fine as is. There is no problem with the target lock system if you know what you're doing and don't hit the wrong commands to switch targets. This is a DBZ fan's wet dream and it's on the mother♥♥♥♥ing PC.\n\nCons- This was developed primarily for consoles so the social functionality you would expect for a PC title just isn't there. For example there is no textual chat bar anywhere, the most you can do is edit preset responses, It's easy to play wioth friends if you have them on Steam but difficult to link up with those that are not on your Steam friend list. Also, because this game has to cater to last gen consoles there are a lot of things that are limited such as loading screens between the 3 areas of Toki Toki city (the social hub world) and the destruction of environment animations disappear shortly after destruction. However the game still looks beautiful. Hopefully the next installment to this game will not be built for last gen consoles and these issues would quickly dissappear.\n\n9/10","February 27, 2015","true","62.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if you grew up screaming alongside Goku and friends, It's worth it big time!!!\n\nHundreds of different combat abilities, items, costumes, facial/body customizations. The choice of Buu-race, Human, Saiyan, Namekian and Frieza-race. Tons of nostalgic memories and moments from Dragon Ball Z. This rattles off just a little of Dragon Ball Xenoverse's offerings.\n\nThe game starts off somewhat slow, yet entertaining. Other fans like myself will find themselves staring in awe at the intro and several cutscenes made to look much like the episodes. The difficulty ramps up quick, but whilst hunting for items in Parrallel Quests, you level up and gain enough ability to overcome the difficulty relatively easily.\n\nWhilst it is still early days, and the game loses connection to Xenoverse's servers on a rather regular occasion, it is a very solidly built game.\n\nI would like to see the ability for two people to play with controllers, on the one PC, and work through the game together... But that's probably being a bit picky.\n\n\nWorth the money? If you are a die hard fan YES!\n...If not, I suggest waiting for a sale to bring it around the $40USD mark. Feels more reasonable if I wasn't such a DB fanboy.","February 28, 2015","true","61.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

That is good unless you got one teammember that goes afk and does nothing when you and your other team mate go down. you will have to restart the game to be able to play another game again. witch also means reconecting to the server (good luck). also there seems to be a bug in multiplayer quest. you can attach a character but deal no damage to him/her. also that character will not move and then usually after a while all the damage gets dealt  and the character is all of a sudden K.O. that all said when it does work it is amazing not just the combat but also interacting with the other playes in Tokitoki city.

This doesn't ruin the story but it does have a strange effect to it.\n\nGraphics 7/10\nBLOOMBLOOMBLOOMBLOOM.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHellspawnHero/recommended/323470/","TheHellspawnHero","The Hellspawn Hero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHellspawnHero/","53 products in account","Dragon Ball Xenoverse is not a perfect game, but it's probably the best Dragon Ball Z game we've got right now.\n\nThe combat is simple, and fairly easy to learn. Each button corrosponds to a single action (light attacks, heavy attacks, ki blasts, etc) with little to no need to string together complex button presses or move the control stick around to do combos, sort of like a hack-and-slash game. You've also got Special moves (all of which cost 100 Ki) you can do using the same buttons while holding down the left trigger, and a couple Ultimate skills (costs 300 Ki) and an Evasive skill (costs 300 Stamina) that can be used the same way, just while holding down both triggers. Over all, combat is simple and easy to learn, but still manages to be fun, especially when it comes to mix-and-matching skills on your characters to see what works well together.\n\nThe story isn't too special, but in a way, it also kind of is. Most Dragon Ball games have us play through the same story that we all know and love, maybe with a few details changed around. But overall, it's still usually the same story. This gamedoesn't quite do that: Instead, Dragon Ball Xenoverse's story sort of picks up important things from the now-defuct Dragon Ball Online, an MMO with a lot of original ideas that didn't get to last long enough to see them properly executed. The Time Patrol returns, and your character is one of them, having been summoned by Trunk's wish on the Dragon Balls for a warrior who can help him fix up the timeline. Yes, you're exploring the story of DBZ... sort of, but the point this time is that critical moments in the story have been changed, and your job is to fix these continuity errors by correcting the outcome of battles that Towa and Mira have used their magic to change. An interesting twist that allows for newer elements without leaving the classic characters and settings behind.\n\nEveryone gets to create their own original character for the game to use as their avatar for the HUB world and story quests, and there's a pretty good amount of customizability for your character. There are a number of races, all with their own distinct strengths, and even a character's sex makes a small difference, encouraging the player to make multiple characters to try out all the different combinations. Your character can also equip virtually every technique and article of clothing you could think of. Want to be able to use Hercule's Dynamite Kick and Freiza's Death Beam at the same time? You can do that. As long as you're willing to work for it, you can get it for your character, and there are very few limits as to what kind of character can equip what kind of skill. Your imagination really is king, here.\n\n... Or at least it would be, if not for one little factor: The RNG. There's a large random factor to a few things in the game (NPC location, drop rates for skills and equipment, etc.) in the game, and it's far from generous. The drop rates in this game are quite stingy, and the missions are typically fairly long unless you are grossly over-leveled, so going through a 5-to-15 minute quest, only to not get anything out of it, can be annoying, especially if it happens multiple times in a row. Sadly, the rank you score on a mission doesn't really seem to affect drop rates, only how much EXP you get. Thankfully, EXP gains are pretty generous, especially if you rank high on a mission, so leveling up is fairly quick. You're likely to level up ever other mission you do, as long as its level and yours match up evenly enough. Each mission also has multiple "stages" to it that can be unlocked if you complete certain tasks within the mission in a specific way. However, these tasks aren't made clear to the player, and even if the player does everything right, it's still random as to whether or not the game thinks it counts, meaning you can do everything perfectly as the game wants you to, and still not get an Ultimate Finish based purely on luck.\n\nMy opinion on the audio is... complicated. The voice acting is generally good, but there are enough lines that have been mistranslated, or have the wrong audio play every time the line comes up, that the issue can't be ignored. Cutscenes are also much louder than gameplay, which, save for the sound effect (which are way too loud by default), is fairly quiet. The game also has a tendency to stop the battle music if you back off from an enemy for more than 4 seconds, which kind of ruins the moment, even if you're still fighting them and are just trying to get some distance.\n\nBack to gameplay issues again, the enemy AI has a tendency to outright cheat (knocking you out of moves that have full super armor with a single Ki blast, any character who goes Super Saiyan stays Super Saiyan, dodging attacks and grabs that clearly connect with them, etc.), while your partner AI is generally dumber than a sack of rocks. Sometimes, they're outright liabilities. If you can, try to do Parallel Quests with friends; You get more competent partners, and it's more fun than playing alone! Everyone wins!... as long as there isn't a connection issue. Then things might get a bit laggy, or someone may have to disconnect.\n\nUltimately, Dragon Ball Xenoverse is a game that does well when it comes to its core concepts and mechanics, but little things like issues with the AI, the RNG being a bigger deciding factor than it needs to be, and the occasional connection problem with the server, prevent it from being as good as it could be. And these are all things that could be fixed with some patches fairly easily. It's a good game that gets held down by small problems that pop up often enough to prevent it from reaching its full potential.\n\ntl;dr: If you're a fan of Dragon Ball Z, you'll probably love this game, but may be frustred by its small problems and how much presence they have. Still, I would recommend this game, because the good really does outweigh the bad.","April 7, 2015","true","289.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

The open world is pretty useless.. the dialog is weird & awkward.\n\nIn the beginning, it is difficult to figure out what you're supposed to do. There's a map you can pull up but there's nothing to indicate where to go or who to talk to.\n\nThere's an online mode.. but you can't use it until you make progress in the story.\n\nFighting is as you'd expect.. button mashy. Character graphics & sound are ok.\n\nBeing a long-time DBZ fan, I do enjoy the opportunity to see & interact with the characters.. but the gameplay itself is pretty bad.\n\nAfter playing for awhile:\nThe gameplay does get a little better & the story is actually better than expected. The button mashy feeling goes away somewhat as you gain more abilities & actually have to use some strategic thinking.. but in the end you've only got 8 move slots to use.\n\nThere are a few items to choose from at this point but they are all pretty generic fan-service items. Hopefully there are plans to add to the current inventory.\n\nA lot of the rarer items are obtained by grinding "parallel quests".. which are just basic battles with a few objectives that you must meet. There's a ranking system to determine how well you did, but how they sum up the scoring is a mystery.\n\nTraining under a master is pretty cool as you get to hear their voice when you fail or succeed to encourage you or call you a wreck (Vegeta)","February 27, 2015","true","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

If you're a Dragon Ball fan at all this game is a must own.\n\nPros:\n- Character customization is nothing short of spectacular. Pretty much any combination of styles or any race you want to be from the series is here and it's fun to customize your character just the way you want them.\n- Character progression is great. Customization doesn't stop at just appearances you get to control the type of fighter you want and customize the move set to fit your play style.\n- Fighting mechanics are easy to pick up and learn but at the same time have an incredibly frenetic pace that is a bit hard to master which makes for just the right amount of difficulty in my opinion.\n- New and interesting story that isn't just a bland rehash of the same plot we've seen countless times.\n- Tons of content and  missions to keep you playing for hours.\n\nCons\n- Team mate AI is absolutely atrocious. Sometimes so much so that some battles come down to luck instead of skill. NPCs have two different modes, one is gang bang your opponent to the point where you can't get a hit in edge wise and the other is to stand around like faceless blithering idiots in a Bruce Lee movie waiting for their turn to get their face smashed in by the enemy. Either way they could use some tweaking.\n- Hit detection can seem a bit unresponsive and wonky. It's not HUGELY noticeable but it's there.\n- Shady day one DLC practices. I don't like character DLCs, I think that's essentially piecing out the game for money and it's wrong.\n\nOverall this is the kind of fighting game the franchise has needed for a long time. The core fight mechanics are great. It's got a great hook with the character customization, letting fans create their own hero which is something touched upon just barely in previous DBZ games. It's got a great story that breathes new life into the otherwise stagnant and repetitive narrative we've seen from these games in the past. (I love the DBZ story as much as anyone BUT there's only so many times I can play a game with the same story).  You'll spend hours customizing your character, unlocking new moves, increasing your characters strength and just all around enjoying the new story and atmosphere the game has to offer.","February 27, 2015","true","66.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only that, but I've had a chance to play some Dragon Ball console games like Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Budokai 3, Raging Blast 2- and I believe that Dragon Ball: Xenoverse is the best Dragon Ball game up to date. The combat is extremly intuitive while remaining very challenging at the same time. I'd say that 50% of Xenoverse is a fighting game, the other 50% is like a typical MMOrpg game. We level up, distribute our skill points, learn new techniques and attacks. I just wish there was more options to choose from when creating our own character- like hairstyle, eyes, and so on. But maybe I'm just needy. I also wish there were more characters in the game roster... They've missed out some- like Zarbon, Dodoria, Android 16, Dabura, and few more. Still, the game is great and I'd recommend it to every Dragon Ball fan.","February 27, 2015","true","92.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Clothing and powers are solid, camera can be touchy but otherwise the fighting is fluid and interesting.\n\nNEGATIVES -\nI'm playing a female character. Why are you calling me a dude? I've been staring at my ♥♥♥ for like 13 hours, dude. Is there something I need to know?\n\nThe game has issues but its still extremely enjoyable. The biggest problems are graphical in nature. The textures not put together and checked thoroughly enough and a lack of caring for matching up mouth movements, verifying that cutscene elements don't conflict.. It happens, its kind of a gimme.\n\nThe other thing is the character roster setup. Kind of a step back from earlier games who had the formula perfect. Lots of overlap but they don't condense the form to core characters. Not ALWAYS, at least. Frieza takes up 3 slots when, in theory, he should only take up one and have form escalations.\n\nThe NPCs are pretty poor as well. Using SSJ2 Goku, SSJ1 Future Trunks but they never use their form changes, they simply rely on their most basic super attacks and fail to coordinate or think past that. It can be a bit frustrating as you are pulling all the weight in fights.\n\nIf any of this is fixed along the way, I'll update the review accordingly. Otherwise its a very solid game, engaging and had me on it first day for 13 hours. This is a feat that is rarely ever accomplished with me as I have vidya ADD.\n\nLong story short: Should you play this game?

Each button corrosponds to a single action (light attacks, heavy attacks, ki blasts, etc) with little to no need to string together complex button presses or move the control stick around to do combos, sort of like a hack-and-slash game. You've also got Special moves (all of which cost 100 Ki) you can do using the same buttons while holding down the left trigger, and a couple Ultimate skills (costs 300 Ki) and an Evasive skill (costs 300 Stamina) that can be used the same way, just while holding down both triggers. Over all, combat is simple and easy to learn, but still manages to be fun, especially when it comes to mix-and-matching skills on your characters to see what works well together.\n\nThe story isn't too special, but in a way, it also kind of is. Most Dragon Ball games have us play through the same story that we all know and love, maybe with a few details changed around. But overall, it's still usually the same story. This gamedoesn't quite do that: Instead, Dragon Ball Xenoverse's story sort of picks up important things from the now-defuct Dragon Ball Online, an MMO with a lot of original ideas that didn't get to last long enough to see them properly executed. The Time Patrol returns, and your character is one of them, having been summoned by Trunk's wish on the Dragon Balls for a warrior who can help him fix up the timeline. Yes, you're exploring the story of DBZ... sort of, but the point this time is that critical moments in the story have been changed, and your job is to fix these continuity errors by correcting the outcome of battles that Towa and Mira have used their magic to change. An interesting twist that allows for newer elements without leaving the classic characters and settings behind.\n\nEveryone gets to create their own original character for the game to use as their avatar for the HUB world and story quests, and there's a pretty good amount of customizability for your character. There are a number of races, all with their own distinct strengths, and even a character's sex makes a small difference, encouraging the player to make multiple characters to try out all the different combinations. Your character can also equip virtually every technique and article of clothing you could think of. Want to be able to use Hercule's Dynamite Kick and Freiza's Death Beam at the same time? You can do that. As long as you're willing to work for it, you can get it for your character, and there are very few limits as to what kind of character can equip what kind of skill. Your imagination really is king, here.\n\n... Or at least it would be, if not for one little factor: The RNG. There's a large random factor to a few things in the game (NPC location, drop rates for skills and equipment, etc.) in the game, and it's far from generous. The drop rates in this game are quite stingy, and the missions are typically fairly long unless you are grossly over-leveled, so going through a 5-to-15 minute quest, only to not get anything out of it, can be annoying, especially if it happens multiple times in a row. Sadly, the rank you score on a mission doesn't really seem to affect drop rates, only how much EXP you get. Thankfully, EXP gains are pretty generous, especially if you rank high on a mission, so leveling up is fairly quick. You're likely to level up ever other mission you do, as long as its level and yours match up evenly enough. Each mission also has multiple "stages" to it that can be unlocked if you complete certain tasks within the mission in a specific way. However, these tasks aren't made clear to the player, and even if the player does everything right, it's still random as to whether or not the game thinks it counts, meaning you can do everything perfectly as the game wants you to, and still not get an Ultimate Finish based purely on luck.\n\nMy opinion on the audio is... complicated. The voice acting is generally good, but there are enough lines that have been mistranslated, or have the wrong audio play every time the line comes up, that the issue can't be ignored. Cutscenes are also much louder than gameplay, which, save for the sound effect (which are way too loud by default), is fairly quiet. The game also has a tendency to stop the battle music if you back off from an enemy for more than 4 seconds, which kind of ruins the moment, even if you're still fighting them and are just trying to get some distance.\n\nBack to gameplay issues again, the enemy AI has a tendency to outright cheat (knocking you out of moves that have full super armor with a single Ki blast, any character who goes Super Saiyan stays Super Saiyan, dodging attacks and grabs that clearly connect with them, etc.), while your partner AI is generally dumber than a sack of rocks. Sometimes, they're outright liabilities. If you can, try to do Parallel Quests with friends; You get more competent partners, and it's more fun than playing alone! Everyone wins!... as long as there isn't a connection issue. Then things might get a bit laggy, or someone may have to disconnect.\n\nUltimately, Dragon Ball Xenoverse is a game that does well when it comes to its core concepts and mechanics, but little things like issues with the AI, the RNG being a bigger deciding factor than it needs to be, and the occasional connection problem with the server, prevent it from being as good as it could be. And these are all things that could be fixed with some patches fairly easily. It's a good game that gets held down by small problems that pop up often enough to prevent it from reaching its full potential.\n\ntl;dr: If you're a fan of Dragon Ball Z, you'll probably love this game, but may be frustred by its small problems and how much presence they have. Still, I would recommend this game, because the good really does outweigh the bad.","April 7, 2015","true","289.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Dragonball Xenoverse is definately made for the fans of the series, but it may be a hard game for people new to the series to jump into.\n\nStory: Bad guys are changing the history of DBZ and you have been summon to stop them and restore balance to time. Simple and fun, just like DBZ.\n\nGameplay: For those looking for a detail fight system like Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, Mortal Kombat will be disappointed. The buttons for combat are simply light and heavy attack, special Ki attacks, and special strike attacks. Stamina meter for blocking and dodging and ki meter for special attacks. The combat remind me a lot of a Super Smash Bro style game. By that I mean its fast pace and easy to get use to for any player.\n\nYou create your own custom character from one of several races: Frieza clan, Namekian, Saiyan, Earthling, Majin. As you do missions you level up and can put your attribute points into stats (attack, special attack, special strike, health, stamina, ki). You can change outfits, equipment, z-souls (a special trait that activate during a fight), special attacks.\n\nThe game main story mission get much harder, so you need to stop in between every saga and play a parallel quest to level up so that the next story mission is easier. Parallel quests can be played alone or with people online. Playing with friends online is where this game shines (mostly because the ally AI borders from being dumb as a bag of brick or your savior at times).\n\nOverall if you are a fan of the game series then you probably already have this game and playing it. If you new to the series it may be hard to get into because you only see part of the main DBZ story and it a warp version of it anyway. But don't let that detour you. DB Xenoverse is a fun fast pace game that is easy to get into and much fun.\n\nNow if you will excuse, it time to grind my character some more.","February 27, 2015","true","100.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(You may have up to 7 presets for easy swapping on character select screen.)\n\n-Play solo or with others. (You must play alone 100% til you clear the beginning tutorial sections.)\n\n-Get destroyed by multiple opponents....over and over again!\n\n*-*-*-*-*\nInfo:\n\nI saw the Credits after a bit of suffering from some difficult adversaries.  I got to the "end" by about level 40 (It depends on how you play).  It was an interesting journey which made me definitely change my fighting style every so often.  But there are still plenty more quests to do and levels to gain.\n\n*-*-*-*-*\nReview:\n\n-Playstyle: Very fast paced, sometimes spam-like, but enjoyable.\n\n-Graphics: Simple and pleasant. Tends to be bright like anime (obviously).\n\n-Controls: Fairly decent. Using a controller makes my experience better for such a game.\n--Camera can get awkward depending on how close a wall section is to your character.\n\n-Replayability: Varied enough. Multiple races with different bonuses.  Different fighting styles / skills also add a large difference in how a battle is approached.\n\n-Entertainment Value:  Great for Dragonball Fans. Very good for fighting genre lovers.  But it can easily get boring if you tend to lose interest in battling against AI and/or other players over and over again.  Though you do have the option to choose if you want to be alone or not.\n\n-Multiplayer: I cannot comment much on this as I have yet to play with others. But I noticed there might be an NPC that allows you to play local co-op (Probably Versus) if you have more than one controller.  So I just think that is a very nice feature to have and mention.\n\n*-*-*-*-*\nConclusion:\n\nIf you don't have a crazy lust for this game at the moment like I did, then just wait for a discount price. You won't be missing that much.\n\nIf your mind is bent on it, you love Dragonball / Z / GT / etc, like to play fighting games, just get it!  But the DLC doesn't seem worth it in my opinion for the content. (No, I did not purchase the DLC.)","April 2, 2015","true","109.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't stand when people are complaining about the server issues. Ever since they fixed issue about a few days ago, I have NEVER been kicked out of the server. During the launch date, the server were not stable and had gliches. After a few quick fixes, the server is good and running on my end. I played for 4 hours straight and left the game running for 20 minutes while having lunch and still had a strong server connection.\n\nAlso, for any complaining about the story, the game wasn't supposed to be about giving the entire story like in previous games where you played through the whole story over and over again. In this game, it concentrates on the "What If" scenarios and alternative endings. In a pevious review, I read that someone was complaining about how your character does not interact with the storyline and you simply disappear. I confidently say that is not the case with this game. For example, when you are facing off against the head boss, Goku appears and helps you to beat him. The dialoge is all there and at the very end, Goku even offered to fight you. Like seriously. There are tons of interactions, including with Trunks.\n\nFinally, I cannot (and I mean CANNOT) stand anyone who complains about the online fighting mode. People complain about how it is unfair to versus against people who are higher leveled than you and stuff like that. Seriously...if you are entering an online battle and you are level 30, you might as well quit now. Wait until you beat the entire storyline and complete a decent amount of the time quests. Also, make sure you train with many of the masters (like Andriod 18, Cell, Vegeta, and so on) in DBZ and master them to unlock very good moves. This is simple. Just be patient and wait until you are strong enough (like around level 55 or above) before even considering playing online. Unless you and a friend are just having a friendly, non-competitive fight.\n\nMy Rating: 9/10","March 13, 2015","true","97.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Inventive story, great visuals and lots of easter eggs all over the place. The combat feels as true to the source material that you could probably get and the created character campaign portion is inventive (written by Toriyama, expect nothing less than great). The new MMO-esque social hub has replaced a traditional menu system and I can understand how it can bother someone who doesn't want to run for 10 seconds to get to a certain menu but I appreciate what they've done with it. Ultimately it all helps add to the emersion into the DBZ universe and make you feel like a character in the series and not just a videogame player. It might get more annoying later, but for now I like it. But that is not the game...that's just a social system and the game is awesome. I looked at most of the poor reviews and none of them really gave any valid reasons for not recommending this game. People whined about the game having an MMO hub world as a menu, or that the game was too hard. Or that they didn't understand where to go. ♥♥♥♥ing read the text instead of button mashing through the tutorial and then writing a poor review because you're too impatient to sit through 5 minutes of guidance. The controls are just fine, you can't custom edit the control scheme but the defaults are just fine as is. There is no problem with the target lock system if you know what you're doing and don't hit the wrong commands to switch targets. This is a DBZ fan's wet dream and it's on the mother♥♥♥♥ing PC.\n\nCons- This was developed primarily for consoles so the social functionality you would expect for a PC title just isn't there. For example there is no textual chat bar anywhere, the most you can do is edit preset responses, It's easy to play wioth friends if you have them on Steam but difficult to link up with those that are not on your Steam friend list. Also, because this game has to cater to last gen consoles there are a lot of things that are limited such as loading screens between the 3 areas of Toki Toki city (the social hub world) and the destruction of environment animations disappear shortly after destruction. However the game still looks beautiful. Hopefully the next installment to this game will not be built for last gen consoles and these issues would quickly dissappear.\n\n9/10","February 27, 2015","true","62.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if you grew up screaming alongside Goku and friends, It's worth it big time!!!\n\nHundreds of different combat abilities, items, costumes, facial/body customizations. The choice of Buu-race, Human, Saiyan, Namekian and Frieza-race. Tons of nostalgic memories and moments from Dragon Ball Z. This rattles off just a little of Dragon Ball Xenoverse's offerings.\n\nThe game starts off somewhat slow, yet entertaining. Other fans like myself will find themselves staring in awe at the intro and several cutscenes made to look much like the episodes. The difficulty ramps up quick, but whilst hunting for items in Parrallel Quests, you level up and gain enough ability to overcome the difficulty relatively easily.\n\nWhilst it is still early days, and the game loses connection to Xenoverse's servers on a rather regular occasion, it is a very solidly built game.\n\nI would like to see the ability for two people to play with controllers, on the one PC, and work through the game together... But that's probably being a bit picky.\n\n\nWorth the money? If you are a die hard fan YES!\n...If not, I suggest waiting for a sale to bring it around the $40USD mark.

The open world is pretty useless.. the dialog is weird & awkward.\n\nIn the beginning, it is difficult to figure out what you're supposed to do. There's a map you can pull up but there's nothing to indicate where to go or who to talk to.\n\nThere's an online mode.. but you can't use it until you make progress in the story.\n\nFighting is as you'd expect.. button mashy. Character graphics & sound are ok.\n\nBeing a long-time DBZ fan, I do enjoy the opportunity to see & interact with the characters.. but the gameplay itself is pretty bad.\n\nAfter playing for awhile:\nThe gameplay does get a little better & the story is actually better than expected. The button mashy feeling goes away somewhat as you gain more abilities & actually have to use some strategic thinking.. but in the end you've only got 8 move slots to use.\n\nThere are a few items to choose from at this point but they are all pretty generic fan-service items. Hopefully there are plans to add to the current inventory.\n\nA lot of the rarer items are obtained by grinding "parallel quests".. which are just basic battles with a few objectives that you must meet. There's a ranking system to determine how well you did, but how they sum up the scoring is a mystery.\n\nTraining under a master is pretty cool as you get to hear their voice when you fail or succeed to encourage you or call you a wreck (Vegeta)","February 27, 2015","true","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It is amusing that you are summoned by trunks, who went back in time to change history. to ask you to stop people changing history. Regardless of that, you must play through the sagas from the saiyan all the way to beerus (and a little bit past that) ensuring battles end how they did in the original timeline. At the same time looking out for the people behind the changes in history.\nYou have amain hub which is a city divided into 4 sections. The first is the area you are summoned to by shenron. There are a few npcs scattered about, the entry to world tournament (as in an online battle), the area you use the dragonballs you can collect and the entrance to the two other sections of the city as well as the final part, the time nest.\nPersonally, i find the first seciton pretty redundant, as apart from the time nest and the dragonball holder, there seems to be no need for it.\nThe second section is the industry section. Here you will find the item shops, mix shops (you can mix z-souls which boost your stats for stronger ones that have different effects in battle depending on certain scenarios) clothing stores and a skill trainer.\nThe third section is the time machine station. Here you will find team registration to recruit AI or other players in multi lobbies, online and offline battles as well as online and offline parallel quests which are essentially just scenarios to play out such as defending frieza from goku or defeating every saiyan in their base, super saiyan forms etc.\nYou Will also find your current master in this section, the whereabouts of finding  said masters are entirely random as they are scattered throughout the  sections of the city.\nThe final section, the time nest, isn't technically part of the city, but it's where you have to go to begin your story quest each and every time. The supreme kai of time is also in this area, but she doesn't have a use.\n\nPositives:\nCombat system isn't too basic but isn't too advanced, so every user is able to learn the combos\nRPG system and character creation allows you to make your character your way. If you want to be a melee heavy character or focus entirely on ki blast supers, its up to you.\nWide variety of moves and evasive attacks - from the classic kamehameha to broly's gigantic meteor. From whis's karate chop to trunk's shining sword attack.\nWide character roster with many variants to characters. So you can play as saiyan saga vegeta or kid buu vegeta. A saibaman or ssj4 gogeta - you can also select any of the characters to help you in parallel quests; but story missions, you're on your own.\nGraphically it is one of the best dbz games out there, but that isn't much of a feat and isn't as good as it sounds as they remain faithful to cell shaded anime style - as they should.\nClothing system allows you to dress your characters up (this does come with a negative though)\nRacial attributes - each race ( earthling, saiyan, majin, namekian and frieza clan) all come with slightly different starting stats and a racial attribute as well as each level up with larger or smaller stats based on race i.e. majin race gets a bigger increase to each point in health whereas a saiyan gets more of a boost to attacks.\nIt can be a challenging game at the start, as it is an RPG you'll get progressively stronger, but start of quite weak. This can be a bad thing if you hate grinding, but a fun thing if you'd enjoy being level 80, helping out a friend and annihilating yamcha in one combo.\nMaster system - you can chose a variety of masters (from hercule to beerus) to train under. Each one will give you a unique set of mission to complete and you will get rewards such as z souls and master related skills i.e. vegetas galick gun or final flash\n\nNegatives:\nEverything is completely random. Literally almost everything.\nParallel quests can give you specific z souls, other items, clothing or skills. Whether or not you get them is completely RNG. You also have bonus objectives to complete during these missions to get an ultimate finish which could help you attain a z rank. These bonus objectives have specific conditions in which to activate. However, even then whether or not  the mission will progress into the next stage of bonus objectives is entirely random. For example, in one fight you must defeat all cell jr's before progressing and taking out android 17 and 18. This is supposed to spawn cell and make the two androids get back up after you defeat them. However it doesn't always happen.\nYou also get time patrollers in certain missions that challenge you. Defeating them can sometimes yield a dragonball - collect all 7 and make a wish. They spawn randomly and aren't always there. Even the masters you can train under don't always appear in the city, they spawn in random locations at random times  sometimes after doing missions. You also can't just do all of their missions in a row. They'll decide when you can do the next mission. Sometimes you could do 3 in a row. Other times you do 1 and wait 10 years for the next. Or they'll ask you to get a specific z soul from a PQ which means grinding that same mission until RNJesus decides to drop it for you. Some people have claimed it's determined by how many z ranks you get in PQ's, but i failed a mission 3 times in a row and then gohans final mission was available for me, so i'm assuming it's random.\n\nServer issues: This is an ongoing problem because they didn't expect this volume of sales and their servers cannot handle it. However unless you use the offline mode on steam you need to be connected to their servers to play. This can result in you waiting 5-10 minutes plus to log into a single player lobby to do offline quests. You can even get disconnected sitting in the single player lobby, which kicks you back to the main menu. Multi lobby is almost out of the question right now, and online PQ's or battles are quite laggy. This will be sorted out soon though, and the servers are already much more stable since release.\n\nClothing: Whilst the clothing is a nice idea, every piece of clothing gives you certain stat boosts or negatives. This can mean that if you wanted to dress up like certain characters you may have to attune your character to use the stat boots provided by the clothing, or lose some of your current stats. Some armour is race specific or gender specific and you have no ability to filter through saiyan only, or frieza only. You just have to check by scrolling through each piece.\n\nThis is only a minor annoyance to me and i'm nit picking at this point, but if you fail a PQ you'll spawn the same place you did if you succeed. In the time machine sector about a 20 second walk away from the quest vendors with no button to allow you to rety from failure. You'll have to walk all the way back to the vendor each time. It's not that bothersome, but it'd be nice to not always have to be in the hub, to just select another mission and carry on or choose to return to the hub\n\nOverall, 6.5/10\nThere are some dlc's coming out which will add new characters and missions which i think is pretty neat, but i'll be waiting to see what they are before i purchase a season pass.\nIt's a good game, i've got some decent hours on it and it's fun with friends. If you're a fan of Dragonball Z, you'll most likely enjoy this game. If you've played some of the previous games, no it's not as good as the budokai tenkaichi series, but it's definitely an improvement over battle of z or UT. Though i prefer the character creation, abilities, and even graphics to an extent in UT.\nIf you dislike MMO grind, or want a really in depth combat system which you'll play online battles for hours as if you're on street fighter or mortal kombat, this is not a game you should buy.","March 7, 2015","true","53.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It is amusing that you are summoned by trunks, who went back in time to change history. to ask you to stop people changing history. Regardless of that, you must play through the sagas from the saiyan all the way to beerus (and a little bit past that) ensuring battles end how they did in the original timeline. At the same time looking out for the people behind the changes in history.\nYou have amain hub which is a city divided into 4 sections. The first is the area you are summoned to by shenron. There are a few npcs scattered about, the entry to world tournament (as in an online battle), the area you use the dragonballs you can collect and the entrance to the two other sections of the city as well as the final part, the time nest.\nPersonally, i find the first seciton pretty redundant, as apart from the time nest and the dragonball holder, there seems to be no need for it.\nThe second section is the industry section. Here you will find the item shops, mix shops (you can mix z-souls which boost your stats for stronger ones that have different effects in battle depending on certain scenarios) clothing stores and a skill trainer.\nThe third section is the time machine station. Here you will find team registration to recruit AI or other players in multi lobbies, online and offline battles as well as online and offline parallel quests which are essentially just scenarios to play out such as defending frieza from goku or defeating every saiyan in their base, super saiyan forms etc.\nYou Will also find your current master in this section, the whereabouts of finding  said masters are entirely random as they are scattered throughout the  sections of the city.\nThe final section, the time nest, isn't technically part of the city, but it's where you have to go to begin your story quest each and every time. The supreme kai of time is also in this area, but she doesn't have a use.\n\nPositives:\nCombat system isn't too basic but isn't too advanced, so every user is able to learn the combos\nRPG system and character creation allows you to make your character your way. If you want to be a melee heavy character or focus entirely on ki blast supers, its up to you.\nWide variety of moves and evasive attacks - from the classic kamehameha to broly's gigantic meteor.

I want to do quests with my buddy and we have to keep remaking the room. Other then that the game is great, drop rates could be better but at the same time it'll keep me going. I come from playing WoW so I am totally used to going a day or more without getting the item i want. Overall 9/10.

I've been a Dragonball Z fan for as long as I can remember, and whether you are a fan or not, I think this game will be a fun and satisfying experience for everybody. The game is able to run very smoothly even on my laptop, and I rarely ever have any issues with playing it.\n\nThe only game in my library that I've played longer than this title is Skyrim, and that's saying a lot. There are plenty of things to do in this game, so it'll keep you busy for hours upon hours. The game has full controller support, so and the controls are thankfully very easy to learn, as instead of having to pull off annoying combos, you can just use the trigger buttons to access your Super and Ultimate moves provided you have enough energy to use them. I have had some issues with the game responding to my button presses and a little bit of input lag, but that might just be my computer or the graphics settings.\n\nThis game looks pretty, plays well, and is all and all a very fun game to pick up and play. My main criticisms are that sometimes the RNG is terrible and it makes trying to find masters or gathering Dragon Balls or getting certain item drops from quests rather tedious, which can sometimes make playing them feel like a chore. Another thing I would have liked to see was an option in the clothing and accessory shops to preview what you're buying. You dont get to see anything but the name and stats of the clothes you buy, so you either have to look it up online, or buy it blindly. If you dont happen to like it, your only choice is to just deal with it or sell it back for half of what you paid for it. Some quests are also almost unfairly hard, and some of those quests are ones you must get from NPC's, so you may not bring support characters or finish the quest online with a friend until you beat it once by yourself. It wouldnt be so bad if it werent for the fact that some of these involve characters that like to spam their super attacks so much you cant even move and get comboed from full health until you die, one of these quests being one where you have to fight at least 15 characters by yourself to complete it.\n\nComplains aside, this is a really fun game, and an interesting take on the story in the DBZ universe, and I'd recommend it to anyone, especially a DBZ fan.","March 16, 2015","true","68.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fighting side of the game is a lot of fun, and controls very well compared to older DB-series fighting games.  The movements are fluid and attacks are aesthetically pleasing.  There is enough variety in creating your skill-sets to keep the combat interesting and unique.\n\nHowever, the rest of the game has it's issues.  The scripting/acting in the story leaves much to be desired. Cut-scenes are laden with bugs and visual glitches.\n\nSingle-player (offline) quests run smooth enough, and don't have the netcode issues plaguing the online versions of the same quests.  Oftentimes you'll find yourself stuck in a quest, waiting for the timer to run out because an NPC failed to spawn.  Other times, your character will be stuck in-place, unable to assist your teammates.  This can happen even when it looks like everyone's latency is acceptable.  Yet, it happens far too often.\n\nDrop-rates on items and skills are a mixed bag.  Some people farm entire days to finally get something to drop, while others will get it on the first try.  There's a lot of RNG praying involved.  Would it not be better to put the drops on the stores after you Z-rank a mission, perhaps?\n\nThe "secret" goals on missions keep it fun, but it's difficult to coordinate with online players without using voice chat.  This is an online game - Why not open up typed chat, rather than using pre-scripted chat options?\n\nThe interface in the hub city could use some work.  But once you find where all the menu options are, it tends to flow.\n\nPvP is unbalanced, and there are cheaters taking advantage of bugs that make them nigh unbeatable.  There is no in-game report function.\n\nI find the experience is far better playing offline until the netcode issues are resolved.\n\nIf you're a fan of the DB series, it's probably worth playing when it goes on sale.  The character variety and fun combat will keep you entertained for many hours.

From the Buu waifu to the fusion dance on servers to the infamous male voice 8, anyone who has ever wanted a Dragon Ball Z game probably envisioned something like this. The story is intersting, albeit short, but I love it because it's not the same story that ever DBZ game has, it isn't just playing through the story of the anime, but a new story entirely. I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to recreate their own fan-made characters in the Dragon Ball universe, we've all made Bass the Namekian, or Frigid, Frieza's crazy uncle, or just ourselves as saiyans. With Xenoverse, you too can go SSJ2.","March 29, 2015","true","174.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though my bone to pick with this game is the voice actors, they're from the Kai, the original in my personal opinion were far better, like the ones from older Dragonball Z games, they got it perfect with Budokai Tenkaichi 3, and they had a spell of pretty crap games, cause Bust Limit was only up to the Cell Saga, which annoyed me and Raging Blast and Raging Blast 2 lacked that fun factor like Tenkaichi 3, Ultimate Tenkaichi as well, that was fantastic when it came to character customization, but it felt slower than the originals, as for the multiperson fighting on this game, I don't rate it that high, but the sheer speed of this game during fights is what makes this game epic, so all in all, 8/10 from me, the timeline from Saiyan Saga through to Majin Buu is fantastic, downsides? Voice actors and the multi character battles, it should feature a tag-in style, but I can understand where they come from with your own character saving history..clever idea, so I can understand why multi character battles are needed, that's all there is to it :D","March 27, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't usually play fighting games, but I enjoyed this one.  I am not sure this game would be fun for someone who isn't a DBZ fan.\n\nThe graphics are kind of odd.  A lot of people refer to them as "goodish".  It's a cross between the original 2d animation of the series and failry decent 3d graphics of the cartoon characters.  It looks weird because we are used to seeing the characters drawn a certain way.  If someone has a differnet idea or better explanation I'd love to hear it.\n\nThe combat is really fun.  You can build out your character with moves you've come to love from the series.  You can build and customize your character however you'd like.  The main story and the parrellel quests are really fun and creative.  The master quests, in my opinion, are a little too much of a grind.  I also thought the summoning of Shenron was a little anti-climatic.  Finally, you can't really customize your character to look very differnet.  I, for instance, couldn't make a character that looks like me, its just way too limited.\n\nProsFun gamplay, fun combat, fun character progression\n"Goodish" graphics.  (would high quality cell shading have been better?)\nSolid game, no crashes, no bugs encountered\nWell optimized\nVery fun storyline\nGreat multiplayer, when other people are available\n144Hz support\nWith some rebinding the game plays great on mouse and keyboard\nConsLoading time is slow, takes too long to load into the main lobby and out\nCharacter design (how you look) is WAY too limited\nDLC is too expensive\nStrange keyboard controls, but they can be easily rebound to whatever you'd like","October 25, 2015","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

There are a few glitches that need to be worked out as far as some skills and missions and the PVP system is a bit unbalanced. Each race has its own type of advantage over the other and the game play itself is a but more enjoyable if you have a small group of friends to play it with. Trying to be competitive in this game will kill the excitement extremely fast. From what I've seen this game needs a lot of team work so try not to make enemies out other players if possible lol. I'm only speaking on how to have the best fun out of it rather than trying to be the best. But in my personal opinion, its a pretty awsome game and some I find myself coming back too every now and then to see how much more fun I can have and who I can help get stronger.","January 12","true","457.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is great to be able to hop into the Dragonball Z universe that I loved so much as a child. I love the fact that you can be mulitple races. Best part is being able to get many different skills that are used throughout Dragonball universe. Here is a list of pros and cons for this fantastic game!\n\nPros:\n-Character Creation\n-Many different moves\n-Tons of hours of fun\n-Online capabilities (w/ friends)\n-Many memorable moments get to be relived\n-Decent story\n\nCons:\n-The grind is real sometimes for moves due to RNG\n-Online capabilities with randoms can be poor sometimes since not a lot of people seem to play with randoms\n-Can become repetitive and boring\n-Saiyan race seems op compared to other races due to super saiyan capabilities\n\nThat is my personal pros/cons list that I have came up with while playing the game. I highly recommend it to everyone, but especially those who love the Dragonball Z universe.

It's a bad console tard game MADE badly...which makes it a dimension of suck that is unheard of. Switching from random difficulty (WAY too easy to WAY too hard) with no seeming reason, REALLY awful camera movement and SUPER flashy attacks that will actually cover your entire screen so you have no idea how to outplay anything...being permastunned when outnumbered, or too easily winning when you can bring 2 god gokus AND whatever npc they give u to fight like 1 guy, being immune or hitting immune targets, or being immune and STILL taking damage, being locked on and using your ultimates and they either dont do damage for REASONS, literally dont work and cancel themselves (while still using your ki) or actually...ACTUALLY activating in the middle of nowhere even though you were locked on, all of it is random and really just...awful. HOWEVER...the show itself was ALSO just...freaking awful. But growing up with it it was the greatest thing ever....mostly because of the power fantasy and the Bruce Falconer soundtrack. So the ONLY reason to buy this game is if you are a fan, and then no matter how garbage it is you will like it. It will abuse you and you will like being abused you dirty little ♥♥♥♥.

This game, however, is an exception.\nPlease note that I have not and do not plan to play any PVP, so that will not be factored in here.\n\nA little backstory:\nGrowing up, DBZ was one of my biggest influences and loves. I fell in love with the characters, the story, and the outrageous combat elements that made up what is today one of my most favorite anime series of all time. Naturally, when I first played a DBZ game (Budokai 1) I was very excited to see the universe I'd grown to love and be able to play it. Flash forward to now, with the release of THIS game (Xenoverse) and I couldn't be happier.\n\nPros:\nStory- VERY much like the anime, but of course with that cool, time-warped twist. I found myself on the edge of my seat a LOT.\n\nCharacters- Not much to say here other than they're the ones you came to love (or hate in case of villains). Customization could stand to be a bit better, but overall I'm happy with what I can create in the games' system.\n\nGameplay- Plays much like the Tenkaichi series of games. Fly around, auto-combos, teleports, ki-blasts, ultimate attacks... you name it, it's pretty much there. A blast (buh-dum-tss) to play, and I never get bored of it. Can be a bit wonky, but overall is very well polished.\n\nGraphics- GORGEOUS. Damn this universe looks amaaaaazing in this game. Couldn't be happier with it.\n\nCons:\nStory- None that I have problems with.\n\nCharacters- Villains (Toma, Mira, Demigra) can be a bit too predictable or cliche, but that doesn't necessarily detract from the overall experience.\n\nGameplay- AI is sort of barebones, but once you get further along into the story and PQs (which are good, varied, and challenging at higher levels) the ai becomes a real challenge to deal with. Up until about the android saga and PQs 17+, the AI isn't very good. Some attacks whiff when they shouldn't, but no other gripes with attacks.\n\nGraphics- N/A.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nHELL YES (if you're a fan of the series).\nYes! (if you're a fan of rpg/fighter hybrids).\nNo. (if you don't like SOME (partly unnecessary unless you want to GIT GUD) grinds). (Diablo-esque, but a bit better in my opinion).\nYes again! (If you like gorgeous games with a wealth of content that won't leave you bored).\n\nOverall score: As a fan of the series- 9.5/10. Very great game, well-polished and satisfying.\nObjectively- 8.5/10. Good, if a bit irritating, in terms of gameplay and adaptability (at first).","June 17, 2015","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Outfits should have been seperate and Equipment or more stat points should be given to fill this.\n-Outfits Part2, only some outfits can be colored to your liking, all the other stuff (again straight ripped from DBZ characters) can only be its original color.\n-Difficulty, some battles are extremely frustrating, others to easy, the final boss was a cake walk compared to buu and ginyu. Could use some tweaking imo.\n-Roster is smaller than previous DBZ games, pretty usetting.\n-Server Issues, they suck, like real hard, if your in single lobby even expect to get dissconnected every other mission and kicked to title screen, its like they made the server out of bubble gum and spare wiring.\n\nOverall I'm loving it, I just wish there was more CaC options. 6/10 Would bang Videl (Before she cut her pony tails off)","February 27, 2015","true","55.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I started off with a human character and fell in love with the whole style of this game. The voice acting is a little bit painful but I can look past that with the game-play being what it is, amazing.\n\nI played through the story mode, with a good amount of grinding the parallel quests to unlock a few things that I couldn't buy, making this game very engaging. I didn't actually beat everything until well after hitting level 80 because the drop rate in this game was horrible, making you replay missions over and over again.\n\nI liked everything about this game, from character customization to the story. But the poor drop rate on something that gives you a chance to unlock something that already has a poor drop rate is a little too much.\n\nI would still recommend this game to friends that like DBZ and to those that don't because starting this game, I didn't even like DBZ all that much. Now I actually love the story of the universe a lot and this game actually helped me get into the series a lot.","June 16, 2015","true","98.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Make a Namek, make a saiyan, make a krillin. Beat up some guys and fly around. It feels good to do this, and you get new powers as you do missions. If you want all the powers and all the clothes and everything, well, you gotta grind, which is a mixed bag for people. I like making characters, and I like Dragon Ball, so this was a very good game, and I played a lot of it. Flying around, fighting, and using powers is fun. It's not perfect but it works well enough. There's multiplayer vs but I haven't done much of it and it's probably bad. The game is not remotely balanced and you shouldn't expect it to be, which is fine.\n\nThere's a lot of questionable decisions that can make things frustrating on the collection end of things. Not only are ability drops random for the most part, but also the Mentor system is random as well. You can't decide who to be your mentor, you just have to wait for them to randomly show up. This is the most annoying thing for me about this game, because while drops are random for skills, at the very least you are actually playing the game, and the skills are tied to specific missions. The DLC adds mentors but a couple of them I haven't even seen or gotten the chance to train with yet, because they show up randomly, among the pool of your old mentors too. This is probably my biggest complaint with the game.\n\nit's good fun otherwise. tldr, if you like DBZ at all get this game.","October 11, 2015","true","89.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can even log in, you'll be kicked after doing a few missions.\n- Convoluded stats. No explanation for what any stat does, and the only way to redo your stats is by gathering the Dragon Balls, which can take 2-5 hours to farm all 7 of (Because RNG is amazing).\n- RNG. All I really need to say here. It ruins games.\n- While there ARE a lot of moves, most of them don't scale linearly with your damage stat, so you'll find yourself using a much smaller pool of abilities for maximum damage.\n- AIs are wonky. Your allies as AIs are borderline braindamaged, even in the storyline, and your enemies spam evasive/recovery moves like crack addicts. The only big challenge is actually landing a combo on an enemy AI.\n- Unflinchable boss fights. In a fighting game about combos and locking down an enemy, it completely defeats the purpose to add enemies that cannot be flinched in an easy way. Not only do enemies become bullet sponges, but they become unflinchable and a pain in the ♥♥♥ to solo unless you abuse Z-Souls or items, BOTH of which form bad habits.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- PvP is a mess of hackers, abusive Z-Souls and glitch exploits. I'm staying clear of this until they fix it. Like, to give you an accurate image of how BAD the hacking is right now: 1 in  3 players you meet will be a hacker in PvP. Unlimited energy. Unlimited Stamina. Unlimited Health. Because who buys a game to NOT HACK, am I right?\n- The final boss in the storyline is such a huge letdown of a fight. Instead of adding meaningful or cool mechanics, they simply made him a huge, unflinchable waste of time.","February 26, 2015","true","178.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't usually play fighting games, but I enjoyed this one.  I am not sure this game would be fun for someone who isn't a DBZ fan.\n\nThe graphics are kind of odd.  A lot of people refer to them as "goodish".  It's a cross between the original 2d animation of the series and failry decent 3d graphics of the cartoon characters.  It looks weird because we are used to seeing the characters drawn a certain way.  If someone has a differnet idea or better explanation I'd love to hear it.\n\nThe combat is really fun.  You can build out your character with moves you've come to love from the series.  You can build and customize your character however you'd like.  The main story and the parrellel quests are really fun and creative.  The master quests, in my opinion, are a little too much of a grind.  I also thought the summoning of Shenron was a little anti-climatic.  Finally, you can't really customize your character to look very differnet.  I, for instance, couldn't make a character that looks like me, its just way too limited.\n\nProsFun gamplay, fun combat, fun character progression\n"Goodish" graphics.  (would high quality cell shading have been better?)\nSolid game, no crashes, no bugs encountered\nWell optimized\nVery fun storyline\nGreat multiplayer, when other people are available\n144Hz support\nWith some rebinding the game plays great on mouse and keyboard\nConsLoading time is slow, takes too long to load into the main lobby and out\nCharacter design (how you look) is WAY too limited\nDLC is too expensive\nStrange keyboard controls, but they can be easily rebound to whatever you'd like","October 25, 2015","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

I do wish that they added all Characters from the different DBZ movies and other characters from the show that we never saw like what Budokai Tenkaichi 3 did (Amazing game).

It's a bad console tard game MADE badly...which makes it a dimension of suck that is unheard of. Switching from random difficulty (WAY too easy to WAY too hard) with no seeming reason, REALLY awful camera movement and SUPER flashy attacks that will actually cover your entire screen so you have no idea how to outplay anything...being permastunned when outnumbered, or too easily winning when you can bring 2 god gokus AND whatever npc they give u to fight like 1 guy, being immune or hitting immune targets, or being immune and STILL taking damage, being locked on and using your ultimates and they either dont do damage for REASONS, literally dont work and cancel themselves (while still using your ki) or actually...ACTUALLY activating in the middle of nowhere even though you were locked on, all of it is random and really just...awful. HOWEVER...the show itself was ALSO just...freaking awful. But growing up with it it was the greatest thing ever....mostly because of the power fantasy and the Bruce Falconer soundtrack.

I would also like a hair change between normal to super sayian my characters hair didn't change and I cried for a day because I grinded for 6 Hours trying to get SSJ. But the character creation is where this game shines and FINALLY a new DBZ story instead of the same rehashed story we always get. The fighting is SUPER fun but at times it got a little clunky but it was simplistic and made it fun for 1 v 1 matches locally because you could easily teach your friends.

Can get a bit grindy and repeated at times, but there is enough variety that it doesn't kill interest. Combat system starts very simple, depth increases gradually, and can be heavily customized, along with your character's stats/equipment which alter how that character performs.\n\nFun multiplayer elements (when they work) with integrated voice chat. Good pacing, looks nice, few odd choices for voice actors\n\nI give it an 8/10. They could have done some things better, but overall a worthwhile purchase and gaming experience.","March 23, 2015","true","37.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can even log in, you'll be kicked after doing a few missions.\n- Convoluded stats. No explanation for what any stat does, and the only way to redo your stats is by gathering the Dragon Balls, which can take 2-5 hours to farm all 7 of (Because RNG is amazing).\n- RNG. All I really need to say here. It ruins games.\n- While there ARE a lot of moves, most of them don't scale linearly with your damage stat, so you'll find yourself using a much smaller pool of abilities for maximum damage.\n- AIs are wonky. Your allies as AIs are borderline braindamaged, even in the storyline, and your enemies spam evasive/recovery moves like crack addicts. The only big challenge is actually landing a combo on an enemy AI.\n- Unflinchable boss fights. In a fighting game about combos and locking down an enemy, it completely defeats the purpose to add enemies that cannot be flinched in an easy way. Not only do enemies become bullet sponges, but they become unflinchable and a pain in the ♥♥♥ to solo unless you abuse Z-Souls or items, BOTH of which form bad habits.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- PvP is a mess of hackers, abusive Z-Souls and glitch exploits. I'm staying clear of this until they fix it. Like, to give you an accurate image of how BAD the hacking is right now: 1 in  3 players you meet will be a hacker in PvP. Unlimited energy. Unlimited Stamina. Unlimited Health. Because who buys a game to NOT HACK, am I right?\n- The final boss in the storyline is such a huge letdown of a fight. Instead of adding meaningful or cool mechanics, they simply made him a huge, unflinchable waste of time.","February 26, 2015","true","178.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As an avid gamer though, I feel there is much more room for improvement. That being said this is still a solid DB game and will keep you busy for hours on end, there are a lot of side missions to complete, ranks to achieve and the inevitable RNG that comes with claiming items. Creating your own character and building them up however you wish is a most welcome addition also and adds to replayability since each race/gender combo can be built differently. The game can be frustrating at times but what game isn't? Difficulty spikes, blatantly cheating AI, poor servers and terrible use of RNG mechanics are among the top frustrations I encountered. (I never did PVP)\n\nTLDR: DB fan? Buy it. Not a fan but this game has caught your interest?

If so, you're probably going to like this game. If not, well, while the game won't set your world on fire, it does a lot of pretty cool things.\n\nOne of those cool things is the fact that, while there are heavy liberties taken, it DOES tell the basic story of the Dragon Ball universe. This is nice for newcomers, but the heavy liberties are more for the benefit of old fans, as these liberties make sitting through the same story we've been watching, reading, and playing for the last 30 years a somewhat fresh experience.\n\nOne of said liberties (that was advertised heavily leading up to the game's release) is the use of custom avatars. That's right, you can create your own character using any one of five universal races, those being Earthling, Saiyan, Namekian, Frieza Race, and Majin, and take said character throughout the Dragon Ball Z timeline, participating in iconic battles against the backdrop of an almost shameless excuse plot of time travel and interventions in the timestream. While I say "shameless", that does not mean "bad", as the game's story does what it should by giving you a reason to do what you are doing and context for why some random humansaiyannamekenmajinfriezaguy is helping out in these iconic fights.\n\nBut story isn't what brings you here, hopefully. Instead, you're probably wanting to hear about gameplay. Well, it's great. I mean it's far from the deepest of fighting games, but that being said I tend to agree with ProJared's opinion, which is that this game isn't really a fighting game, but more of an RPG, as you take your previously mentioned hero into battles, learn new techniques, level up, and mess around in the surprisingly large amount of customization offered.\n\nThat being said, there are a few gripes I have with the game that I would like to see addressed, possibly in a sequel? I mean as well as this game has done I wouldn't be surprised, and I'm willing to bet some people have the same gripes as me, but here goes.\n\nSaid customization is a bit of a crapshoot. While it is cool that you're capable of attaching pretty much any move you want from a vast pool of techniques throughout the series, it does kind of require a decent prior knowledge base in Dragon Ball moves, who uses them, how powerful they are, et cetera. In addition, while I REALLY like the clothing system (that is, clothing changes stats as well as your character's costume), because there is no way to preview how the costume will look on your character, you kind of have to blindly spend your money and hope you like what you get, the exceptions being the staggering amount of costumes from different characters throughout the series. You pretty much know what you're getting there, if you tap into said prior knowledge of the DB universe.\n\nAnother personal thing I would like to see changed is the option of accessing different places in the game's hub through the use of a menu. Don't get me wrong, I like the ability to walk around the hub and see other players who are online in real time, but there are times when I feel like a fast-travel menu would be nice.\n\nOne final gripe is the fact that the game is a LITTLE grind-heavy, which is both good and bad. Good in the sense that side-quests (called Parallel Quests in game) have a TON of loot to get and a nice grading system just in case your Completionist OCD wasn't bothering you enough, but bad in the sense that, if you want to continue with the story and NOT have your face rearranged, you need to put in some time with redoing main-story missions and Parallel Quests.\n\nBut as I said before, these gripes aren't game-breaking. I'm 10 hours in, and I foresee much more time spent here, and I will be keeping my eye out for a sequel. Recommended for DBZ fans, especially if it goes on sale. The uninitiated who are looking to get into the series, however, I recommend watching some gameplay videos to see if you'll like it, and, putting this as politely as I can, watch the show immediately. Heck, even watch Dragon Ball Z Kai. It has a better translation, much of the fat that bogged down the show is cut, and it's about half the length of the original show.\n\nThat or watched the abridged series. I mean....I liked it.","August 16, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this case, knowing the series from a-z I do notice how that knowledge helps you in the sidequests a lot. (Grabbing ape's tails, tagging ssj3 before attacking)\n\nThere is one weird thing that a lot of people see as a negative point:\nBefore the game explains you which keys do what you have to beat 3 enemies (frieza, cell and buu) without knowing what does what exactly.\nThe game plays away so natural that you actually don't need the whole explenation and tutorial to beat them, what they did here is show you how easilly mastered the basics of the game are before explaining all the details. In my oppinion: Awesome!\n\nThe DLC's are mostly useful for online playing (pvp) due too the skills included in them, giving you wombocombo's that wombo the combo out of everything and everyone.\n\nYou do see a lot of tutorials on "how to powerlevel", Don't even bother that way. Destroy the baby ape (takes 1 minute if you stay behind him and grab his tail constantly (keyboard E + Q / controlelr LB + B) and within 50 minutes you're max level)\n\n\nLets talk some pro's and cons.\n\nPro:\nGraphics\nStory is spot on\nCostumization\nLoads of secondairy objectives\nControlls are easy\nIt's DragonBall!\n\n\nCon:\nFast playtrough\nToo easy\nDialogs are buggy\n\n\n\n8/10 Very well playable and enjoyable game.

Loved the main story as well as the Parallel Quests.   You get to create your own warrior in the Z universe!  How can you not enjoy that if you have been a fan of the series!  One thing I will note is that you will not be able to run straight through the main story.  You will also have to complete quests on the side in order to level up enough to be able to pass the story.  The DLC also add quite a bit of content to the game.  You can train under various Masters, including Beerus and Elder Kai.  The best part is that you can play online with other people.  That makes the game much more fun and you get to show off your character and its abilities to others.  After you pass the main quest, however,  there is not much else to do.  I did get about 100 hours out of it, which is plenty of time for this type of game.  Highly recommended to any fan of DBZ.

The people who call it gamebreaking that they can't win these fights, however, simply do not have their character built out right or don't know how to string together their attacks correctly. Yes, those fights are hard, but the first one I had trouble with was Beerus and Wiz, which is supposed to be a hard fight. I got frustrated, quit playing several times, then came back, looked at my stats and skills and respecced and chose new skills and suddenly the fight was at least doable. You can't put points into every stat, you have to figure out what you're good at and spec into it.

I think they retain a lot of flaws from an age in gaming that was limited by technology and lack of ideas; limitations which modern games no longer have. Xenoverse doesn't even really look like an RPG, but that's what it is. It's an MMO with a fighter skin. And it's not a bad idea really. It was fun for the first couple of days even for me, but around level 50 was when I decided this game was not enjoyable any longer. The gameplay is very simple and between level 1 and level whatever-the-max-is, very little will change about your custom character. Their stats will increase and they'll get slightly different, flashier moves, but you'll still rinse and repeat the same combos or spam the same ki ultimates over and over again. It's essentially the same as mashing the "A" button while playing a Final Fantasy game. Yes, this is a very boring design, but the simplicity was actually enjoyable for me. What wasn't enjoyable was the other RPG elements: grinding and difficulty spikes. Specifically difficulty spikes that shouldn't actually be difficult. A lot of the later quests involve your character and two support characters (or even your character alone) going through gauntlets of Super Saiyans with permanent transformations who never run out of ki and spam energy blasts and ultimates forever. But one Super Saiyan is manageable you say? How about three? Yep, Super Saiyan 2 Goku, Ultimate Gohan, and Super Saiyan Goten fighting you at the same time and hitting you with three Super Kamehame-Ha's and getting rid of half your health is what you can expect in the later levels of this game unless you do the dirty deed of grinding for hours on end. Like I said, I'm not an RPG fanatic and I'm sure the MMO crowd probably wouldn't care much about a few hours of wasted time, it just annoys me when any possible skill the player has is negligible and the fight relies on how much time you've sunk into grinding quests that you don't need to grind. So do I recomend this game to a casual person who likes Dragon Ball and is looking for a fun experience? Definitely not. That person will have wasted fifty dollars and would probably think the game is crap. To an MMO'er or RPG fan, who wants an interesting combination of MMO's and fighting games, they may like it a little bit. Overall, the game is more an RPG than a fighter, but it's gameplay and mechanics are far too simple for it to stand up as either. It won't captivate you for hours on end, but it's a good game to play when you feel like letting your brain melt. It's fun, but it's not that great and it can be a real ball buster at times. I give Dragon Ball Xenoverse a 6/10.","March 31, 2015","true","79.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not so much.\n\nNow, Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was a game that even people who hate the series could love. This one sort of requires you to get a gist of the lore and story to truly enjoy. Not like BT3 where you could have never seen or read anything about the show, jump in and get a good jist of it all.\n\nANYWAY\n\nSince non-fans wouldn't buy a DBZ game anyway, onto the juicy stuff\n\nThe game feels like a polished version of Battle of Z. Bringing up that trainwreck of a game is usually bad, but this game still feels like it... In the posative ways. By that I mean the lock-on, deathmatch style is back, rather than the tag-team from BT3. Also like BoZ you can revive teammates in the same way.\n\nLike everyone else is saying, they leave you in the middle of a small, clunky city off in the beginning with little introduction of what to do, and most of the world is locked off.\n\nThe city isn't necessary, that could easily be condensed into a small menu, don't be excited for that free roam. It's just slowly running around a clunky city (what is flying)\n\nThe roster size is pretty good. Nothing like BT3's monster of a roster, but still a nice size. We get some characters that aren't even memorable, too, like Raspberry (That sounded negative... I'll be honest, I ♥♥♥♥ing love when they give us a ton of more-obscure characters. It's so damn cool <3)\n\nYou can play as a number of races, each has a small stat boost in one area or another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYamcha has a fake-death supermove. Get this game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","February 27, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would also like a hair change between normal to super sayian my characters hair didn't change and I cried for a day because I grinded for 6 Hours trying to get SSJ. But the character creation is where this game shines and FINALLY a new DBZ story instead of the same rehashed story we always get. The fighting is SUPER fun but at times it got a little clunky but it was simplistic and made it fun for 1 v 1 matches locally because you could easily teach your friends. So overall this is my favorite DBZ game Sequel please.","August 13, 2015","true","41.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game let's you play through all saga's of the game (Like most other DBZ games) but you must fix the timeline of the DBZ Universe! You create your own character which gives you tons of customisation which I absolutely love and there is alot of replayability in this. I do wish that they added all Characters from the different DBZ movies and other characters from the show that we never saw like what Budokai Tenkaichi 3 did (Amazing game). I would love to see a DBX 2 in the future if it ever happens which im sure it will ;P Other than that I HIGHLY recommend this game to ANYONE who is a fan of the Dragon Ball Z Franchise!","September 22, 2015","true","118.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have had alot of fun going into the past and correcting history in the story, it is a bit short if you do alot of side quests between each missions but some missions are very hard and bery enjoyable. I love this game to death how you can get all these different ki blasts and fighting moves. The game is very enjoyable even after beating the main game and most side quests. i would reccomend this game heavily to Dragon Ball fans and i would still recomend this alot to all my friends. 8.5/10","September 13, 2015","true","153.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun I have had with it. The combat system isn't anything earth shattering but it is a lot of fun. The added RPG elements with gearing up, potions, and quest lines make for a great experience. The story was a typical DragonBall one, but it was fun to play through. The combat isn't particularly challenging, however there are a few frustrating fights. I haven't done any PvP so I can't comment on that side of the game.\n\nDBZ Fan = you'll like the game\nFighting game fan = you'll like the game\n\nI wouldn't buy it at full retail, but on sale it's a definite buy.","December 8, 2015","true","30.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
