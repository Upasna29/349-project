Well worth the price of admission if you're an arcade fan. Don't expect fancy graphics, movies or an intricate story, this is all speed and split seconds.","February 22","true","3.5"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","1"

The time limit. No matter if you pick course or stage, you have a time limit, and sadly theres no option for an endless mode where you can just race at your own pace to try to beat peoples times.\n2. The Spotlights. The night sections of some maps feature street lights, which completely obscure your vision.\n\nUltimately, its a good game, for a good price at 5.99, but I really cant recommend it once its out of the sale period. Theres six courses, and thats it.","February 23","false","0.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhomega/recommended/444000/","Rhomega","Rhomega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhomega/","267 products in account","Super Night Riders is a good throwback to the days of Outrun and the like, where the key is completing the course within the time limit, rather than winning a race. Getting into the game is very simple. Just choose your course or race, pick which one you want, choose 1 of 4 songs for background music, and off you go. The first thing you'll wonder is "What's the difference between courses and races?" Each has 6 legs to complete.\n\nCourses change the environment after each leg (Forest, Desert, City, Canyon, Valley, and Hanami, which is essentially Japan in winter), while also changing the time of day (Day, Sunset, Dusk, Night, Dawn, Sunrise).\nRaces take place in a single environment, with more emphasis on changing time.\n\nThe real obstacles are other motorcyclists. They aren't competing, but bumping into them will hurt your time (protip: don't be afraid to let off the gas on turns). Once you complete each course or race, you'll be placed on the online leaderboards. I do have one complaint: street lights, while atmospheric, make it difficult to see other bikers, which makes City and Hanami at Dusk and Night a little unfair. It's all pretty simple, so get on out there!","February 22","true","1.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

You're just gonna have to experience that yourself.\nBut it's really smooth and well made. (  I hope someone gets what I'm trying to say. )\nI have to warn you though, what you see in the trailer and the pictures above..\nThat is everything you're getting.\nDon't expect to find any cool mechanics or so called "secrets".\nIt's an arcade game, plain and simple.\nOh, another thing.. The game is extremely catchy for the eye.\nit is so C O L O R F U L .\nso, A E S T H E T I C .\n\nI'd say this game is well worth the money, if on sale. Maybe not so worth it at full price though.\nNot a lot of replay value and short on gamemodes, other than that it's a fantastic, cute little game.","February 23","true","0.5"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","8","18","2","0"
