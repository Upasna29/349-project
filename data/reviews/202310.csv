It managed to introduce a lot of new concepts, such as course construction set (with progressive unlock of building blocks), group racing, lots of cars, multiple modes, destructible scenes, and so on. However, with the shut down of the matchmaking servers in early 2015, buggy game (crash to desktop after several races), and odd handling (there is no tutorial on how drift works in this game) means the game, even at bargain basement prices, is not exactly a good investment.\n\nAs a new racer joining the scene in Shatter Bay, your task is to "take over" multiple neighborhoods by doing well or very well in the various races. Each neighborhood has about 7 races. Winning the races (or at least, get into top 3) will unlock higher races, while accumulating score will increase your rank and gain you access to better cars.\n\nThere are multiple race modes, but most races will be "domination race", where you race up to 11 other cars. Do the special moves like getting air, hit top speed, or drifting, will gain you boost. Once you fill the boost gauge, you can engage boost which allows you to smash through certain "targets", yielding shortcuts that gain you more boost (usually involve getting some big air) but since boost has limited duration, you have to time its use carefully. Smashing other cars will cause them to respawn, albeit several seconds behind.\n\nSo what's the problem? Very weird drifting mechanism. Some guides advocate holding down the handbrake button during the turn, others insist on releasing the handbrake as soon as drift had started. The problem is there is no "test track" for you to practice. It's always race, race, race.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, and as this is a Bugbear product (makers of Flatout series) the game has decent handling... except for the weird drifting. Sound is... okay, with a lot of decent soundtracks, again, just like Bugbear games like Flatout.\n\nYou were able to build your own race courses and as you conquer neighborhoods and raise your driver level you will unlock additional blocks to build the courses. However, with death of the matchmaking servers the courses are of little use now, as much of the fun is race others in MP games. In fact, the game is stuck for about a minute checking for nonexisting server when it starts up.\n\nAll in all, Ridge Racer Unbounded tried to do too much and lack of tutorial / test track made the game unenjoyable, and the shutdown of matchmaking server is the nail in the coffin. It's fast, it's furious, but it left an empty feeling.","May 23, 2015","false","2.7"," 78 of 99 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","78","99","3","0"

Ridge Racer™ Unbounded is none of those things.\n\nThis game differs from the rest of the series. A lot. You can actually drift off into wall and crash your car, or bump into your opponents in an attempt to take them out. There's a handful of game types you can play, from your typical race to the finish where drifting fills up your boost meter (Shindo racing), to causing as much damage to the city as you pass through it, including your opponents (Domination race).\n\nEach car has a unique feel to it, although most of them just slide all over the place, or can barely turn at all. The lower the "Drift", and the higher the "Handling", the easier to drive!\n\nThe graphics are simply beautiful. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the different shops in the city to the spot-on reflections on the cars. The weather changes the look and feel of the track in an immersive way, although there is no precipitation. My only complaint is that lighting effects are sometimes blindingly intense, especially at night, to the point where wearing sunglasses would almost make sense.\n\nThe music is upbeat and powerful, unfortunately we do not get a set of original tracks this time around. Ridge Racer™ Unbounded borrows a few tracks from previous games in the series, as well as songs from other artists.\n\nThe game features a fairly simple track editor, which reminds me of Accolade's Grand Prix Unlimited (DOS). Published tracks are uploaded online, where everyone has access to them. That's an infinity of maps to play on! I must admit, however, that most people are very uncreative when it comes to making custom tracks, but there's always a few gems in there. You just gotta find them!\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say much about the multiplayer experience. You can invite people from your Steam friends to play with you, but don't expect anyone else to join your game.\n\nI've encountered a few bugs here and there (glitching graphics, flipping cameras when boosting during a collision, and one area where you can drive off the map), but nothing major or game breaking.\n\nWhat I'd love to see in this game would be a better controller support (for non-Xbox 360 controllers), rural-themed tracks, and maybe a multiplayer lobby where all players can actually see who's online and play together!\n\nOverall, Ridge Racer™ Unbounded's title can be misleading, but it's still tons of fun, and has a high replayability value for a modest price. I recommend it to anyone who'd love a neat little pick-up-and-play urban-racing game.","May 6, 2014","true","172.9"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","46","54","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhantomStones/recommended/202310/","PhantomStones","Saladofstones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhantomStones/","1246 products in account","Its not a ridge racer game. Its burnout meets trackmania without a clear focus. The game is based around beautiful destruction physics but in order to destroy other cars, you need to drift, chase, or destroy items. Destroying items is worthless since you get a fraction of the boost needed, so you tend to be drifting a lot.\n\nHowever the ai just gains boost at a steady pace, meaning they will just boost whenever their meter is full. The boost itself is odd, its designed around strategic use to either power through a corner, destroy a city target to get more speed/shortcuts, or take out a racer but instead the game requires you to be constantly boosting in order to keep up. As well, there are no mechanics to allow players to catch up. None of the short cuts drastically change the map and the leader can use his boost to open it up anyways so there is no way for someone behind him to catch up unless he messes up.\n\nGiven the nature boost is gained, the late game is also to the favor of the leader as there are less targets available and players are more spread out.\n\nCombat is also weird. There are no rewards for damaging cars, and you don't get boost if you frag someone in a special way ala burnout. Also unlike later burnout entries, there is only one type of car per race. As a result, cars with good acceleration and speed trump all else since they can drift fine and use boost to make up for any lose of speed.\n\nThe game does have one very interesting part and thats the special events. These include some trackmania esque maps where you have to get to the finish line while hitting targets.\n\nBut what sells the game to me is the sense of destruction. The objects you destroy remain on the track making the track feel more and more wartorn and whenever you destroy a car you see an amazing slow motion view of it bouncing. It never got old for me.\n\nAs for the default levels, they are pretty generic and some end up being confusing since they reuse prefabs in an unusual way. The events aren't always balanced, either, some will prove to be a pain since you just don't have the right car for it or others are so easy because you can use a car that the level wasn't balanced for.\n\nThe star is the player-made levels, of which there are tons, which use the ingame editor and allow for a nice variety of fun and bizarre levels. The game to me seems like a case where there was a pre-existing game that was adapted with the ridge racer brand and then rushed into development.\n\nI say get the game if you like arcade destruction racing , the 10 dollar price tag is appropiate but with games like carmageddon and NCG, there are more focused alternatives.","November 18, 2014","true","26.4"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","4"

Aside from Ridge Racer Vita, R: Racing Evolution, and maybe Rave Racer, I've played all the games. I'm extensively familiar with the series, but that's irrelevant. Unbounded is...I don't know what it is. Was it some game Namco bought and then had some RR music and cars included to tie everything together? I don't know. So yeah, if I compare this game to RR, or hell if I so much has even mention that game, then I've lost.\n\nUnbounded takes place in Shatter Bay, where a mysterious group is involved in illegal street racing. Apparently they hate the city almost as much as they hate each other. This is one of those racing games where not only can you obliterate your rivals, but you can also bust through cafes, government buildings, and construction sites for a shortcut. The similarities to Burnout are pretty obvious, though in this game "checking" a rival is a bit more binary.\n\nBy catching air, drifting, and/or receiving various in-race awards, the player gets boost. Aside from a temporary increase in speed, anyone you run into during that brief period is going to get wrecked. This is about a 95% chance. If you're grinding next to someone (oh my) and you hit the boost, they're going to turn into flaming wreckage instantly. When not boosting you have a 5% chance of wrecking someone. This is a neat way to reverse all the dirty tricks that can happen in  a usual race. Say you're one of two racers making a turn. You're on the outside, and the inside guy is using you as a buffer to avoid hitting the wall. This is a great time to boost because they'll suffer dearly. Also whenever you wreck an opponent, the game auto-corrects your car, so you don't drive into a wall or anything. Exploiting this mechanic can be quite handy.\n\nYour opponents can boost as well, and aside from the red trail there's no obvious indication that they've boosted. Something like a sound effect could have been really useful. As it stands you're better off handling the other racers with kid gloves (especially if they're cheating AI), because they could boost at potentially any moment and take you out. Boosting is also necessary for certain destructable objects. Their usefulness in the actual race varies, and they could just as easily glitch out and cause you to flip over or get turned around. To unlock more races you have to amass a lot of points, destroying stuff is how you get them.\n\nThere are no shortage of tracks in this game. That's because they're all created via a track-editor. It's a neat idea but not really fleshed out. Basically each track is divided into sections. Let's say there is a straight-away, a curve to the right, a squiggly line, a hard-angle right, a dip, a long-easy right, a hairpin right, and that's the track. A lot of time in arcade-racers is spent learning the track itself, but with this game it doesn't seem to matter much at all. Instead you familiarize yourself with particular turns (the 1 or 2 difficult ones to be precise). While the track-editor allows further customization by adding objects and other tools, it's not as deep as it could be. Let's call it a limitation of the game-design. It's difficult to create ornate tracks when it's expected that a handful of racers are trying to destroy each other. There are a lot of created tracks floating around, and some are really interesting. Consider spending some time checking things out online.\n\nI don't like the handling. Normally I'd just tack this on to the end of a huge paragraph, but it's the #1 reason why I couldn't take anymore of this game. The main reason I don't like it is because it's inconsistent. With some games drifting has either A) a sizable learning curve, or B) can be picked up in the first few seconds. Both A & B work on their own. Daytona USA** is an A type, while Ridge Racer (I lose!) is a B type. Both games have appropriate learning curves, and mastering them is an exceptional feat despite the wildly different barriers of entry. Unbounded can't be an A type because the tracks aren't nearly as involved and well-designed. There's only so much you can do with such a base-selection of turns. Unbounded isn't a B type either because the cars have more weight, it takes more counter-steering not to lose control, and deciding between what type of brake to use to initiate the drift is more important. Essentially the system just doesn't gel for me, but I guess it doesn't matter.\n\nThis game apparently considers good drifting somewhere towards the bottom of "things you should actually be concerned about in a race". In the career mode there are very few time-attack races, and even then they have gimmicks like icons you pick up to freeze the clock. There are drifting events too, but you don't think about applying what you've picked up in an actual race. It's hard to appreciate a good drift in this game, when it's usually more effective to barrel through the opposition with a boost. Sometimes the winner is merely the racer that managed to get away from the chaos. More often than not, driving skill takes a backseat.\n\nAltogether Unbounded just isn't satisfying. It never flicks the "Hell Yeah!" switch in my brain. Quad-kills, surviving a brutally difficult platforming section, or just executing the perfect drift through the hardest turn, these are just some of the many "Hell Yeah!" moments. Unbounded has never in my 7 hours* of play elicited that same response. I do all these supposedly awesome things but it's just not exciting at all.\n\n*Yes I realize that by playing the game for a sizable amount of time, I've opened myself up to comments such as "If you didn't like the game, why'd you play it for that long?" I was ready to quit this game after 2 hours, but that wouldn't be fair would it? Although, I probably should have beat the game, but playing Unbounded for 10+ hours is just too much to ask of me.\n\nSorry.\n\n**In Daytona USA it's called power-sliding. It's the same but different. DETAILS.","October 9, 2014","false","7.0"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","1"

I am having an absolute blast playing it ! It's a lot of fun and quite challenging if you try to get all the stars for each track. There are over 60 races to complete and you can create your own tracks as well. The Multi-player  is shut down so don't buy it for online play.\n\nI have played many Ridge Racer games in the past and I loved R4 back in the day. Some may complain that this doesn't feel like a Ridge Racer game and they would be somewhat right. It's Ridge Racer to the extreme. The Ridge Racer game series needed to evolve with new gameplay and this game does that. It still has the Ridge Racer "vibe" with all the powersliding you can handle while listening to techno style music. But, it adds in destructible environments with alternate routes you open up by smashing through walls and buildings on each course. It also has opponent take downs like we have seen in games like burnout.\n\nAll of this destruction adds to your power/turbo meter. You can keep the meter filled up by causing destruction to the other racers and the environment. Keeping your meter maxed as often as possible is essential to winning races because the AI is not easy to beat. They drive well, boost often and will even "frag" you when you are ahead of them.  Even if you don't come in first you still get points so losing the race is not always a bad thing.\n\nIn additon to the main "domination" mode there are several other game modes to mix things up. There is a mode called "Shindo" that is a lot like recent RR games where you just get boost for powersliding and the envronment is less destructible. There's also drift attack, time attack and a "frag" mode where you try to destroy as many oponents as possible. All are fun in there own way and you can apply these modes to the tracks you create as well.\n\nMy biggest complaint with Ridge Racer unbounded is that there needs to be more options to change the graphics and control settings for the game. They are extremly limited and it's obvious this is a console port. The game still looks good but more settings for the PC version would have been appreciated. Other than that it's a solid arcade racer.\n\nOverall, the game is just plain fun and that's what counts to me. I don't understand why people don't like it. Maybe they are struggling to win the races. Some races are very difficult and require multiple attempts to win. As with other racing games it takes some practice to get use to the handling of the cars. Also, there is a  button for drifting and you should use it instead of the brakes to start your drift.\n\nMaybe the people who don't like it expect it to be like the older Ridge Racer games but I'm actually glad it's different than the previous games. Why make a new Ridge Racer game if it's doesn't add anything different ? Also, I don't care that the MP is dead. I don't play MP on many games anyway. So if your looking for a fun, challenging, over the top, arcade  racing experience give this game a try.\n\n8 out of 10","June 12, 2015","true","7.5"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","4"

The problem here, is that despite being an arcade racer, drifting is somewhat realistic, completely destroying whatever fun you could have with it.\nThe way the steering works, combined with the light height of the car, makes for really floaty driving. It feels off.\n\nDESTRUCTION\nLots and lots of meaningless destructibles, as you are given what is basically a tank in shape of a car, anything you see in the middle of the road can be destroyed, well almost everything.\nSure, I won’t deny its fun, It’s the way its implemented that feels lazy and inconsistent\nFor example, you win Nitro for hitting walls when drifting, which means you are being rewarded for being bad at it, but then you have random objects and even some destructible walls that don’t give you anything, except for a small amount of points, that only have purpose in Domination races and even then the quantity is so small it won’t even matter.\nIts unnecessarily confusing\n\nBOOSTING\nStill present is the boost for drafting, drifting and air time, and now by any form of physical contact with other cars\nIts then used too "frag" other cars or open hidden paths, and it’s a good way to win points as well, which you will need to unlock more races.\nFrom all of these, drafting is the worst way to gain boost, AI is significantly slower than you, making it so you only get a small amount before eventually leaving them behind\nEven though there’s more ways to win boost in this new RR, very rarely is it possible to stack boost after boost, since speed isn’t really encouraged in Unbounded.\nBoost is played more strategically, its not even related to speed anymore. Doesn’t seem like much but will lead to situations were slow moving cars can frag other vehicles or going at full speed to open an hidden path, only  to have the boost run out on you, leaving you to crash against the wall.\n\n\nEVENTS\nDomination races is where the game most shines, its were the game mechanics seem to work or even make sense.\nWhere drifting and Frag Attack are just broken, even to the point of exploitation, unless the point was to drive really slow, in which case I wouldn’t even know what to say\n\nMUSIC\nClassic RR songs that do not fit with the game at all, with Skrillex thrown in.\nIt would feel more authentic with other artists, not sure why the stopped there or even came choose that particular artist, but it’s something, at least\n\nDESIGN\nThe track design is quite good and the environments although not busy, are aesthetically pleasing.\n\nFew more things you should know if you are pondering on buying this game\n.if you are an achievement hunter, beware that the MP no longer exists but those achievements have not been removed, and cannot be unlocked in a fair and non-shameful way\n.There is no video options aside from Anisotropic and i wouldn't recommend touching that unless you want the game to crash after each race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","August 15, 2015","false","15.4"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","23","32","2","5"

Although drifting through a corner certainly gives you an amount of satisfaction, frustration with other elements are plentiful.

I have been a fan of the Ridge racer series since Rage racer hit the ps1 in 1997, I’ve loved the way cars can drift around corners at impossible angles and speeds...and how its all about the skill of drifting. THIS GAME IS NOT LIKE THE OLD RIDGE RACERS; in this game you can hit walls and it is not very likely you will keep your speed when you just turn and press the drift button, in unbound you have to control your car, or else you will be at the back of the grid. It also borrows from the burnout series with 'frags' (takedowns in burnout)...this adds another element to the exciting racing in this game. It is also made by bugbear (the makers of the flat-out series and Next Car Game), you can see game elements from flat-out throughout this game, as in the highly destructive environments and vehicle combat. The track-editor is also amazing, the editor lets you create many...MANY tracks in all different shapes with all different elements, the advanced editor lets you add ramps and explosives to the track you have created. Overall if you want a fun arcade racer to pass the time and have a lot of fun along the way, get this!! its a brilliant mix of many different racing games.","June 12, 2014","true","2.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rtuchiha/recommended/202310/","rtuchiha","Uchi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rtuchiha/","70 products in account","Ridge Racer: Unbounded was, to me, a very fun, yet repetitive racing experience.\n\n(Be prepared to read a VERY descriptive review. TL;DR is at the bottom.)\n\nThe game's introduction is very simple, and explains to the player how Shatter Bay came to be, only to turn into a urban playground for the Unbounded. As a beginner, the player is convinced by the hashiriya master to join the Unbounded, and seeks higher recognition by moving up the ranks.\n\nNow, if you've played any of the Ridge Racer titles preceding this one, you'll find that this particular title mostly leaves any traditional aspect of the older games in the dust. However, do note that Unbounded was produced alongside major game developer Bugbear Entertainment, the same folks behind the Flatout series and, most recently, Next Car Game: Wreckfest. Bugbear's role in developing Unbounded was one of the major factors in producing this game.\n\nThe single-player mode is very simple. The player has to race through the districts within Shatter Bay and dominate every one of them. These districts very in location and theme, from the lower parts to the docks to even the city center. Now, each district has a set of challenges that get tougher and tougher as the player moves from district to district. These events are filtered out into specific types, from the standard Domination Race to my personal favorite, Drift Attack. Unbounded also adds a ranking system to game, where you unlock more & more features by gaining EXP and moving yourself up higher on the list. Now, from my playthrough of Unbounded, I found that these challenges often felt a little repetitive, considering that they all take place within their respective districts and can only offer so much in terms of visuals.\n\nGameplay is where Bugbear's changes come into light. The physics system is completely different compared to traditional Ridge Racer titles, with drifting through corners feeling more realistic instead of the old-fashioned "go through a turn drifting at 300 km/h" approach. However, from my playthough experience, the physics of Unbounded are easy to adjust to, with a slight learning curve. There's new gameplay mechanics implemented into Unbounded, the most notable being Frags and Targets. Frags are the Unbounded equivalent of Burnout's Takedowns, where you can smash into another opponent in order to temporarily render them out of play. An awards system is also present, which gives awards to objectives you achieve as you're racing, such as hitting a particular Target or getting multiple Frags. Targets, however, pretty much lead me to my next point.\n\nThe game now introduces a destructive environment, where almost everything can be smashed into. DICE ain't got anything on the amount of buildings and coffee shops you'll be smashing through, as the amount of destruction the player will be causing to the city can put a smile on his/her face. And yes, there's explosions too.\nSmall explosions.\nBig explosions.\nMichael Bay-approved explosions.\n\nAside from the carnage, there's a game mode that I'd like to recall: Shindo racing. This is pretty much the standard racing game mode, where there's no frags and no driving into buildings. Instead, you race against other Shindo class opponents around the city, with the winner being the first across the line. The game also features Time Attack, where you race against the clock in order to beat the timer.\n\nOne of the game's bigger selling points is the track editor. This allows users to build up their own personal cities for other players to violently smash through. Track pieces are unlocked as the player progresses through the single-player and multi-player. However, I found that making a city isn't exactly the best time-investing thing to do, but the option will be there should I choose to do so.\n\nThis game often goes on sale, and when it does, it's very cheap. I picked up Unbounded with all the DLCs for less than $4 during the Steam Winter Sale of 2014. The game made up the $3.74 I paid for it quite well, providing a solid single-player experience with the added addition of multiplayer (which, admittedly, I haven't gotten to yet).\n\nTL;DR: Ridge Racer Unbounded is a game that I'd recommend as a means of trying new things. The revamped gameplay plus the added ability to create your own personal city to tear through offers a very entertaining experience for the racer fanatic. The single-player is a pretty decent experience, but it allows you to understand how the game works, so that you can begin dominating other players online.\n\n\n","January 10, 2015","true","15.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, the multiplayer would probably be the only reason to keep playing this game.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, this game is unlike any proper Ridge Racer game before it. Unbounded is trying to be something akin to a (pre-Paradise) Burnout but it falls short of being better than any Burnout game. The drifting mechanics aren't great and the cars you start with all feel heavy, clunky and slow (even the DLC cars). You don't get the drifting you come to expect from a RR and you don't get the speed you would expect from a Burnout.\n\nRR Unbounded is a game with an identity crisis and as a result it doesn't execute well in anything. I only got this game and some DLC for it as part of a Humble Bundle. With all the issues the game has on top of it's current multiplayer-less state, there is no way I can seriously recommend anybody spend any amount of money for this game.","August 8, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

After investing a large chunk of time into Split Second on my PS3, Ridge Racer: Unbounded felt immediately familiar, but different enough to make it stand out on its own. Split Second was super fun as racing games go, but I found the handling on the vehicles to be... not necessarily as advertised based on their stats. RR:U vehicles seem much more true to their description. Although a word of warning: A high drift score is, in my observation, not a sign that a car handles well under drift, even if it has a decent handling score. Rather, the drift score seems to indicate the willingness of the back end to swing out, so a car with max drift almost wants to drive in reverse after every single corner. These high drift cars require a delicate touch, and you'll end up facing the on coming field a lot until you get the subtleties down.\n\nContinuing the Split Second/RR:U comparision:  While I loved the destruction in SS, merely placing in many SS tracks required that you hit every single destructible. And to win, you often needed to having the timing of using the destructibles down just so, rather than just relying on your skills as a driver. RR:U gives you the option to destroy, and it's definitely encouraged both by adding to your score and it's potential for shaving a little off your lap times. And of course, it's just fun to do. But in the end, placing and winning comes down to what you do behind the wheel. There will be moments of frustration, like when you're in the lead and some AI jerk three positions back starts a chain reaction accident, costing you your hard earned spot at the top, but even that feels fun and exhilirating, and makes you want to try again. Gotta say though, the SS soundtrack was better IMHO. RR:U has this very generic bassy electronica that I would rather have than be without any music, but it definitely doesn't evoke anywhere near the same kind of emotional pulse pounding rush that the SS tunes did.\n\nMany will complain about the death of the online server, and I can understand that. But when I just wanna pick up and race, I don't really care. My only gripe is that the game was never updated to stop looking for it, so you waste more time than is necessary when the game first loads up, as it looks for a non-existent thing. It'd be nice if they came back and fixed that, maybe rewrote things so that the player community could host servers so we could still play online. But meh.... it's a small thing in my book, and I'm not a ginormous fan of online gaming to begin with, especially when play is strictly competitive.\n\nHavent' played with the editor yet so I can't speak to that, but I think it's a cool feature. Again, many will say it's nearly useless given the demise of online play, but I'll be interested to see what I can come up with anyway.\n\nOverall, as long as you're not looking for multiplayer mayhem, I definitely recommend it, though you might be well advised to pick it up on the cheap, or as part of a bundle. Lots of single player fun to be had, as long as you don't go in expecting the world.

And I love it! It switches the action around quite a bit which is nice but some of the things work better than others. The obstacle courses, frag attacks, and drifting challenges start to get tiresome but they really help when you’re driving the races. After a while the challenges get so challenging that restarting the tracks becomes your second nature in this game and you take it as part of it. The important thing is that the game rarely feels unfair. If you lost, it’s because you messed up.

Definitely worth the money, fantastic game with a lengthy career, amazing track editor and plenty of Michael Bay to keep anyone happy.\n\nOne game mode in particular known as 'Frag Attack' is very similar to the 'Road Rage' events found in Burnout, except you can drive through buildings... and cars burst into flames in slow motion and is definitely worth your time.\n\nYou can even create custom events of all game modes with a fantastic track editor. A basic, but entertaining example of this is:\n\n- Create a track with a lot of open space (this is done easily with pre-set assets)\n- Set game mode to frag attack.\n- Plant Petrol stations and explosives everywhere.\n- Let the destruction unfold.\n\n\nAside from this the game features a relatively difficult set of career events ranging from standard racing and destruction racing to drift and time attacks, set out in districts of a city with the objective of which to earn enough points to 'Dominate' the district - this is done by placing podiums, drifting, hitting objects, taking down opponents and smashing buildings.\nso if you like a challenge you should definitely give it a shot.\n\n\nClosest thing to Burnout since Burnout.\n10/10","December 27, 2015","true","28.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Drifting takes some getting used to. Well, lets just say that it's a lot easier if you pick the right car. Not all cars are created equal drift-wise and trying to win with a poor drifting car is more difficult than it should be. The game does not leave room for mistakes; one crash and you are in last place--so don't even bother trying to finish.\n\nThere are many things about this game that I do not like: 1) The initial cars are not only slow, but they all have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ acceleration and the AI cars will pass you like you are standing still. Not only that, but the AI cheats when they crash and will spawn in front of you at full speed. 2) All the cars look and sound the same. 3) The graphics have an annoying orange hue making it difficult to focus on the road. 4) There are only a handful of areas with multiple events, but each event pretty much uses the same racing map and there is very little variety. 5) Music is kind of hit and miss, some good, most bad.\n\nWith so many better arcade racers out there, this one is easy to skip.","September 6, 2013","false","8.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It reminds me of all the crazy racing games I played when growing up. I would just drive in the wrong direction and crash into everyone rather than try to win anything! It's focused more on action than simulation which is perfect for me. If you just want some fast paced action then give it a try. But be warned it takes some time to master. The racing relies more on your ability to create shortcuts by plowing through certain obstables and blowing up your opponents rathern than pure racing skill. The best way to get power points for a boost is to learn how to drift properly and destroying objects. It's the only ridge racer game I've ever played so I cant comment on whether not it lives up to its predecessors.","December 31, 2014","true","71.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is one of the better games out there, wish there were some multiplayer folks willing to give this a try but everyone loves Wreckfest NCG these days (which admittedly has far more realistic driving and physics). But this is fun too! Especially if you don't have a G27 wheel yet. I guess I'll try and find some other players who like it as much as I do.\n\nPros:\n- Great sense of speed, as long as you don't run into anything "non-destructible" in the environment, so it pays to learn the course.\n- Polished graphics, widescreen support via "Flawless Widescreen" thanks to HaYDeN, super fun with three monitors. The nVidia 3D surround works somewhat, it's much better than EA's pathetic "Need For Speed: Most Wanted" but of course nowhere near as good as it is in real simulation games like Assetto Corsa, Dirt or even Euro Truck Simulator (!).\n- Tons of cars to unlock, althoughthey all seem to handle very similarly, the only thing that matters seems to be speed and acceleration.\n- The AI seems to be very "rubber band" algorighm based, with somewhat suicidal tendencies (this could be good or bad, But overall the randomness aspect of it all keeps it fun, it's a bit like baseball -- 2/3 of the time nothing interesting happens, but when you get it right, it's a home run.\n- Lots of destruction, which is rewarded, so keep a lookout for those targets and try to have your boost ready to go when you hit them. Hitting them without boost feels pretty silly, errp!\n- Great singleplayer, lots of crazy tracks, frag challenges with a truck, quite a lot of fun trying to hit all the destructible stuff.\n- Community-generated maps can be downloaded too, and there's a map editor.\n- Great multiplayer races (if there were any players).\n\nCons:\n- Upbeat music, easy to switch tracks. There's scanner radio chatter or in-game commentary so it feels a bit isolated from real life compared to Burnout or NFS where the audio is somewhat better and makes the game more immersive.\n- Doesn't seem to be any car customization, except maybe the colour of the paintjob (similar to "NFS: Most Wanted").\n- The initial logon to the server takes quite a long time, and doesn't seem to be bypassable if you only want a quick singleplayer game.\n- Weird controls, but seems possible to get them to work eventually. Not sure if this game even supports the Logitech G27 wheel, I need to try. At the moment, I've only played it using "Better DS3" and a Sony DualShock3 (with a piece of elastic to hold the throttle/trigger down, otherwise my hand got tired accelerating all the time!).\n- It's kinda strange that bugbear hasn't provided any patch to fix the occasional crash when quitting the game, as they're normally amazingly careful about their code, you can see their thoughtful work on Wreckfest NCG.\n\nOverall, it's well worth it, especially if you get it in a Steam sale. Would be worth every penny if you can get a few friends together and play the hell out of it without any of those loony AI doing weird stuff.","December 3, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

However, If you're going to pay for this game, I implore you to look elsewhere.\n\nRidge Racer Unbounded (RRU) is a sad case example of how a great publisher like NAMCO BANDAI games has lost its identity in the contemporary video gaming world. If I would like to play Need for Speed (NFS), then I'll play NFS games. If I would like to play Burnout, then I'll play Burnout games. RRU is the very definition of identity crisis. It borrows the "career" mode of most recent NFS, but the concept end up as very linear and boring with no story lines. It borrows the destructible environment from the Burnout series, however, it does not borrow enough to make it slightly fun. Unrealistic drifting was always fun factor and also the trademark of RR series, however it is undeniably toned down in an attempt make the game more realistic. As a result, RRU racing mechanics become something that is neither realistic nor unrealistic. In short, this game is just not good from any aspect it try to sell. The developer copied aspects from other games, yet failed to make it any good. Worse, they also droped many fun aspects which make the original series fun. This game is basically a fail reboot, akin to the fail reboot of the Fantastic Four (2015) film.\n\n\nPS: NAMCO BANDAI games!!! If you, as a corporation, has allow any developer to bring your flagship RR series to fall this low, then how the mighty have fallen indeed.","August 28, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're an avid FlatOut fan, this game is not for you. But if you're looking for an arcade racing game to kill some time, then you won't be disappointed. It looks nice and can offer a relatively wide set of activities.\n\nHowever, there are some aspects of the game that I just can't cope with such as lack of immersion into the events of the story because there were no drivers in the cars. While playing the game I had the constant feel of loneliness as if I was riding the streets of an empty city.\n\nConsidering the difficulty I have next to zero complaints up to the later stages of the game when I had to plan my routes on TIME ATTACK events to guess what chain of actions developers had in mind for me to preform in order to get the gold medal. Also, it seems to me that preforming better than average in this game might backfire because you're going to progress too fast through the districts and you gonna get destroyed by fast cars until you raise your level enough to open a competitive vehicle.\n\nAnother thing that annoyed me was a cinematic camera during crashes. Sometimes when I had to activate POWER gauge right before breaking into some building, another racer would randomly touch my car and I instantly lose control of it because of the camera. Of course AI pilot considers a still intact object as an obstacle and tries to maneuver around it which in most of cases leads to a restart of the race.\n\nI like the idea, I like the graphical part, I like the color filters and oh I love the editor. However, I was expecting more from this game. It had potential, but it isn't offering enough for a solid project. I do hope that in the future, when and if developers will start working on the next game in the series, they're going to put more effort into filling their project with life.","February 20, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

However, If you're going to pay for this game, I implore you to look elsewhere.\n\nRidge Racer Unbounded (RRU) is a sad case example of how a great publisher like NAMCO BANDAI games has lost its identity in the contemporary video gaming world. If I would like to play Need for Speed (NFS), then I'll play NFS games. If I would like to play Burnout, then I'll play Burnout games. RRU is the very definition of identity crisis. It borrows the "career" mode of most recent NFS, but the concept end up as very linear and boring with no story lines. It borrows the destructible environment from the Burnout series, however, it does not borrow enough to make it slightly fun. Unrealistic drifting was always fun factor and also the trademark of RR series, however it is undeniably toned down in an attempt make the game more realistic. As a result, RRU racing mechanics become something that is neither realistic nor unrealistic. In short, this game is just not good from any aspect it try to sell. The developer copied aspects from other games, yet failed to make it any good. Worse, they also droped many fun aspects which make the original series fun. This game is basically a fail reboot, akin to the fail reboot of the Fantastic Four (2015) film.\n\n\nPS: NAMCO BANDAI games!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D-Fenz/recommended/202310/","D-Fenz","D-Fenz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D-Fenz/","222 products in account","Introduction\n\nIn the realm of racing games, competition is tough. However quality control in that said same category is lacking in my mind  There are too many racing game out there, and most of them suck or were great once, but then began to suck. Like it is with all the countless titles released under the banner of the NFS series, just to name one racing series.\n\nFor me NFS SE R&T Edition, NFS 2 (SE), NFS 3, NFS High Stakes, Underground 1+2, Most Wanted and Carbon were brilliant untill Undercover "happened".Then it just started to slip and fall down this downward spiral, resulting in one terrible release after the other.\n\nRegardless, it can be difficult as a developer to keep your head above water. This is mostly because of consumers, demanding products to be better than before, while still urging developers to remain almost conservatively true and loyal to the previous released titles. I can understand that from the consumers and the devs POV, being a gamer myself, with a most of my free time spent from an early age to present day, in front of my PC (and consoles alike), playing computer games and will continue to do that as long as I can.\n\nI have not played any of the previous Ridge Racer games, so I knew little about them. Nor did I play any of the Burnout games, before I tapped in to the vain of Burnout Paradise. Some say, to quote Jeremy Clarkson, that this game is NOTHING like the previous games, and I would not know, nor do I care.\n\nSo what about the game?\n\nThis game is quite good, very cliched, but good. Cliched because of the story. The setting is some random tech-noir-Sci-Fi near future city from what I understand, with some rebels racing to really stick it to "The Man" and fighting the power....by racing and destroying the city they want to change....Yeah okay. But nevermind the story. Nobody plays a racing game for the story. You play it for the racing dammit.\n\nThe story is Mirrors Edge meets P.O.D (and no not the band alright!!!) meets Watchdogs I guess.\n\nAs you might already know, this is an arcade racer. Keep in mind, that this is not a racing simulator.\n\nOne less great thing about the game is the sense of speed. I have to agree with Total Biscuit, in that the sense of speed is lacking and is quite poor. The speedometer might say 200+ kph, but it feels more like you are doing less than 150 kph at most times and some of the cars accellerate seems to accellerate very slowly.\n\nThis might be a minor thing for some, but I am a racing game fan and that matters to me. However, as you progress in the game, the cars become faster and this means that the sense of speed becomes better, but it will hardly take your breath away.\n\nAestically the game is graphically impressive, especially at levels that play in the night time in the city. The soundtrack is decent with your stereotypical cheap-bad taste-generic-mediocre-up tempo tween Dubstep techno ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t soundtrack like Skrillex. The soundtrack nevertheless fits the game quite well. The engine sounds are rather cheap though. They do not sound very authentic.\n\nGameplay is straight forward, no nonsense racing, where it is mostly about getting there first and in one piece. You can smash through certain areas of the map Michael Bay style, with loads of explosions and lighting effects\n\nYou also have stunt races, frag races (Yes, this game uses the term frag!!) and race where you race a semi-truck, with the objectives of destroying and crashing police cars, chasing you.\n\nThe cars feel very heavy and sometimes even clunky. No open world here. You pick a race from one of the unlocked locations and proceed until you have gained enough XP to let the game progress and unlock new cars, districts and levels.\n\nThe game is not easy, but it's far from being as difficult as some would have you to believe. Stop crying, there is NO BATHROOM, you little girlie men. If you have trouble progressing or win races, just keep on replaying the level you have trouble with and practice. It's that simple.\n\nOne tip I have is to save your boost. Not for fragging opponents, because that does little really. Save it for when the game prompts you for smashing through certain areas of the level you racing. This gives you the maximum amount of XP. These destructible set pieces act sometimes as shortcuts too, allowing for an easy overtaking and win.\n\nThere are better arcade racing games out there, like Burnout Paradise, Split/Second Velocity (hella good game btw...just awesome) or Flatout Ultimate Carnage (also a little arcade racer gem a la Destruction Derby meets NASCAR with more redneck destruction action) e.g. and all of the above surpass and overshadow Ridge Racer by several car lengths (pun intended).\n\nI still recommend this game. It does the job well, but nothing more than that. Do not buy this game unless it is on sale. The current asking price is not worth it. No game on Steam is worth to buy at full price if you ask me.\n\nI give it 7/10.","June 17, 2015","true","17.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Handling's pretty good, action-filled gameplay, excellent track editor. Sounds like a good game, so why's it a downvote?\n\nRidge Racer: Unbounded (keyword: "Ridge Racer") is a spin-off, spun too far off track from the Ridge Racer project, as in not in the main series, and not made by the actual developers of Ridge Racer either mind you, but Bugbear. Yes, those people. Flatout. Wreckfest.\nWhat is a spin-off? Probably depends who you ask, but to me it's a game that strays away from the main series, maybe experimenting a little bit by changing up the main gameplay formula. And hoo boy, let me tell you... it sure changed.\n\nThat's my main problem with Ridge Racer: Unbounded, it strayed WAY too far off from what Ridge Racer really is.\nRidge Racer is a high-speed, nitrous oxide filled drift-racing experience, and this game really just doesn't capture that timeless Ridge Racer feeling. The drifting is weird in comparison, it's definitely not as fast-paced and you're driving like a maniac.\nNow don't get me wrong, many a person could probably describe the way you drive in Ridge Racer games as a way a maniac drives, but in Unbounded you take it to the n-th degree by pulverizing your opponents, literally just smashing them off the track. It really, really just feels like a Burnout game.\n\nIt'd probably do great as a Burnout spin-off. But then again, EA games would probably never allow this much creative freedom. So again, it's not a bad game, it's just that it really, really feels weird knowing it's named "Ridge Racer", because it's so much but Ridge Racer. Do I recommend it as Ridge Racer? Absolutely not! Do I recommend it as a game? Sure, it's alright.\n\nI have to admit, it's a decent play once in a while, so play it if you're not expecting Ridge Racer.","July 15, 2015","false","10.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Don't expect a racing sim, but just a fun arcade racer with lots of explosions and drifting. That's actually one of the features Ridge Racer is known for; drifting. But, in this game it works a bit differently. Normally, in previous RR games, you could easily drift around the map. However, Unbounded has a lot of maps with tight corners so there's a lot less drifting.\nIt has a length of about 8 hours, and even more if you want to finish every race with 3 stars.\nGraphically it's nothing special. There are a limited number of video options. It does look good, just not great. And the entire game (except the final map) has an orange glow. Also, the maps aren't all that different from each other. Different layouts but always the same buildings and corners. A bit disappointing.\nAnyway, I really hated the dubstep music and the engine sounds all sounded the same to me. And I normally can't tell the difference, so you can imagine what it's like.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","May 13, 2012","true","7.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you're a pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Phil Fish-like) that can't think about it without being an insufferable ♥♥♥♥♥♥, please kill yourself.\n\nNow, the game itself. 5/10 at best. It's fun at moments, but there are so many broken mechanics that at the end it's only pain and frustration. Which raises the question of why is Ridge Racer Drftopia based on this game?\nGraphically, it's alright. A bit orange, and the bloom is sometimes overdone, but it's still a nice game to look at. Sounds are good.\n\nBut the gameplay, first you have to use the "drift button", which is basically a glorified handbrake that magically sets the angle of the car around a corner. Counter-intuitive but not hard to get it right. Then you learn about "frags", mainly done using the Boost and hitting an opponent. But a light tap with the boost will do more damage than a huge crash with no boost. Also, if you hit a car that has its boost activated, you are fragged. A collision between the front of the car and a wall, no matter what, will be a crash.\nThe difficulty is horrible, some of the latest "frag attack" (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car, unlimited boost, and opponents to destroy) are a nightmare, the drift events are extraordinary hard and not helped by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ drift gameplay, where the cars that are already quite slippery in normal races become even worse.\nA central part of the game is destruction. Many parts of the world can be destroyed, but god knows what and how. Some walls can be destroyed, but some tiny columns can't. A same prop can be either breakable or unbreakable depending on the context. Some of the "targets" (big destructions worth more points and sometimes freeing shortcuts) make no sense, and only the first hit needs to made using boost. The next lap you can go through the same wall without boost and be fine.\nEvery car feels heavy and understeers at all times, but if you press the handbrake then it starts spinning around. The physics engine is missing, jumps and collisions usually end up in bouncing around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nMultiplayer is dead, but there are still cities being created and the hourly challenges are still working.\n\nIf could've been much more, but at the end it's not a Ridge Racer game and it's not really that fun.","August 22, 2013","true","49.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I wish someone would just go the extra mile and include all the features in Burnout Dominator and nail the whole Burnout experience, but it's a throwback to the Burnout type racing games worthy a checking out. I don't think it will hold anyone's attention for too long, and servers are down so I wouldn't know if the online experience imporves things, but as a budget title, it's well done enough.  I've seen enough in one hour to thumbs up it during the developer's sale. There's always room for more racers on my hard drive.

Type 4 was awesome but since then the next titles haven't been quite as good but still passable arcade racing games from the land of the rising sun.\n\nI believe this is the first western Ridge Racer and it shows. It not as fun. Its slow, the drifting is awkward and the tracks aren't anything like the typical Ridge Racer which makes its quite bland and boring. Its understandable considering it focuses more on a destructive outset with the chance to destroy buildings to make shortcuts but its not nothing special. Its similar to Burnout but that was a much better game with a superior choice of cars, modes, better track designs and the amazing crash mode. I've disliked how they've moved on to the open world of Paradise City and to me Unbounded is a missed opportunity. The online... even though I detest almost every online feature to be a waste of resources of many games is really pointless so all the time I've having to wait a couples of minutes for the game to figure out that the games been swept away for another failed Ridge Racer, and free to play too ironically.\n\nI'm not sure if I would reccommend RR: Unbounded, its worth a try for anyone if its ever on discount but from the arcade racers its not the most fun I've played to be honest and I can't go through it anymore.

It seems to have identity crisis and it doesn't seem to be able to choose - or it wants to be NFS or Flatout. By not establishing itself - it competes with those titles while failing to deliver on par with them. I would definitely prefer a racing game without essentially useless (unpredictable) destructible environment and weird physics (on one occasion my car went into air after driving over knocked sign or some debris) or game similar to Flatout, but not this hybrid.\nAt first - I was enjoying this game, but after playing more I will definitely not recommend this game as it is less than sum of its parts.","June 14, 2014","false","6.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I can't say a single good thing about this game.. And to think I actually payed around 50€ for this piece of ◘◘◘◘! This and several other games have taught me NOT to buy ANY game on release and full price.\nCons:\n- AWFUL HANDLING (the main reason I can't stand this game) because of this the game is unplayable\n- There is NO map so you have no idea what kind of turn will be next and should you drift or not.\n- Music is just boring. The best track is scary sprites and nice monsters by Skrillex and that says a lot.\n- The graphics aren't even that good..\n- No car customization (other than color change) or even rotating and viewing them while selecting a car so no eyecandy for you.\n\nPros:\nehh.. umm... can't really think of any.\n\nI did not try the multiplayer but with handling like this why would I bother...\n\nDon't buy this.

And it seems you unlock more parts for the track editor as you race in single player. So it has a nice side incentive to racing.\n\nMultiplayer doesn't work and the servers have been taken down.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varstahl/recommended/202310/","varstahl","Varstahl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varstahl/","438 products in account","A racing game as directed by Michael Bay. I bought RRU cheaply while knowing some several bad critiques, so I came expecting nothing, and indeed nothing I got.\n\nThe drifting compared to previous iterations or other racing games is stupid to say the least. Using a controller take a turn, keep B pressed to increase the angle, release B to reduce the angle. You could rubber band the gas trigger, it would play the same.\n\nThere is some kind of boost which does not speed you up, but make you immune and able to oneshot and make other cars explode in thin pieces. Which can also happen to you btw. In front of the finish line. While you're first. With your car passing the finish line in a debris state, having several second delay cause of being FRAGGED and being respawned behind the line and finishing 3rd/4th at best if they don't frag you again.\n\n"New game mechanics are fun", I thought to myself, "why did they complain?" Well, they complained because this game lacks to provide a minimum of enjoyment. RRU is basically a grind through a set of events to be completed more or less in order. You could pretty much ending up locked out of races because reasons. Also while you drive you are tasked to run through buildings destroying them, still for reasons. The game offers a lot of 90° turns with no basic control over the drift, and it's so bad that even AI fails to take those turns most of the time.\n\nI was about to give it a "meh" review, if it wasn't that on my PC (which is far from being low spec'd) the game crashes while in full screen. And, while in windowed mode, the taskbar shows up. They didn't even get that part right.\n\nAlso there is no minimap ingame, so you cannot plan your turns strategically as per… like… any other racing game, ever. You also have health like your other opponents, but that information is also missing from your HUD.\n\nIn the 2-3h I played this game I chewed up a good portion of the so called campaign, not once I had some fun. I dare think there's none to be had here, unless you like to destroy buildings and cars and not caring about actual driving, in which case this game might be right up your alley. It totally isn't up my alley though.","September 9, 2014","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I've played a lot of racing games. I mean, I sat here literally for 45 minutes just trying to beat the first damn race and the computer literally cheated just to beat me. And I'm not talking about a simple one or two cars passing me after a quick crash, I'm talking all 11 other cars. And between the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and half-♥♥♥ drifting mechanic, you crash a lot in this game. While trading paint with other cars feels pretty decent, it just isn't satisfying when I can literally smash a guy into one of those indestructible walls and he'll just kind of squeeze out between me and the wall. One good thing I can say about this game is that I actually feel like I'm going fast, which in most racing games these days is a shocker because the environment just kind of creeps by. Also, the amount of destruction you can actually cause in this game is fantastic. But overall, I shouldn't have to try so damn hard in the very first race just to get third because the game has its worst cars move faster than you do.

I enjoyed the time I spent playing, although I have a lot of complaints.\n\nThe game occurs in a place called shatter bay where you pretty much participate in races and other challenges to prove you're the best driver on the road. You can even make your own courses. But since the servers are gone you can't share them or race anyone online.\n\nNow for my complaints\n\nVery little variety\n\nThe cars have a very small selection of colors to choose from, 4 max. The DLC cars get no color change options at all. All of the areas look similar, but they each have something to make them stand out from the other areas. For example Ghost Bay (the final area) is just every area combined, but the area is a lot darker than normal. The gameplay is pretty much Burnout's.\n\nDrifting\n\nI think the drifting in the game needs work, a little too much force and you spin out of control and it's tough to get back into control without resetting your car's position.\n\nFragging\n\nI know some cars aren't very strong but geez one touch and my car gets totaled at times in the game. I feel like strength doesn't even matter because I can take out one of the strongest cars with the immortal, which has the lowest strength in the game, with ease.\n\nNot that many cars\n\nThere is a car that you can only use during the last event in the game\n\nThe DLC cars are just reskins of other cars, same stats, same look, everything.\n\nRegardless I think the game is very fun. I don't suggest buying the DLC if you plan on purchasing the game.","September 16, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sound effects is great. But the soundtracks make me cringe.\n\nOpponents have a nasty habit of coming out of nowhere. And there's no clue to how your car is doing except for the "critical damage" warning and a flame bursting out of your engine bay. By then it's too late because a poke from an opponent will detonate you.\n\nThe game puts emphasis on drifting, but drifting is like trying to drive on top of a frozen oil. Most of the time the only thing that would get you driving straight again is when you hit a wall. If you spin out (and you WILL spin out), then God help you. The opponents are going to make frag you again and again and again until you find yourself in last position in the final lap.\n\nThe 'power' mechanics (basically a turbo boost + invulnerability) is unreliable. Duration is too short and when all racers in sight are using it simultaneously, it's practically useless.\n\nThe tracks are littered with opportunities to get airborne, but coming off at the wrong angle will send you corkscrewing through the sky, into a wall, spiralling down, and back onto the track facing the wrong way. You get no points for that by the way. And as with the spinning out above, be prepared to restart the race.\n\nAll in all, I regret spending money on this.","September 17, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpletentacle/recommended/202310/","purpletentacle","Purple Tentacle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpletentacle/","3719 products in account","It's a fun racer, but there is more than one hair in this soup:\n\nThe technical issues are rather minor: No cloud support and literally zero settings to adjust the graphics beyond their resolution. But the art direction of the title is mostly quite elegant and it looks and runs well, so these are more representative of a lack of effort than any serious problems.\n\nOne of the problems is the drifting: It's a game all about drifting, it's the core mechanic and what the series is known for, so it's the one thing they had to absolutely get right. But I'm not sure they did, at least not entirely - it ended up both unrealisitc and surprisingly hard to control.\nUnrealistic drifting in an arcade racer isn't a problem, sacrificing realism for speed, control and fun is what you expect.\nIn RRU it requires some skill to learn and master its magic-physics based drifting mechanic - and you stand zero chance in the game until you have wrapped your brain around it. And the game certainly doesn't help you with that at all.\nHowever, this will eventually happen and once it clicks, the game mechanic works reasonably well.\n\nThere is neither a difficulty curve nor any difficulty settings. The AI knows only one mode and it's merciless. Screw up once and you can restart the race in many of the (not even that short) events and its easy to screw up: in good old Bugbear fashion you can drift out of 80% of all curves without losing any speed and the remaining 20% (often placed right enar the finish line) will kill you and effectively end any chance of winning a race - there is no rewind mechanic either. There's a fine line between satisfyingly difficult and unfairly punishing and this game walks this line like Barney Gumble.\n\nI found it shockingly hard to advance in the beginning - now that I unlocked almost all of the tracks and cars and learned the mechanics I'm dominating many of the later events left and right. But returning to some of the earliest races, with better cars and much improved skills and I'm still unable to properly pass them. That's what I meant when I said something went terribly wrong in playtesting.\n\nThe AI is weird. There doesn't seem to be any rubber banding (although it feels like they somehow speed up near the finish line, almost like the opposite of rubber banding) and they aren't overly aggressive (it may frag you once per race so you can get points for fragging your "rival") but they are also completely inhuman: They never create any shortcuts (the other core mechanic of this game) but readily take them if available, basically make zero mistakes, take some corners faster than they should be able to and are generally very fast.\nIt just feels unnatural and at times just punishingly unfair.\n\nThere are other little details, for example the displayed speed. While RRU certainly conveys a good sense, the speed of your car bears almost no resemblance to the speed actually displayed on the screen.\n\nThe tracks look nice and are fun to drive, but since they are all made from the same building blocks and all have the same setting the "infinite possibilities" end up feeling a lot more samey and repetitive than those of other racers.\n\nThis all sounds a lot harsher than it should be: The more I play the more I'm enjoying this game and there are many times when I'm having a blast. And it keeps drawing me back in. Much like "The Binding of Isaac" I disliked it at first but it constantly made me come back for more.\n\nI certainly got my money's worth and then some out of this game, so I guess at this point I should fully recommend it. I'm not disappointed by what I got, but more by some this game's wasted potential: With a bit more polish, some extra playtesting and some better decision making during the development process this could have been a classic - as it stands it's fun but flawed.","July 24, 2013","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You gain power (which is basically your boost meter) by drifting, chasing/drafting behind opponents, catching air, etc. When your power bar fills, you can boost, frag opponent racers (essentially wreck them), and destroy targeted parts of the track. The track editor is a unique feature where you can use parts to create your own cities (You can even go online and race in cities that other players have created). The main game mode consists of a series of races across several districts throughout the city.\n\nUnfortunately the game just falls too short.\n\nThe race types are pretty slim, ranging from destroying opponents while racing, destroying a set number of racers within a time limit, to time attack, to drift attack and normal racing without destruction. The handling is pretty bad. Gone is the drifting from previous RR games. It feels more like NFS The Run or NFS Rivals. A.I. is a bit unbalanced. Some of the track designs are pretty bad (like smashing through a shortcut only to fly straight into a wall and crash).

And while they do require practice & nuance to do well in Unbounded, they just never feel good to pull off, and feel wildly inconsistent most of the time.\n\nAfter I figured-out the drifting was something I didn't enjoy (even when I got decent with them), I tried to just race clean & fast, and take corners with an optimal driving-line instead. And surprisingly, it worked-out, and I actually got rewarded for finding ways to take tough corners at optimal speed (even just barely touching a wall can knock-off a lot of your momentum). Not something I expected from an arcade-racer, and I got some enjoyment out of that aspect.\n\nAnd now, the issue of rubber-banding: Surprisingly, Unbounded does NOT have it. Or, at least, I couldn't tell if it was there. If I raced really well and maintained optimum speed on corners, I would usually be 2-or-3 seconds ahead of my opponents, and I'd stay that far ahead for the duration of the race - they'd only encroach if I messed something up. Although, courses with lots of straight-aways are another story: They usually inexplicably sped ahead of me during long stretches of track, even if I was way ahead of them on the last corner. Not a huge issue, but it can feel unfair when the AI magically speed past you if the finish-line is at the end of a long piece of track.\n\nWhat I want out of a racer is either a) an authentic simulation that rewards good driving or b) a crazy arcade game that still has its nuances. Unbounded doesn't deliver either for me. Its drifting feels really bad, so that cuts-out the arcadey-but-naunced aspect for me. And the physics & handling are too arcadey to make optimal driving-lines feel good, so it's not in the authentic category either. It feels like a strange game that has no identity.\n\nUnbounded's definitely not a bad game by any means, but there are many, many other better racers out there.

Drifting is inconsistent and seems to not work consistently, sometimes you don't drift at all and sometimes you do a spin. Collision damage seems unpredictable, sometimes you'll wreck another car with a tap and sometimes you'll hit them at high speed while boosting and get nothing for it.\n\nAlso, too many obstacles that slow you down (rather than destroy you). The game tries to be fast paced, but obstacles that force you to stop/spin around/slow down massively ruin the flow. Seems like to get the pace it wants a collision should either wreck you, or slow you down a tiny bit. You end up wasting time trying to turn a sluggish-♥♥♥ car around, wishing you'd hit the obstacle that little bit harder to get wrecked because then you'd get back in the race faster.","August 6, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/202310/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","I'm not quite sure what I expected with Ridge Racer: Unbounded. The title sounded cool and I had heard decent things a few years back, but I never realized that Namco Bandai had tried their hand at a Burnout game. When I first loaded the game, I was delighted that this was taking a more destructive approach to racing.\n\nAfter I finished the first event, I knew something was very wrong. The previous Ridge Racer games were all about speed. Tight turns, tighter controls and hilariously awful translations; that is what gave Ridge Racer it's charm. All of that gets thrown out the window for Unbounded in an attempt to modernize the series.\n\nThe graphics are darker and more realistic; the pace has been slowed a bit and the cars feel far too weighty. Drifting, which is an integral part of the track design, is so ♥♥♥♥ing busted that I nearly quite in fury a few times. Busted explains a lot of things with Unbounded, but it applies more to the controls then the areans you'll be tearing apart.\n\nThe biggest thing with Unbounded is the destructible environments. I have to give credit where credit is due, Unbounded does offer an impressive amount of course carnage. While the props are basically styrofoam, you car can glide through things and not immediately crash. Sadly, that's about the only decent thing in the tracks.\n\nAs for static buildings, your car typically gravitates towards them. Barely clipping them will usually cause your car to smash up, but sometimes you go flying through the air or spinning in circles. While that should be realistic, the game has an awful tendency to reset your car before your crash site. This causes a tremendous amount of wasted time in Time Attack events and often causes you to lose up to 7 places in race mode.\n\nSpeaking of which, despite boasting 7 different race types, the game really only features three distinct challenges. You have a race mode where you can destroy everyone and one where that is disabled. You have frag attack, which sees you smashing up other cars; then there is time attack, which barely shows up and is the only challenge without other opponents.\n\nThese should be fun, but the physics and AI of the game are so borked that I couldn't wrap my head around them. At times, you fly out of the gate and pass everyone with ease. Other times, the opponents are beyond hard and you'll hardly notice them. Sometimes you'll smash through highlight objects only to immediately crash once the automated cutscene ends. You'll even make jumps only to see your car barrel rolling through the air, despite not clipping anything.\n\nThere is also some horrible graphical glitch that causes constant flickering for upwards of 15 seconds at a time. It obscures some of the track and leads to wiping out or missing turns. It also looks terrible and gives me a headache, but that may be a personal issue.\n\nWhat isn't personal is information about your cars. The stats are shown before you decide on your vehicle, but they aren't really reliable. Maybe this has more to due with individual playstyles, but the car with the highest speed stat should be the fastest one on the track.\n\nThere are also some cars that are carbon copies of others (excluding the pointless DLC) and others, still, that have mostly the same stats, but are higher in key areas. It makes certain cars completely worthless after reaching a certain driver level.\n\nThen there is the lack of course diversity and the general sluggishness to the controls. It just doesn't feel pleasant to play Ridge Racer: Unbounded. I had fun at times, but not enough for me to recommend this to anyone. The lackluster campaign and hilariously anti-climactic ending just rub salt in the wound.\n\nThe online portion is completely non-functional. From the sound of what it included, it could have remedied this package. Racers were given the ability to customize events and challenge others worldwide. While it may have been frustrating to deal with the controls, I could see smashing people into walls as being a blast.\n\nStill, that doesn't work. Namco Bandai shutdown the servers earlier this year and have basically cut the game in half. The price tag, at least, reflects the lack of multiplayer, but it still sours the overall package. Having courses made by other players would be a dream, even if the game feels rushed.\n\nOverall, I just wouldn't bother playing this. Unless you just have a fondness for the Ridge Racer name, there isn't much here that hasn't been done better in other racers. Unbounded mostly made me pine for a new Burnout or to return to Burnout: Revenge on Xbox 360.\n\n3/10","September 26, 2015","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe beacuse rather then huge open roads your tied to a tight city with lots of 90 degree bends it just never happens unless your lucky and get a high way section in your race. It also commits the sin of locking cars to just some events so unlike just about every past Ridge Racer some cars you just cant take with you between races. Also it for some reason has a tiny sample of colours to pick from IF your even aloud to pic a colour.\n\nAlso I feel like the take out system is almost luck based I hit some guys full T-Bone style and ran a few into walls doing nothing while just touching others burst them into flames.\n\nI was actually shocked to see the Bug Bear name on the loading screen as Wreckfest is currently shaping up to be a great game.

It features gameplay mechanics extremely similar to GRID; destructible environments, destructible cars, and drifting. Fans of the series might be disappointing with this installment of the game, as it is completely different and essentially acts like a GRID wannabe, as well as far more DLC than is needed. The game itself is boring and uninspired, with no real sense of progression. Fans might also be disappointed with the fact that the cars are no longer fictional.\n\n\n• Analysis •      Story ~ 1✬ / 6✬\nNo real plot involved with this game: just an all out destruction fest to get money and buy cars.\n\nGameplay ~ 2✬ / 6✬\nRidge Racer: Unbounded features gameplay features not too dissimilar to GRID and other such titles. While having a few bugs, it has no sense of progression, essentially requiring you to destroy the city and surroundings to gain points and to unlock further similar races. It does feature some other types of modes where you have to drift and gain points with a time limit ticking, and another where you drive a truck, although both are seldom. The car also functions unintuitively and could get frustrating.\nIt is also worth to mention that the multiplayer feature is simply dead, as the servers have been shut down. Anything that requires a server to be accessed is unusable.\n\nMusic & Sound ~ 3✬ / 6✬\nThe music in Ridge Racer: Unbounded is mainly compose of remixes and former viral songs, with seemingly no original compositions. Essentially, you've likely heard half the soundtrack already just being on the internet.\n\nGraphics ~ 4✬ / 6✬\nThe graphics in Ridge Racer: Unbounded are clean and beautiful, but certain models could glitch, especially the cars when they suffer damage. The interface and the overall design while driving is only slightly reminiscent to previous Ridge Racer games, but mostly inspired by other games.\n\n\n• TL;DR • + Lots of missions and gameplay.\n+ Upbeat music.\n- The focus is destruction, not racing.\n- Multiplayer and anything related to it is dead.\n- Far too much useless DLC.\n- Copies GRID, DIRT, and Need For Speed.\n- Unoriginal music, essentially a mixtape.\n- Glitched controls.","January 2","false","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed the time I spent playing, although I have a lot of complaints.\n\nThe game occurs in a place called shatter bay where you pretty much participate in races and other challenges to prove you're the best driver on the road. You can even make your own courses. But since the servers are gone you can't share them or race anyone online.\n\nNow for my complaints\n\nVery little variety\n\nThe cars have a very small selection of colors to choose from, 4 max. The DLC cars get no color change options at all. All of the areas look similar, but they each have something to make them stand out from the other areas. For example Ghost Bay (the final area) is just every area combined, but the area is a lot darker than normal. The gameplay is pretty much Burnout's.\n\nDrifting\n\nI think the drifting in the game needs work, a little too much force and you spin out of control and it's tough to get back into control without resetting your car's position.\n\nFragging\n\nI know some cars aren't very strong but geez one touch and my car gets totaled at times in the game. I feel like strength doesn't even matter because I can take out one of the strongest cars with the immortal, which has the lowest strength in the game, with ease.\n\nNot that many cars\n\nThere is a car that you can only use during the last event in the game\n\nThe DLC cars are just reskins of other cars, same stats, same look, everything.\n\nRegardless I think the game is very fun. I don't suggest buying the DLC if you plan on purchasing the game.","September 16, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The title sounded cool and I had heard decent things a few years back, but I never realized that Namco Bandai had tried their hand at a Burnout game. When I first loaded the game, I was delighted that this was taking a more destructive approach to racing.\n\nAfter I finished the first event, I knew something was very wrong. The previous Ridge Racer games were all about speed. Tight turns, tighter controls and hilariously awful translations; that is what gave Ridge Racer it's charm. All of that gets thrown out the window for Unbounded in an attempt to modernize the series.\n\nThe graphics are darker and more realistic; the pace has been slowed a bit and the cars feel far too weighty. Drifting, which is an integral part of the track design, is so ♥♥♥♥ing busted that I nearly quite in fury a few times. Busted explains a lot of things with Unbounded, but it applies more to the controls then the areans you'll be tearing apart.\n\nThe biggest thing with Unbounded is the destructible environments. I have to give credit where credit is due, Unbounded does offer an impressive amount of course carnage. While the props are basically styrofoam, you car can glide through things and not immediately crash. Sadly, that's about the only decent thing in the tracks.\n\nAs for static buildings, your car typically gravitates towards them. Barely clipping them will usually cause your car to smash up, but sometimes you go flying through the air or spinning in circles. While that should be realistic, the game has an awful tendency to reset your car before your crash site. This causes a tremendous amount of wasted time in Time Attack events and often causes you to lose up to 7 places in race mode.\n\nSpeaking of which, despite boasting 7 different race types, the game really only features three distinct challenges. You have a race mode where you can destroy everyone and one where that is disabled. You have frag attack, which sees you smashing up other cars; then there is time attack, which barely shows up and is the only challenge without other opponents.\n\nThese should be fun, but the physics and AI of the game are so borked that I couldn't wrap my head around them. At times, you fly out of the gate and pass everyone with ease. Other times, the opponents are beyond hard and you'll hardly notice them. Sometimes you'll smash through highlight objects only to immediately crash once the automated cutscene ends. You'll even make jumps only to see your car barrel rolling through the air, despite not clipping anything.\n\nThere is also some horrible graphical glitch that causes constant flickering for upwards of 15 seconds at a time. It obscures some of the track and leads to wiping out or missing turns. It also looks terrible and gives me a headache, but that may be a personal issue.\n\nWhat isn't personal is information about your cars. The stats are shown before you decide on your vehicle, but they aren't really reliable. Maybe this has more to due with individual playstyles, but the car with the highest speed stat should be the fastest one on the track.\n\nThere are also some cars that are carbon copies of others (excluding the pointless DLC) and others, still, that have mostly the same stats, but are higher in key areas. It makes certain cars completely worthless after reaching a certain driver level.\n\nThen there is the lack of course diversity and the general sluggishness to the controls. It just doesn't feel pleasant to play Ridge Racer: Unbounded. I had fun at times, but not enough for me to recommend this to anyone. The lackluster campaign and hilariously anti-climactic ending just rub salt in the wound.\n\nThe online portion is completely non-functional. From the sound of what it included, it could have remedied this package. Racers were given the ability to customize events and challenge others worldwide. While it may have been frustrating to deal with the controls, I could see smashing people into walls as being a blast.\n\nStill, that doesn't work. Namco Bandai shutdown the servers earlier this year and have basically cut the game in half. The price tag, at least, reflects the lack of multiplayer, but it still sours the overall package. Having courses made by other players would be a dream, even if the game feels rushed.\n\nOverall, I just wouldn't bother playing this. Unless you just have a fondness for the Ridge Racer name, there isn't much here that hasn't been done better in other racers. Unbounded mostly made me pine for a new Burnout or to return to Burnout: Revenge on Xbox 360.\n\n3/10","September 26, 2015","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sound effects is great. But the soundtracks make me cringe.\n\nOpponents have a nasty habit of coming out of nowhere. And there's no clue to how your car is doing except for the "critical damage" warning and a flame bursting out of your engine bay. By then it's too late because a poke from an opponent will detonate you.\n\nThe game puts emphasis on drifting, but drifting is like trying to drive on top of a frozen oil. Most of the time the only thing that would get you driving straight again is when you hit a wall. If you spin out (and you WILL spin out), then God help you. The opponents are going to make frag you again and again and again until you find yourself in last position in the final lap.\n\nThe 'power' mechanics (basically a turbo boost + invulnerability) is unreliable. Duration is too short and when all racers in sight are using it simultaneously, it's practically useless.\n\nThe tracks are littered with opportunities to get airborne, but coming off at the wrong angle will send you corkscrewing through the sky, into a wall, spiralling down, and back onto the track facing the wrong way. You get no points for that by the way. And as with the spinning out above, be prepared to restart the race.\n\nAll in all, I regret spending money on this.","September 17, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Their horrendous level design kills the flow and feel of the game and the worst part is that they're mandatory to progress the campaign.\n\nOther thoughts: I decided to steal newegg's reviews format just for this one review, but I suppose thats beside the point. RR:U is a port, not a particularly bad one but the thing that rubs me the wrong way is that theres only 2 graphical settings, resolution and anisotropic filtering.

I got this in the humble bundle a long time ago and I finally got around to playing it but I could only do that for 80~ minutes before not really enjoying anything it had to offer anymore.\n\nI absolutely hated the drifting system and the fact that it was necessary to help you get the boost so you could take the short cuts or knock other cars out of the way was pretty much a killer for me. I kept playing the same track to get a feel for the drifting but I swear it was just clunky. My car felt to light and I spun out a pretty good amount. I figured maybe it was just me being rusty, but I checked a good amount of the other reviews and it seemed like a large amount of people agreed with me.\n\nI liked the graphics except for when stuff was blowing up because it really, really turns the screen into a cluster of smoke and debris.

The drifting mechanic is extremely simple to learn and is very well designed and implemented.  It is Ridge Racer's trademark gameplay.\n\nIn this game we have only dark, tight streets, mostly annoying music (there are a tiny number of tunes from other RR games, 2 or 3 from memory) and worst of all, the drifting is terrible in this game.  It is badly designed and you have to smash into objects in order to earn boost.  It is the most ill-conceived and unintuitive game design I can remember.  Some objects are breakable and give you boost, others will make you crash.  The difference between these objects in appearance is not obvious so you have to either learn from trial and error, or hope for the best.  Other larger objects can be smashed through when you have full boost, but not at other times.  The game will take control of your car during this time, and often hand you back control when a crash is unavoidable.  So the game basically forces you into crashing.\n\nThe game varies between easy and maddeningly difficult.  Make no mistake this can be a very frustrating game indeed.  I don't think there is any catch-up or rubberbanding, because typically if you let the AI get a lead and crash on the harder levels you might as well restart as you have next to no chance of winning.  On the other hand, I have found myself with huge leads and I've even found myself stopping and waiting 20 seconds for the other cars to catch up, so I can try and score more points in order to unlock the next stage.\n\nI have completed the career mode but in the end it was more for my own personal satisfaction than because I was really enjoying myself.  I've recently been playing Ridge Racer 6 on the 360 and Ridge Racer 2 on the PSP, both of which are PROPER Ridge Racer games and are miles more fun than this game is.  Loads of fantastic tunes, open roads, addictive drifting, colourful happy environments.  Real feel good games.  We still wait for such a game on the PC - this isn't it.\n\nOh yeah and it likes to crash to the desktop a lot (I'm using Windows 7) seemingly randomly.","October 11, 2013","false","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Less than the sum of its parts Ridge Racer Unbounded (aka Ridge Racer in name only) oscillates between a lukewarm 4 and 5 out of 10. It's a perfectly functional game and anything but horrible but I somehow wish it was horrible so it would have a single memorable ingredient.\nEverything you'd expect is sort of there; various generic game modes with sports car pastiches. A bit of drifting from NfS Underground, a little bit of Burnout's car combat, a bit of the destructible environments from Split Second, etc. all of it assembled robotically and efficiently without any creativity, passion or talent. Racing-light is the name of the game - less calories, no taste. For a racing game supposedly based on high speed and drifting neither is engaging and fun enough to keep you interested past the ten minute mark, the bland music doesn't help.\nApparently there also used to be an online multiplayer mode that is now non-functioning. Honestly I'd much rather invite my friends to an office meeting than Ridge Racer Unbounded so this point almost works in its favour but you have to admire the audacity of the publishers who really went the extra mile here, I applaud you.\n\nIn short, avoid. It's mindboggingly forgettable and generic, so much so my mind already blurs the select few hazy memories I had of playing it with memories of other, better games.

I like the Flatout Series a lot. I'm mostly indifferent about RR:U. However, if I were simply indifferent I wouldn't review this game at all. I have to go through the effort of disuading purchase of the game simply for the removal of its online services. But while I'm here for that I may as well talk about its snoozefest content.\n\nSo accessing other user's content and the majority of online services are gone. What's left of it is a mediocre racing game having little of the charm of either Flatout or Ridge Racer. Yes, stuff blows up and Yes, there's super exaggerated drifting. A clear connection is drawn to RidgeRacer and Bugbear, but sadly, the drift mechanics feel weak and are poorly implemented compared to other RR games. As for the destruction, it comes off as canned and grows largely unimpressive as believeability escapes with the game choosing what can and cannot be taken apart. That and the cookie cutter maps and environment start running together and weren't that great looking in the first place.\n\nAs it is, it should be in an arcade cabinet at Chuckee Cheese. If you're looking for an arcade racer to really stay with, I'd pick up almost anything else. If it's priced at like a dollar and you're only expecting that much out of it, you wont be as disapointed.","January 14","false","3.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

That's where the positive stuff ends.\n\nFor one, when you start the game it's immediately obvious that PC wasn't the lead platform. The options that you can change are minimal, so you won't be able to get rid of the disgusting instagram filters and nauseating overused bloom effects that make the entire game look like a trashy CoD killstreak montage video. And that's just one of the game's smaller problems. The physics are horrifying, and I don't say that from the perspective of some elitist sim-only race enthusiast; I LOVE arcade racers, and the games that Bugbear made before this one (Flatout 1 and 2) were both tons of fun. Ridge Racer has always been about speed and control, but something is definitely off with the handling model here. Cars feel like absolute tanks when you're driving in a straight line, but initiate a drift and suddenly your car will feel as weightless as a paper airplane. I know that's kind of how drifts are supposed to feel (in a very VERY simplified, vague sense), but it shouldn't be that exaggerated in ANY game. On top of that, in the time that it takes to get used to the handling model, you'll realize that you've seen just about every game mode that Ridge Racer Unbounded has to offer. It's extremely repetitive. I've re-installed this game on 3 or 4 separate occasions, and I've really tried to give it a second chance more than once. I'm disappointed every time.\n\nSave your money. Bugbear's older games from the Flatout series are fantastic, and their new game Wreckfest (Next Car Game) is a little more on the realistic side but it's more fun than this. I'd skip RR:U if I were you.","January 24","false","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did horribly and assumed it was because I was terrible at racing games (spoiler alert, I'm not THAT bad).  I came back to the game for some entertainment while Dirt 3 is installing, and some poor entertainment it was.  And I'd like to think I've got a little bit more racing game experience behind me at this point.  The drifting controls are abominable, the boost mechanic is overpowered (rear-ending someone while boosting kills them).  Also, I've heard tell that the multiplayer is down.  And the car selection is pretty limited as well, even if you bother to go through and unlock things.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this game.","February 16","false","0.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","1"

For starters, server's dead. So you load in after a slightly annoying wait while the game fruitlessly tries to connect to the server. So no multiplayer, that's fine. I can forgive that, I love singleplayer games. But to get into the game and spend over an hour trying to beat the first race, hell, even place in it. The drift mechanic is so damn finicky that I end up either spinning out or fishtailing at every corner. And to know that the devs abandoned this years ago...\n\nThank God I got this from Humble Bundle.","March 30","false","1.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The last ridge racer I played was back on PS1 and a lot has changed. Not being sentimental about the franchise I had no qualms with the very different feel this had in comparison.\n\nNotable are the excellent graphics, considerable game modes, variety of vehicles, and the kinetic, over-the-top feel. It's can get quite nailbiting and got me on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions. Sound is good, although the  techno dance soundtrack was not to my tastes.\n\nI found this to be a challenging game that does not yield its treasures easily: it took me some time to master the drift mechanic and I found the opposition pretty tough. I wasn't sure I liked it at first, but luckily I persisted and I now am having a ton of fun.\n\nAs others have noted, there is no longer a multiplayer server which is a shame, but the single player is content rich enough for that not to matter.\n\nI am very surprised at the low marks given on Steam. This is a high quality racer in my juddgment. Luckily there is a demo so you can try before you buy.\n\nMy advice is to not quit too early: once you get the hang of the drift mechanic there is a ton of fun to be had.\n\nHighly recommended.","May 6","true","36.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Servers which are no longer there but the game was never programmed to acknowledge. When you get in it's almost a shell of a game, there's a single player campaign mode which lets you select a single car (unless you get the dlc) and a single track. When you get into a race the entire pack jostle around within a few hundred meters of each other, so a single slip can easily send you form first to last place and failing to adequately drift around a corner can cost several places. This makes progression feel random as it is quite easy to play a race three times and come in last, first and 5th place. A little bad luck can leave you playing the same track over and over before breezing past the next few.","May 22","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is nothing like burnout either.\n\nThe environments in the city that you race around are pretty good by racing game standards, but it becomes quickly apparent that they are consistently re-used, and there's not much variety in them. Plus, nearly everything is destructible, which means there are virtually no hazards to avoid other than flat brick walls at turns.\n\nThe mechanic used to 'frag' other racers is just terrible. It seems as if it's trying to be like burnout in that respect [RE: takedowns], but it's so badly made. The only way to frag seems to be to rub up against the back bumber of a car, and magically they get taken out. There's no timing either, so unless you're in direct contact with a car [no pit manoeuvres here], they won't be affected.\n\nTo top it off, it is full of obnoxious dubstep music, which i'm really not a fan of.","May 26","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, there's drifting.. and there's a heavy arcade feel to it. That's it.\n\nI'll keep things short. Unbounded is not bad, not bad AT ALL. Graphics are fine, sense of speed is ok. Handling is something you need to get use to, but nothing awful. Yes, track design lacks a real punch and the difficulty can be frustrating. But in the other hand - Unbounded is a fun game, being a weird, twisted child of Ridge Racer and Burnout/Flatout. If you find it on sale, for about 3-5€, it's defnitly worth it!\n\nYes, there's plenty other, better racing games.But i still find Unbounded charming and... it puts me in a special mood. This game killed Ridge Racer franchise. Not because it's bad - developers just didn't know what to do with it. Innovate or stay the same? It's all sad, i remember playing Ridge Racer on original Playstation.\n\nOh well. Try Unbounded. It has a demo, so why not ?","June 2","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
