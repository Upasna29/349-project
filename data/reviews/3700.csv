While sniping, you will have to take into account wind, gravity, your heartbeat as well as the air in your lungs, the latter of which you will be unable to exhaust with an elevated heart rate.\n\nThe strategic element is important as the AI will investigate noises as well as fallen comrades and quickly gift you a bullet hole too many if you're not mobile enough.  The experience of pulling off difficult shots on moving targets is very satisfying.  The game employs a bullet cam and provides a stupendously graphic visualization of that soldier's jugular you just punctured complete with blood spurt.\n\nYou're scored on your abilities as well and the game recognizes the type of shot in terms of distance, moving targets and parts of the body.  The save system is liberal enough so that you can save anytime, though the game will eventually inform you that you have saved too many times and thereby dock your score.\n\nSniper Elite adds additional realism and tension by allowing you to comprehensively search the dead, many times under threat, for survival necessities as opposed to a brusque pat down which might just yield a couple of bullets, though the ability to move the cadaver to a safer area for inspection is available.\n\nWhile the visuals are indeed dated, the whole package creates an atmospheric stage consistent with bombed out Dresden and I would like to emphasize this accomplishment given the age of the engine. Once you have created a profile, 1080P is supported. Sniper Elite is the definition of a war time classic.","April 2, 2014","true","10.5"," 94 of 109 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","94","109","4","9"

You can adjust and customize your difficulty and all factors that affect the challenge of the game as you wish.\n\nIt works without any problems on highest settings on Windows 7 64-bit. The graphics and voice acting are the weakest links in this otherwise fun game and it has great longevity as well as replay value. Unlike the later Sniper Elite games there's actual challenge here which feels exciting and authentic rather than purely scripted.\n\nThere is barely any story to the game and the intro video is probably the as deep as you'll get to know anything about the setting of the game and its main character. The main point here is the gameplay which is tight and exciting. Of course, more so than its sequels, Sniper Elite is absolutely NOT purely an action game. You will die instantly if you run around trying to kill everybody. You need to act like a sniper and wait for the perfect shots and this is the main attraction for this game. The hunt for the perfect spot to snipe unsuspecting enemies from a mile away. There is at least 12 hours worth of single-player gameplay here plus multiplayer modes which I'm not personally familiar with.\n\nRemember the game can get highly challenging on higher difficulties and also READ THE GAME MANUAL BEFORE YOU START. There are quite some keys used in the game which you may need to write down in order to remember. No steam achievements.\n\nAll in all, like good wine, this game has aged considerably well. If you look past the terrible voice acting and the old, repetitive graphics then you're in for a lengthy, exciting game full of sweat-inducing anticipation. Definitely worth picking up on a sale.","January 26, 2015","true","12.6"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","42","49","5","0"

Oh? Why personal? Well...\n\nGo back to a time when the 360 was just out and the next gen of gaming consoles started. I never got a 360 untill about two years after it's release. So i was still playing my good ol' XBOX (my favourite console of all time).\n\nI had a few favourite games, but a few stood out. My mother's boyfriend at the time got a game when i had newly got my xbox around 2 years before that, and he played it alot and i watched and had a go every once in a while. That game was noen other than SNIPER ELITE.\n\nThe game was fu**ing amazing to my little eyes. The bullet cam blew my mind, and when i got one it was like opening a Kinder Surprise and getting a new epic little piece of plastic to play with. I loved it.\n\nHe lost interest in the game because he was a sports person so it was mine. I played the first two levels every once in a while because they were my favourites, the first i loved so much because something odd happened, a plane crashed right in front of me. No joke. My little mind went nuts, And i didn't want to quit the game because of such a sight. I thought: "Where is the pilot?" So i picked up a wounded enemy or ally (i can't remember now) and placed him next to the plane and did a little role playing. I had to quit eventually, and ever since i tried to re create that experience and only got the plane to spawn when i wasn't around to see it crash.\n\nCut to years after that, i got my 360 and loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. I would still play my original XBOX, but the 360 was the console at that time for me. The sniper elite disc disappears, i can't remember how, but i was sad to see a game go. Early 2011 My 360 days were over, Microsft fu**ed me oever so i stopped playing my 360. I had nothing, but my laptop....\n\nI didn't have steam then, but i was recomemded to try it and my PC days went off (Fu*k consoles). My xbox was never collecting dust because i once again, still played it. But at this time i wanted to build my collection for it up again, so i started to buy  more and more games for it. around 2012 I went to my local video shop who were clearing all their now 'retro'      last-gen games, so my mum purchased as many original XBOX games as she could. One of them was Sniper Elite.\n\nI played the absolute sh*t out of it! And remembered the plane.....\n\nSo by trying to trigger it be playing the level and restarting it over and over, only getting the plane to spawn when im not around, it finally happened.\n\nThe plane crashed, infront of me. My heart stopped and my childhood memory was revived. True story.\n\n10/10 Best Sniper Elite ever.\n\n","June 8, 2014","true","4.5"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","42","54","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tunaftw/recommended/3700/","tunaftw","Big Tuna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tunaftw/","221 products in account","While for whatever reason the tutorial video may mislead you into thinking this is some sort of realistic war simulator such as Arma, this is a pretty standard action game for its time.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game has you going around the ruins of Berlin completing objectives, which can vary from getting from Point A to Point B, sabotage, and assassination mainly. Some missions require stealthing with your silenced pistol, some may recommend stealth, but can end up being exponentially easier if you decide to go guns ablaze. In general, the stealth element is more or less half-baked.\n\nAs for difficulty, it is very forgiving. I played through the game once on Sniper Elite and hardly found any troubles. Actually, I lied. I really began the game on Marksman difficulty, yet by the next level the game automatically increased my difficulty to Sniper Elite due to my high score. This difficulty adjustment component is a cool, subtle feature that encourages players to take on a greater challenge when showing capability to do so; however, since the game is hardly challenging at all, it didn’t really matter.\n\nThis lack of challenge comes from the previously mentioned ability to just blast through certain stealth sections, along with the surplus of ammunition that your current sniper rifle is constantly stocked with. It is also very easy to replenish health, as medkits are common and can instantly heal you to max health. Though there is a heart-rate feature that kicks in after strenuous activity on the protagonist (i.e. running for long periods), making it harder to aim when scoped, yet it can be sidestepped with some skill. You are simply too powerful. And because of this low difficulty, the game is quite a bit less memorable, but that doesn’t necessarily make it completely boring.\n\nThe star of the show here is the well-known bullet-cam feature that was popular at the time in games and film. It is still quite satisfying to activate it when getting a long range head shot on an enemy sniper. One great thing is that it does not trigger too often, and still requires a decent shot to activate. This prevents the feature from growing stale, which if it did, I may have dropped the game altogether.\n\nOne attempt to mediate a lack of replayability is a scoring system, as mentioned previously. At the end of each level, you are given a score based off of your kills, headshots, difficulty, etc. However, since there were no leaderboards or an additional medal/reward system, I had no idea how high of a score should be considered “good” or why I should care.\n\nThe game is also marketed with supposed “Non-linear game play”, which is referencing the open-ish design of the maps, which are fairly large, considering its release date. Some missions may have alternative routes or methods of completion, though I found these to be a bit few and far between in my playthrough. This also means that you must constantly stop to check your map to make sure you won’t run into a dead end. I cannot say that the maps are worth a retread because of this element.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer component, though I can’t comment on it due it being dead as a doornail.\n\nGraphics:\nFor the time, the graphics are adequate. The models and textures are generally decent, and some of the skyboxes look rather nice. The animation quality when characters are talking is somewhat laughable, but the animation on the player character’s movement and enemies are passable. A problem I found is that I could hardly tell the difference between my allies and the enemies, as well as the enemy Germans and Russians. Luckily I never killed one of my allies because of this, though it was just annoying to have to wait a few moments to see if the soldiers would take a shot at me or not.\n\nOne issue I have is that in some of the daytime city environments are drenched in this urine-colored hue, as you can probably see by the screenshots. Now I myself was never around to see war-torn Berlin to debunk their historical representation of it, however I can’t see much reason to depict it in this relatively unpleasant manner. Though not all maps have this yellow-ish filter place on them, some take place outside of the city and at different times of day, which somewhat helps the immersion factor.\n\nA few other aspects of the presentation I generally liked, particularly the war film-esque introductory video that really got me psyched to play the game. Yet while the tutorial video carried this aesthetic, it was arguably very misleading of how the game should be optimally played.\n\nA strange issue I ran into is that when you launch the game, for your previously selected graphics settings to take effect, you must load your profile first. I don’t really understand why graphics settings were decided to be tied to the save file, but it never really hindered the experience.\n\nMusic:\nThe game features a standard, forgettable orchestral soundtrack that fits the WWII-Cold War era quite well. When the missions are stealth focused, the music complements it with a quieter, tenser track. When you’re placed in the middle of the action, the music complements it was a fast-paced, booming tune. Standard stuff. I found that that only marginally stand-out track was the main theme.\n\nStory:\nThe game also features a standard, forgettable war-hero storyline that centers on an American OSS Sniper, Karl Fairburne, in his mission to uncover nuclear secrets and eliminate German/Russian resistance during the post-WWII and pre-Cold War era. Nothing of the story really stood out to me, besides the mediocre voice acting, and the jarringly high-pitched voice of Karl, which was not particularly distracting, but just an odd choice of casting for the role. You would think a graduate of West Point Military Academy would have a deeper voice than a high school male who just hit puberty.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nWhile I purchased the game for only one dollar and got roughly nine hours of gameplay, I can safely say it was worth the money. However, whether the game is worth your time or not is subjective to you. I found the game to be overall pretty forgettable, besides those fun moments where the bullet-cam kicked in. This is a budget action game and it shows. I can see why Rebellion decided to develop a remake/sequel to this title, because there is potential in this game to become something greater. The problem is that the developer was just not as steady with their aim as they could’ve been.\n","December 21, 2015","true","9.4"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","31","37","2","3"

With the summer sale, I treated myself a favor: acquiring again Sniper Elite.\n\nAnd what a difference! I prefer largely V2 for cover thingy and for better use of commands. Because in Sniper Elite, you have to access the inventory THEN only you can use an item... and you have to exit the inventory if you want to shoot. The   radar isn't really as efficient as for V2 as you don't know if you're in the view of the enemy or not. Besides, here, you're dressed up like a German, yet, Germans shoot at you. Only the Resistance is on your side. And if I can add something else, the menu itself isn't so intuitive.\n\nBesides, sometimes, you're kinda lost at where you should go.

I've missed the WWII settings, it's been a while since I've played a game set in those times.\n\nSniper Elite is a Third Person Shooter, with sniping sessions obviously in First person. You can approach your missions any way you like but the action-assault approach is very heavily penalized, if not almost prohibited sometimes. Stealth approach is often the most advisable, you can get behind enemies, distract them with diversive noises, hide in shadows or ruins, or even shooting while there are some bombings to prevent enemies soldiers from spotting you. Soldiers have a really good sight and an incredible hearing... Maybe excessive. Still more realistic than the classic metal gears view cones... XD\nYour arsenal includes your main weapon, the sniper rifle, a silenced gun and various rifles or machine guns. In your inventory you can count on some dynamite, time bombs, wire traps and a rock... A simple stone to create a diversion and distract enemies. XD\nYour missions vary from assaults, taking contacts, rescuing prisoners, ambushes and so on, and the settings are quite nice, ranging from bombed cities, trenched parks, factories and so on, and the single playr campaign is quite long, so it will keep you busy for a while.\nThe soundtrack is not exactly outstanding but is a pleasant background, with some dynamic interactions when approaching an enemy or when approaching more enemies, or when you're being spotted.\nThe game is quite old but the graphics is not that bad considering its release date. What I don't like are the characters movements, they're quite rigid and kind of... confused, I can't tell when he's crouched or standing, nor it doesn't crawl naturally as he keeps on turning when you move the mouse. Still it's a clever system, where you can increase or decrease its movement speed to also reduce the noise produced while moving.\nThere is also a difficulty system which allows you to set your games in many details, beside the AI such as gravity (for long distance sniping), explosion radius and so on.\nEven considering the campaign and the story behind the missions, Sniper Elite isn't an outstanding title as there's no particular innovation, no involvement in the story nor any outstanding visual or musical parts. BUT it still is a nice title as, besides some very minor graphic glitches, there's nothing really wrong about it.\n\n+++PROs+++ SETTINGS. Some might say it's quite boring but I like the WWII games. The world is nicely built and visually satisfying.\nGAMEPLAY. This is not a common shooter as it focus mostly on sniping or stealth sections.---CONs--- POV.

Nothing compromising the game of course, but there are some minor bugs as floating rocks, bad syncronized throwing system for the rock (inverted buttons and sometimes when you aim it simply goes on the wall next to you, or on the pole next to you, even though the aiming trajectory isn't showing anything), and the AI isn't particularly impressive, but you know, considering this was the first title of this franchise...","April 14","true","18.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The sniper rifle is my best friend in Borderlands, or Deus Ex, or L4D or any other game that will give me the option.  But what I really like, it seems, is taking advantage of game AIs that don't contend well with a sniping approach.  I love taking out foes that have "taken cover" but left part of their heads sticking out.  I adore taking the time to line up the perfect headshot as an enemy runs directly towards me, across open ground, in a straight line.  I giggle when my shot from the rooftops drops an enemy in the middle of the street, which causes all buddies to rush out and cluster right in my sights.\n\nSniper Elite, first of all, is a strong adherent to the reality-is-brown school of graphical design.  Which doesn't do any favours to the graphics, as they're already rather poor, even for 2005, relying too much on textures to save polygons.  So you trudge through a bland, unimmersive environment in order to accomplish your mission, only to find that the usual AI-abusing sniper tactics don't work here.  Unless you've played a level already and memorized the locations of the enemy NPCs, you have to sneak (slowly) everywhere, because NPC snipers are ready to do to you what you'd normally do to them if you go running around in the streets.  So you have to be patient.  Very, very patient.  Which is boring.  When the game does get exciting, it likes to do so by throwing a tank at you, or spawning a couple of guys at short range, so that you don't get to play with the sniper rifle anyway.\n\nBetween all the sneaking, and crawling, and waiting, and waiting some more, and crawling a bit, and waiting again, I've never had a less fun time with a simulated sniper rifle in my hands.  On the plus side, the game did manage to capture the feeling of being a very vulnerable, mortal soldier, alone in a dangerous environment.  I just prefer the feeling of being a cunning, dangerous predator, methodically eliminating hapless prey, and Sniper Elite was not going to give me that.","November 23, 2015","false","1.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","13","23","5","0"

In the first mission you are decked out in a German forest commando pattern. Unfortunately the mission takes place in a generic war-torn eastern european city. Essentially you are a giant green tree in a sea of brown. Good luck getting your "hidden" over 50%.\n\nThe game tutorial gos on and on about using your binoculars to scout for enemies before moving out of cover and advancing. Seems good in theory, but in practive all the enemies stay hidden around corners until they are scripted to pop out of their hiding places once you get within spitting distance. And when they do so they come out guns blazing like a wall-hacker in an FPS! What is the point of playing a sniper who has to scout out the enemy and take them out from a distance when the game mechanics actively make that impossible?\n\nThe game  even acknowledges that it failed at it's objective when during the later part of the first mission it litteraly tells you to pick up a sub-machine gun and start blasting waves of enemies about to come at you. Yep, that's exactly what I want out of my SNIPING GAME!\n\nThe only good thing I can say is the actual sniping mechanics of wind and gravity affecting the shot work pretty well! Now if only you were given a chance to properly use them.\n\nIf you want a stealth game with a decent sniping mecahnic you would be bettter off playing and of the first 4 Hitman games or even their middle-market counterparts Death to Spies.","January 4","false","1.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Though they're on difficulty settings, bullets are affected by windage, posture, & gravity.  Running and gunning CAN work on low difficulty settings, but crawling & selecting sniping spots = most fun.  Furthermore, noise plays a role - when emplaced enemies are within earshot but not line-of-sight, masking one's rifle shot with the sound of mortar fire (very common: it's May 1945 in Berlin) is wise and does work.\n\nThe kill cam is pretty fun but gruesome: most headshots will trigger a slo-mo, bullet-follow cam that'll show your shot.  The game also tracks relevant stats (farthest shot, stealthy shots, head shots, etc).\n\nMissions, when played stealthily, are long: I sunk 2 hours into the first one.\n\nAwesome game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/3700/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","In short, Sniper Elite is a third-person-view PS2-era shooter about American covert operative in Berlin in May of 1945, sniping Soviets and occasional Germans with that famous "bullet cam" effect, "borrowed" from Max Payne games. I can recommend it only to people who want to kill Ruskies in bulk. There you'll be mowing hundreds of those stupids. Which is good, if you're, say, some right-winged Nazie-lover, still wishing for re-count with USSR. I repeat - for the most of the game, you'll be running in Wehrmacht uniform, assisting Germans in killing Soviets and hiding some "war secrets". Great deeds for every karma, don't ya think?\n\nAs of shooter rules, obviously, this game is focused on using the sniper rifles. Using those boomsticks was somewhat elaborative for the year 2005, as those rifles are using basic ballistic rules, so the rifle bullets are flying on some parabolic arc and not just direct line. Which means that you need to aim higher on bigger distances. You can use some other weapons, like a silenced pistol, or guns picked from your enemies (machine guns like DP-27 or PPSh), but their ballistics were nerfed alot, to make player use his main rifle more than other weapons. Alas, the situations where you're supposed to perform really long shots is quite numbered. Damn, there are only 5 maps for the whole game! And only 2 of them are of some use for sniper work.\n\nAs of "stealth" there... Just forget the word. You can't be stealthy. Your silenced pistol can't work, your enemies will always be knowing where you are, no matter how good you're with hiding in dark pixels.\n\nNow, WW2 tag. It's fake. The history details were not simple altered. The whole game setting is a pure phantasy! Where diesel tanks can be blown up with normal bullets, where war veterans waltz in the war zone without cover, and don't hide in front of enemy. Where... everything is not simple not based on reality, but twisted with good amount of absurd and ignorance.\n\nWhat I have against that game other than siding with Nazies in their fight against good guys? As I am sure that Russkies in the 1945 were certainly good guys killing the dragon with the sword, whereas USA was dropping A-bombs and performing all other usual stuff like turning into dust by carpet bombing cities like Tokio, Dresden, Würzburg, Swinemünde and so on... And yes, the story of covert support of Nazies retreat and revival is one which (some people in) USA is quietly proud of, and I strongly despise.\nRead some books about it before critizing me there, folks.\n\nOkay, again - why Sniper is a bad game, in my opinion?\nFirst is the setting, where you have 5 maps on 28 "missions", with huge backtracking part, always. The structure of levels leave to player a light possibility to make some maneuvers, but in practice it is even more strained, than in the Crysis 2. If you count the possibility to turn left or right from rails as "non linear game play", I'm sorry for you. In the end, Sniper Elite turns out just as beeline as any typical shooter, very far from the defintion of "non linear"-something.\nSecond, the AI. It is horrendous. The meanest soldiers of the Europe of year 1945 never use any real combat tactics. They just standing in the middle of a street, shooting at you, or rushing forward on your position. On the other hand, they will be always knowing where would you go, no matter how silent you are, how many hours you spend crouching and proning in the shadows. Dead stealth experience.\nThird, the weapons aren't any good, even with addition of ballstic rules. I know dozens of other games, where you can hone your sniper skills much better.\n\nAll in all, there is no point for I can like this game. But I'll give it a 5/10 mark, for its effort to improve the "bullet cam" effect. Now, I know there are a big fan base of Sniper games, which turn down any negative review on their beloved "shoot-the-Soviet" shooter. I can't care less.","February 13","false","32.4"," 26 of 52 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","26","52","2","17"

And, there are a couple of missions where the art is pretty darn good, especially the last one, but this seems to stand in contrast to the more generic levels.  The sound is, well, alright.  The background run on a repeating track of explosions that pauses slightly when it ends and begins.  Even for the timeframe, this is a little below par, but you'll tune it out eventually.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/3700/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sniper Elite is a stealth-sniping based WW2 shooter released by Rebellion in 2005 year and was also released on PS2 and then Wii. Compared to console ports, the only thing you are missing out is a 2-player coop mode. Have to get consoles if you want that.\nEDIT: Turns out that Wii version has exclusive Flak Tower mission. Huh. Interesting.\n\nAnd talking of multiplayer, it was Deathmatch. But GameSpy was shut down, so choosing online option simply freezes game up. You can only play by LAN, if you have a friend who can come to your room and share some Sniping love. Otherwise, count that Multiplayer isn't available anymore and you only have Single-Player campaign.\n\nUpon launching the game you will be greeted by an intro that explains the main plot of a game: You are American sniper who has to disguise as German soldier and start to shoot down Red Army and Nazis alike while getting rare help from German Resistance. All so Red Army will not get hands on Nuclear research in Berlin. Doesn't exactly makes you feel like a hero. Nothing much to say for plot, it kinda moves on during game.\n\nNow, before moving to gameplay, I should say few things about setting. A falling Berlin. End of war. The music, while usually silent, will give you a taste of heavy atmosphere during each small introduction (camera shows you the surroundment) and action. Most of your time will be spent in a dirty ruins of a city, crawling under rain, being away from front lines and constantly hearing artilery fire. But on another side, it's an ugly WW2 game. Technically it was outdated by the time and artistically, well, it's as brown as WW2 shooters get.\nAt least you can see realistical rainbow in one of the levels. So that's at least something.\n\nBefore you start the game, you get to choose difficulty setting. I would divide it into three categories: AI, instant switch and sniping simulation settings. I highly recommend to turn all sniping simulating setting on, it's a sniper game. Well, at least it gives better gameplay on very very few maps where your objective is long-distance sniping at incoming waves of Russians. AI in this game is random, both stupid and brutal. Turn this on normal or such. As for instant switching: With instant switching it will make a more action game where you can hold machine gun all time and quickscope heads as soon as you want. But with it switched off you will never use Binoculaurs, with which you can look futher than with Sniper Rifle scope, as it will leave you with no defense.\n\nAnd then you are off to the first level of the game. And they say that the first level gives a much important first impression. And well, as for as gameplay goes, it may be so.\n\nChecking the map you figure out that the best way to approach main objective is a way around. As flanking is more clever. And optional objective is there anyway. Next thing you are slowly crawling over the ground, looking around with binoculars, being inspired to do so from tutorial video. You crawl carefully over the canal only to get killed from behind, as the camera points at the random soldier behind you, who came out from his cozy sewer, somehow becoming aware of your existance despite you not making so much sound.\n\nAI in this game is quite random. In some cases he will notice you seemingly by itself, as if scripted, in some cases it can't be avoided. In other cases he can be stupid. He may be clever, but it really doesn't feel fair often. Even worse is that once you are noticed by a single soldier, it feels like everybody in the level will become aware of your current and future positions.\nThat, and I don't think you can hear their footsteps clearly.\nMovement and pace is different from what you expect. Most likely, you don't really need to crawl. Standing doesn't have much use either, running and walking while crouching is the best there. You can change speed with mouse wheel like in Sprintel Cell, so that's one cool point.\n\nAfter restarting the mission, you decide to try a head-on approach to the location and walk toward the direction until you notice a soldier on another side of level. You hide behind cover and scope in into your sniper. Taking gravity, wind into mind, as well waiting for artilery fire to hide your shot sound (hopefully you read manual) you shoot. BAM! An infamouse Bullet Cam kicks in, following the bullet, as you watch it blow poor soldier's cheek off. Awesome! Game announces it as Covert Kill.\nAnd then, despite being sneaky and scoring Covert KIll, few more of his friends come out from distance and start to attempt to shoot you down, maneuvering between covers. Throwing away sneakyness, as you can't lose them off your tail, you just shoot them down with your Sniper Rifle.\n\nGame really feels like it's easier and more fun to beat as your everyday WW2 shooter with a bit of stealth here and there. At least it's more reliable than hoping that AI will be fair to you.\nAside from Sniper Rifle you also get Silenced Pistol which can instakill enemies if you are close enough and was't noticed, sneakily, more reliable than Covert Kill. You also can pick up grenades. And you can pick up either sub-machine gun or machine gun. Sub-machine is common and good for close range. Machine gun isn't as common, but there will be enough for it for both you and enemies, and it works at all ranges. Yes, enemies with it will kill you even from sniper range. Brings some frstating moments.\n\nThen you are sent to rescue injured person. You kill a guard there and then enter a room. After that, you get to grab supplies, tripwire mines and be noted that more soldiers are coming to check out what happened. First time you try to set up tripwires mines, you get killed before you are finished. Second time you succeed, only to have injured soldier killed by mine explosion nearby.\n\nYou get to have some items: Healing ones, TNT (Protip: You can throw them like grenades too), rock that I never used and a tripwire mines. Actually, first level doesn't show tripwire mines any justice, they are quite useful there.\nAnother huge problem of a game got to be scripted events that go against the sniper premise. Even if you want to focus on sniping alone, be ready that game will often send soldiers at you, maybe even around the very corner. It's not full stealth, for sure.\nYou even get some levels where you have to kill everyone.\n\nAnd so, outside of few levels where you get to snipe from excellent sniping high position and very very few levels where stealth is forced, it playes like everyday dull WW2 shooter with sniper rifle and feels like a chore to complete. Good idea, bad execution, like some said before. Unless that's what you want, you should skip this one.","April 26, 2015","false","44.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

In this game you see a different view of world war II, the ending days of berlin and how german troops are leaving berlin and russisns invading germany, full of emotional moments at the endings. for its time it had the best graphics and gameplay. the bullet mechanics are amazing the bullet cam is also amazing. The multiplayer died because of server shut down and i remember even though when Sniper elite v2  was out this game had more players in multiplayer than V2. the reason is pretty simple because sniper elite 1 was original it had health bar and was hardcore and classic game in both single player and multiplayer.

As a disclaimer, I haven't actually spent 7 hours on this game, I went to watch TV and fell asleep for a few hours with the game still running.\n\nI can't recommend this game. Not even slightly. I would have never bought this game without it's bigger brother, Sniper Elite 3, being on sale and part of a pack. This game advertises itself as sneaking around and a stealth type game, where none of that matters.\n\nI played this game in 2015, where the game was released in 2005. I may be unfairly critizing the game, but trying to put myself in my 2005 shoes, I couldn't imagine myself liking this game. All the things that the trailer and tutorials for this game pride itself on, make no sense in the actual game. I made it as far as the 3rd mission in this game before completely giving up on it. The 3rd mission plays a bit differently than the first two missions do, in that you are not supposed to be detected for the first half of the mission. This is why I gave up on the game on this mission, because it just doesn't seem to work...like, at all.\n\nI start out the mission, you have to wait for guards sporadically turning back and forth, which I guess is the technology of the time's version of a guard trying to watch his patrol area. I use a silenced pistol to take out the first guard and drag away his body. That's why this is funny, because I'm completely in range of the other guards outside of the walls when I'm standing up with their buddy. Fine, that must be that stealth mechanic I heard about in this game. I sprint up to a hole in the wall, about 20m from another guard before going prone to crawl through it. Not spotted yet, maybe the stealth in this game was hindered by the technology available, and I can do more than I'm supposed to be able to do. I crawl through the wall, and a scripted sequence occurs where the Russians attack the base, and you're 'masked' by the Russian advance. Now, at this point, why is it that the Germans are staring at me no matter what I do...I redid this mission about 6-8 times to be sure, and each time plays out exactly the same.\n\nThere is no stealth mechanic...at least not one that makes any kind of decent sense. What makes it worse, not only are the Germans watching me in the midst of a Russian attack (I have screenshots of them running towards me while a T-34 is behind them lighting them up with the coax and a sniper on a roof getting shot up while staring at me), but the roof's where the snipers are don't have display models that line up...meaning it looks like i can shoot a sniper because it looks clear, but my round hits an invisible surface each time. Even worse than that, one of the roof top guards has a MG-42, and can snapshot me, while I can't hit him through the invisible surface.\n\nIn summary, this game was only $0.99 by itself (if I remember correctly), but I don't think it would be worth it on it's own. Generally, the rule of thumb I use is, if I can pay $5, and play for longer than 2 hours per $5 spent, then it would be worth it. This game, I gave the benefit of the doubt and played probably 3 or so hours (not the 7 my account says...as previously stated), but I found myself annoyed through most of it. Playing a game for a few hours and being annoyed all the way through is a metric that just doesn't make it into a raw, hours played versus dollars paid.\n\nTime to give up on this 10 year old game, and move on to Sniper Elite 2.","October 2, 2015","false","7.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

I appreciate games that embrace a more niche appeal as opposed to mass appeal where everybody wins easily because the mechanics are streamlined to the point that the gameplay lacks depth. Such mass appeal games tend to lack personality in my opinion: you could substitute one for any of a dozen others and be forgiven for forgetting which one you were playing. Sniper Elite has personality and some depth to its mechanics, but the execution of the whole package didn't satisfy me.\n\nThe most important deal-maker/breaker for this game with most people is going to be the controls. They're weird. When prone and crawling, your character (Karl) is slow but he responds to your keyboard commands readily. When crouching or walking, though, Karl has a startup time before he moves or turns. He moves the way a semi truck drives: slow to accelerate and slow to stop once moving, with turning being pretty limited and clunky without extra room. Another analogy: Karl doesn't walk, he ice skates. I'm guessing the developers were trying to capture how human beings build up momentum before reaching top speed, but in gameplay it feels awkward. I took the time to learn and adapt to the controls, but they're not comfortable overall.\n\nThe missions are very long when I compare them against most FPS games nowadays. Some missions span up to five different wide-open levels, and your saves are limited. I actually like the idea of limiting saves, but overall the difficulty wasn't quite tough enough to pressure me into improving my skills enough to avoid spending my save files. Sniper Elite is a dynamic difficulty game, so it changes itself to suit the player's skill as you play. I chose hard difficulty (Sharpshooter, I think it's called) from the beginning because that allowed me to turn on all of the game mechanics like bullet drop and wind, etc. and I wanted to experience the game as I imagined the developers intended.\n\nThe game permanently stuck me on max difficulty ("Sniper Elite" difficulty) after the first level of the very first mission, but I didn't realize this until I was a ways into the second mission. I didn't notice because the game didn't seem any harder. Even with bullet drop, wind, max difficulty A.I., etc. sniping is very forgiving in this game. You can mess up your shot multiple times and the enemies might run and hide, which means you mostly lose time trying to draw a new bead on them, or they might try to shoot back at you. But even at max difficulty, one or two enemies at a medium to long distance won't take you out very quickly, and you can just fire at will until you hit them and they're dead. So much for needing to flee and find a new vantage point once you've been discovered.\n\nFor as much lip service as the tutorial's narrator pays to how the player must “think like a sniper,” I've solved numerous situations by just grabbing a machine gun and mowing down enemies. I don't even use stealth half the time anymore because the enemies can't stop me consistently unless an entire platoon is firing at me. Or, more likely, the objective for my current mission will fail automatically if I don't use stealth. Otherwise, I play as G.I. Karl, All-American badass. Karl doesn't need to line up the perfect shot because Nazis and NKVD soldiers are rendered impotent shots by the burning flame of democracy in Karl's chest. I've been chucking grenades and even wasted a valuable rocket launcher shot on some dawdling enemies for fun at one point because there wasn't enough reprisal from the game to dissuade me.\nI almost feel like I've been rewarded for my blatant aggression instead of punished for not using more stealth.\n\nIn fact, at certain scripted points in the game (there are many) enemies will not pop out of an area you need to progress through unless you get so close that stealth is nearly compromised without immediately running away after triggering the event flag. I would think that I should be able to take advantage of the level design and pick off any inconvenient enemies from afar while moving around the perimeter of the area, but some enemies don't spawn until you actually try to move deeper into the level. I assume the developers did this to keep players on their toes, but it feels antithetical to a sniping game. Example: If two Nazis are going to come sprinting, guns blazing, through an alleyway just as I'm halfway down it after I killed everybody in the area and carefully belly crawled for 50 yards to said alleyway just for extra precaution, what's a sniper like me to do? I whip out my MP-44 and become G.I. Karl, All-American badass, instead. Die, Nazi scum.\n\nShould you buy this game? Sure, if you're a fan of WW2 games and open to something more slow-paced and less Call of Duty. I did have fun with the game when it took its stealth seriously and punished me for breaking cover, and when it rewarded me for taking down enemies in single, well-placed shots from afar. On the other hand, don't buy this game if you're intolerant of odd control schemes or looking for a really challenging sniping game. There's some reward for getting a hang of bullet drop, but you're not punished much for being a scrub either so you may feel cheated for trying to master the mechanics when goofing off as G.I. Karl works just as well much of the time.\n\nOverall, I don't think the game lives up to its potential, but it's alright for what it is.","May 28","false","9.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Take place in WWII Germany and well, you are basically a sniper that has different missions to take on. You also have a machine gun a pistol you can use in certain situations, but the overall game play is pretty good. The highlight of this game is the "bullet view". If you land a nice headshot or a good shot, you will see a bullet cam in slow motion from your rilfe and pellet into your enemy. A nice touch.\n\nThe graphics are of something that reminded me of Counter-Strike 1.6. But that should not affect your game play.\n\nHOWEVER, the only downside is the controls. When you are running, you cannot stop on a dime so when you let go of your button, your character will drift for a second. This is and should add realism, but the fact when you are running away, corners and obstacle are a nuicance and you get stuck for that second on that object until your drift stops. That one second that can make or break the mission.\n\nAll in all, it's also a short to medium game. I bought it with the package on Winter Sale 2015  and this one was about $3. Best $3 I spent and this game should not disappoint.\n\nIf you buy this game to go Rambo style, well it kind of defeats the purpose. There are instances where you can, and where you have no choice, but it's really to see what it's like to be a sniper.","January 20","true","24.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You work for the OSS, predecessor of the CIA, and your job to prevent the high-tech German scientists were working on from falling into Soviet hands. This means you will be fighting both Germans and Russians, usually behind enemy lines. You will crawl, sneak, walk, and run around the level, set traps to cover your back, make a silent kill or two, use sound of artillery to cover your shots, and so on. The levels are quite open, and enemies have patrol routes but will react to you and other factors. Actual approach is up to you. Ambush with bombs, shoot with gun, or other approaches? The interface is clunky due to console port laziness, but the "bullet cam" where the viewpoint tracks the bullet and the kill lead to a lot of imitations since. All in all, this is a game that started the genre, and it can be extremely hard, but extremely rewarding.

The game forces you to play as sniper, what a surprise.\n-missions are pretty interesting. Most of the times you have to infiltrate the heavily guarded territory (alarm = game over), take a position (optional: plant explosives everywhere), then start shooting like crazy in everyone.\n\nCons:\n-cities are pretty much empty. Most of the building are permanently locked, so you cannot enter them and you can't get on the roof for a good sniping position. Although some enemies are able to do that. And those roofs that you can enter are pretty useless, because AI instantly notices you there from afar.\n-and the worst part of this game:\nAI is pretty much broken. You can snipe an enemy out of bushes with one single bullet from a great distance and enemies will instantly know where it came from. It feels like I appear on their minimap like a big glowing dot right after the shot from any weapon without silencer (i.e. anything other than silenced pistol, which has awful accuracy on medium to long ranges).\nSo after any shot all enemies on the map will be rushing towards you, no matter how well you hid or if you ran away right after the shot.\nWhat was the point of creating a game where you have to play sniper, but you also can't do that, I don't know.\nIf not that, I'd easily rate this game 7/10, which is pretty good by my standards.\n\n\nIf you played first CoD and ever thought something like "But I don't want be here, I want to be on that hill with a sniper rifle", this game is definitely for you. If you liked Rogue trooper, you'll probably like this game as well.\n\nIt felt like a good game indeed, but I guess I'm not patient enough.\nThe last straw was the mission in a field with 2 enemy snipers, me and big ♥♥♥ gun that fired every 10 seconds or so.\nI thought it was put there by devs to provide sound masking option for stealthy sniping enemy snipers.\nSo I counted seconds, then put a perfect headshot from ~200 metres in enemy sniper.\nI could have sworn this was a sound masked shot - I fired the same time with that cannon.\nBut, apparently, second sniper somehow heard it and instantly saw me and started to shoot at me (I was ~300 metres away from him, crawling in bushes).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/3700/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","The game's got a lot of cool features but much of the technical stuff I found is pretty awful which ruins whatever good experience I have with it.\n\nThe single player difficulty can be customized; wind, gravity, posture, and heart rate can be toggled on and off. The grenade blast radius & "Empty Lung" capacity, basically the command to keep your aim steady, can be altered. The AI difficulty can also be set to a preference.\n\nThe sniper shooting and the mechanics behind it work proper and the kill cam when getting a long distance kill can be satisfying to watch for a short time.\n\nHealth punishingly goes down fast and you only have a limited amount of saves per mission so you're sort of forced to actually stay on your toes.\n\nThe (default) controls are a bit odd but they're do-able and can get used to with a bit of time.\nFor firing weapons that isn't your sniper (with the default keys in mind) you have to first equip the weapon then click the fire button once to aim and again to fire.\nYou can't rebind the aim and throw throwables controls (they say "grenades" but really the control's for anything you can throw)  as they are locked on to the LMB and RMB. Apparently to throw a throwable you have to first equip it, then hold LMB to ready yourself and then press RMB to throw.\nTo speed up or slow down your movement you have to scroll the mouse wheel up to set the crawl, walk, or run speed to fast and down for slower. You can hold shift as you're moving to dynamically go even slower.\n\nWhen running at full speed and you attempt to decrease your speed to either stop or make a turn the character tends to slide a bit before actually doing something else which may have you stopped a little further from your destination than you'd like. Even when during a sprint and I immediately switch to prone I slide anyway in the direction I was headed towards.\n\nWith it being a stealth game because the game's about being a sniper and all it should be expected that the AI would be great if not just working proper, which doesn't.\nFor the first mission a lot of the enemies apparently know exactly where I am even when I've done all I can to be stealthy and I know this because despite them being miles away they run towards my direction and as they turn elsewhere their FOVs are always facing me even when I'm behind the cover I carefully guaranteed that no one else would see me go to. Could be that someone minutes ago already saw and I didn't notice but that doesn't excuse what happens after they spot you. When one guy spots you, and even if you kill him the second he noticed you, apparently the entire opposing force that's close has a lock on where you are no matter where you go next. When they spot you there's no way to lose their sight other than to kill them. Not even running long distance where it's empty & safe helps elude them. Plus they don't act like they belong in single player; they act more like badly programmed bots in a multiplayer match who strafe, run around, and prone frequently for whatever reason. If you're trying to take a peak behind a wall or cover as slowly as you can and there's an enemy behind it that's just locked on to you, the instant they see something they could shoot off you they'll open fire. It could be that all this is their way of upping the difficulty if you get spotted but that doesn't really help making the AI look worse when it was already bad and this goes for all the difficulty settings that isn't "Easy".\nIn the second mission I thought the idea of concealing your sniper shot sounds with the frequent artillery fire was cool. Apparently way more often than there should be they still have a bad habit of spotting me from long distance despite me crawling as slow as possible on appropriate terrain that increases my camo index. Along with that they also have a habit of seeing me through the tiny cracks & slits that are on the cover for the player to look through.

This is a really rough quality game. It's hard, but if you want realistic stealth that's a good thing... but I don't actually think this is realistic. I don't find the guards' hearing or observational skills at all realistic, in many cases over sensitive, and sometimes too quick to be aggressive. And that's not a complaint because it makes it hard. It's a complaint because it feels like cheap AI, and therefore like a bad game. Like I said, if a stealth game is hard due to realism, great. If it's hard because it's just arbitrarily coded that way, that's not realistic, and that to me is not a good stealth game.\n\nIf you want an old game with old graphics that's actually closer to realistic stealth, but is still old fashioned enough that you can still pretend to yourself that because it's old it's therefore hard and therefore good, get Death To Spies.","July 19, 2014","false","4.4"," 10 of 30 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","10","30","2","0"

Continuous pauses for tip windows popping up and a funky control system. (tap z to crouch, hold z to go prone)  Plus some rather dumb things like any type of walking no matter how slow would increase your heart rate, but crawling while prone would do nothing to affect it.  Plus, you are only stealthy while prone, even walking as slow as possible would alert enemies to your position while you could practically go all the way to them while prone.  The graphics are pretty terrible by today's standards and the voice acting was lacking any sort of charm.  And the enemies liked to line up for you to kill them.\nBut, it was actually a pretty fun game with a decent story line.  Basically you are trying to prevent the Russians from gaining nuclear tech from the Nazis toward the end of the war.\nIt also had some neat things like bullet tracking while sniping, trip mines for planting traps for enemies.

Although an undercover agent, you get to play a Natzi sniper which I thought was kind of cool; change of pace you know.  This game is fun and it sets the WWII / Cold War mood pretty well. My only complaint is the AI is kind of lame.  Enemies sometimes seem to know where you are even if you are low crawling slowly/hiding, Fun.","December 30, 2011","true","45.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you ever wanted to be a sniper in WWII then this is the game for you. It has bullet flight and drop. It has a multiplayer that is still active and fun to play around with. The graphics are just great for this game, it really draws you into the action. The controls can be tricky if your doing default so make sure to use your own set-up. The story is great and there are a number of missions with alot of things to do. The action never stops, you can be guns free or pick off your enemy from a distance. The slow motion bullet follow is fun to watch. The overall game is great!

The slow motion bullet-cam feature is a sniper fan's dream come true.  And the fact that you can accurately flank and distract opponents without them psychically "figuring it out" is glorious to behold.  Shoot a guy from one place, run around the level, approach from another angle, hide in a pillar box, watch him run around like a spaz, blow his head off.  It really is up to you and the levels are interesting enough to keep you going.  I absolutely adore this game, and the sequel is on my "must purchase full price or lose respect for myself" list.

I've found very little deflection in windage affecting cross-drift of the round - enabling me to make 200 Meter or so headshots without a significant problem.\n\nBear in mind that this is an old game and one of the first 'proper' sniping games... dont bash this game after playing more modern sniper games. Enjoy the 'retro' feel of this early title... and remember it for what it is...RETRO.\n\nIts a shame that I got this after the multi-player on-line servers had shutdown, but that doesn't stop you playing via LAN I should think... worth an afternoon to realize how far the genre has developed... a must have for your war library at a couple of bucks.\n\nMissions are fairly linear and the AI is not challenging, though it does get a tad ridiculous when enemy soldiers show eagle-eyed propensity to detect you from dozens of meters away.\n\nOftentimes a whizz of a close-passing round will make me hit the dirt and spend some time reallocating to find out the shooters location... unlike other reviews who claim that this game has limited ammo... I always find myself clearing levels with supplied ammo untouched...this is a SNIPER game after all...not DOOM II!\n\nIf you are an all-guns blazing type...move on. if you like to think over your shot, watch your target patrol/do his thing before committing to the trigger... come on in.\n\nBullet time is decidedly retro. Its like finding gamp's rusty old musket and cleaning it out to fire a few rounds to take you back to yesteryear... cant wait to clear this and move on to the other two successors I also bought.

Continuous pauses for tip windows popping up and a funky control system. (tap z to crouch, hold z to go prone)  Plus some rather dumb things like any type of walking no matter how slow would increase your heart rate, but crawling while prone would do nothing to affect it.  Plus, you are only stealthy while prone, even walking as slow as possible would alert enemies to your position while you could practically go all the way to them while prone.  The graphics are pretty terrible by today's standards and the voice acting was lacking any sort of charm.  And the enemies liked to line up for you to kill them.\nBut, it was actually a pretty fun game with a decent story line.  Basically you are trying to prevent the Russians from gaining nuclear tech from the Nazis toward the end of the war.\nIt also had some neat things like bullet tracking while sniping, trip mines for planting traps for enemies.

I've found very little deflection in windage affecting cross-drift of the round - enabling me to make 200 Meter or so headshots without a significant problem.\n\nBear in mind that this is an old game and one of the first 'proper' sniping games... dont bash this game after playing more modern sniper games. Enjoy the 'retro' feel of this early title... and remember it for what it is...RETRO.\n\nIts a shame that I got this after the multi-player on-line servers had shutdown, but that doesn't stop you playing via LAN I should think... worth an afternoon to realize how far the genre has developed... a must have for your war library at a couple of bucks.\n\nMissions are fairly linear and the AI is not challenging, though it does get a tad ridiculous when enemy soldiers show eagle-eyed propensity to detect you from dozens of meters away.\n\nOftentimes a whizz of a close-passing round will make me hit the dirt and spend some time reallocating to find out the shooters location... unlike other reviews who claim that this game has limited ammo... I always find myself clearing levels with supplied ammo untouched...this is a SNIPER game after all...not DOOM II!\n\nIf you are an all-guns blazing type...move on. if you like to think over your shot, watch your target patrol/do his thing before committing to the trigger... come on in.\n\nBullet time is decidedly retro. Its like finding gamp's rusty old musket and cleaning it out to fire a few rounds to take you back to yesteryear... cant wait to clear this and move on to the other two successors I also bought. Hopefully, like wine, this series gets better with time...\n\nBuy it on sale. 67/100.","February 22, 2015","true","71.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beholdtheblight/recommended/3700/","beholdtheblight","Unconquered","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beholdtheblight/","123 products in account","I can't really recommend this game unless you get it for 1$ or bundled. I remember this one back in 2005 when it was regularly featured on Gamer.tv which used to air on an obscure channel called Now (how I miss that show). The game was built for the PS2 which explains the outdated graphic engine. And I say outdated because this was a year after Farcry, Doom 3, Painkiller and Halflife 2 (2004-That was the best year for PC shooters). But anyway the graphics are decent...neat skyboxes, great depressing atmosphere without being overly gritty.\n\nUsed to give a F**k about this game as I was around 18 when it released and upgraded my PC to play the then top of the line games as mentioned above. Man! it's a decade later and I decided to buy this along with the other two sequels. As a man almost in his 30's now, You would think I would really go crazy with this game in a pseudo intellectual way...World War, History etc.\n\nTurns out it's an action-stealth game with the sniping simulator as a pretext. Well all that's fine, it plays out more or less like a Dishonoured where you can stick by a rule or just go around on a murderous rampage. Control-wise there is a lot of Splinter Cell influence. In terms of realism it's in between arcade and simulation leaning more towards arcade. Just don't expect an early Ghost Recon or Rainbox Six(1998).\n\nSniper Elite can get pretty repitative, with very little to shake things up. The game is lengthy which in this case, doesn't do any good. It faces the same problem as many Modern games, too many ideas thrown in...few good, few excecuted properly.\nRather than be a sniper centric game, it tries hard to be alot more, hence rather than getting one thing right, ends up being sup-par in every aspect. Lets take a look a great idea- Tripwire traps, Awesome!\nExcecution? They had to create a situation for you to use them or you just forget about them.\n\nI guess the biggest drawback here is age, see this game was crafted to be a Modern game, and unlike retro games and classic games...this one won't age well. It was meant to be played and disposed , There was another game that released in this year for the same platform and that was Shadow of The Colossus, I still think about that game till this day. That's what made it a classic. And this? not even a bargain bin classic.\n\nBack in 2005 I would give this a 6/10. Today I would highly recommend getting it bundled and giving it 4 hours of gameplay to see if you like it. I had a bit of fun with this one and it's way more entertaining and ambitious than a modern day Call of Duty.","February 4","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rules of engagement are simple: kill, and don't be seen.  If you run into combat, you will die.  If you get pinned in and forget to set your traps....you will die.  If you forgot to scout with your binoculars and missed the eight soldiers around that truck...yeah you will die.\n\nYet, even with the easy death, the game is still doable.  It takes lots of practice and patience...and when you get the gravity down to blow up a truck, and then take out a sniper on a roof before anyone knows where you are, then it's time to up the difficulty and play with wind.","April 18, 2012","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You take on the role of a sniper, but not in your typical first/third person "run and gun" style.  Instead, you have to have patience and move slow, staying hidden, picking your targets carefully and not necessarily trying to kill every enemy you see, taking your shots while keeping gravity, wind, and breathing in mind, then carefully changing locations once you've given your position away, etc.  That kind of thought and detail usually makes gameplay that much more immersive to me, and I was very much intrigued.\n\nUnfortunately, Sniper Elite is an older game, just having had its ten year anniversary, and as well as it did in some areas the game just didn't do it for me.  The dated graphics didn't bother me much at all, but the overall gameplay and lack of any real story just really left me disappointed.  The enemy AI, for example, was at times both ridiculously stupid and uncanny.  One minute they couldn't see me crawling on the ground 10 feet away from them in 25% cover, and the next minute they pegged my location (in 75% cover AND hidden behind a wall) from around the block and a street over.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beholdtheblight/recommended/3700/","beholdtheblight","Unconquered","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beholdtheblight/","123 products in account","I can't really recommend this game unless you get it for 1$ or bundled. I remember this one back in 2005 when it was regularly featured on Gamer.tv which used to air on an obscure channel called Now (how I miss that show). The game was built for the PS2 which explains the outdated graphic engine. And I say outdated because this was a year after Farcry, Doom 3, Painkiller and Halflife 2 (2004-That was the best year for PC shooters). But anyway the graphics are decent...neat skyboxes, great depressing atmosphere without being overly gritty.\n\nUsed to give a F**k about this game as I was around 18 when it released and upgraded my PC to play the then top of the line games as mentioned above. Man! it's a decade later and I decided to buy this along with the other two sequels. As a man almost in his 30's now, You would think I would really go crazy with this game in a pseudo intellectual way...World War, History etc.\n\nTurns out it's an action-stealth game with the sniping simulator as a pretext. Well all that's fine, it plays out more or less like a Dishonoured where you can stick by a rule or just go around on a murderous rampage. Control-wise there is a lot of Splinter Cell influence. In terms of realism it's in between arcade and simulation leaning more towards arcade. Just don't expect an early Ghost Recon or Rainbox Six(1998).\n\nSniper Elite can get pretty repitative, with very little to shake things up. The game is lengthy which in this case, doesn't do any good. It faces the same problem as many Modern games, too many ideas thrown in...few good, few excecuted properly.\nRather than be a sniper centric game, it tries hard to be alot more, hence rather than getting one thing right, ends up being sup-par in every aspect. Lets take a look a great idea- Tripwire traps, Awesome!\nExcecution? They had to create a situation for you to use them or you just forget about them.\n\nI guess the biggest drawback here is age, see this game was crafted to be a Modern game, and unlike retro games and classic games...this one won't age well. It was meant to be played and disposed , There was another game that released in this year for the same platform and that was Shadow of The Colossus, I still think about that game till this day. That's what made it a classic. And this? not even a bargain bin classic.\n\nBack in 2005 I would give this a 6/10. Today I would highly recommend getting it bundled and giving it 4 hours of gameplay to see if you like it. I had a bit of fun with this one and it's way more entertaining and ambitious than a modern day Call of Duty.","February 4","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
