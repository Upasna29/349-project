I love all kinds of them, from AAA titles all the way to tiny Indie releases. I even found some small enjoyment playing this game the first time, but upon playing it further, I've rapidly fallen out of love with this game. The worst part isn't that it does anything particularly wrong, it just fails to do much of anything right or original, and gave me no reason to keep coming back. Save your money on this one folks. If you don't believe me, watch my gameplay video and view it as the high-water mark of my experience with the game:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485965593\n\nPros\nNone (I tried, sorry folks)\nCons\nBland environments\nTerrible sound effects\nNo strategic challenge beyond simple "keep away from monsters and shoot them"\nTerrible Interface and Options Menu","July 21, 2015","false","0.3"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","0"

Sadly I found it very boring.\n\nFor 10 levels you get the exact same map over and over, finished off with a boss fight, and then you finally get a new map. For another 10 levels. The graphics make due, they're nothing special, and the audio is alright. Although the sub machine gun sounds like a pea shooter and flamethrower is so loud expect issues.\n\nThere is no urgency in the game, nothing makes you go "OH NO" "I'm going to die, what can I do?!". Nothing, it's very monotonous, and just not fun.\n\nYou can upgrade and buy new weapons through gold coins, but once you have a decent flamethrower with enough ammo you're set. Hitting enemies charges up your special, once it's charged you become immune for a bit, do more damage, move faster, and get a full Flamethrower of ammo. So just repeat until you go insane and you've beat the game.\n\nI've died a total of 3 time, twice for getting to close to enemies to pick up coins they drop then dead, and once from a boss.\n\nThere really isn't much do it, and after 0.9 hours I already finished a third of the game. At â‚¬10, I don't think it's worth it sadly.\n\nPC gameplay\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MmXIpNMwEc","July 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

You're killing zombie hordes that come in waves in a top-down view. As you progress, the stages are more difficult and there is more variety in the horde of enemies.  There are three maps and each has 10 stages with different enemy makeup. Three stages have boss battles, and there are three challenge maps.\n\nA mass of dead has three weapon types, with variants of each type (SMG, Shotgun, Flamethrower). All weapons are upgradeable with a basic upgrade system in place. There is also a variety of equipment upgrades that modify your character slightly, including health points, increased item drop, and increased run speed.\n\nI wish there were more content in the game. More maps and enemy types would go a long way to make the game replayable. It's still pretty mindless fun. It's easy to get into and easy to pick up.\n","July 16, 2015","true","7.9"," 9 of 123 people (7%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","7","9","123","9","2"
