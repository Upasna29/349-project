"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/recommended/399230/","Zootch","Karl Pilkington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/","904 products in account","the entire game looks like those terrible 90's compressed cgi full motion video things that play before you begin a game.\n\nthere are no options, period.\nso the music is way too quiet, turning it up leads to excruciating beeps and boops that i guess serve as a notification.  none of my actions made any noise.\n\ngraphics as i mentioned, are just awful. no options there either. chugs like a chungus. made in UNREAL engine.\n\nUpon launch, you are greeted with a dreadful menu that has three things to click on. PLAY, TUTORIAL, QUIT. Even worse, they have those three things repeated right next to their english counterparts, now in russian. One of the worst UIs i have ever seen.\nhttp://imgur.com/oFQOkVD\nyep. that's all you get.\n\nif you can stomache all that, you will get to the gameplay . which is just using spatulas and a flip motion to turn things. otherwise its you against crrrrrrraazzzy physics that will make any simple task into an unfunny unoriginal unfunny wrestling match.\n\nwhen i started my first playthrough, this is what i was greeted with\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=516505798\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=516505965\n\ni don't even have the words.\n\n\n\nnow onto the developer drama.\n\nThe developers are greedy and love censorship, and here's some reasons for why.\n\nthe day this came out, there was none of that brand new 10 percent off launch discount.\nnope, it was a flat 19.99 dollars. 19.99 dollars for THIS.\n\nso i went to their old greenlight page to see just who's responsible for this trainwreck because the developers aren't even posting comments on their own forum. they don't even watch to show their own "faces" to own up to this crime.\n\nso there's "nice" aka alex wardle (according to their youtube account) who on their greenlight page would just spam emotes, mock the critics, and just act like your general 15 year old meming kid on the internet that you just want to thump on the head. over and over.\n\nNow i was given a free key, because the developer is actually handing them out like candy, hoping for positive reviews. I don't think many people are actually paying real money for this, and if they did... I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nAlso, there's "paleface" who has a VAC ban on their steam account. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058948330\nthey're Russians. (not surprised)\n\n*note* both profiles are private and have been well before I wrote this review.\n\nBy the way, at launch, paleface actually wrote a review for his own game just to boost the review status to positive. i didn't capture a picture at the time, but it has since been deleted.\nThey also gave out keys to friends so they could write positive reviews that were useless and obviously bias.\nAt some point, the developer and several friends were the only reviews on steam, so naturally they had a positive rating. most have been removed due to criticism but there's still a few left.\n\nNow, they have since deleted their greenlight page to cover this up, but before they did, I took a screenshot of "nice", who was doing all the typical antics to get greenlight votes, including promising the price would be very low.\n\nhere is the picture i took. https://imgur.com/Qq5NkCG\n\nthe wayback machine also can find an old page where "paleface" claims "We will not charge to much for the game, all will be able to afford ."\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140605123002/http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/265721972/522728814235936946\n\nIt looks like nice is claiming that there will be some sort of updates or workshop for new levels?\n"With a new map every 2 weeks anything can happen !"\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150605062056/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026963897 (he used to be public)\n\nso it sounds like the developers are just two brothers from the same mother\n\ngreedy liars.\nthe game launched at 19.99\n\nSo naturally i went to the forum and made a thread saying this, and how asinine and greedy this behavior was.\n\nAbout a day later i found my thread had been quitely deleted. So i made another identical one.\nA day later, the thread had several responses of similar criticism and outrage. A day later, the thread was again, deleted. At no point has either developer posted a response. Also, i found myself banned by one of the developers.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/DVWNJto\n\nreal cheeky. note, they couldn't be bothered to put a reason, but we all know why they did it.\n\nAnd there's plenty of others who can verify they've been banned for questioning their actions, or they had actual communication on a personal level with one or both of the developers, and they indeed act like weird moody teenagers with no talent or social skills.\nthis "game" is one of the worst things on steam. it belongs in the halls of Air Control, Zen Fish Simulator, Earth Year 2066, The District, and your typical Digital Homicide game.\n\ni guess apparently they've reduced the price to 9.99 after nobody would buy it, but this trash\nreally should be FREE, and ideally on some website for download, not Steam.\n\n\n*edit* developer flagged this review as abusive\nhttp://imgur.com/WRcU8o6\n\nit has since been cleared.","September 11, 2015","false","8.8"," 182 of 196 people (93%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","93","182","196","18","12"

Making the controls bad isn't challenge its just bad controls, Another very bad thing about this is the glitches, allow me to list some of them off.\n\n-The food sometimes just blows up\n\n-The orders on the screens just go away\n\n-When i closed the game and reopened it I was transported to day 2 for no reason\n\n-The first time i pressed the tutorial button i had to quit the game because it would not close the pop up when i pressed said tutorial button\n\nAnd i am sure those arent the only ones. But i can see how this game could be fun, If there were just a bit more work into the game and maybe a tutorial about the game so i don't press everything on my key board to find out one thing. On things to add, There is nothing. Do not add anything at the moment just focus at making the game less glitchy, The way it is right now i cannot give it a rating higher than a 1/10\n\nJust because of this low score i do not think you should give up game making, No game is perfect and no developer is perfect. I look forward to the next game you are working on no matter what it may be.","September 4, 2015","false","0.2"," 167 of 180 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","167","180","12","0"
