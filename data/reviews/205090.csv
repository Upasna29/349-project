I probably sunk the most hours into this one of all the BIT.TRIP games, and I still listen to the soundtrack very often. And that ending, it still moves me to tears sometimes.\n\nHere's all you need to know about this stunningly bad port:\n\n- Lag causes beats to go through the paddle.\n- Timing bugs make powerups run out too early, causing challenge segments to be impossible.\n- The gorgeous backgrounds are barely visible due to lighting errors.\n- Vsync causes input lag that you cannot avoid unless you run the game in windowed mode. (Unless you disable the FPS cap in the ini file, which creates even more timing issues.)\n- Glitch still present from the WiiWare releases allows you to glitch perfects with great ease.\n- The studio who did this port made a patch, but they are done working on this game and the patch has not been posted to Steam for an unknown reason.\n\nBasically, if your computer is not strong enough to run a Wii emulator at persistent 60 FPS (Which is basically what this port is) you're gonna have game-breaking problems.\n\nBIT.TRIP FLUX is a perfect game, and one of the most memorable rhythm games I've ever played. 10/10. But if you want to play it, either get it on WiiWare, get BIT.TRIP COMPLETE for Wii, get BIT.TRIP SAGA on the 3DS e-shop (it's cheap!), but don't bother with this crummy port. It's sad for all the wrong reasons.","January 2, 2015","false","6.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","3"

(I've beat it on Wii and 3DS before)\n\nBIT.TRIP FLUX is a simplistic arcade game about blocking "Beats" with your paddle. Kind of like Pong, but only on one side, and with way more balls. It's extremely similar to BIT.TRIP BEAT, go check that out too.\nThe game itself is pretty fun and challenging while still being fair, thanks to the checkpoint system. The soundtrack is pretty good too (although not really my taste), it's a little different from the chiptunes that the other BIT.TRIP games have. Content is lacking, but the replayability makes up for it. Everything's good so far, so why do I not recommend it?\nThe port is HORRENDOUS. The first thing I noticed when I started the game is the crazy input delay on my mouse movement. So I opened the options, only to find that there's nearly no settings! No way to disable VSync and not even an option for changing the mouse's sensitivity, which means I had to force disable VSync by changing the game's config files.\nWith VSync off, the game played mostly fine, but all animations that fade out were played too quickly and one of the powerups was broken and refused to work properly. From what I heard, the first boss also becomes impossible to beat (haha, get it).\nI enabled VSync again after that and it was pretty awful. The input lag returned and the game started getting extremely annoying stutters. Not only that, but once I reached Stage 6 on Epiphany (first level), the beats started to pass THROUGH my paddle (!!!) and it screwed up my multiplier. So yeah, it's not very playable with either VSync on or off.\nI haven't been able to get past Epiphany yet because IT CRASHES ON STAGE 6. And I'm not the only one having this problem.\n\nGreat game, unacceptable port. Avoid this (and play it on Wii instead, or 3DS if you don't have a Wii) until they fix it (which will probably be never, if you look at the studio's previous ports of BIT.TRIP games).\n\nUPDATE:[/b]\nI bought a new computer and decided to give this game another go again. This time, it didn't crash on me a single time (and I was able to get to the ending in one sitting), but it still stuttered, despite this thing being able to run pretty much every game at 60 FPS maxed. I'm just going to guess they didn't even bother with the optimization a single bit.","June 9, 2014","false","2.3"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","3"

Port is very bad and many people will experience problems with running this game propertly. No leaderboards, no comparing your results to friends... Situation is not good, but at least the person responsible for it is active on forums and tries his best to help everyone with issues. Still, that is more points for good intentions than performance.\n\nThe game itself however... Man... Bit.Trip FLUX has one of the most moving video game soundtracks I ever listened in the indie game. Beats and instruments are incredibly warm and cheerful, yet distant and alien. Sound design the strongest point of the series and FLUX delivers the touching ending note. Gameplay is just a mirrored version of Bit.Trip BEAT, but for me those last three songs make the difference. Overarching theme of the whole series is on full force here and if you are already intrigued by this whole mysterious plot tying up all six games of the series, you will not be disappointed. This is a satisfactory ending of the CommanderVideo's errant.\n\nOverall, I recommend the game for all Bit.Trip fans and those looks for incredible, musical experience.","September 25, 2014","true","5.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

However, I think that the PC controls are inadequate, and don't do this beautiful game justice, in that there is no way to adjust mouse sensitivity, at least at the time that I wrote this. Also, even though I have a fairly powerful PC and a pretty decent mouse, I experience significant lag. It makes me very sad to give a game in the BIT.TRIP series (which is definitely my favorite indie franchise, and one of my favorites overall) a negative review, but I must warn others of the faults in this port. My advice is to MAYBE get it when it's on sale, and wait for the devs to fix it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/recommended/205090/","Jragghen","Jragghen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/","965 products in account","BIT.TRIP FLUX is a pixel rhythm game loosely based off of Pong, in which the player controls a paddle on one side of the screen and is responsible for bouncing back "bits" that fly across the screen at it. It is the final game in the BIT.TRIP series, and is more than adequate for being the final huzzah, but somewhat marred by some in-game bugs.\n\nFATE and be thought of the "answer" to BEAT, where this time you play on the right side of the screen instead of the left. Like other BIT.TRIP games, as you string together a number of successful hits without a miss, the game will move to a "higher" mode which has more graphic effects, and as you miss enough without getting an appropriate number of successes, you will move to a "lower" mode, which has fewer. FLUX adds a final layer, META, for a total of 8 - NETHER, HYPER (which you start in), MEGA, SUPER, ULTRA, EXTRA, GIGA, and META.\n\nFLUX is both easier and harder than other BIT.TRIP games. It's less difficult to beat than BEAT was, for example, but is effectively impossible to perfect on the PC. As other reviews have noted, there are some issues which can cause beats to pass through your paddle and other sorts of frustrating timing issues (to say nothing of the fact that the game appears to be designed to have harder sequences, but be more forgiving for going up/down levels so it takes doing much worse to eventually lose).\n\nI still enjoyed it despite its flaws, but it's a shame that the port to PC for the final game in the series isn't in the best state possible.","March 6, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I love the music and the style. Hell, when the gameplay works, it's a fun game.\n\nThe problem is the mouse controls. Instead of taking raw input from the mouse, it uses the cursor position. This would not be a problem If you were actually able to move fullt vertical, but there are small gaps at the top and bottom of the screen where your mouse can be, but the paddle can not. This makes the game feel weird because when you move you mouse to the top of the screen quickly, your mouse will move to the top, but the paddle will stop at the upper limit. When you then start to move down, You don't move down immediately because the mouse has to exit the barrier zone that shows the score before the paddle will move with it. Using mouse position instead of raw input also means running the game in windowed mode is damn near impossible as well. If you're like me and moving your mouse up and down on a game like this alsoi causes you to move it ever-so-slightly to the left or right as well, you'll find yourself moving the mouse cursor off the game windows and you'll be thrown off because then the game isn't accepting any inpun while the cursor is off its window. This also makes playing with two monitors a pain in the ♥♥♥ because if your cursor drifts to the other monitor, then you're also stuck with the game not accepting any input.\n\nLong story short, if it wasn't for a technical oversight on how the game handled mouse input, which is the only way of playing the game, it would be a damn fun game. Because of the mouse issues though, FLUX is only frustrating to play on PC.","March 26, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As is the norm for the series, a pixel art style is used. In this game, the graphics aren't as eye searing as in Beat, but look stylized and trippy with more solid colors and less distracting background events. The music is chiptune inspired, and Flux is mainly composed of remixes from the first level in Beat. The guest artist from Beat is back too with a new catchy menu theme. The music for Flux is lighter and calmer, almost happy and free. As in Beat, each reflected beat makes a sound that is in tune with the music. In this game, the backing track does not change. Instead, the instrument when reflecting a beat changes per rank. Storywise, this game continues from Fate to end the Bit.Trip series saga as a whole. The story feels more figurative and symbolic, but does tie up the game series as a whole which has a weird and confusing narrative to it.\nThe gameplay is very much the same as in Beat, where the goal is to reflect back squares with a paddle. However, in this game, the paddle is on the right of the screen. Blocks needed to be hit are now white colored rather than being colored based on their pattern. Extra gray blocks can be hit to give bonuses, but they tend to be out of the way in a set of blocks that may make it risky to get. White circles are to be avoided as they will impact your rank. Lastly, powerups like in Beat are present, with a few more new powerups (or challenges) present in Flux. Flux tends to borrow some conventions from all previous games in the series. At the end of the levels are some bosses, which range from easy to hard. Each level has to be done in one sitting, although there are now checkpoints in each level which are be activated when the player loses in some way.\nThe difficulty is considered to be slightly higher than Beat due to the white circles and the fact that all blocks to hit are now white. There are indeed easy and hard parts of the game along with one fairly tough boss fight. This game is much like Beat, so expect some of the same kind of action and length of each level.\nFlux concludes the Bit.Trip series with a game that takes its gameplay from Beat and from all the other Bit.Trip games. Play this game last after playing through all the previous Bit.Trip games to enjoy it fully. By taking elements from the previous games in the series, Flux presents some previously seen concepts and shows it again to give an engaging experience as a grand conclusion to the Bit.Trip series.","July 17, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Neither of those are really appealing to me, so I didn't like this game.\n\nAlright, so this is the second Bit.Trip game like this and it really doesn't appeal to me.\n\nBasically, this game is like rhythmic pong campaign mode. Each time a node enters the screen, it plays a sound. Each time you ping it back, it plays another sound. The idea is don't miss any nodes and you can hear the full song without missing a beat. And that's cool. But it just doesn't offer too much.\n\nThere's totally nodes that don't travel straight. There's totally nodes that travel in sequence, but hit the end area at slightly different heights. There's a bunch of different creative ways they decided to create the nodes and how to interact with them, and I totally give them credit for that, but I just couldn't play this game for too long.\n\nI say that loving the music in all* games by Gaijin Games.\n\nMaybe it's because I really like the sound and if I do happen to miss, the penalty is doubly harsh?

Oh dear god.\n\nIt's one the most forgiving evil-trousers pleasantly rage inducing games I've played, well, ever.\n\nConcept is simple. You = bat. Move the mouse (or joystick if you = numpty) to move yourself in game. Block the oncoming waves of squares (or 'beats' as the BIT.TRIP series colloquially refers to them as) and avoid the walls and caves of circles along to calming music, as you either zone out to the beautiful melodies (Level 2 is my bae) or punch your screen repeatedly because the game ♥♥♥♥ed you up the ♥♥♥.\n\nBIT.TRIP FLUX is almost dangerously good at making it look like one thing is about to happen, making you gear up for the sequence about to attempt to infiltrate the rather flimsy defences of whatever is behind you, and then at the last moment, with some swish movement, changing it to something completely different, confusing you and causing you to go through about 3 monitors (which equates to about 1 monitor per level) due to your incapability to bottle up your frustrated screams that you feverishly wish that you could metaphorically punch the developers of Flux in the face with.\nEven the level count is not exempt from this. What appears as a measley 3 levels turns into a whole hour (or five if you don't know what you're doing) of calming melody mixed with high blood pressure and loud vocal poo. Checkpoints are a welcome feature, as I doubt my first playthrough would be possible without them, something that it's soul predecessor* (yes, this is a sequel) lacked, even though it was a damnsite easier.\n\nUpon completing the level, you are given a number with about 10 digits which refelects how well you did, but at least 4 of these remain as zeroes. (As if anybody could get a score of anything anywhere near one-billion-and-whatever) And then you get a 'cutscene' (which is just an MPEG of some shapes moving around each other) followed by another level procedurally more difficult than the previous. I can't help but feel myself feeling a little stupid, as when I dance around at the pronouncement of vicory, I don't exactly get much of an award, except a number which makes me feel, frankly, a little ♥♥♥♥. I wish this game was more rewarding. The game does change the sounds that the 'beats' make upon impact (which, by the way, wonderfully compliment the music, if you can pull off the sequence) but this becomes more of a thing that the game can indirectly rub in your face by degrading the sound experience because you couldn't guess that the simple up-down-up-down-centre sequence that was flying at you (and that you were ready for) to suddenly start doing loopy-loops then come at you as the same thing but upside down and backwards. That, or the colorful trails that some of the 'beats' leave become too overwhelming and the screenfull of rainbow becomes the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ised trick the game could possibly pull on you. Except that it isn't. Because the next sequence will be a lot more daunting, and will be a lot more random in what it turns out to be.\n\nEven then, sequences that look like they're about to change don't, but simply remain in an order which will make you sweat with how far you have to move your mouse becuase this game has NO SENSITIVITY OPTIONS WHATSOEVER GRUBLE GRUMBLE\n\nBUT, despite this, this game is practically a work of art. as soon as you head into the options and set the difficulty to Easy, this game becomes a beautiful masterpiece where sound and video perfectly compliment each other.\n\nTHE GAME GETS A 7/10. It's beautiful, if you can either play the levels over and over so many times that you learn all fo the game's tricks, or you don't mind a bit of hardcore spit-and-elbow-grease difficulty.\n\n*Yes, I know there was another 4 games inbetween this and BEAT, as well as Runner2, but the gameplay of BEAT and FLUX remain practically unchanged.","January 26, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So just keep in mind, if you run this game in windowed mode, be sure to click the left mouse button when the game starts to lock the mouse inside the game window so your controls don't flake out.\n\nSo on to the review. I have this game on the Wii where it was originally released and have to say that this game is a ton more playable than it is on the Wii because of the mouse controls. Not that the Wii version is bad, but there is just an ease of precision using a mouse with this game instead of a Wiimote that you have to twist back and forth. It makes the game seem a bit more fair and alot more fun since you're not battling with the somehat archaic controls on the Wii. I've even managed to push up to the "Meta" level which I've never seen before when I was playing this game on the Wii because of the controls.","December 26, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, since the storyline is very hard to understand, especially if you haven't played the previous games. That is why I will explain it right here.\n\nAhem... An alien is born.

Of course it's the last game in the BIT.TRIP series so things get pretty epic at this point. The game is easier than the average BIT.TRIP game. Mainly because checkpoints were introduced so you didn't have to go ALL THE WAY back when you screw up unlike other BIT.TRIP games.\n\nThe game plays just like BIT.TRIP BEAT with frenzies of beats coming at you this time. But it's STILL easy since there are seven checkpoints in each of the three stages. And the music changes automatically instead of the kind of thing in BEAT and CORE where when you miss a colorful beat the music doesn't change for you.\n\nFinally the music and story are the two main aspects of this game. The story is Commander Video departs from his friends and arrives home. And the music completely fits in with it. The music is so soothing that I feel relaxed after finishing the game. Most of the magic comes from the third stage where getting further into it plays this music. And the segment after the third boss dubbed "home" is the best part of the game. You can find out for yourself once you get there. Don't want to spoil anything.\n\nI recommend this game for gameplay, story, and music.

Just the things that stand out)\n\nThe epic finale to the BIT.TIP series, Flux is certainly a must have for anyone who has experienced the full journey...if you can get past the game breaking bugs that is.\n\nThe first thing you may notice after the startup screen is the mouse lag, the thing thats killing this beautiful game. Attempting to play the first level without fixing will result in a very unsatisfying experience. Also, the game becomes somewhat impossible, as bouncing beats will go through the paddle! V-sync is able to be turned off through the options menu so your going to have to mess around with a few files. From what I have heard though (since this has not happened to me) the 1st boss becomes un beatable due to a crash.\n\nNow that were done talking about bugs, lets talk about the game itself.\nFlux plays out in similar way to Beat, the 1st game. There are a few differences from Beat, the most obvious being that your paddle is on the right side of the screen. Other differences include colourless beats, avoid blobs, bonus beats and of course, the modes. Just in case anyone is confused, I dont mean mode as in different game modes. What I mean is the change of beat sounds and graphics as you continue to block beats. A new mode has also been introduced. "Meta" (coming after Giga) will have a tune that makes it sound sort of victorious in a way when you block beats.\n\nLevels now.\nThere are 3 levels in this game. Epiphany, Perception and Catharisis. Each level has there own background, music and boss. Stage progression is different to Beat, in that you are no longer required to block rainbow coloured beats. Instead, checkpoints have replaced them. This means that failing to get out of nether mode will result in you being sent back to the last checkpoint, starting at hyper mode. Boss stages are always the final stage and each level will have differing fights. To avoid spoilers, I wont describe them although I will say that perceptions boss is the most unique.\n\nSo for a quick pros and cons sum up:\n\nPro:\nFantastic soundtrack\nSatisfying conclusion\nCheckpoints\nGreat 8-bit graphics\nSome replayability\n\nCons:\nBugs\nEpiphany and Catharisis bosses a bit too similar\nBugs\nNo public leaderboards\nBugs\n\n\nRating this game, I would give it a 7/10\n","August 11, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The enemy pong goes flying at the beat and never misses it once. I've tried for a couple hours, reinstalling the game, changing in game settings, changing the difficulty, nothing seems to work.

FLUX is the last game in the BIT.TRIP series and in my opinion is the best one out of all of them, here's a couple reasons why:\n\n- There's no game overs.\n- It has way better graphics than the Wii does.\n- It hardly has any bugs, aside from the challenges.\n- The performance is incredible. (If you turn vsync off)\n- So much time has been put into developing the game.\n\nListen, don't be fooled by the negative reviews just because the performance is "terrible", because most of them were back when the performance of the game was really terrible. Giving the game a second chance doesn't hurt anything.","August 17, 2015","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are good, the music is good, the problem is that the first boss is unbeatable.\n\nAt the end of the first world there is an AI boss that you fight in a Pong like style, but the problem is the boss cannot miss a hit. It tainted my feelings while attempting to play this game because I can't really play through it at all. I didn't have any issues with graphics, controls, or any hitches that others had but the game was rendered unplayable by that one bug. I enjoyed the hour I sunk into the first world and got my time's worth out of the game but this is a warning to you to just get it on another platform.\n\nThe music is great, the game looks great, and overall if you want a continuation of the mechanics introduced in Bit.Trip Beat this game is for you, just buy it where it actually works and not on the PC.\n\nThis review will remain negative until the issue is fixed, but from what I have read the people who worked on this game aren't releasing any patches on PC.

The first level, Epiphany, has the glitch. Once you get to the boss, you play normal pong with it, but the boss is too hard, making it seem impossible of not impossible. The enemy pong goes flying at the beat and never misses it once. I've tried for a couple hours, reinstalling the game, changing in game settings, changing the difficulty, nothing seems to work. This one glitch makes it impossible to progress through the game and complete the BIT.TRIP.","November 23, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snazzypants/recommended/205090/","snazzypants","Pesti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snazzypants/","47 products in account","BIT.TRIP FLUX is an absoultly beautiful game. It isn't so much a game that you play to be competitive with, but more to just kick back and look at the stunning visuals. It has a very charming simplistic style in both gameplay and art. The soundtrack is genius, feeling very triumphant. It is a definite step forward from the game before it, FATE. The infamously hard difficulty of the game has sustained, but feels a lot more fair this time around. The story, like in the other games, leaves much up to interpretation, but leaves you with a good idea of what's going on. The ending left me with a feeling of completion, countless goosebumps and a dazzling sensation that lasted weeks afterword. Of course, this can only be achieved through seeing and understanding the story from the previous games, so playing through all of them (or at least watching the cutscenes) is very much recommended to get the full feel of this installment.\n\nOf course, this game is NOT perfect, and here's why. The multiplier system has expanded, just as it has in all previous insallments. Now, the new mode, META, is awesome. It changes the beat noise to a badass violin note and reveals a new background. (Goosebumps ahoy). However, since there are so many stages before this, and that those stages don't sound very good, I find myself wishing that I was in META mode, whilist in reality being stuck in ULTRA. Also, sadly to say, this has to be the glitchiest game in the whole franchise. All of the other games I got through without noticing any glitches, but this one was an exception. Sometimes, usually with the MULTIPLY powerup and during the final boss, beats will pass right through the paddle, which is annoying to me and most likely more annoying to those trying for a perfect score. These bugs are not apparent at all on other ports of the game (Wii, 3DS) so getting it there might be a good idea. But if you don't have access, stick to this port.\n\nOne last thing I want to touch on is the common arguement that this game it too similar to BEAT. While it may have similarities, the games are very much different, with this one being almost a straightup improvement. Your paddle and the beats are bigger to even the difficulty, there are new AVOID beats for added difficulty, checkpoints so that you don't want to pull as much of your hair out when you fail in an area, and the game is just overall more polished and complete. Plus, this game is SUPPOSED to be similar to the original, as it is a very important part of the plot. I won't say what it is, but I was really happy to know this would be another BEAT after completing the other games.\n\nAll in all, beautiful game with wonderful music and simple gameplay. The difficulty is in a nice spot. Not easy, not brutal, at a very nice hard/very hard. Recommended to anyone reading. Hell, I recommend the whole SERIES. Got and buy the others too, silly!","July 12, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I chalk that up to my prior experience with this series, though.\n\nThe last game in this series goes full circle, both in gameplay and in themes. It recycles a lot of tricks and remixes a lot from the first game. That said, this is probably the best game of the bunch in terms of atmosphere. The soundtrack for this one in particular is beautiful.\n\nThe thing with this game is that it starts hard right off the bat. However, that means that there isn't much room for it to get harder, so there isn't actually much difference in difficulty between the levels. If anything, it actually gets easier as you go, with the final boss being hard to outright lose against, a stark contrast to the first game's diffculty spikes. This might be intentional, if the story is anything to go by.\n\nMy computer was able to run this game fine. However, some computers can't, and this game apparently can't handle lag of any sort without breaking down. So high-end computers only. Even so, the steam overlay ended up being screwed up for me, but that's just a minor hinderance.\n\nThe big question is: Does this game do enough to distinguish itself from the first one? I'd say that it does.","May 1","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
