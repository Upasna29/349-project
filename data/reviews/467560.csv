You can't even exit the "Survival" mode that just ends with killing all of the enemies and standing around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly. When you hit ESC, it just brings up a gui to buy ammo, health, etc, but it says 200#-300$-400$ and you only earn a coin a match, which doesnt carry over to other matches? The final two levels out of only 10 are practically impossible. I almost want to conclude this a scam!","May 18","false","0.5"," 77 of 81 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","77","81","0","1"

I'm not the same man I was five minutes ago. Sawing your own nose off with a steak knife would be more fun. If you like games like this, get Crimsonland. If you already have Crimsonland then play that again. Bad Rats/10","May 25","false","0.1"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"
