I've been waiting to see Men of Valor (MOV) released on Steam for years.  I even wrote to Valve some years ago  asking for it to be included because it has a surperb multiplayer game.  It's 11 years old now, so some  aspects are a little dated, but the actual maps are  excellent. Thankfully  the  original add-on map pack has been included,   expanding the original maps to 21 multiplayer maps.   Every major battle  from the American involvement in the Vietnam war is represented in these maps.   I do hope we see some  servers coming online soon  as there hasn't been any for a few years now, and then you only got a few players  at any one time, so some of the bigger maps were never included in the map roations.\n\n\n\n\nI actually purchased  15 hard copies of this game less than a month ago as I was planning to  get  friends involved in the game.  There is still one company renting servers for this game and I was thinking  of   renting a small server of perhaps 8 or 12 slots, but I may not need to now (hopefully).  It  used to be possible  to set up your own server via the game, but   I wasn't able to with my hard copies.  I purchased Steam versions   for both of my Steam  accounts, then set up  multiplayer server and WAS able to  join the server from my other account, so it looks like that part of the game has been fixed.   (Yeahhh!)\n\nThe single player  missions are  brilliant.  I remember playing MOV  for the first time  when it was released  back in 2004 and really felt like I was on partol in Vietnam.   The first mission gave me an adrenalin rush as I swept across a field towards  forest,  then  creeping along  a narrow  clearing in the forest, avoiding traps only to be faced by  several enemy dug well in  was  exhilarating.  i'd never experienced  a FPS game quite like it up to this point.\n\nFor those expecting a run and gun like game (COD, MOH etc) you'll be disappointed. You need to play the game as stealthily as you can, otherwise you'll quickly cop a bullet in the head if there are any enemy around.  Respawning is simply  a click of your mouse.  If you are wounded you have to  quickly bandage yourself otherwise you'll bleed out.  You can pick up  health packs and canteens from dead enemies and friendlies, both of which   fill up your  indicator that shows  how near to death you are.  You can also  pick up weapons and ammo from dead  enemy and friendlies as well, so you  rarely run out of ammo.\n\nThe single player  campaign  follows  the multipler missions,  though  in the single player missions you do get to man a heavy  machine gun while flying around in  a Huey,  and steer a boat on a river. There are various mission types   that include  rescuing  downed pilots, freeing prisoners and  various recon patrols;  sadly,  apart from cut scenes, there's no vehicular  traffic  available in any of the missions, unlike the brilliant Battlefield series that was  running concurrently when this was first released (Battlefield Vietnam, another game i've been playing recently).  If I had to choose between the two I would have to pick Battlefield Vietnam  even though I think the graphics  for Men of Valor are better, because BFV had hundreds of custom maps  and loads of mods available, plus  you could  use   tanks, mobile artillery, jeeps,  and  various other vehicles including   choppers and jets.\n\n\nYou do need to play this game with some stealth otherwise you won't get through the game.  A heat shot will kill you instantly, but   other parts of the body are recoverable by bandaging and  health packs.  The longer you leave bandaging, the lower your health becomes.\n\nThe Jungle maps are   brilliant, and still look superb even now 11 years later.  It's not DX11, but   you still get   the atmosphere in most of the multiplayer  and sigle player maps.\n\nWith 40% off the release price, this is a bargain.\n\n\n\nThe only negative I remember about this game was  the  spawn camping/♥♥♥♥♥♥ that occured on some of the servers and  when you died, if you didn't click the respawn button, you could follow your killer around and see where he/she was, then creep up on then to kill them   in retribution for killing you; however, there were some good servers with   decent players  who would  kick  players who  spawn ♥♥♥♥♥ or played in an unfriendly manner.\n\n\nI'll update this review once I've had chance to revisit the game. apart from  a couple of the single player missions, which I played recently, I've not played the game much for several years.\n\ncheck out some of the videos over on You Tube.  Sadly I could only find one multipler match and the quality was appalling, so isn't worth  watching.  there are loads of single player  videos though.  The following   is over 5 hours long and shows many of the  missions available in the single player campaign.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mhpAxlqdQM\n\n\nedit:\n\nI  set up a server this evening and was able to play  with a friend, so  it is definitely possible to set up your own server. There  may be problems playing with friends who liv on different continents.  I seem to remember   if the Ping was over   150   you'd be lagging quite badly.   We did have a few freezes when starting   some  new games, but generally   the game  ran really well.  I'm over the moon  to  see this game  on Steam and hope  to see  loads of  community members playing the game in the not too distant future.  I also hope  to see  increased interest whenever the game    is on sale, so as to extend the life of this game for years to come.    There are much  better looking games out there now, especially with   game engines like Frostbite and Crytek  plus  the number of new releases may dampen the enthusiasm of some, but  for those who like a good game, that's fun to play and has lots of  great maps and the ability to set up your own server without having to rent one I'm sure  this will be a winner.   I'm  looking forward to  seeing some full servers;  most of the maps   are definitely much better when   12   are playing, but you can still have fun on the smaller maps with fewer  players.","February 9","true","48.9"," 61 of 68 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","61","68","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/411330/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","I actually remembered playing this game on the original Xbox back when it came out in late 2004 and as I am writing down this review, I still have my physical copy of the Xbox version right here in front of me. I absolutely love this game as I played the campaign over and over again that I lost count. You may be wondering: What’s so special about this game? Well, I am going to tell you.\n\nMen of Valor is a 2004 PC (and original Xbox) first-person military shooter that takes place in the earlier stages of the Vietnam War (1965-1968). You play as Dean Shepard, an African-American soldier who took part in the conflict alongside with his squadmates: Greaser, Smooth, Zook, Hodges, and all other characters (Oh my goodness, I even remembered those characters from long ago). The game does not have a legitimate plot but what I love about this game is the presentation. Men of Valor provides a great historical perspective and experience, placing the player to know what is like in that conflict. The campaign is divided into four different areas of the war in 1965-1968: Da Nang Outskirts (rooting out the Vietcong from Da Nang, taking part in Operation Starlite), Iron Triangle (eliminate the Vietcong stronghold that resides in northern Saigon and being part of the joint US-ARVN Offensive), Khe Sanh Hill (push the North Vietnamese Army away from U.S hilltops firebases in 1967), and the Tet Offensive (terminate the North Vietnamese positions out of Hue and breaking the Siege of Khe Sanh).\n\nThe game also presents a two minute “documentary” (think of it like the ‘classic’ History Channel documentary) that tells general information about the event you are about to take in. The loading screen provides photographs of the Vietnam War as well as general information about the war, including notable quotes from the leaders in both sides of the conflict. The graphics are a bit dated today, but the gameplay is absolutely breathtaking and highly immersive. The sound effects are amazing, especially with the incoming mortars blasting on the ground or in debris. The voice acting for the Army Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), Vietcong, and NVA are highly authentic, legitimate (actual Vietnamese voice actors not those ‘fake’ ones like in the 80s and early 90s films), and impressive. The aiming animation is not looking down on the iron sight, but rather ‘leaning’ (think of Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield: Vietnam). There is absolutely no health regeneration and if you get shot, you have to hold down the bandage button to stop the bleeding (there are medkits and canteens laying around in the map or from dead enemy soldiers).\n\nThe best part about this game is the soundtrack and music from Inon Zur (the composer who did the first Crysis game, Dragon Age: Origins, Fallout 3 and 4, and other notable music). His music in the game is astonishing, immersive, and majestic. Arguably, his music in Men of Valor was a stepping stone from him to compose music in popular video games that we have today.\n\nThe only negative aspects about the game is that you will get killed. A lot. The game sort of cheats when it comes from the enemy shooting at you from nowhere even when you take complete cover. The second half of the game is a bit punishing since you will get shot at from all directions and you’ll have to move slowly, inch by inch. The resolutions for the game is 4:3 primarily because the game is an oldie, but a classic. Putting on higher resolutions might be problematic but might be solvable.\n\nMen of Valor was a Vietnam War game that was often overlooked by EA Games’ Battlefield: Vietnam, Vietcong game, Shellshock: Nam, and Conflict: Vietnam. However, Men of Valor was also a “testing” game in the gaming industry to see if gamers and developers are willing to tolerate to have a Vietnam War game in the market that was greatly overwhelmed by World War II games (like Medal of Honor and the original Call of Duty – the 2003 version). Nowadays, modern gamers know about Call of Duty: Black Ops (for the Vietnam sections) and Bad Company 2: Vietnam as the well-known video game titles for that conflict. I never regret for having Men of Valor on the original Xbox and enjoying the campaign over and over again. I am very glad that the game is now on Steam and I strongly recommend this game to any person who is interested about the Vietnam War in a historical perspective because this game actually did an impressive job.","March 1","true","36.2"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

I could barely try and scratch the surface back when it was about a year old, but i do remember it.\n\nSome Yay and Nay :\n\nPositive stuff -\n* Vietnam War shooter, yes please and give us seconds. There needs to be more of them.\n*Famous Voice Actors such as Steve Blum and Michael Gough providing good soldier voices.\n* Time accurate Weapon arsenal progresses throughout the war, as you start out in '65 with the 7.62 Nato Raifu M14 and the M1 Thompson which sooner or later will be phased out by the M16A1 (unfortunate in my opinion)\n* Surprising, but accuratly, the game has female NVA inviduals. I have yet seen a Vietnam game than this game have that.\n* While you rarely hear them, you can hear classic 'nam songs such as "Wooly Bully" at certain US controlled areas and vechicles.\n*  Fun if very simple. It's like a blend of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and tiny fragments of Ghost Recon (don't ask)\n* Hard, but fair health System. You get shot, you hold <button> to stop the bleeding and then you need to find/loot for canteens and or Medkits to regain your health. No silly health regen here, private Pyle!\n*First thing you do is throwing an american football with your squad at the base. A fine detail.\n\n\nNeutral:\n* The AI on the US team can sometimes be quite dumb as it can be quite helpful. They will never die (although they can be temporarily buzzed down). They can dissable NVA traps aswell, but you mostly work around them before they can react. Sometimes they can go Colonel James Braddock on their enemies and clear out a whole bunch of them before you can say "Jelly Donut."\n*As expected, munition for the US weaponry are scarse (somtimes found in crates) and you are sometimes forced to loot an NVA invidual's body for a weapon. Luckily you have up to four weapon slots, which grenades also take up.\n*NVA inviduals can sometimes be dumb as balls as they can sometimes be your worst nightmare.\n*Pistols are gained further in the game, unfortunatly. Not a neccesity, but a fine luxury. ( I love the M1911A1)\n\nThe Negative\n* No jump button. You will never be required to jump in this game, but it happened to me that i get stuck between a few rocks or similar situations and i can't get out. No jump function means i have to reload to my previous point.\n* Animations are really strange and or delayed on your teammates. Not a huge thing, but ugly as hell.\n* Overly aggressive AI with slightly overpowered weapons. I played it on Medium and expected a fair fight, i'm stuck on a level where i can't get out of a Rat hole without being mowed down by a machinegun goof.  You are sometimes forced to get extremely close with certain weapons and they can mow you down easily. Therefore i stopped playing because i'm literally stuck.\n*Melee bashes are utterly worthless. I had to bash a guy for fifty (three) bashes. He could land a shot on me between each one too. The SKS however has a bayonet, but i never use it.\n* There are times you will be forced to attack with an MG from a chopper, you won't gain any health during this and the NVA shoots like pros.\n*Some levels have a weird FPS drop. And if you encounter a stuttering fps/lag drop early on, look up the v-sync fix on the discussion list to disable it. Quick and easy.\n*Graphical misses by the developers, such as the Maxim 1910 and the world model for the M60 not having any ammo belt.\n\n\nAnd so forth, i've likely missed a lot of points on all three bases up there but there you have it.\nDo i recommend this game?  Yes, i do.\nKeep in mind that this is a fairly old, fairly cheap made, difficult FPS with glitches and bugs here and there, but if you can look away from that, you'll get a good treat of this Vietnam war gem.\n\nThere needs to be more Vietnam games (especially on steam) and this is a start until Tripwire get their slow butts off Killing Floor II and make Rising Storm II: Vietnam. (Hopefully not on Early Access.)\n9,99€ (Ten bucks?) isn't bad at all and you'll get a good kick out of this. Go for it my friend.\n\nHope you get what you wanted with this review!\nThis review dosn't suck...it blows.\n","March 2","true","3.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","1"

So take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\nPerformance Issues (Just an FYI): Running this game at 1920x1080 in fullscreen mode caused the frame rate to stutter at an uplayable rate.  For reference I am running a GTX 970, a 3.4GHZ i5, and 8GB of ram on Windows 7 64bit.  It feels as if there was no optimizations made for current gen hardware.   I play the game in widowed mode at 1280x1024 and it runs smoothly.  I realize this is not something a lot of people want to do - so if this not acceptable you might want to try something else.\n\nPros: Good atmosphere - jungle sounds/graphics hold up fairly well.  This not Crysis with layers of mods that will make your eyes bleed - but it gets the job done.  It uses an interesting tranisition from briefings to gameplay in which photographs slowly enlarge to become the gameplay screen.  Weapons feel realistic - I have shot old Soviet SKS rifles quite a bit and it sounds very close to the real thing.  Friendly AI is so-so.  Sometimes they will take down enemy soldiers, sometimes they will let them run by unscathed (stuff that was not that uncommon in games of this era).\n\nCons: Checkpoint save system is not forgiving.  Don't expect to re-start from were you died a few moments ago.  In game actions like planting C4 can glitch out at the critical moment as you search for the perfect spot to activate it. Character models are ok - but on the blocky side.  Character animations can be very stiff - like the animator forgot to put in a few animations.  Bleeding system takes a bit to get used to and damage is very high.  If you are used to playing the older rainbow six games where a few bullets kill you will be right at home, especially when the game is set to hard.","February 17","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've heard some good things about this game, but never got to experience it. This game, along with Vietcong, are two games on my list I've wanted to play for quite some time as they deal with a very controversial moment in not only American history, but world history at that. Overall, it feels very satisfying to shoot enemies, move around in the levels, and call in airstrikes. The controls are pretty responsive, the hit detection is pretty narrowed in, which is nice. The levels are nice and lengthy, while also presenting a challenge even on Easy difficulty. The bleedout mechanic is a welcome feature for realism and immersion. Your squadmates are all pretty unique, with interesting quotes and viewpoints. I have had one CTD so far, in the middle of the first mission of the second campaign, "Iron Triangle". So watch out for that. But other than that, the game has run at a smooth framerate consistently and supports higher resolutions as well. It's a solid port, as far as older games go. It's a recommended buy right now, while it's still on sale, and even afterwards, if you feel like spending a whopping 10 dollars on a classic. Good to see the older games making a resurgence. G.I.

It was a great game in its day... but I couldn't even play it in full screen mode. It was Windowed. If I tried to play it in full screen, the screen would go black and I would have to manually reboot (I couldn't even CTRL+ALT+DELETE). By the way, I tried various resolutions on my computer and it was the same result.\n\nSteam seriously needs to put more pressure on these developers to release better quality products. I'll probably get it on GOG or something.\n\nI must say, I did manage to play it in Windowed mode, and then my saved games disappeared. Yeah, that was the last straw. I had to get a refund.\n\nTo sum it up... I would certainly recommend this game if it was glitch free. The gameplay, graphics (by 2004 standards) and sound were all well done. However, I really can't recommend this game in its present state on here.
