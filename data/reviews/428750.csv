I had never played 10tons other game (Crimsonland), sovI admit, I didn't know what to expect from this game. However, once I played it, I was hooked!\n\nNeon Chrome mixes RPG elements, this means youll start out cboosing a class. After that you will be earning and spending currency on buying upgrades and power-ups, you'll be hunting for loot, bashing crates and other objects in order to search for new weapons. You'll also be customizing your character augmentation modifications and leveling up your strengths.\n\nYou move forward in the game via a tower-like system, every level you beat is essentially one floor but you can find elevators which lead to hidden floors if you look carefully enough, these hidden floors unlock new technology and weapons. The game is very solid, and I'm surprised at how simple it is yet there's so much depth underneath it. That's the beauty that is Neon Chrome.\n\nPros Full controller support\nRuns great on lower end pc's\nAlmost everything is destructable\nEach class dramatically changes the way you approach the game\nGreat bosses\nCons Blurry graphics unless half the options are disabled\nCamera may be too far away for some\nNo online multiplayer\nTextures are a bit on the low-res side\nFinal thoughts:\nI highly recommend this to you whether you are a fan of twin-stick shooters or you're just looking for something new. Either way, it offers a fresh new taste to the top-down shooter genre. It's an addictive game with virtually endless replay value.\n\nRating (8.9 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 8","true","4.6"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","9"

We should do something about that.\nNeon Chrome is a cyberpunk, top-down shooter from the developer of Crimsonland, 10tons. In Neon Chrome you play as assets, used by a strange character (who you also play as, sort of) in order to try and take down the mysterious Overseer. The Overseer has full control over Neon Chrome’s human and robotic guards and he’s more than happy to use brutal force to stop anyone in his way. That includes you by the way. As you battle through thirty-one levels, taking place over six levels of the building, you’ll face increasingly difficult enemies and even a few mini-bosses and bosses. It won’t be easy but you’re not exactly in short supply of assets, you’ll get there eventually.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nBefore every run you can move around a level of Neon Chrome which is halfway between an apartment and a human storage complex. I’m not sure how to label the character but they have a strange chair/headset device that they use to control the assets, the assets are who you mainly play as. In this stage of the game you can also buy upgrades (such as improved health or damage) as well as purchase weapons, abilities and cybernetic enhancements that your next asset will use when you use them. In this area you can also track your stats, such as how many assets you’ve used, as well as see what achievements you’ve unlocked and what rewards they have earned you.\n\nThe assets themselves vary a fair bit, the main variation coming from what class they are. There are a few different classes in the game, ranging from Assassin (my personal favourite) to Cyber Psycho, each with their own class-specific ability. The Assassin’s ability, for example, is that they become completely invisible when they are standing or moving around in shadows while the Cyber Psycho has +20% Hit Points and +2 Enhancement slots. Each class also has its own stats, i.e. health, energy (used for the asset’s other ability), speed, damage and critical hit chance. The classes are very different to each other and require slightly to drastically different strategies to be successful with them, adding a nice level of depth to the game.\n\nThe assets also have a weapon, a non-class-specific ability and a name (well duh). The weapon can be any of the weapons you have unlocked (more can be unlocked by finding special box-type things in the levels, which also applies to enhancements and the second kind of abilities.) You can also unlock the same weapon but with a different projectile, for example you can have a regular shotgun as well as an Ion Shotgun or a Plasma Shotgun. The second type of ability is effectively a secondary attack, this could be lock-on missiles or blast grenades, there are quite a few to unlock. These abilities require energy which is collected from loot boxes. Each ability can be used a certain number of times before you run out and need more energy, for example you can use your grenades three times. Enhancements can be equipped from a CyberHance Express station (found on most levels). You have a certain amount of slots for these enhancements (upgradeable) so if you run out of slots you’ll have to choose one to replace with the new enhancement. There’s a wide variety of enhancements available from the basic stuff that increases health or speed to enhancements that cause your bullets to split and cause 30% more damage.\n\nAs I said earlier, Neon Chrome consists of thirty-one levels across six floors. When you reach a new floor (the level after a boss fight) you can then start from that new floor and skip the levels leading up to that. It’s a great way to help you progress through the game though it does mean you miss out on all the loot from the previous floors when starting from that floor which is a problem seeing as there’s a spike in difficulty from one floor to the next. There is of course a difference in difficulty between the levels too but it’s more noticeable when you reach a new floor. For the most part, you just have to reach the green (or purple for a special level) elevator at the end of the level to go to the next one but some levels will have objectives for you to complete first, e.g. destroy five specific targets. The levels are also randomly generated (apart from the boss fight levels) so you’ll never see the same run twice.\n\nAn increase in difficulty doesn’t just mean more enemies though, it means harder enemies and new kinds of enemies. From what I’ve played, enemies don’t get phased out, they just get phased in meaning you’ll be introduced to new enemy types every few levels. You’ll also face off against ‘special’ enemies. These consist of normal enemies with some kind of buff/special ability, for example an enemy marked as SWIFT as a much higher movement speed than a regular enemy. Some levels have a mini-boss, again this is a variation of a regular enemy with a special ability and in this case better stats too and at the end of every floor you come across a full boss. The boss fights are incredibly challenging, it took me several attempts to get through the first one for example. Thankfully (if you’ve collected a lot of loot) you’ll be able to buy new upgrades which will help you next time you take on the boss. Furthermore, once you beat the Overseer you reach a new OS level which significantly increases the difficulty across all levels. As far as I’m aware there’s no limit on OS levels but it does take a lot longer to get through them anyway.\n\nSo, let’s talk about loot. There’s quite a lot of it. Most of what you’ll find are small boxes which, when opened, will net you a couple of hundred bucks and a little bit of energy, you generally find one or two in each room when playing. Then you’ve got slightly bigger boxes in which you’ll find more money and energy as well as (sometimes) health kits and even weapons. Then you’ve got healing stations, unlock boxes (the things I mentioned earlier which contain new abilities, weapons or enhancements), weapon crates and weapon upgrade machines (levels up your gun which improves its stats). Also, enemies drop loot in the form of money and energy, they drop about the same as a small box but special enemies drop more. While energy, weapons etc. only matter for the asset you collect them with, your money and unlocks are persistent.\n\nJust a couple more things to mention. The sound track is absolutely fantastic, it really fits the game well but there didn’t seem to be many tracks so it would’ve been nice to see a few more. The controls are also really good, they felt very responsive and the default configuration works well (though it can be changed). While I’m talking about controls, it’s worth knowing that your asset’s speed has an impact on how quickly they turn, it’s not a case of the controls being unresponsive, this also applies to enemies which can be used to your advantage.\n\nVerdict\nNeon Chrome is a thoroughly enjoyable top-down shooter with a lot of gameplay variation, unlockables and quite a bit of replay value. All of this wrapped up in an awesome cyberpunk setting. If you’re a fan of top-down shooters, I’d definitely recommend checking this one out.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","April 28","true","8.0"," 56 of 79 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","56","79","0","4"

Longpong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dermtz/","1584 products in account","EDIT: Added spoiler tags to the loose description of the bosses.\n\nI'll try and keep it short and to the point. This is an excellent game. It's essential. It's fun. It's addictive and rewarding.\n\nYou have classes with genuine differences. All are fun. The weapons and violence are exceptional. Heads come off, chunks fly. Bullets whizz and lasers feel hot and clinical. It has recoil mechanics and stealth, alert and line of sight mechanics and varying levels of weapon penetration.\n\nDestructible environment. If you see a heavy guard with a riot shield in the next room, they are invulnerable to regular weapon-fire from the front, you blow a hole in the wall behind him and blast him to chunks from the back with a critical sneak attack. You can melee. You can upgrade the melee skill, you can smash through walls like robocop and unleash hell.\n\nThere are excellent bosses with phases. I've put in 22 hours and I have seen 3 of the total 6(?). A spider-tank boss]that walks you down, tearing up the scenery with it's guns blazing. A Centipede/trainbot that patrols spawning increasingly dangerous mobs and mines. A very open helicopter battle complete with radio chatter, guns and lock on super weapons.\n\nIt's procedural and has permadeath. You loot cash and energy from your foes. When you die you are disconnected from your puppet of flesh. You get out of the immersion chair and spend the cash on skills and weapons. When you are ready to go again, you go back to the chair, and awake another "body" from the rows and rows of stasis pods. So there is a lovely and macabre sense of cost, drive and a seemingly morally ambiguous protagonist. I'm responsible for about 79 now empty pods. I keep throwing bodies at The Overseer of the Neon Chrome building and it's security which he controls. Learning the really solid gameplay mechanics and getting stronger though the incremental upgrades in Damage, Health, Energy, Luck, Augment Slots etc etc.\n\nI could talk all day just about the gameplay mechanics and how fun and gripping it is, but it looks great, has brilliant sound design and good music as well. A very polished and well tuned action rogueLITE that rewards skill and thought while staying absolutely action packed and fluid. There's no fat on this game. You start it, you get in the chair, you start with the death-dealing. There's no painful intro/splash screens, no long periods of downtime between deaths.\n\nI love this game. If I had more than two thumbs to give it, I would. I would raise thumbs till none were left.","April 28","true","87.9"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","29","41","2","0"

Essentially, in Neon Chrome, you have a primary and secondary weapon, plus a melee attack. The secondary weapon takes ammo, and all the primary weapon needs is reloading management. The melee attack takes much more skill and planning, but is totally worth getting to know. You play a series of clones (very similiar to Starward Rogue), in an attempt to climb a corporate tower. The voice acting is very good, and the story seems decent.\n\nLike any game of this genre, its all about the meta-game. The clone you are currently driving will collect money for meta-game upgrades such as health, damage, slots, etc. This will help ensure success for future clones.\n\nPros:\n+Controls and gameplay are butter smooth. It is much slower than Starward Rogue, which isn't necessariliy good or bad; just different.\n+Graphics are quite polished, if not a bit dark (I've requested a brightness slider for couch players).\n+Up to 4-player local co-op!!! This is awesome!\n+Very addicting. Each run is very fun and definately calls me back. So far the frustration level has been very minimal.\n+Dozens of quality play hours for anyone that wants to even remotely finish the game, and achievements.\n+Nearly (if not all) of the level is destructable, which really adds another layer to the strategy.\n+Excellent game saving function!\n\nCons:\n-Music is real meh, and feels fairly generic.\n\nNeon Chrome is excellent. If you normally love games in this genre, this is a no brainer.","April 29","true","20.0"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/recommended/428750/","hyperduel","Hyperduel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/","1983 products in account","Futuristic games built upon worlds of dystopian despair, ruled over by malicious men of evil intent have always fascinated me. And it is because they tease a deep-seated fear within us on some primal level, in that such a scenario could plausibly occur at some point in our lives as technology rapidly advances in the wrong hands - with the only hope remaining for humanity resting upon the wits of techno-savvy rebels who desperately seek to undermine & overthrow such a diabolical system of rule.\n\nAnd so it was with great anticipation & delight that I took the opportunity to review this latest offering in the top-down twin-stick shooter genre, Neon Chrome, from the very same developer, 10tons Ltd, who brought us Crimsonland...a very laudable title in its own right. But were they able to capitalize on past experience and improve upon the formula by taking it to the next level with their newest title? My answer to this question is a resounding yes, on all counts, and so let's now further explore why this is actually so.\n\nUpon starting this title up with a grin of anticipation, what immediately struck me was how artistically gorgeous it all was. Aesthetically, the game is spectacularly stylish indeed, exuding richly vibrant neon colors which seamlessly blend into each other very pleasingly...delighting the senses and imbuing a great sense of immersion within these scenes of both illuminated and shadowed areas...itself perhaps a meaningfully subtle metaphor in describing this battle of both light and darkness. Coupled with its atmospheric ambiance, there is a true feeling of depth below you, letting you know in no uncertain terms that you are gradually ascending higher & higher within this frightfully towering colossus for an epic showdown with the evil overlord who rules over all that is - the inscrutable Overseer.\n\nEssentially, your prime objective is to navigate your upgradable & cybernetically enhanced player around each floor with its many walls and maze-like paths, methodically sabotaging their defense systems and obliterating every ruthless minion or sophisticated robot you encounter, of which there are several uniquely different kinds to engage in battle with. The progression system here was rather well executed I thought, because there were numerous clearly defined challenges & goals to be achieved - complete with both bosses & mini-bosses found throughout. I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment after each floor was reduced to rubble and no further enemies were left remaining to mercilessly hunt me down. It was both addicting and exhilarating to reach the next one higher (31 levels spread across 6 large floors incidentally) as I eagerly wondered what would be awaiting me to contend with when I arrived there.\n\nThe gameplay exudes a wonderful cadence, with moments of relative calm and strategizing as you consider your options, interspersed with sudden bursts of absolute mayhem as reinforcements mercilessly swarm you with incendiary explosions dancing all around your feet...inducing incredible adrenalin rushes as you desperately attempt to stave off this onslaught of malicious intent. And make no bones about it, the enemies in this game can be rather aggressive indeed...so planning is absolutely crucial for success here. And therein lies the true beauty of Neon Chrome, you must actually think ahead and plan your movements accordingly as opposed to mindlessly running & gunning around aimlessly. Thus a thoughtful strategy for attack is the key to success here, as opposed to impetuous and impatient tactics being employed, making for a vastly more enriching experience upon its floors of procedurally generated levels.\n\nOn a side-note, I must say that the enemy AI is neither superior nor wholly inadequate in my opinion - instead being found somewhere in between at the decent range. It can be exploited somewhat, but only to a limited degree since they tend to relentlessly hunt you down sooner or later.\n\nAnother positive attribute to be found here was the bountiful number of both powerful weapons & cybernetic abilities (unlockable) as well as diverse character classes (selectable) that could be deployed, each with their own specific strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that every single run-through was a deeply satisfying & uniquely memorable experience. I greatly enjoyed testing out their inherent abilities against my foes, continually dialing in the optimal setup for each challenging situation that I was presented with.\n\nAnd to further expand upon this point, the environment is actually destructible which beneficially helps the game. And so for example, if you are unable to enter an area from the front entrance, then why not blast your way in from the side and make your own pathway forward utilizing brute force. This is yet another definite plus in the gameplay, injecting an additional layer of fun possibilities to the equation.\n\nNow in regard to the background music, it was perfectly matched to the look and feel of the game, and consists of an edgy yet gratifying electronic tune that is endlessly looped...masterfully evoking a brooding tension in the air.\n\nI did however have a very minor gripe with the camera height, in that it seemed to be quite a ways above the action...sometimes making it a bit tricky to discern detail. Of course, it's always a trade-off in that a lower height would reveal less of the gameplay area. Nonetheless, at times it did seem a touch too high up I thought. Ideally, it would be fantastic if it were dynamically adjustable in-game, so as to allow the player to set their own preference at any given moment. But again, this is a relatively minor quibble overall as the current setting is still very much within the limits of what is acceptable.\n\nThankfully, this title has been fully Steamified with both achievements and trading cards included. Furthermore, it is designed for both single-player and local co-op...meaning no online play...which may or may not be an issue depending upon your own personal preference. For me, I simply view it as an intriguing single-player game to journey inside of.\n\nVerdict\nSo alas the burning question remains, is it worth procuring?\n\nWhile Neon Chrome doesn't do anything exceedingly ground-breaking or revolutionary, what it does do it does superbly well, sticking to tried & true gameplay ideas & mechanics wrapped inside a very pretty package...one where the supraliminal exploration of this unnerving dichotomy between freedom versus tyranny inside of a futuristic cyberpunk setting has never been so much fun. And thus I would wholeheartedly recommend it as a very worthy addition to one's library for fans of this genre at its very reasonable new release price, while confidently rating it at a solid 4/5 stars.\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com","May 4","true","4.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The game is set in a sci-fi cyberpunk structure throughout the game which really sets the mood of the game and the enemies also.\n\nGameplayThe game itself starts you off being chased through Neon Chrome, the mighty overseer doesn't trust you anymore and trust is what the society Neo Chrome is built upon. You get caught and you wake up in a Total Recall chair from your latest failed attempt to take down the overseer. But you have many more chances to get this overseer and kill him. The game itself revolves around you trying to kill the overseer, progressing through floors whilst killing enemies along the way and trying not to die as you get through these enemies. But if you die, it's okay because you can just reconnect to another pod and try again through the floors. After getting through 4-6 floors you will come across a boss room, if you are able to kill this boss without dying then you will be able to respawn at that floor with the pods.\n\nThe game follows the general rogue-like elements throughout, with the general arsenal assault rifles, SMGS, shotguns ect. All of these general weapons have their stats from attack damage to range. When you die and get reconnected to another pod, you will have a special randomly selected special active ability that you can use as you shoot through your enemies. One of these special abilities can be shooting a rocket at your enemies doing extensive amounts of damage than normal weapons, you will have to use these abilities in order to survive through the tower.\n\nBut the game really shines through the destructible environment and the amount of strategy that is included throughout the game. With the game having a sort of strategy side to it, you will have to take advantage of the destructible environment in order to shoot enemies from behind which does double damage as long as they don't detect you. Being able to destroy walls and take advantage of the this will make you be able to get through the level with minimal damage taken.\n\nThe enemy AI isn't exactly the smartest, you can kind of manipulate them to your advantage and kill them easier than you are intended to. But, with most of the enemies being fully aggressive they can give you some problems if they start surrounding you and hitting/shooting you. The game can sometimes make the game from slow to really fast paced sending in reinforcements making for some really great gameplay. These reinforcements aren't just some normal guys that come running at you, there is about 15-20 of them shooting at you and throwing grenades all at once making the game fairly difficult at times.\n\nThe game, as it is a roguelike, is suppose to be difficult and ruthless throughout. The smallest mistake in the game can cost you the current run especially when it comes to the boss fights and explosives that will make you lose quickly. The health is scarce throughout, as you will struggle to find health when you need it the most.\n\nThe game does a good job with the currency of the game that you will find as you play through each of the floors. Exploring through the floors will reward you with better weapons ect to make your characters more powerful. With the credits that you earn you will be able to up your stats by buying each of the upgrades, from your health to your attack damage.\n\nThis game seems to feature full controller support or keyboard controls. For me personally I would choose to use a keyboard and mouse, just for the better accuracy when you shoot enemies instead of a controller which doesn't have as much accuracy. The controls doesn't seem to include a invincibility frame such as a dodge roll, this also makes the game feel much better with keyboard and mouse.\n\nWith the graphic side of the game it isn't as impressive as it seems. The cyberpunk theme throughout the game does seem to get a bit boring after playing the game for a hour or so, everything starts to look the same with the same dark and light colour throughout. I think that more variety would really make the graphics look better.\n\nPros+ General weapons\n+ Respawning you will get a different special ability\n+ Destructible environment\n+ Strategy i needed to survive\n+ Aggressive AI makes the game more difficult\n+ Lots of replay ability\n+ Ruthless and difficult gameplay\n+ Controller Support\n+ Steam trading cards and achievements\n\nCons- AI could use some improvement\n- The graphics seem to let the game down a bit\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsSo the final verdict of the game, this game is a exceptional good roguelike cyberpunk game that has a lot of replay value and exploration value of the game. The game is ruthless and unforgiving at times, which just makes the game better all together making you need to be more precious with your shooting. The game seems to fall at it's kinda stupid AI and the same look of the graphics. Overall I would highly recommend this game to rogue-like/lite lovers!\n\nRating: 8.2/10","May 26","true","2.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Steam must be counting all the time the application has been running to come up with the 14h I'm seeing.\n\nEDIT:  play time is now around triple the first review's\n\nPros:\n- Good amount of options in weapons and ability loadouts\n- Good balance overall - even if you get to a point where you're a killing most enemies with 1 shot, there are elements to keep it from becoming a cakewalk\n- Story fits my playstyle --  I don't want to be bored to tears by a novel of backstory.  I came to play a game, not read a book.  This game has exactly the right amount of forced story, imo.  And for me, it doesn't hurt that it's a sci-fi with Shadowrun-style elements.\n- Although similar, it's softened the edges of the grind/hardcore components that Rogue Legacy has, which means I might actually play to completion!\n\nCons:\n- seriously why so blurry?  reminds me of old days CRT monitors going bad, which likely means it's causing eye strain and honestly makes me believe it could be harmful\n**the blurriness can be lessened significantly (but by no means eliminated) by disabling dynamic resolution - at least on some monitors?\n\nEDIT: the blurriness can indeed be removed as the dev kindly replied.  i had tried disabling options 1-by-1.  i should've tried all off and selected one at a time.  it's the combination of disabling "dynamic resolution" and the "post processing filter" that makes the game as crisp as can be.\n\n- i could be wrong but i fought the 2nd boss 4 times so far and have come to the conclusion that the fight is vastly more difficult than 3rd and 4th bosses + just about requires that you have unlocked one of a small number of abilities that are viable for the final evolution\n\nEDIT: i played back through a few times on 1.0 and 2.0 overseer levels (if you haven't yet played the game, overseer levels basically = going back through from level 1 on increasingly higher difficulty) and i no longer notice such a large discrepancy with 2nd boss.  however i will still say that regardless of loadout (which makes a huge difference), starting with greatest difficulty i rank the bosses at 5-2-3-4-1.  not a huge deal, just expected a progression since it is a linear path (unlike, say, megaman games where there was also a discrepancy in boss difficulty but you could go to any world in any order).  still, i don't know what anyone else's opinion is on this matter and this part boils down to an opinion.\n\n- ***MINOR SPOILER ABOUT AN ENHANCEMENT***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n"Nanoedge Chameleon Skin" has a description of "You are undetectable while stationary".  While I have indeed had enemies walk somewhat near me and go right by without noticing, I have also seen enemies that were chasing me (i had turned a corner and stood still / went into stealth before they came around the corner) walk right up to me and attack.  Additionally I have witnessed enemies who couldn't have possibly seen me go into stealth come around a corner and start shooting from afar (not even walking up to me first).  This enhancement appears to be at least somewhat broken or possibly in need of a description revision.","May 1","true","41.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","1"

The gameplay mechanics, weapon variety, and perks make this game very fun to play.  I highly recommend this game to those that enjoy this type of genre and newcomers as well.\n\n\nThe game can be played with KB+M or controller.  As for gameplay there are 28 stages, each stage consists of going from point A to point B, sometimes there will objects that you have to do in order to advance to the next stage.  Throughout the levels you will find money, weapons, perks, and weapon upgrade stations.\n\nThe environment is semi-destructible, you can shoot or smash walls down to create new entry ways.  I should note that this is limited, but the feature is there and works very well.\n\nAfter you die and you have the option to purchase upgrades that will remain permanent throughout your entire gameplay.  Also the game has save points, if you exit mid-stage, upon starting the game again you start at the beginning of the stage.  If you beat a boss, this will unlock a new starting point so if you die at any stage after the boss, you won't have to start from the very beginning again, you continue right after the boss.\n\nI don't have any major gripes.  I will say that not having the ability to dodge is kind of a bummer, but does not ruin the overall experience.\n\nAs for hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth and much more.  I've played a variety of roguelites/likes and none of them really gives me that strong "just one more run..." feeling like this game does.  This is due to the very awesome gameplay this game offers.  I can die in-game all day long and I wouldn't care because the game is really fun.\n\nI hope this review was helpful to you. .","April 29","true","9.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

McDunnough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calipanhead/","613 products in account","This game was MADE for me!\n\nI enjoyed "Crimsonland", but quite frankly I found it somewhat monotonous and subsequently did not play very much of it.  One of my favorite games on steam that is quite underrated is "ShadowGrounds".  In reading the reviews I am surprised nobody mentioned this.  "Neon Chrome" feels like a much more polished "ShadowGrounds" only with INFINITE levels!  I am so stoked to rack up some hours in this game.  I am a big fan of the 80's aesthetic and this game absolutely NAILS it.  The visuals have this cyberpunk vibe to them and the world outside the walls looks like it was ripped straight out of "BladeRunner", in a GOOD way!  The soundtrack is also wonderfully 80's and fits perfectly.  I really enjoy roguelikes, but one thing that irks me is the lack of feeling like you progressed.  "Neon Chrome" negates this by letting you collect loot to spend as permenant upgrades to your runs.  Along with this in your runs you can unlock new weapons to find permanently and a "Nuclear Throne" style temporary run upgrade system as well.  The levels are unique and randomly generated.  Every five levels there is a shortcut added too after you beat the challenging boss, if you are into that.  This game OOOZES polish, I bought this purely on a whim and I will be telling everyone I know about it.  I hope this game gets alot more attention, you can tell this is a labor of love and these devs DESERVE some buzz!","April 30","true","7.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I curtsey to Crimsonland. Thank you.\n\n\nDo you enjoy Top-Down shooters? This is the game for you. Allow me to explain why.\n\nGraphics::::::Set in a futuristic Neon Cyberpunk and Blade-Runner-esq world, Neon Chrome is a pleasure to play. This game offers beautiful colors, particles, glow (not overdone) and polish.\n\nSoundtrack::::::Cyberpunk and almost 80's-esq, my hats off to the composer/producer - you nailed it. I found myself zoning out to the beats and tunnel-visioned while my ears were serenaded.\n\nGameplay:::::In this game you can upgrade your stats such as Damage, Health, Luck, Energy(for special abilities), and more. Currency is the name of the game in this Neural-Tech slautghter fest. Need money? Get yourself a hacker and start back from Level 1 all the way up the ladder, unlocking hack-boxes for better loot and increased money. Take alternate paths for hundreds of secrets levels, challanges and puzzles to solve (if you choose and if you dare).\n\nPrefer stealthy gameplay? Use the nanofiber loadout and be undetectable while sniping with a penetrating railrun from the corners and shadows. The AI or Overseer will detect your preference for stealth gameplay and not flood the level with mobs but place them rather strategically, perhaps even throw down some mines to challange you.\n\n\nLevel Design::::::The levels are well thought out, balanced, and offer unique challanges each time you play through with random rooms, loot, and the occasional obsticals. "Hmm, do I shoot that explosive canister and blow up all the enemies in the room? Or be more cautious, pick them off, and take in the loot." It's up to you with the beautiful level designs; part pre-made and parts random. The levels increase in difficulty and design as you climb the ladder through each chapter (adding more obsticals, more enemies, or less enemies but stronger ones). All in all, the AI for generating these levels is top-notch.\n\n\nConclusion:::::Overall I can't recommend this game enough. Besides the listed genre(s) of 'Indie' 'Cyberpunk' 'Twin Stick Shooter' and 'Action', this game also has fairly substantial RPG elements as well. The RPG is not hardcore and thus I understand not listing it as an RPG; afterall, it is a top-down slaughter fest. However with the way the upgrades, unlocks, and replayability go - I would also list this game as RPG-lite. 10/10.\n\nPurchase this game, support these devs and spread the word about NEON CHROME!\n\nYou will enjoy this, soldier.","April 29","true","17.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/428750/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Neon Chrome is a frantic cyberpunk twin-stick shooter from the developers who made Crimsonland.\n\nIn Neon Chrome, you play an unknown hacker who, through the use of a neural interface immersion chair, is able to hack into countless cryogenically frozen cybernetic bodies and control them in your battle against the Overseer, the megalomaniacal ruler of a futuristic megacity arcology called Neon Chrome.\n\nEach of your available bodies is one of a small number of roles -- assassin, hacker, psycho, etc. -- each with its own special ability. For example, the hacker bodies have drone followers and can hack into strongboxes and other in-game objects, whereas the assassin bodies have cyberwear that lets them hide in the shadows.\n\nAfter picking a body (an 'asset') and waking it up, control switches directly to that body, and you enter the lift on your way up the 30 levels to the top of the arcology, where you will do deadly battle with the Overseer.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - When I first loaded up Neon Chrome I thought, "Oh yes... ." The title screen is fantastic!\n\nThen when I entered the game, at first I thought the graphics looked a bit blurry, but I think I just didn't like the film-grain effect. After turning that off in the settings menu, everything looked much sharper, and more to my liking. Either way, though, the graphics are fantastic.\n\nEverything is just spot on. From the subtle purple neon glow of the pause menu boundaries, to the animated screens that litter the various early levels of the game, to the great explosions and small, but detailed, enemies. It all looks good, moves well, and really sucks you into the story.\n\nOther than the aforementioned film grain, there are also settings for bloom, anti-aliasing, and more, as well as the standard resolution settings. I played on my old gaming laptop (Nvidia 485m graphics card) in full HD with everything except for film grain turned on, and it didn't skip a beat.\n\nI just wish I could zoom in closer to the action on occasion, and zoom out for an overhead or map view.\n\n\nSound - As with the graphics, the title screen music grabbed me from the start, and didn't let go even once while I was playing. Throughout everything there's an electronic vibe, but it ranges between a hard and heavy sort of industrial feel with thumping beats, almost to elevator musak in some places. It's very well done, enhancing the atmosphere created by the story and graphics.\n\nSound effects are good, too, with appropriate bleeps and bloops, great gun and explosion sounds, and occasional grunts and groans when your current asset or one of its many human enemies is hurt.\n\nThe overseer's voice in the introductory section seemed overdone to me, for about the first 10 seconds, but it grew on me quickly. Occasional voices while you're playing the game (e.g. when you get a new implant) are very well done, and once again add to the great atmosphere.\n\n\nGameplay - As with the graphics and sound, I was blown away by the introduction. I started the game and thought, "WTF is going on!?", but within a few seconds it all started to come together and, then I died. Then the overseer's voice threatened to find me -- the real me -- and this was displayed on the screen:\n\nDISCONNECTED - NEURAL LINK LOST\n\n...\n\nSeconds Alive: 184 (best ever!)\n\nI was grinning from ear to ear!\n\nThe basic game plays like any other twin-stick shooter: WASD (or left controller stick) moves you around, while mouse (or right controller stick) aims your weapon. Neon Chrome gives you two weapons to use at any one time, an infinite-ammo primary weapon, and a secondary weapon that you need to refill with energy that you collect, as well as a simple melee attack, for when enemies get too close.\n\nRogue-like elements have been perfectly blended with the basic gameplay, leading to procedurally generated levels that are different with each asset you control, random loot of varying rarity and power levels, and random enemies (within reason) on normal levels. There are also a number of 'special levels' randomly spread around with each play through.\n\nAnd then there are all of the cool enhancements available to you. After each run and before your Unknown Hacker chooses another asset to send to its death, you can spend credits collected from previous runs on stat increases (permanent), or temporary purchases of abilities, cyberwear, and weapons, which will be given to your next asset. As the Unknown Hacker's hideout, the 'home room' really enhances the atmosphere, too.\n\nWhile playing an asset, he or she can gain various upgrades and weapons, too, as well as temporary effects like penetrating shots or a vampiric field around you that sucks the life out of anything that walks into it and transfers health to you.\n\nThe game has a local co-op multiplayer mode as well, which I can only imagine must be amazingly cool, but I haven't had a chance to try it. There's no online multiplayer, unfortunately.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Fantastic graphics throughout. I still catch my breath when I see that title screen\n+ Excellent sound\n+ Great atmosphere\n+ Lots of explosions; most objects can be destroyed\n+ Very replayable\n+ Full controller support\n+ Achievements and trading cards as well\n+ I haven't found a spelling or grammatical error yet\n\nCons:\n- No zoom in for close up of the action or zoom out for overview, or map of the current level\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Neon Chrome is one of the most polished indie games I've ever played. It drips cyberpunk atmosphere and continues to impress me over and over again. It is a fantastic game.\n\nI told myself I wasn't going to give half marks, but I think with Neon Chrome I have to: it's not quite a 10, but it's definitely better than a 9!\n\n9.5/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","April 28","true","36.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

There is definitely a certain amount of grinding, but to me it feels rewarding. I don't get a whole lot of time to commit to one game at one sitting, so this is a nice mix with instant gratification. No game is for everyone, but I love the music and graphical design on Neon Chrome. The engine is perfect, and while I have a top of the line gaming rig, this also runs just fine my older gaming laptop and a $150 mini PC I purchased for media on my TV. It's very well designed, and I am guessing they'll just keep making it better. You will die. You will die a lot. It's the way the game is designed so well, that you won't be frustrated by it (at least I wasn't).

The gunplay feels great, and the progression system is rewarding so far.\nThe different "classes" are different enough to feel unique, but still balanced enough to where I can't pick a favorite, and none stand out as the "best" at everything.\nI'm a big fan of the setting and little bit of story that I have encountered so far. The cyber-punk asthetic is pretty cool, and the fact that the game uses polygons and not pixel art is refreshing (I can't believe I have to say that).\nThe music is FANTASTIC. It fits the theme perfectly.\n\nAfter five hours straight of playing the game, my only real complaint is that there is no rumble support if using a controller.\n\nI saw that the game was made by the makers of Crimsonland, a game that I was obsessed with over a decade ago.

Since the very beginning of a game, players are greeted by an awesome soundtrack that will introduce you to the pace of the game. At first, the gameplay might look a bit chaotic and maybe even overwhelming, but once you'll get used to it, oh boy - the only thing you'll want to do is spread even more chaos! Or who knows, maybe you'll decide for a more sneakier path? It's all up to you!\n\nAdvantages\nExcellent local co-op (max 4 players)\nFenomenal and atmospheric soundtrack (I instantly fell in love with it, listen to Monopoly on Violence, it's just splendid <3)\nDifficult is hard enough to be entertained but not too hard to be raging at\nControls are simple and perfect. Also, a great controller support (tested on XBOX 360 controller)\nStory is told "on side" as you're going through the game, no need to sit through long cutscenes / dialogues\nHuge variety of pre-made classes, upgrades, weapons and abilities to choose from\nLevel design is awesome, mostly destructible surroundings and randomly generated levels gives the game quite a nice replay value\nClever system that requires you to actually die to upgrade yourself and even progress the game\nGraphics are very nice looking and, surprisingly, quite neon. Cyberpunkish graphics rules!\nConstantly updated\nDisadvantages\nGraphics were somehow "bugged", I needed to level them down slightly due to blurriness\nHopefully devs will add multiplayer at one point\nSummary\nThis game is literally excellent and perfect. I might have not played a lot of it yet (I'm a busy man, alright?) but I can't wait for the next time to get in and play it. It's also highly addictive, so far, I can't find any serious cons. Literally perfect. The replay value is great thanks to randomly generated levels and all those abilities and unlockables. Surroundings are nearly 100% destructible, so the only thing that stands in your way to burst through the wall into a room full of enemies is a wall that you'll need to take down! A.I. is not stupid, so don't worry, it's not one of those slashers where enemies just run at you, doing nothing. Story seems pretty good once you'll listen to it, hopefully I'll get to its end one day. One thing that surprised me is the diversity of all add-ons like combinations of weapons and abilities, unique abilities to specific characters and tons of upgrades you get going along the game - believe me, you'll have tons of fun looking for the best combination that fits your playstyle. One thing that would be nice is multiplayer, co-op or versus, it would be fun either way.\nTL;DR Do I recommend it? Hell yeah, just get it and play, you won't regret it!\n\nPersonal score\n9.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","May 19","true","5.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

To my elated surprise, it's actually pretty fun and addicting.\n\nThe cyber punk atmosphere actually succeeds at bring somewhat cyberpunky (a word? now it is). Not very many games a have succeeded in that, so hats off to them for that. It even keeps to the generally grey morality of many cyber punk games by having you play as a person who seems to  hack into peoples brains in cryo sleep and use them as weapons until their utter demise .\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. There are a few classes that can be chosen from at the beginning of a run and, with money from previous runs, you can get premanent upgrades or purchase equipment for your next run. The combat is fun and there is a decent variety among the enemies.\n\nThe best part about the gameplay is the permanent pregression. (I personally think that) A rouge-like needs to have some form of permanent progression between runs, and Neon Chrome gets it down pat. The upgrades that you can purchase between runs is important, but everytime you beat a boss you will also be able to start from just after that battle. This negates the slough that so many rouge-likes have of fighting through earlier, weaker levels and repetative bosses.\n\nNeon Chrome feels like a nostalgia trip to old, top down arcade shooters. It retains the greatness of a bygone era while still using some key features of modern indie gaming. If you like top down shooters or rouge-likes, this is a game to consider.","May 4","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now, no one element is going to blow you away here, but this is a package deal: as the combination of all the gameplay elements makes for a “one more run” experience. Strategy actually plays a big part in the game: as being able to bust through walls and flank for double damage is key in not taking damage, and using the environment's explosives will do a lot to take down big groups of enemies....and maybe destroy some upgrades in the process. While the game isn't taking any awards home visually, it focuses on the action and is able to deliver with steady controls, and a reasonable difficulty. Now look, it doesn't have the unique pull of games like Binding of Isaac: Rebirth or the production value of Enter The Gungeon, but what it brings is a fun experience that you can play repeatedly, and something that I'll want to continue playing (well, at least if I wasn't reviewing so many other games as well.....).\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nDestructible Environments have a direct effect on strategy and gameplay, and aren't there just for show. Flanking is vastly important, and really adds a whole another layer to gameplay.\nSurprising, but the lack of a burst movement option actually feels like a breathe of fresh air for the genre. A focusing on aiming and accuracy and base movement is a nice change up from the dodge mechanics I'm seeing in a lot of games lately.\nReinforcements actually mean something in this game. It's not just 2/3 enemies, you get an entire army after you. Have fun with running for your life!\nGood weapon system, in particular with the finding of weapons in the environment. Like the fact that you always seem to be improving, and not finding garbage weapons.\nProgression system makes you want to reach further and further into the game. You're always getting stronger, which in the context of the game, actually makes a lot of sense.\nReplayability is high, even if there's repetitive elements. Game keeps pressure on you with different events, and content is dropped as a reasonable rate to keep things fresh.\nBasic structure of the story adds a good backdrop to the gameplay. It's not the star, but it complements what's here.\nNegatives:\nVisually not impressive. There's some blur effects that don't do the game justice, but the pulled back perspective may be a bit too far back. Hard to get some detail.\nNeeds more visual variance for some of the levels, as it can get old to look at the same elements at times.\nCertain abilities/bosses need some balance, in particular with the rechargable shields.","April 28","true","5.7"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","12","26","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianGuitar/recommended/428750/","CanadianGuitar","Canadian Guitar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianGuitar/","308 products in account","Neon Chrome is a top-down twin stick shooter with rouge-like elements set in a a cyberpunk future full of bright colours, from the 10tons Ltd, the delevopers behind the cult classic Crimsonland. There are a lot of influences from their previous title here, but they also were not afraid to branch out a bit, and make something new, without having a cookie cutter game too similar to their last.\n\n\nThe game's controls are pretty standard for that of a twin stick shooter. Whilst looking at your character from a top down view, one hand (or stick) controls movement, and the other controls aiming and shooting. Unlike a few twin stick shooters I have played, there is also a melee button, and more unlike other twin stick games, the melee is actually quite useful and powerful. The game can be played with a Mouse and Keyboard setup, or with a controller (although I haven't tried it with a controller yet), and with other controllers, can be played by up to four people in a Local Co-op setting.\n\nIn the game, you are playing a hacker, who is using "assets", basically blank slate people/bots to assault the Neon Chrome facility. The facility is run by the Overseer, who is evil for some such reason and has a bit of dialouge at the beginning, and a few levels here and there. I'm sure once you progress more, his character gets flushed out a bit more, but I've only got a bit over two hours in it, and haven't progressed that far yet. These assets are what you play as, and use to assault the facility; every time you die you are taken back to a small room where you (the hacker), have a few terminals available to you where you can upgrade your character(s), look at what you've unlocked (weapons, cybernetics,etc) and choose your next assest to play with. There are a few different classes of assets, but three will be randomly available to you each time you spawn. Classes include a Techie, who has a rechargable shield and more energy than the others, but less overall health, an Assassain who in the shadows is harder for enemies to spot and detect and several more. Each class will also have a different weapon and ability each time, so sometimes it's best to pick a class for a weapon you like, rather than a specific skill set. As you progress though the game, you will be collecting money from dead enemies, or from looting various items you come across. This money can be spent at some of the other terminals to upgrade your assets after your death, but before you pick a new asset to use. The upgrades are Health, Damage, Luck (increases cash you pick up and rarity of loot), Energy (used for your abilities; shockwave, missles,etc) and Slots (which determines how many cybernetic upgrades you can carry [explained later]).\n\nOnce you've picked an asset, you will then be able to pick which floor you start on, 1 through 6, but you can only start at floors 2 and higher once you have reached them at least once. Between each set of floors are different levels, all randomly generated, between floors 1 and 2 are three levels, 2 and 3 are five, and more are added between higher level floors for a total of 31 levels. There are bosses that seperate each floor as well, and can be quite difficult. You will spend some time dying and "buying" your way to better stats to take them on easier. You will spawn in an elevator in each level, and be looking for a green one to proceed to the next. Through each level, there will be various enemies and traps (laser fields, mines and the like), as well as boxes to loot for money, and crates with weapons and/or cybernetic upgrades and each time will be different, as the levels are randomly generated. The cybernetic upgrades are essentially perks, and are found in small capsules you walk in that are randomly placed in the levels. Once you activate it, you have a choice from three random ones that you get to keep for the duration of this assest's life. The perks include things like faster rate of fire and more damage, more melee damage, move faster and many many more. There are 50 perks altogether, but most of them must be found in other crates while you progress, and some perks can only be found on certain floors (so you can't get amazing end tier perks just by playing the first levels over and over). After buying the upgraded slots for your asset you can have a maximum of 10, so you must pick wisely. There are also crates with different weapons to be found, and some crates that upgrade the loot level of weapons you will find (including the weapon you currently have), giving them more damage. On some levels, there are alternate purple elevators (which you will see an alternate path between levels 5-6 for example, on the loading screen) which will take you to a sort of bonus level, each has it's own sort of theme for a puzzle, and will you often be rewarded with a box containing a new perk to them go into your random pool for when you upgrade yourself.\n\nAs far as variety goes, there seems to be quite a bit. There are 50 cybernetic upgrades, 16 abilities and 26 weapons that you can unlock and there are different sets to be aquired on different floors. There are lots of different enemies and traps/defense systems you will encounter, and of the two bosses I've faced so far, each was very different and had a unique method to sucessfully killing.\n\nThe graphics won't blow you away, but the atmosphere and colours will. The game is called Neon Chrome, and for good reason, there are plenty of bright and flashing colours making the levels very vibrant and appealing. The game has pretty low system requirements so I can't really see anyone having any issues running this on max, and in my time I haven't had any frame issues or stutter at all. The game simply runs smooth, and lets you sit down and shoot stuff without worrying about how well it will run. The sound effects are also good, and the music is what you'd expect looking at a game like this - a very 80's style electronic and futuristic music.\n\n\nPros\nExtremely fun and easy to pick up\nVery bright and colourful level designs\nRouge-like elements and lots to unlock will keep you coming back\nGreat variety in weapons and abilities/perks as well as enemies\nFour player local co-op\nLots of destructible envrionments and objects\nCons\nOnly one game mode (Crimsonland had various types of surivial modes in addition to the main quest)\nLocal Co-op, would have loved if this had some online co-op, even if it was only for two people\nPerhaps a bit pricey for most considering the genre (16.99 CDN when full price)\nAll in all, so far I love it. I put a ton of hours in their previous game both on steam, and long before that and I can see this gane will be the same way. I love the colourful art style, the music and all the variety in weapons and enemies. Although I wish it were a few dollars cheaper, I know I'll more than get my money's worth out of this game and will surely have double digit hours in this before tomorrow.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilspiritsrdeath/recommended/428750/","evilspiritsrdeath","deathswagga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilspiritsrdeath/","400 products in account","Neon Chrome is a cyberpunk top-down shooter from the same company that brought us Crimsonland.\n\nGunplay: The gunplay is quite similar to Crimsonland, and is very polished. You'll have a huge array of weapons ranging from pistols to miniguns, and laser shotguns to plazma burts rifles. There is no shortage of weapons here, and they are all unique and fit different play styles. Similar to Crimsonland, is the fact that all guns have unlimited ammo. Personally, I love that. This game in punishing enough it's a relief to not have to worry about running out of ammo. The gunplay overral is great.\n\nGraphical quality: The graphics in the game are gorgeous. They really have that neon/cyberpunk feel and it's just beautiful to look at. The animations are butter smooth, and I have never had any framedrops or lag issues, even in heavy combat situations. The game is very well optimized and has a fair amount of graphical options. The graphical quality overral is awesome.\n\nSoundtrack and sound effects: Neon Chrome's phenomenal music is one of the best part about this game, it's breathtaking! The music is epic, very cyberpunky and I really hope the game get's an OST DLC. The sound in this game is quite good too. Every gun sounds different, and all the impact sounds and explosions sounds great too. The audio quality overall is incredible.\n\nGameplay elements: The gameplay in this game is extremely good. The environment is nearly fully destructible which makes for some very tense boss fights. That first boss was insane, you had nowhere to hide because all the cover would end up getting destroyed. I would have to say this game has some of the most adrenaline-pumping boss battles I've ever encountered. The gameplaye-style has some great rouge-like elements that are quite similar The Binding of Isaac. You get to choose from 3 randomized characters at the beginning, and it's fun to be able to play with different characters that have different unique attributes. The levels are quite spectacular, no level is the same, they are all randomly generated (exept that story levels) and flow really nicely. I've died so many tiems yet it never feels like you play the same level again. This gives that game a lot of replayability and a reason to keep playing. The game also has checkpoints so you don't have to start from the beginning each time. There is also permanent upgrades which you can buy with in-game earnt money that give you a small boost. You will also be collecting a lot of perks, which are similar to that of Crimsonland, and they really add to the randomness as well. The game get's really hard but you never feel that it is unfairly punishing. You will always be getting better, becoming more skilled, getting more upgrades, unlocking more weapons and perks, you're always making progress, so death never feels like much of a penalty. The A.I. in this game is reactive and never bugs out, which is great. The game allows you to be stealthy as well. The gameplay overall is satisfying and very fun.\n\nStory and features: The story of the game is that you're trying to stop an evil "Overseer." I didn't really pay much attention to it, but at least the story is there, unlike Crimsonland. As you can tell from the trailers and pictures, the game takes part on a giant megastructure in some sort of futuristic city. The setting is really nice and the music, gameplay and graphics all come together nicely. One nice feature I would like to note is like Crimsonland, blood and corpses are permanent. This gives this game a great aftermath and really makes a difference. The story overall is interesting and intriguing, nothing too special, but definitely great for a top-down shooter.\n\nVerdict: In conclusion, if you enjoy roguelikes, top-down shooters, a fun and challenging co-op experience, or even like cyberpunk in general, definitely try this game out. I have never played a top-down shooter that was as polished, well made and fun to play as this. The game is so addicting, and luckily there's abosultey no microtransactions which is a plus. I can not think of anything to fault this game for, it's just pure goodness.\nTL;DR: Overall, this is probably the very best top-down twin-stick shooter game I have played. Incredible music, balanced and fair game-play, awesome bosses, a dynamic destructible environment that makes fights more intense, gorgeous graphics, and I love the rogue-like elements and replayablity.\nI give this game 2 thumbs up.","April 29","true","14.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Shooting mechanics are of course excellent considering these are the same devs that brought us Crimsonland.   Neon Chrome is the far better game though with more immersive gameplay and actual strategy surrounding the destructible environments and how you will use them to your advantage.  On the first Boss fight I found myself hiding behind walls and structures to escape death only to have my cover eventually crumble down around me. That feeling alone makes you feel like your playing a much more intelligent game than just your average robotron romp.  The rogue aspects come into play in two different forms.  1st the spending of previously collected cash to upgrade your clone operatives permamently in areas regarding health, power, luck, etc. and 2nd using cash to equip your next battle ready clone with temporary upgraded weapons and tech if you so desire.  This provides interesting choices on how you wish to spend your cash.  The difficulty is ruthless as well...just the way I like it .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiny_Pirate/recommended/428750/","Tiny_Pirate","TinyPirate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiny_Pirate/","148 products in account","This game is superb. I have to admit I wasn't sure I would like it because I'm not usually into twin-stick shooters and this kind of high-speed action, but the game is so responsive to the player, the gameplay evolves in so many interesting ways, and the music and graphical style so engaging I got hooked very quickly.\n\nThe central conceit is that you control a series of agents that are heading out into some corporate mega-tower to fight their way to the top past armies of robots, guards, turrets and traps. As with all games of this style you need to have quick reactions and death isn't something you can save-scum to get past. So far, so normal. But what Neon Chrome does that's particularly fun is randomize the levels, loot and skills while death is annoying, it isn't a total setback. Cash and unlocks you have earned before death can be used by your main character to enhance the next agent sent out into the field. This means that even a bad run can be wortwhile as death sends you back to do more upgrading and purchases and to select a new agent, perhaps with the opportunity to try a new strategy.\n\nThis cycle of play-die-enhance-play more is really quite engaging and even though I'm kinda bad at these kind of games I always felt like I was making progress and achieving something. I highly recommend Neon Chrome and if you'd like to see it in action, check out the videos I put together showing it off below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsXQw5nF32Q&list=PLCymfyavV-yM9ZbAuu_rjlui3jNU_1KFx","April 29","true","4.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It starts off Contra hard, but once you get built up enough it levels off into a good challenge.\n\nGraphically, it's beautiful.

You can play it as a twin-stick shooter on controller, but the aiming on my XB1 controller was super sensitive.

I put over 30 hours into it during the beta test and I still can't get enough. In my opinion, 10tons (the guys who created the amazing crimsonland) have made a masterpiece of a true "game" in the purest sense.\n\nNeon Chrome combines the great gunplay from crimsonland with a good dosis of rogue like randomness and a gameplay that starts on the surface but becomes very deep the further you get into it.\n\nI have beaten the game once and I am on my second run through, which is very challenging and as much fun as the first time.\n\nThis is due to some key elements, that make the game as great as it is:\n\nAtmosphere: The cyberpunk setting of the game is fitting and provides a good atmospheric basement for the experience. Any time you wasted another cyborg clone you feel like the bad guy in "The prestige" having just killed another version of yourself from the vast amount of alter egos in cybernetic sleep tanks. The theme is very well executed and the game has a vibe of bladerunner and hard reset, which I find extremely appealing. The fact that you have to fight your way to the highest floor of a futuristic megatower adds a feeling of constant challenge and evokes that "just one more run" urge in a big way.\n\nGunplay: Like crimsonland, the guns are a lot of fun to shoot. Different firearms perform differently and vary in impact and damage. Certain guns require a specific playstyle. It is great fun to sneak around a level as an assassin, becoming invisible in the shadows and sniping away enemies with the railgun. It is also fun to storm through the floors of the tower, making a bloody mess of enemies with a laserburstrifle and melee strikes with your cybernetic arm as the cyberpsycho. There are several character classes to choose from, everyone with a different random loadout, that you might also finetune if you have the cash to do so. This makes for an almost endless variety in playable characters, as you find more enhancements and weapons through the level, your litte alter ego gets more and more powerful and more and more specialized in dealing with the many enemies the overseer throws in your path. If you die, it's over. Permadeath is a bummer, but also the reason for you to cheerish every run on its own as a achievement.\n\nLeveldesign: The levels are randomly generated. They differ in appearance and style from floor to floor. 10tons did a great job of assuring a huge amount of variation in the levels and giving every floor of the tower its own theme. While you will certainly recognize some room patterns every now and then, the levelsign in itself works great and I never had the feeling of repetition during my 30 hours of beta play. Another exciting feature is the fact, that the levels are almost completely destructible. Guns can shoot through many walls and often provide you with a tactical advantage, be it hitting someone in the back by destryoing the wall he is hidden behind or simply blast entire levelsections to pieces with a grenade or by hitting an explosive device.\n\nAI: After I knew what was going on in neon chrome i was expecting the kind of mindless enemy behaviour I knew from similar looking games like alien shooter or Alien Breed. But instead of bad guys running at me in a straight line, I experienced quite a diversitude of KI routines. Some guards might charge at you directly, others will try to get you from another angle. Enemies will run around mines that you have placed on the floor and clump together to overhelm you. Every now and then patrols will appear and searchteams will enter the level to snuff you out. I find the enemies in the game extremely challenging especially in the later levels when heavy armoured guys will join forces with commander cyborgs that are quite hard to overcome and require some planning.\n\nSometimes I had an almost hotline miami approach on the rooms, on other occasions it feels more like isaac, but it is always challenging and every error will be punished.\n\nUpgrades: The game features an upgrade system similar to hard reset, where you occasionally find upgrade stations that allow you to choose from a selection of body implants to be inserted in your cyborg body. Like the perks in crimsonland, these upgrades and finding the right combination of them, is key to beating the game. In combination with the different loadouts and the chosen characterclass, you will have a great deal of customization. As you progress towards the top of the tower you will unlock more and more upgrades for you to choose from. The feeling of constant progression is one of the many joys of the game...\n\nI could go on and on about how much I enjoy neon chrome, but I will end this little overview with the remark, that this game feels like a REAL "game". I is a little oldschool, but highly polished and with so much depth and replay value, that I almost thought I would never see this kind of game again. Neon chrome reminds me of a time, when a game was simply a game: easy to understand, hard to master and with enough to offer to start it again and again until it had revealed all of its secrets. I still play it every other day and have more fun than with any of the "big budget triple something" titels in recent years.\n\nI applaud 10tons for bringing out a title like this and hope, that it will pay off for them.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough....\n\n\nPS: and the soundtrack is also great:)","April 29","true","41.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

You start Neon Chrome with a cut scene setting up the plot and your base objective. Overthrow the evil overlord with completely reasonable actions like shooting everything and everyone in sight and breaking through any wall that stands in your way.\n\nNeon Chrome is a lot more complex than it looks. At first it looks like a basic top down shooter with fun enemies to shoot and completely destructible environment but its exactly that along with a fun leveling system, merciless death system, a class system, and situations that’ll smother you with enemies.\nThe class system in Neon Chrome gives you the ability to play how you want to play, giving you options to play like an assassin sneaking in the shadows, a brute destroying everything in your path, a techie with the help of a robot partner, and many other classes you can think of. Each class giving you a new experience in gameplay and mechanics and even being able to switch it up as time goes with the quick upgrading system you can find around the map to either help boost your defense or build your destructiveness.\n\nAs well as the upgrading system within every level there is also a main leveling system to boost your max damage, max health, power meter, luck, and other properties; the only catch is you have to die first to level your character. Might even being the most complex top-down shooter I’ve played, Neon Chrome is also merciless and hard. Not only does it smother you with enemies at your lowest points but once you die you have to start everything over (Except your main leveling system) along with all your solider you’ve upgraded. The only way to get a check point is beating a boss and moving to the next floor even though I’ve never been able to even beat the first boss…\n\nThe destructible environments are top notch with just about everything beings destroy-able. A room that has multiple walls and crates can be shot down to a room full of ruble and bodies with the help of some well places explosives, lots and lots of well places explosives. Even with the added bonus of destructible environments, the levels themselves change every time you die! No level is the same the second time around and each one is as challenging, if not more challenging, than the last! Not only is it fun to play, Neon Chrome also comes with an amazing soundtrack that brings the whole game together. Very energetic and gets you pumped seconds before getting slaughter! It’s hard to not notice the music while playing, nothing annoying and frantic.\n\nOverall, Neon Chrome is an amazing game with a shine to it that screams endless fun. I absolutely loved the game and I’m not even a fan of top-down games (Excluding Hotline Miami). Neon Chrome came out of nowhere but I will definitely be playing more of it and it’ll eventually have mod support, level editor, and more! But meanwhile I wait for that I’ll probably be trying to at least beat the first boss.. I give Neon Chrome 9.0/10! You can get Neon Chrome on Steam for $14.99 but it’s 10% off till May 5th And you can also buy the soundtrack for $4.99! Keep up the good work 10TONS LTD!!

There's a railgun that blows through walls, and an anti aircraft machine gun that is slow to spin up. Secondary weapons include auto aim missiles, and grenades that light the floor on fire.\n\nIf you're sensitive to screen shake or flashing, you're in good shape. You can shut off screen shake. There's no senseless flashing, and the background is typically dark. Background scrolling is smooth.

Neon Chrome is really little more than generic repetition at it's core. You spend most of the time grinding with absolutely nothing to make the experience stand out. It's just typical run n shoot with dull weapons.\n\nNeon Chrome does as bad a job replicating it's cyberpunk inspirations as it does carving it's own identity. It's like someone who's never heard of cyberpunk before got an email describing some basic themes and aesthetic the day they went to work. Something something brain uploading blah blah robots blah blah neon. And about the neon: there are bright colors, yes, but they are bright like a clown is bright. Yellows, greens, and reds get tossed around liberally, but it looks nothing like like you'd imagine when you think "neon". See what I mean about that failure to understand the aesthetic it's going for?\n\nI hate to make that the meat of this review(as bad as it is) but the actual game is just so boring I don't know what else to say. Run, shoot, get credits, run, shoot, get credits. I'm guessing the chance the game would really blow me away if I took dozens of hours to level up all my stats and get to the final boss is low. There are trillions of roguelikes released on Steam in the last couple of years, and about half of them are shooters. I can't think of a single reason you'd go for Neon Chrome over any of them, especially considering how bungled the theme is.","May 4","false","2.2"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","32","7","22","4","0"

It's Robotron with rpg elements and perks.  Not quite as frenetic as Smash TV, but very similar in layout.  Anyone that even remotely likes twin stick shooters should look into this excellent indy game.  Vast improvement over crimsonland, although that game was almost as fun for the era it came out in.","April 30","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far I've only gotten to the Hovertank, but I'm definitely enjoying it.\nEdit: I've beaten it for the first time, so I can make some of these things a little more accurate.\n\nThe Tl;Dr is that this game is a Cyberpunk Rogue Legacy with a "linear" map progression. I say linear map progression, because you generally have to go to floor 1, then 2, etc, but the floors are different every time.\n\nFor everyone else, it's a top down rogue like shooter. You play as super hacker who is trying to take down an evil corportation. You do this by sitting in a chair, picking a bot/person from a list, and sending them forth into the levels. You get to pick from three different people that are random. The more weapons and abilities you find, the more diverse your picks can become. There are also static upgrades, so you can give your units more health, energy, luck, damage, etc. These are static upgrades, if you get em, they stay. You can also buy a weapon, that you've unlocked, and you'll start with it on your next run, same with abilities.\nAnother neat thing I noticed was that completing achievements nets you in game money. It's not a lot, but 1200 credits can still be a few levels, depending on how early in the game you are.\nThis game can feel a little grindy, but that's the just nature of the rogue like.\nA small note is that this game felt VERY weird to me initially. The controls are very simple, but there is no dodge, which I thought was weird. After the first hour, I adapted, and the game is awesome.\n\nAfter you beat the game, it'll kick you to the equivalent of new game plus. You can swap between difficulties at any time, which is a really cool design choice. Over all, still a fantastic game.\nI'd totally recommend if you're a fan of rogue like games with progression.\nThe music is also really awesome.","May 4","true","34.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also i looked at live 5 lets plays of this.... and most of them sucked at the game lol, so they couldnt do this game justice, trust me.\nPros\n-it has more than 20 weapons (much more than 20, i just eyeballed it lol)\n- random layouts of room modules(like isaac)\n-modding support incoming (its actually here but its in beta testing, just ask the dev and he will invite you to the beta version within a reasonable time)\nrandom start each time you play unless you want to power play and spen the credits you earn each run to give yourself a big boost.\n-save points after each boss. you have to see it to understand there are a few levels betweem each boss but the gap gets farther the farther you make it but you dont have to start at level one each time you die once you beat the boss, then when you beat the final boss ...the game gets harder..... and harder.... so you need to get better and better\n-actual couch co-op like the good ol' days get some controllers and have some fun.\n-alot more pros but ill be here all day trying to explain, and i suck at the TL DR thing as you can see so ill stop here\n\nCONS\n-not something that bothers me in the slightest, but the graphics arent top of the line next gen... but we are gamers... and this game isnt about graphics its about gameplay right?\n-the game doesnt have the popularity it deserves but its only been out for 2 months im sure it will slowly pick up\n-small playerbase means low amount of quality mods but the game is still awesome without them\n-i had to stop playing the game to write this review QQ\n\n\nGreat game, looking forward to everything this dev puts out!","May 30","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the enemies lack variety (particularly early on) they make up for it with a good balance of tenacity, hardiness, and straightforward challenge that rewards pre-planning and quick wit equally.\n\nBut the bosses. Oh dear lord the bosses.\n\nKilling a giant spider with three stages only to, without any real pre-warning that this would happen upon winning, have the boss self destruct in a blast larger than anything you've come to face beforehand, thus killing you and rendering pointless your victory.\n\nOr how about a giant worm who's sole form of attack in his third phase is to fling homing missles out you in massive numbers. I counted at least 6 on screen at a time, all with fairly large blast radiuses, and all of which can and will be launched at you while the boss is off screen.\n\nThese aren't challenges because you aren't given any tools to overcome them exept to boost your health for the next run or boost your damage to kill it quicker than it can kill you.\n\nWithout these oversights, maybe I could leave a positive review but with them I just can't.\nIt simply makes the game too frustrating. I feel my time would be better spent elsewhere.\n\nEdit: Going back in, I still believe the bosses are ridiculous, but the game still has some real shining points. While I think they could have been better designed, ultimately they don't destroy the whole product. 7/10","June 2","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
