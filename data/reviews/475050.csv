Nice chilled out atmosphere, smooth frame rate and challenging levels.  Really nice VR version of an old school classic!\n\nWorked great on my Oculus Rift.","May 30","true","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's easy going but stays interesting. Whereas in the classic Tetris the game goes faster as the levels go up, in this VR version it's the complexity that increases. Is it the killer VR app? No, it isn't, but it doesn't pretend to be either. How I wish this had been my introduction to VR instead of that horrible roller coaster...","June 4","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One based on Tetris concepts as well. At a decent price too. Sounds great?\n\nProblem is: there's no way to reset your seating position. Doing it in the SteamVR dashboard seems to have no effect. So unless I want to go and sit on the floor and face the direction the game wants me to, I'm stuck playing the game at some weird 45 degree angle.\n\nSecondly, unless I'm missing something: there's no way to zoom in. Sure I could walk up to it and get closer, but this is advertised as a seated game. I should be able to do this without having to move my physical position. Right now I'm stuck staring at a fairly tiny play area. It should give me the option to use the majority of my FOV.\n\nThe gameplay is sound. It's simple and relaxing if you like this sort of thing. I could definitely see myself racking up lots of time playing if the interface weren't so awkward.\n\nRight now I can't recommend it. Though it has only just been released. If these (in my opinion basic) features are added, I'd definitely recommend it.","May 27","false","0.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

VERY annoying and a deal breaker for me. If you are to close you can't really see the block falling down while looking where to put it. My room is small and I can't really move the chair away far enough to get a decent view. As the developer added functionality to move the height I believe this issue will be fixed very soon.\n\n* Extreme lag issues in the main menu.\nLag is probably around 1 frames a second at times. Then all of the sudden it works perfectly. Maybe it's the fog that creates this.\n\n* The price of 6,99â‚¬ is to high for such an unpolished and not very beautiful game. It feels more like a 1 dollar mobile game. The graphics is doing it's job for the gameplay perfectly however, so it's not a dealbreaker.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a game with great gameplay with issues that can be a dealbreaker for some. With some updates it's a pure gem. Keep it on your wishlist for now.\n\n","June 4","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
