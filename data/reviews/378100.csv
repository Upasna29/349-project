However, he's kind enough to let you know in precise detail that the generator beyond the river is where he harnesses his power, but you'll never stop him anyway because you don't have the gas can, key and cable to get the generator running.\n\nNo kidding, that's what he says in his note.\n\nI spent about 30 minutes ambling around a hideously ugly forest that mostly consists of dirt and a sparse few PS1-era trees, picking up giant battery packages to keep my flashlight running and avoiding land mines seemingly drawn in MS Paint before I decided I had enough of this game. If you tried Nyctophobia for free you'd probably be angry at the time wasted in downloading and playing it, never mind spending a fiver for this dubious privilege.\n\nIt should also be noted that this evil spirit of the forest and darkness wrote his sinister warning message on spiral bound notebook paper. Perhaps "The Keeper" is short for "The Trapper Keeper."","August 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","91","39","43","15","3"

Actually, that's a lie...Devil's Share was worse, but only by simple virtue of it crashing approximately every 23.6 seconds (praise the Lord for small mercies).  This game, on the other hand, plays just fine...as long as you don't go extrapolating the word "play" into "gameplay".  Do that, and you're REALLY up crap's creek.  Oh, and it LOOKS like diarrhea, to boot.  This would have been a sub-standard horror game by the standards of 1987 (that's PRE-Doom 1 and Resident Evil 1, by the by).\n\nLightning Man Media, may I suggest a quick change of company name before releasing your next effortless "masterpiece" in a fortnight-and-a-half's time?  Even us die-hard horror aficionados are slowly learning not to buy every single pile of stinking horse-manure which slops across our paddocks.  VERY slowly, granted, in the case of confirmed ♥♥♥♥-heads like yours truly.  But I AM learning.\n\nTo be honest, I only bought this one 'cause it was a measly five bucks and only had nine reviews to date, and it's always nice when one or two human beings actually get to read the reviews you spend more time writing than the game devs spend making their so-called "games".  So I'll consider this five bucks well spent, or more accurately, five bucks well used to wipe my ♥♥♥♥ with before I unceremoniously flushed it around the s-bend.  In all frankness, a sewer drain would have been more worthy of my well-earned wads than these scoundrels.\n\nLightning Man Media, whatever you do, PLEASE spend my five dollars sensibly, and don't go using the proceeds of my purchase towards something silly like procuring some hard drugs which might lead to a fatal OD.  The world needs your future contributions.  The vitality of our beloved genre of horror gaming DEPENDS upon the tireless efforts of people like yourselves/yourself (I'm guessing you're probably just a twelve year-old kid in his bedroom, though you may have gotten your best mate up the street to lend a hand with the admittedly nifty title screen).  People like yourselves really do have Steam reviews and Youtube videos to thank for that fact that anybody is ever stupid to buy your games AT ALL.\n\nAlas, this is one game even a PewDiePie could never love...\n\nVerdict: 1/10.","August 29, 2015","false","1.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","75","15","20","12","0"

Just like the world of triple A title, it is crowded with cheap knock-off and copycats. Who thought that making a Slender clone without Slender would be a good idea?\n\nIn Nyctophobia the real threat is not an entity but your own fear of the dark. In order to survive you must pick up batteries floating around the map since your flashlight can't last more than 1 minute. If you don't do that darkness will overwhelm you and you will be greeted with a game over screen. That's some lazy game design, isn't it? Not to mention the minefield that stands between you and the gas can that you must pick up to progress. It just feels out of place.\n\nAt the end of the game a silly looking shadow chases you and the only thing you have to do to survive this encounter is to make your way to the safety zone before it gets you.\n\nThe only positive thing about the game is its ambiant sound effects which gave me the chills at some moments but that's all.\n\nTo summarize, Nyctophobia is absolutely not worth a buy. Wait for someone to gift it to you instead. It takes no more than 20 minutes to beat the game on the first playthrough.\n\nHere's the proof :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze-uP9hkbSE\n\nRating :\n1.5","September 11, 2015","false","0.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Cause that's basically what this game is: a timed walking simulator.\n\nThe game requires you to find randomized checkpoints in the form of batteries to stay alive. Your only clues on where to go are based on question marks on the map that you have to manually go find to look at. If you go off exploring too much, you can easily die due to there not being any battery packs in that area.\n\nI highly recommend using the guide.\n\nSounds: In terms of sound, the game is pretty boring. There were a couple of sounds that felt right, but overall the sounds felt a bit forced. There is no depth of sound either. In Own the Night mode, it doesn't matter if a zombie is 1 foot from you, or 20 feet from you, the sound level is the same. No volume scaling based on distance at all.\n\nIssues with Clipping: Clipping occurs often during this game, so when you try to enter certain areas, you may not be able to without wiggling your way in, which makes absolutely no sense. Further, as you're walking along, random things can catch you, and you might slow down for no apparent reason.\n\nGraphics: Visually the graphics are low quality, but I don't think that was the main goal of the designers.\n\nControls: If you use two monitors, I would highly recommend disabling the second monitor during play, because the game gets confused when your mouse leaves the window/fullscreen area of its existence. I was often walking in strange directions or having the screen flip and move around due to mouse position on the other monitor. It was rather frustrating.\n\nInterface: While the game says its supports inverted mouse control on the y-axis, whenever I tried to select "yes" the game just laughed at me and did nothing. I could also select no, and the same thing happened. Nothing. When you want to access the menu, you press escape.... often I'd have to press it twice to bring it up, but not always. Something weird was going on there.\n\nStory: Fairly weak, as the premise itself is obviously flawed. You have a deep terrifying fear of the night, and yet for some reason you've decided to go out for a drive in the middle of no where, at night. Whatever. While the game attempts to piece together some sort of semblence of a story, it just seems a bit forced as if they came up with a game mechanic and designed something around it.\n\nOverall: Fairly boring, but easy to 100%. The most exciting times playing will be when you've wandered off too far from places you are supposed to be and are desparately running to a battery pack watching your battery drain down. Then just before it's completely empty and it looks like it has 15% left, you'll have 0% and die and that will surprise you.\n\nTwo dollars is too much for this game. I'd pick it up in a bundle, if at all.\n\nRating: 3/10","May 4","false","4.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

I'd suggest splitting the Controls screen off into its own page with its own button.\n- In the "How to Play" page, the way the text and graphics are laid out make it extremely difficult to be able to comprehend what I'm supposed to do. I mocked up a quick wireframe of how I'd recommend you do it: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38430663/DesignShit/Nyctophobia-TutorialUIWireframe.png Note: The images of the battery meter should be small enough so they're no taller than the height of the line of text they're inserted into.\n- Typo in "How to Play" page: "acess" should be spelled "access".\n- There's virtually zero payoff for dying. A black screen saying "you died" without the player ever even seeing the monster (unless I guess the monster is darkness itself?) isn't exactly horrifying. Modern horror typically demands a build of tension with some sort of payoff or release. Extra Credits has an excellent video on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyiAR2BXtKU\n- When the player spawns, I don't think you should have the player character directly talk about the battery indicator at the top of the screen. Instead, I think you should have them say something like, "My flashlight's batteries are limited, so I should do my best to make sure that they don't run out."\n- I highly recommend that you don't use icons in the pause menu, I'd use normal buttons with text instead. Or, what you could do is when the mouse hovers over a button, have text appear under the button that says what it does.\n- There should be some sort of confirmation message for restarting the game when I press the button to do so, as well as for when I press the button that takes me back to the main menu.\n- Kevin MacLeod's music isn't being credited correctly. Here's how he requests it be done: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/faq.html It is very important that this is fixed as soon as possible.\n- The footstep sounds should be quieter.\n\nOverall, I like the atmosphere you've created - it has a very nice aesthetic, despite its jarring lack of polish, but there remains a lot of work to be done overall. Giving this a thumbs down for the time being, at least until most of these are addressed in some form.","August 29, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

The game has been fun to play and there are several good moments in the game. I took the game to be a somewhat goofy horror game. There are quite a few fun elements to the game; collecting batteries, finding notes, getting chased. There are also a few issues with the game. Overall though, the game is fun to play and suffers from a few bugs that the developer has been fixing. I have 15 minutes on record on steam but probably a few hours on record in total. I think if you rush through the game you could finish it in 20 minutes but otherwise the game should take 45ish minutues.","September 7, 2015","true","1.0"," 6 of 29 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","6","29","0","0"
