"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gao-Li/recommended/209120/","Gao-Li","Gao Li","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gao-Li/","192 products in account","7/10 A good game with several severe drawbacks to itReview for the Street Fighter X Tekken: Complete Pack version 1.08\n\nBoth the Street Fighter & the Tekken franchise are video game milestones. Capcom’s Street Fighter II (1991) became famous for introducing mechanics we nowadays perceive as normal, such as combos, cancellations, or lenient controls. Bandai-Namco’s Tekken series (1994 ongoing) then built upon this & Sega’s Virtua Fighter’s legacy (1993 ongoing) to sweep the market with 3D fighting arenas, new control schemes, more realistic fighting moves, & beginner friendly controls that displayed a remarkable, never before seen depth to them. It seems like a no-brainer for these two giants to meet up in this crossover from 2012. But whether this 2.5D mashup fared well or not, is a completely different question.\n\nAbout the game Mechanics\nMovesets\nThe mechanics & controls of both  Tekken & Street Fighter could not be any further apart with one being build around 3D arenas while the other was made with 2D environments in mind. SFxT tries to solve this problem by greeting players with a surprisingly deep fighting mechanic that has multiple means of individualizing the characters’ movesets. Nevertheless, using Tekken characters does feel alien.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685384490\nGenerally, the game shares several of the mechanics of the Street Fighter IV franchise (2008-2014), but adds optional, simplified special attacks (e.g. instead of ↓↘→Ⓟ just pressing ↘Ⓟ), customizable button combinations, & quick combos to make it easier for Tekken players & newcomers to find their way into the game. Simplified moves worked well in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom (2008) & sure enough do their job here.\n\nTag Team\nThe tag team system is inspired by the Tekken Tag Tournament series (2000 ongoing) with tagouts either being performed through quick combos or by pressing medium kick & medium punch at the same time. The initial problem of the game was that the amount of damage dealt was too low & because each team possesses two healthbars, fights often ended in timeouts instead of KOs. After several patches, this was remedied, but fights can still be unnecessarily drawn out. On the upside, tag teams can even be created in online ranked matches and up to four players can duke it out at once.\n\nScramble\nThe scramble mode is obviously the highlight of the on-/offline multiplayer experience, four players can play simultaneously in teams of two. The rounds are quick and chaotic, which just adds more to the fun.\n\nGems\nTo further balance the game, SFxT has a gem mechanic. Each character can carry up to three gems at the same time, each having different effects & prerequisites to activate them. Although the gem system makes sense in theory, in practice it is a mess. The amount of available gems is way too large leading to a multitude of confusing combinations that discourage users from looking into this mechanic altogether. Even worse, a large amount of premium gems are only available as purchasable DLC, thus missing the point of being there to level the virtual battle field.\n\nPandora\nIn theory Pandora is a great mechanic; sadly it’s not so much in practice. Players sacrifice one party member to temporarily boost the remaining protagonist's powers for a brief amount of time. Once Pandora runs out, the player automatically loses. Therefore it is key to knock the other party out swiftly; unfortunately, because of the game’s design, Pandora rarely helps win any rounds but instead causes players to lose. So, it’s hardly ever used.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685384665\nCustomization\nTo individualize characters beyond the gems & customized button combinations, players can color their characters’ clothes. The feature even allows players to either wrap the characters in latex or neon glowing schemes (To see an example of a neon character, click here). Additionally, all base game characters have DLC outfits that are inspired by characters from both franchises.\n\nBacklash\nThe game had several issues when it first came out. Shaking life bars irritated players & low damage dragged matches out. But it was the DLC policy that ruined the game for many.\n\nControversy\nAlthough the SFIV series was known for its on-disc DLC, Capcom came under scrutiny upon SFxT’s initial release when it became public that several of the announced twelve DLC characters were already included on the game’s disc - locked behind a paywall that cost as much as many video games ($19.99 USD). More than that, the Playstation 3 & Vita releases of the game had five additional DLC characters, namely Toro Inoue, Kuro, Cole Mac Grath, Pac-Man, and Bad Box Art Mega Man, while the PC & Xbox360 releases did not receive any exclusives. Further, the Xbox 360 version received even more criticism as the online tag team bouts mentioned in the game's manual did not find their way into that version & were not patched in later on. The big disappointments over the game lead players to stay away from it altogether. After initial attempts, Capcom then decided to stop promoting the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688920867\nGames for Windows Live\nFor the longest time, Capcom refused to transfer both Street Fighter X Tekken &  Resident Evil 5 over from Games for Windows Live to Steam Works. And while RE 5 received this treatment in 2015, SFxT still uses GfWL. Windows 10 users won’t have any problems logging in, but others will have to jump through hoops to get the game working in the first place. However, once that’s done, the game & other GfWL services will work just fine.\n\nOnline\nSadly, due to its age, negative reputation, less popular design choices, & GfWL, the online population is considerably small & encountering cheaters who use lag switches or rage quit before they lose a match is not uncommon. The remaining players who don’t cheat are often times veterans who far outlevel any newcomers making it increasingly difficult for newcomers to win any matches at all.\nOptimization\nThere's not a lot to say about the game's graphic and control options. It's just as marvelous as with the SFIV series with different AA features, V-Sync, & completely customizable button configurations.\nConclusionDespite it all, SFxT is a good game that suffered from questionable management choices which tarnished the game’s reception & subsequently was part of what discolored the company’s reputation for years to come. The arcade stories are fun and the animations have the right level of goofiness to stay refreshing. The PC port is marvelously optimized with tons of graphics options that even allow it to run on "toasters". It's definitely worth picking up for a fair price & is truly something that fans would want to check out.\n\nSee also:\nSuper Street Fighter IV review (in German)","May 21","true","55.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheepytina/recommended/209120/","sheepytina","tina bean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheepytina/","373 products in account","Street Fighter X Tekken had so much potential. It really did, and it's actually a pretty fun game in short bursts. I bought this one back at launch and I don't necessarily regret it, since I do enjoy this game a lot, but it's not one I'd recommend.\n\nThe main problem lies in the game's lack of replayability. If this game were made 5 years prior, all of the DLC for this game would have been unlockable content, prolonging the life of the gameplay considerably. However, that would almost be too logical in this day and age, so everything, EVERYTHING that could possibly be DLC is DLC in this game. No unlockable characters or costumes here. Just pay up and they're yours! If you can get the 12 character DLC pack on sale then that'd be worth it, but then you're giving money to Capcom for all the wrong reasons. I wouldn't bother at this point. To make matters worse, the game will taunt you for not having DLC, showing very clearly what you're yet to "unlock".\n\nAside from the DLC issue, the fact that THERE'S NOTHING TO DO once you've beaten the arcade mode a couple of times, seen all the endings, and gone for a few rounds of online play, the game actually has a solid selection of playable characters, with or without the additional 12-character DLC pack, and the tag team mechanics satisfy both the urge for a serious fighter in SSFIV and a more over-the-top fighter in MvC all in one game, which is pretty cool. The Tekken characters in SF style offer a breath of fresh air with Capcom's own charming take on these classic characters, and they're all loads of fun to play as. Not to mention how good the soundtrack is!\n\nIn fact, I rather like this game for what it is, but I'm disappointed for what it could have been. It's kind of underwhelming, especially after all the hype. If you're a more casual fighting game fan like myself, then you'll probably get some enjoyment out of it, but it doesn't feel quite as deep and refined as some of Capcom's other fighters and there's little to keep you coming back. It's definitely simplified to a noticeable degree, which seems to be a conscious design decision, but it feels like it could be a little more technical. On the plus side, at least it's easy to pick up and play.\n\nI mean, yeah, it's still totally fun, but with the DLC issues, questionable mechanics, the lack of long-term support from Capcom (especially for the PC version which is behind on several patches), and the fact that NOBODY FREAKING PLAYS IT, I really cannot recommend this game at all. Just wait for Ultra IV to come out, and hope that Namco's promised Tekken X Street Fighter is a lot more compelling.\n\nBut hey, at least it has Trading Cards!","November 25, 2013","false","22.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

And I believe my first Playstation game was Tekken 1. I have loved fighting games since I was a little kid, and I in fact, wanted to get this game, but because of some negative reviews on this game by some people, I decided to just stay away from it for a while. Now that it was on a Steam sale, I have decided to buy it, and well, I am not really sure why people would give bad ratings to this game....sure, you can't really use the Tekken characters like you normally would in the original Tekken games, as the one that made this game is Capcom, but those Tekken characters still maintain their own character even in this game. It kind of sucks that Jin is kind of hard to use in this....or I should say, he either sucks or is for the real hardcore players....or possibly, I simply don't understand how he works in this game yet. But Jin kind of does not really feel like the Jin in the Tekken series. It sucks even more because you can't use Devil Jin, either.\n\nBut yes, other than that, I think this is pretty a decent fighting game. I like how so easy it is to do combos and it just feels so good when you successfully execute chain combos using two of your characters. I in fact loved Tekken Tag Tournament 2, which I thought it was the best Tekken game yet, and personally, I would like to say Street Fighter x Tekken is simply the best fighting game I have ever played. Perhaps I am exaggerating, but the fact remains. The game is just damn good. You can also mod the costumes, which are available on the internet or you can simply make your own by using a certain program, so the replay value is there. All I can say is that the game is rather underrated in my opinion. The game is definitely not as bad as people say it is.\n\nWell, it might be because I am a fan of Street Fighter and Tekken series, but I don't know. I believe if you are a fighting game fan, you'd love it in my opinion.\n\n9.9 out of 10","January 23, 2014","true","64.8"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","33","52","0","3"

So if you like Street fighter and like tekken i would recommend getting it but if you like tekken more and dislike the playstyle of Street fighter i would suggest you don't buy it (unless your collecting the games) so with that i give it a max 7.5/10 min would be 5.5/10 none the less this game gets the Skrub Tick of Approval ( Don't judge me or i will judge you) thank you reading Sig Da Skrub out","August 12, 2014","true","10.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

But Capcom skipped on the story mode. You literally just pass levels without anything happen, only crap talk. Whats worse the ending are just black & text if you don't choose the 2 characters side of each other. Come on Capcom even in your super nintendo days you had better animated scenes. I can't believe that Namco let them do this. You would think a story of 2 greatest fighting games would be way better. The practice mode is laughable, tekken 5 had a better scheme.  Paying for costumes that in the past were unlockable. The only thing thats make this game worth while is the competition between human players, because u can button munch your way to passing the computer. Remember how hard Street Fighter 2 was to pass on normal.\nCapcom why you stop caring? This game should just be 15.00 on steam its already aged. Darksiders 2 cost me less & has way more content.lol For those of you expecting the Tekken characters to have their normal button scheme they don't. You have to relearn sum moves. I think its a real shame that they didn't give pc more outfits for free. Also come on capcom titles as rewards?\n\nRemember the good old days of Marvel vs Capcom earning money in the game and buying new characters, colors, and backgrounds. Most of all no updates on this game at all! Street Fighter 4 is ♥♥♥♥♥ing an Ultra update upgrade purchasable. Why can't they ♥♥♥ all the Characters to this game fei long especially. I think we all wanted to see those 2 scrap to see which of them is really Bruce Lee. Speaking of which Tekken's Bruce, Lee, EVil Ryu, Oni the game just has so many character slot space to be filled.

The combo system feels limited. You can mix between punches and kicks and up in strength Light > Medium > Heavy for 3 attacks, then a "Launch". Then a bunch of single special moves, and then 2 throws (forward and back throw). Theres also these quick combos you activate with just 2 buttons if you have enough energy, you can set 2 different pre-made combos from a list of like 6 in the menu.\n\nSo overall I feel its not fluid combo system. The game is also so fast it seems like you need to input all your buttons before hes even done with the first swing. Naturally I feel like I want to pause for the attack animation to finish before I input another button into the combo but instead you need to push them all as fast as possible. Also things like countering a throw with a throw seem crazy hard considering how fast the game is going.\n\nThe AI on some charecters on arcade seem better then others. Like the Guile & Abel team. Guile throws sonic booms, waits for you to get in range and tears you up. Abel just walks endlessly at you and leaves himself open for medium hits. That was the worst team I noticed but I havn't faced them all yet.\n\nThe graphics, audio and charecter models are really good. Bryan, Hwoarang, Dalsim, Yoshimitsu, King look amazing. Bryan acting like a complete sciopath I find kinda weird. But then Law, Blanka, Paul, and somewhat Guile for exmaple look like they came from some bizzaro cartoon world. The rest are pretty good.\n\nThe Gem system is kinda cool as you can customize your charecter slightly before you go into a fight. I don't like how the better gems and combos can only be gotten by the DLC. I hate DLC, they should just update you that content for already buying the game.\n\nI am a Tekken fan and this game doesn't bring a lot of Tekken to the table. Overall it would be great to play on versus with someone at your house or at a party but in general I wouldn't get it unless it was on sale for atleast 50%.\n\nLasty I get a constant screen tearing line across the middle whie I play, It gets pretty annoying. My fps is always stuck at around 60 even with Vsync off; the ingame benchmark runs at 300+ fps but normal gameplay is always 60. Vsync, Fixed/Variable framerate, Single gpu mode, nothing gets rid of the line.","November 26, 2013","false","14.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Yes GFWL, shut down making it almost impossible or work heavy just to get the game back and running again. BUT, that doesn't mean it didn't have potential beforehand or it "sucked" all because it had GFWL running.\n\nBefore the GFWL Shutdown:\n- Great gameplay\n- Amazing graphics\n- Real simple controls although yes more SF oriented controls than Tekken\n- Awesome DLCs and great storylines\n- Really gets you going sometimes\n- Fun for everyone else in the family who loves SF and Tekken\n\nAfter the GFWL Shutdown:\n- You can't say anything really after this incident\n- The game doesn't work for DLCs or any pack after this occured\n- Only worth playing for Offline ( as in against someone in your house ) not multiplayer\n- A lot of work just to try and get it working\n\nSum up:\nNot like it didn't have potential, it had everything going for it and good gameplay/graphics just as I mentioned before, but do not and I repeat do not hate on this game just because GFWL closed down on it. Now yes I do recommend not buying it unless you don't mind the simple characters already given to you and playing with a friend or family member in the household, and the time consuming process of just getting it to work with GFWL Marketplace version. If you want to hate on something hate on the GFWL services, but not the game people. Learn from what's really causing it and not hating on the game itself cause of something else. If there was a "Somewhat or Maybe" button for "Do you recommend this game?" then I would've chosen that.","March 10, 2015","true","30.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","2"

Read and watched all the news relating the game before it was available. The game was finally released with alot of confidence in Capcom I thought It was worth 59.99 x 2 because I had It originally for Xbox 360. I Didnt buy the Steam version for some time after it's release because I remembered It not catching my interests enough. It's a shame that the Namco/Bandai version called Tekken X Street Fighter was only partially developed and Namco/Bandai decided to pull the plug. I like The Street fighter series very much aswell, but I felt that the Tekken side that Capcom arranged was sorta looked at like a joke lineup. The way the characters on the Tekken side are very goofy looking and just feel wierd to play in the Street Fighter Universe. I thought the game also made players go through a Windows Live service was unnecessary. The community Online is small enough and I think It made it smaller with the extra hopes to jump through to play someone online. I would not recomend this if you like Street fighter and definetely not recomend this title if your a Tekken fan. 6/10","September 16, 2015","false","108.4"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","14","29","2","0"

If you download the game but also have Ultra Street Fighter IV, you will get a free costume for every new character in Ultra Street Fighter Iv that have not appeared in another version of the  Street Fighter IV game (Hugo,Poison,Elena,Decapre,Rolento)\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n1.Not enough character colors and costumes (starts with original costume for each character, but have to buy new character costumes individually for .99 each)\n\n2. Can't use Pac-Man or Megaman (PS3 version only)\n\n3. If you don't have a Windows Live account, your data will erase when you close the game and will make you redownload all character costume and color swaps again (if you have any) and you have to reset the character language setting (English or Japanese)\n\n4. Have to buy characters like Sakura, Blanka, Guy, Cody, Dudley, and Elena and 6 Tekken characters I can't remember the names of for $20.00\n\n5. Too much DLC\n\n\nThis game is great. 9.5/10 definitly recommend.\n\n","April 24","true","88.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerceptiveGenius/recommended/209120/","PerceptiveGenius","Antwan Black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerceptiveGenius/","43 products in account","This is my personal honest review about Street fighter X tekken: When i first started Street Fighter X Tekken for the first time I had never owned a Street Fighter or Tekken game so i thought what better way to get to know both game then to play a game that features both fighters. As i went to train i was greeted by a roster of 30+ characters much to my satisfaction as this was a good way to get a grasp on both series's fighters. First i played the Street Fighter side(Chun Li, Cammy,Ryu,Ken,Guy,Dudley Etc.) Then i played the Tekken Side(Law,Asuka,Heihachi,Raven,Nina, Etc.) after playing both sides and scouting what they can do i naturally gravitated to the Tekken side. their characters seem more interesting to me as well as Tekken fits my playstyle: doing long combos and heavy damage is more of my style then tapping people's foot A.K.A Footsieing as one can expect in Street Fighter(Not that Street Fighter is a bad game it just doesn't fit my style) one of my first tekken characters was Law in which i still play as well as Asuka these two characters appealed to me the most. Law's tricky mix ups and Asuka high damage output made them stick out even more to me which none of the Street Fighters could accomplish. But that's enough of my rambling now i will explain what i like and dislike about Street Fighter X Tekken\n\nPros:\n\n1. Large Character roster: with over 30+ characters there's someone for everyone, for every playstyle.\n\n2. Great english voice acting: All of the Voice Actors in this game sound at the top of their game(No pun intended) none of them sounded bored or tired(Super Street Fighter 4 I'm looking at you)\n\n3. Strategic Gem system: I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about the new gem system and i was one of the ones who didn't like it at first because i though it would dramatically imbalance the game. Luckily i was wrong if you buy the full gem pack you will be greeted to a vast array of game diamonds A.K.A "Gems". Gems are stat boosting items that are color-coded in accordance to the stat they boost(Red boosts Attack, Yellow boosts Defense and Green boosts Speed) there are other types of gems such as assist gems the type i was just explaining is called "Boost Gems" which like it states it "Boosts".The gem system gives a tiny strategic boost to the game which i feel is underappreciated.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Lack of playerbase: (As of now) i assume it's due to the GFWL service shutting down in July but one would assume if a game's online service is shutting down people would play it until the end(Or at least that's just me) It's rather unfortunate as i feel Street Fighter X Tekken is a great game with untapped potential 2 years is way too soon for a game to "Die out" at least that's how i feel.\n\n2. Lack of different modes: In the PC version there are only Arcade,Versus and the "Live" mode which enables online play. seeing as the Ps3 and vita versions have Burst Kumite: a mode in which you can fight Computer opponents forever i was shocked to see it wasn't in this version(Probably from sheer laziness on Capcom's part)\n\n3. Online Lag: This is a problem which most fighting games have: bad netcode while not nearly as bad as MK9's netcode(Worst i've ever experienced) it still leaves a lot to be desired. As i look for opponents by the A and B computer rank\n(To avoid sloppy connections) I was sad to see players with laggy connections(Some of which went down three bars before the fight would even start) There have been many times in where i start a match with a online player whose connection seemed good at first but became horribly slow making them look like they are teleporting in front of me which i can't even counter. I don't know why this happens but it need to be fixed(Which i doubt it will at least now)\n\n4. Bad matchmaking system: There have been far too many incidents of meeting the same player as i try to search for different players to fight. I fight a person great the fight's over i search for others find that same person over and over and over again to the point where i quit for a while in the hopes of having different competiton by the next time i play("But it's because online is dead for Street Fighter X Tekken PC version") while that may be true I've experienced the same thing on the Vita and Ps3 version despite there being lots of people online at the time. Often when i go online no matter the version i would feel like one of the only online players as i kept running into the same people constantly if only it had a filter button to filter out certain people i don't want to fight again it would help a lot with this problem.\n\n\nWhile the bad may outweigh the good I still think Street Fighter X Tekken is a great game gone too soon(Migrating it to steamworks and releasing patches that will buff the netcode might help revive it but i doubt that will happen) you can buy it if you like playing offline but don't even think about going online trust me(At least the PC version). I don't know if i should recommend this game or not but i will if only for the offline content(DLC ahoy!).","March 14, 2014","true","137.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Only downside i've seen so far is that there are 12 characters that are locked. 6 from SF and 6 from Tekken. Which is a stupid way of saying "Give us your money". This "DLC" has a ridiculous cost of $20. Other than that there are some moves which are really hard (nearly impossible because of the characters response time) to do even in "trial" mode.\n\nSo i give this a 7/10\n\nThe characters locked are as follows:\nSakura (SF)\nBlanka (SF)\nGuy (SF)\nCody (SF)\nElena (SF)\nDudley (SF)\nLars (T)\nAlisa (T)\nJACK-X (T)\nBryan (T)\nChristie (T)\nLei (T)","December 14, 2014","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerceptiveGenius/recommended/209120/","PerceptiveGenius","Antwan Black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerceptiveGenius/","43 products in account","This is my personal honest review about Street fighter X tekken: When i first started Street Fighter X Tekken for the first time I had never owned a Street Fighter or Tekken game so i thought what better way to get to know both game then to play a game that features both fighters. As i went to train i was greeted by a roster of 30+ characters much to my satisfaction as this was a good way to get a grasp on both series's fighters. First i played the Street Fighter side(Chun Li, Cammy,Ryu,Ken,Guy,Dudley Etc.) Then i played the Tekken Side(Law,Asuka,Heihachi,Raven,Nina, Etc.) after playing both sides and scouting what they can do i naturally gravitated to the Tekken side. their characters seem more interesting to me as well as Tekken fits my playstyle: doing long combos and heavy damage is more of my style then tapping people's foot A.K.A Footsieing as one can expect in Street Fighter(Not that Street Fighter is a bad game it just doesn't fit my style) one of my first tekken characters was Law in which i still play as well as Asuka these two characters appealed to me the most. Law's tricky mix ups and Asuka high damage output made them stick out even more to me which none of the Street Fighters could accomplish. But that's enough of my rambling now i will explain what i like and dislike about Street Fighter X Tekken\n\nPros:\n\n1. Large Character roster: with over 30+ characters there's someone for everyone, for every playstyle.\n\n2. Great english voice acting: All of the Voice Actors in this game sound at the top of their game(No pun intended) none of them sounded bored or tired(Super Street Fighter 4 I'm looking at you)\n\n3. Strategic Gem system: I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about the new gem system and i was one of the ones who didn't like it at first because i though it would dramatically imbalance the game. Luckily i was wrong if you buy the full gem pack you will be greeted to a vast array of game diamonds A.K.A "Gems". Gems are stat boosting items that are color-coded in accordance to the stat they boost(Red boosts Attack, Yellow boosts Defense and Green boosts Speed) there are other types of gems such as assist gems the type i was just explaining is called "Boost Gems" which like it states it "Boosts".The gem system gives a tiny strategic boost to the game which i feel is underappreciated.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Lack of playerbase: (As of now) i assume it's due to the GFWL service shutting down in July but one would assume if a game's online service is shutting down people would play it until the end(Or at least that's just me) It's rather unfortunate as i feel Street Fighter X Tekken is a great game with untapped potential 2 years is way too soon for a game to "Die out" at least that's how i feel.\n\n2. Lack of different modes: In the PC version there are only Arcade,Versus and the "Live" mode which enables online play. seeing as the Ps3 and vita versions have Burst Kumite: a mode in which you can fight Computer opponents forever i was shocked to see it wasn't in this version(Probably from sheer laziness on Capcom's part)\n\n3. Online Lag: This is a problem which most fighting games have: bad netcode while not nearly as bad as MK9's netcode(Worst i've ever experienced) it still leaves a lot to be desired. As i look for opponents by the A and B computer rank\n(To avoid sloppy connections) I was sad to see players with laggy connections(Some of which went down three bars before the fight would even start) There have been many times in where i start a match with a online player whose connection seemed good at first but became horribly slow making them look like they are teleporting in front of me which i can't even counter. I don't know why this happens but it need to be fixed(Which i doubt it will at least now)\n\n4. Bad matchmaking system: There have been far too many incidents of meeting the same player as i try to search for different players to fight. I fight a person great the fight's over i search for others find that same person over and over and over again to the point where i quit for a while in the hopes of having different competiton by the next time i play("But it's because online is dead for Street Fighter X Tekken PC version") while that may be true I've experienced the same thing on the Vita and Ps3 version despite there being lots of people online at the time. Often when i go online no matter the version i would feel like one of the only online players as i kept running into the same people constantly if only it had a filter button to filter out certain people i don't want to fight again it would help a lot with this problem.\n\n\nWhile the bad may outweigh the good I still think Street Fighter X Tekken is a great game gone too soon(Migrating it to steamworks and releasing patches that will buff the netcode might help revive it but i doubt that will happen) you can buy it if you like playing offline but don't even think about going online trust me(At least the PC version). I don't know if i should recommend this game or not but i will if only for the offline content(DLC ahoy!).","March 14, 2014","true","137.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In all, I do not recommend this game, and I definitely am not a fan of how they handled expansion characters, who traditionally would be unlocked by finishing the arcade mode.\n\nIn short, buy this game only if you are a huge fan of both series, and want to end up spending roughly 145$ to unlock all the characters, not to mention the completely gratioutious amount of DLC costumes...","April 7","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I dumped more quarters and more hours into those machines than I can even begin to recount, from SF2 to CE to all of the VS games, SFIII, the whole list. I've loved the entire franchise for most of my lifetime, put it up there with properties like The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy as my favorite games ever made.\n\nThis is the game that ended that.\n\nIt's not that it's even a terrible game. The PC port is pretty poorly optimized, sure, but the core of it- 2D twitch fighter light on abusive combos- is still there.\n\nWhat killed it for me was Poison. I'm sorry, but I'm a 35 year old married father now. I play video games as a bit of stress relief, a way to unwind. I'm not looking for some neckbeard's lewd fantasies in a $!%#ing fighting game. I'm as big a fan of scantily clad women as anyone (which may have a lot to do with the whole "father" status), but there's a time and place- and in the middle of a fighting game ain't it. The way this character is presented would be funny if it weren't so utterly grotesque.\n\nOh, and in-game purchases? Yeah, no.

I can just pick it up and play until I get bored. The fast fighting mechanics is really fun to master and Street Fighter mixing with Tekken is nostalgic all around. One obviously frustrating issue is Games for Windows Live but that's an entirely different argument although still a very big part of this game. For a while GFWL was down and I couldn't reach my save game. When I found there was an offline account option the issues were over. I like fighting games but I'm not the type to master them like some Korean kid playing SF4 constantly in his local arcade. SS4 was not fun due to the seemingly slower gameplay with more cartoon graphics and a very challenging system to learn before it's even remotely enjoyable. This game is much more accessible to anyone who wishes to casually play a fighter. Graphics are crisp but I'm not in to the comically absurd character design. A bit of smart button smashing can lead to a sweet combo and character switch for an even better combo. I recommend this to any on the fence fighting game gamers.","June 12, 2014","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of hectic, fast paced fighting that lowers the emphasis on footsies and includes cheap ♥♥♥ gems to help level the playing field, and lowers the exceution requirement in a smart way (which makes it easier to pull off crazy combos) then this is your game.

I don't know about $30, but for $10 it (was) a steal.\n\nCombat - Smooth. You can swap people in mid combo for devasting combos. Bryan hooks someone and throws them. Jack X jumps in and does a double fist pump knocking them in their air. This feels great to get off, and really rewards the player for tag teaming and makes them wish to find interesting combos.\n\nCharacter Roster - Great as hell to start off with. You get a solid roster of both Tekken and Street Fighter. Just don't play Hugo. Most characters(Minus Akuma and Ogre) have a partner.\n\nMaps - Eh, it's a 2.5 game unlike Tekken. The maps are nice and sometimes have funny(distracting) things in the background. Since it's 2.5, you can't really make the maps too innotative.\n\n\n\n\nNow to mention my dislikes:\nThe gem system is horrible. It's basically capcom saying "feed me money for a slight edge in combat ty ty...". You do get some free ones, but the better ones seem to be dlc. Why not do a system where you unlock them? Keep the DLC ones, but make it so you can earn nearly similar gems in combat.\n\nLack of modes. You have your typical arcade, verses, multiplayer, training, and challenge modes. Nothing special. Tekken is known for its many modes, while street fighter is more straight foward. I respect that. I wish it had a Story mode at least, as playing arcade over and over is only fun for so long. Imagine if they did a soul caliber-like quest system? You earn gems, customization items, and new paints and such for your characters by going through it. That's really optimistic of me to suggest that, but this game had so much potential for being one of the best fighter games.\n\nCharacter Roster: The fact you must buy a...$20 DLC(Was $6 on sale.) to get 12 characters that are already shown in game. Why in gods name should you pay $20 for 12 "ok" characters. I love Bryan, Cody, and Christie. They are great. But the fact they are already in the game but you can't play as them is a shame. The vita version comes with 4  extra characters. Why doesn't the PC get any?\n\nIt also is rather annoying that characters such as Alex, Fuerte, and Kunimitsu are teased merely as background props. Dan is even teased in the challenge mode. He tutors you.\n\n\nIf you prefer tekken(I do, but I couldn't resist a $10 street fighter game), then you may want to wait for Tekken X Street Fighter.\n\n7.5/10","September 30, 2013","false","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Anicade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JGAnicade/","54 products in account","Street fighter vs Tekken makes up for all of Street fighter 4 mistakes. They took the simple gameplay of street fighter 2, and added it to horrible art design. Chun-li should never have hands bigger than Zangief. Thankfully in this game. SvT adjust everyones design. Heads are proportionate to their bodies, and not overdone as much. That said the gameplay is where it shines. They did away with the simplicity of SF4, and instead has more of a combo based system in play. Naturally so the SF people can take on combo gameplay of Tekken characters. Almost a cross betwwen MarvelvCapcom and Tekken tag tournament. Combo fighting and switching characters mid fight as they share one life bar. The huge downside of course is the controversial idea of having half the roster locked on your game, and only available through dlc purchase. That reason alone i cant recommend this game as a disc buy. However, on steam when the game, and its dlc is on sale. I cant recommend it enough. Since Capcom is determined to shove an update of S4 at us every year. I havent played a good SF game since Third Strike. Looks like all they needed was some innovation to the usual SF gameplay. Also beaware youll need to either have or create a GFWL account in order to play.","February 15, 2014","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naioni/recommended/209120/","naioni","Who's that Pokémon?! - NaiOni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naioni/","630 products in account","Let's talk about the controversy around SFxT. The on-disc DLC. Dear oh dear, Capcom. There are a few problems with on-disc DLC, but there are also a fair share of problems with the arguments against it. We all know in what ways it's bad, so I won't get into that, instead I will debunk a few of the arguments against it, or rather, explain why it isn't as bad as one might think. Don't get me wrong, there's a huge moral dilemma here, but I am approaching this from an objective stand point.\nIn any game that has DLC characters and an online mode, there are only two ways to go about this. Either cut off the people with the DLC from the rest of the community, or force a download or install of the DLC for everyone playing online. If the games is to be compatible with other players online, you need to have the data of the DLC characters he has purchased to be able to fight against him. You simply can't load a model you do not have. You also need the data for the characters move-set to be able to be compatible. What SFxT did was to package this data with the disc. This included models and move-set data and in-fight audio, but not cinnematics. If it would not have been on the disc, you wold have had to install a day one patch with the content.\nThis brings us to my second point; this happens with literally every game with DLC on steam. When you install the game, it installs all available data for the game. All patches and all DLC. Buying the DLC simply unlocks it. This is again for compatibility.\nI think these are both valid points to take into consideration when you buy this game. However. There are two counter arguments. 1. Why have day one DLC at all? 2. Is it really OK for a fighting game, which is competetive in nature, to have DLC chatacters? This can throw off the ballance of the game drastically. It was terrible when they did it in UMvC3, and it is still terrible. And look what happened to UMvC3. Capcom lost the marvel liscence, and now you can't buy the DLC anymore. So there are people online with characters you can't get. If someone finds an exploit that favours one of these characters now, that will throw ballance out the window. Thn you've got a character that is impossible to unlock, that is supperior to the other characters.\n\nAs for the game itself; it's fun. I like it a lot. It is faster than SSF4AE, and the tagging opens up a lot of possibilities for combos. The one glaring flaw with the game is, of course, the gems. I don't know who at Capcom thought they were a good idea, but that person should be fired. There is no way to turn them off, and it can give advantages to players who bought the gem DLC. It's stupid, it hurts the competitive scene, and I don't like it. I'd say stick to the default set-up of gems.","May 5, 2014","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That app is dying though, so perhaps those problems will be solved when it rightfully craps out. If you want it for single player, I can fully recommend it though. As with all fighting games, make sure you have a game pad. Compared to Street Fighter 4, I pefer this, it just feels better made and the AI doesn't out and out spam you with cheap attacks all the time. 6/10 is my score. It's a competant Street Fighter game - a game which I think that I may be outgrowing because nothing ever changes, nor can it without ruining anything. The Tekken characters have simplified moves to fit with the aging franchise of SF, which may annoy Tekken players out there.","November 29, 2013","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's extremely addicting and fun to learn. Frustrating at times but that's expected. Personally, it's not as good as Street Fighter 4. I found this game easier to learn however with the few characters and the dumb gem system, some things should be here. There should be more characters, more arenas, unlockables, and more of a challenge. Beating hardest mode wasn't crazy difficult. So overall, yes buy this game if you love fighters or stree fighter. I don't know if Tekken players like this game because I am not one but assume they don't like it becasue it's a 2D figther. Anyway, buy this game. It's really good.

It's definitely much more Street Fighter than Tekken because there are no 'real' 3D environments and the moves are pretty much all Street Fighter style. Then again, this game is different enough from SSF4AE, so buy that one too.
