Has unlockable characters (armors actually) after certain point.\n\nI won't talking about technical things since this game is on Early Access at the time of this review written, and I believe the devs will try to solve every technical problems with all of his efforts.\n\nBottom Line: Buy this game to support the devs and the development of this game.","April 18","true","0.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

So I played the game. Must say It's pretty fun thought the control feels a little stiff but nothing you can't get used to.\n\nWhile I rarely do reviews. I felt that I should add my two cents. Cycle Of Tyrfing is a pretty fun / ok roguelike game that is easy to pick up and play. The Game looks nice I will say and it runs smooth which is great but a game is not a game without it's problems of course.\n\nThe things I disliked:\n1. Lack of screen resolution options\n2. There is a "chance" that while playing that you could enter a room with dead ends (which is a dead run) Not sure if this was a room that was overlooked during coding but this is some that can be fixed with a update.\n3. The yellow Orb. which "automatic recovers Magic and HP but your attack power is weak and enable double jump (If you have 30 attack power then get the yellow orb the it will drop by 5 Attack power. 30 - 5 = 25 attack power.  automatic recover HP is pretty slow while "automatic recover Magic" is a lie. It's broken as you have infinite magic and you can just spam the item. Again maybe a oversight.\n\nBut these are the "Only" things I came across and if I come arcoss anything new, I will let you know.\n\n~sonik","April 19","true","4.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

So, apologies if this isn't as good as my other reviews if I so happen to frget this is in EA.\n\nThe gameplay of Cycle of Tyrfing is reminicent to that of the old Castlevania games however it makes enough changes and tweaks to the original gameplay of Castlevania to make itself seem unqiue. Throught the game you will encounter different stones that contain different powers and these powers can help you defeat certain enemies and certain bosses. The boss fights are also done well as it forces you to memorise the attack patterns of the boss fights in order for you to beat the boss correctly and more efficiently than if you just button mash attack them and hope that you win. It pays off to memorise the patterns, that's my tip. People tend to have complained abut poor mouse & keyboard support and ,like I said in the interview, I personally fealt that the mouse and keyboard controls were ok but I have been known to adapt to bad cntrols. If there are alot of people complaining about the controls however, I do recommend to Demon Sword that they should add in rebindable keys which I believe he is doing now, as he said in the intrview. However there is one complaint about the gameplay that I have but then again it doesn't really count towards the gamplay but more as to the fact of how you play, I'm talking about the options menu. The options menu, in it's current state, seems quite bare bones. There is sound and enhance performance and that's just about it. I would really like for there to be a screen resolution option in th options menu as when I was recording gameplay for this, my recording system didn't go along well and I believe this has something to do with the resolution as it isn't detecting it as a game, it's detecting it as a window. There is also no full screen option implemented into the game yet either but, like I said before, Demon Sword claims that he is working on implementing these options into the game so I'll let that slide.\n\nThe story is told through comic strips which relly adds into the immersion that I was feeling throughout the game as I fealt like I was controlling a comic (the action parts of it anyway.) The story isn't exactly anything unique because it's the same sort of story that we're all familliour with. An evil army is built, our hero must destroy them.\n\nThe graphics are good for the most part. The background art is AMAZING! I can tell that alot of time and effort was put into the backgrounds because they look beautiful. Enemies look good as well and there were alot of creative designs used throughout the game. The one complaint I have is the main character. I'm not screaming about sexism before someone disregards it and I'm not criticising it about that either. The design is good but the animations for the main character look stiff and unnatural and there was a slight blur tint added to when she runs which I wasn't a huge fan of either. But the graphics and designs are ,for the most part, good.\n\nThe music composition, I know that Demon Sword has a kickstarter campaign in order to make his own composition for the game but personally, I think that your own unique composition will be great but, if you're unable to get your own composition into this, I personally would think that the music would be fine as it is. I'm not saying "Don't add your own composition in" I still think you definately should because it would definately improve the sound in the game but all I'm saying is that if you're somehow unable to get your composition into the game, I still think the game will be successful.\n\nI'm not going to give this game a final verdict yet because it's still in early access. I will give a final verdict when this game is released however. Here is the link to the kickstarter project the dev is doing and all I can really say is "keep up the good work": https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1830282408/cylce-of-tyrfing?ref=nav_search\n\nSteam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","April 25","true","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagespartan/recommended/429430/","kagespartan","Lord Crocosquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagespartan/","881 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is the sort of game that I wouldn't play normally. After it came to my attention (rather sideways), I saw it looked better than the average Early Access game.\n\nThis is a point in it's favor, much as it shouldn't have to be. Early Access should have lots of quality games like this one, rathder than the usual crud that seems to collect there (and in Greenlight) these days. As a reviewer, I haven't done a lot of these games, but after a good look at it, I simply had to ry it and try and find a way to tear it apart.\n\nI failed. Not in playing it, which I did rather nicely-- in tearing it apart. There have been a few things in the Discussions that people have complained about, and I didn't run into any of it. There's a tiny amount of controller lag, but not enough to create problems even for people that don't like platform-y action hacky-slashy games.\n\nThe only real gripe I have with the game is the controller information image that's displayed on one of the loading screens-- it would be nice to have that available to people using controllers from the escape menu or someplace else where they can refer to it rather than a quick peek and gone to who-knows-where forever.\n\nThe game is good at tutorializing in an unobtrustive, easy to ignore fashion, but after awhile it goes away and if you've put it down for awhile and come back, it might be a tad difficult to pick up again. The progression elements are quite nice, and all of the pickups are easily identified and have functions with the exception of a gold-colored pickup that I never found out the purpose of.\n\nThis was the second game we covered in the stream, and for my money it was an excellent buy. It's one of the rare games I want to play more after the review. It was easy and intuitive to pick up and play, and the difficulty curve wasn't steep enough to frustrate, but it did provide a challenge as I got further into the game. Never enough to make me want to uininstall it, but enough that I didn't feel all-powerful.\n\nSome people will find the first couple of levels incredibly easy, especially if they have a lot of experience with this sort of game. I don't, so your mileage may very. The main character is yet another draw-- not in the way she's dressed, but in the history of the character that the game is based on, and the bits of lore that surround the Tyrfing Cycle (which is a proper Norse legend).\n\nGrab your favorite control method and some popcorn, fire the game up and enjoy. For even the full price of $8.00 US, the combination of solid gameplay and pretty 2D graphics that evoke the culture from which they were derived is worth that and more. The dev is repsonsive, and is trying very hard to get reported issues dealt with in short order.\n\nMy thoughts on the game in more detail are in the video below (including footage of me sucking at it).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEfxVrAqgKs\n\nAfter this review was posted, Mellow_Online1 and I had a chance to sit down live on the air with DemonSword, who was kind enough to invest a couple of hours of his valuable working time to talk to us about the game and the game and the way he designs games. He responds to the good, the bad, and the ugly for us.\n\nThe video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjPHCMSFN_w","April 23","true","1.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","5"

It does feel like this developer is trying to do something good and make a fun game, however at its early access release right now, it sadly isn't a game I can recommend for purchase at it's $7.99 USD price tag.\n\nMain problems with this game are:\n\n1) Right now, there is no graphic settings available in the options at all.  No resolution settings, and not even a full screen off/on setting.  This means that I'm looking at a window about half the size of my default 1920x1080 resolution and I would have to change my computer video settings to match the game just to have it full screen!  Ugh.\n\n2) Another complaint I have is that using the keyboard in this game, while it can be done, just isn't a satisfactory option.  A controller is almost a MUST to really be able to play this game effectively, at least in my opinion anyhow because the keyboard controls just feel awkward and out of place.\n\n3) My biggest complaint with the game itself is that your avatar feels like a weightless paper doll just moving over a background and this makes fighting and hitting a monster unsatisfying.  The floaty movement and feel of your avatar and the monsters as well also takes away a lot from what I feel like could be good gameplay.\n\nAll in all, right now in early access, as much as I want to like this game, I just cannot recommend it until more updates and work has been done to this game, and well... that's what early access is for.  My recommendation is to wait on this one and see what it looks like mid summer 2016 to fall of 2016 and if progress has been made and the game at least has a fullscreen option, then perhaps it will be worth it's price tag at that point.\n\n3 out of 10 is my score considering the value and price of this game at this point at the end of April 2016.","April 24","false","0.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","2"
