Not even worth the .99 price tag.\nThe barbaric saving system and extremely limited UI will give you a blast from the past, all the way back to the late 90s. I would like to see some of that get fixed, because as I said I believe the game has good intentions.\nThis game is certainly nowhere close to being called "finished", and I understand that. However, if the creators do not decide to apply some extra effort to this game, I would not recommend getting it at all.","May 25","false","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

The soundtrack doesn\'t really add anything to the experience (if anything it could be worked on), but it\'s the gameplay that will require the user to have extreme platforming precision, timing and skill. The instant saving feature is extremely important to use, as you will die a lot in this game, perhaps more than you ever would in the Dark Souls games (I know it\'s a completely different genre of game). Some of the platforming sections are extremely difficult (I get flashbacks of the original Rayman) That will require hours of trial and error. I am currently on Level 10.\n\nLogic Missile will test your patience, which is what any good puzzle game should do in my opinion. It\'s honestly refreshing to see a challenging game in an age of overly \"hand-holding\" games that are released. For 99 cents, I think this game is definitely worth taking a crack at if you are a big fan of retro-style platforming puzzle gameplay.","June 1","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
