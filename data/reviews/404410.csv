"Comply" or "Now do the karate move". I stared at it. And it stared back. For what seemed like eons I watched it. It was seducing me. It was corrupting my morals and everything I hold dear.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leadprophet/recommended/404410/","leadprophet","Eschaton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leadprophet/","107 products in account","NOTE: This is a very old review. I have also been negatively involved with the developers and parted ways with the project since then, so I will not do a followup review as I think I would be unfairly biased. You should probably go look for more recent reviews than this one.\n\nEndless Sky is a straight up ripoff (with several excellent additions) of the Escape Velocity series - and that's a good, even great thing.\n\nCons:\n- Economy is static, not dynamic like in EV\n- I'm pretty sure the ships just fly around; they don't affect the economy either. For example, you can't ever clear a sector of pirates; new ones will always spawn to take the old one's places, sometimes right before your eyes\n- Enemy AI is incredibly stupid; I've had pirates with only missile launchers chase me down even after they expend all their missiles, which means I get a free kill\n- It is definitely possible, especially early in the game, to get auto-ganked by huge mobs of enemies as soon as you take off from a planet, before you even have a chance to see what awaits you in space. Since there's no skill, just dumb luck, this is quite frustrating for people like me who try to get through games like this without save-scumming as much as possible.\n-Besides the rebel plotline, it's really hard for me to find any of the other plotlines. I had one other plotline offer, but I was really hoping to ally with the Republic and I have seen no offers from them at all - which sucks since you need their military license if you want to buy their ships.\n-There are no pirate-customized ships on sale, even on the worlds that explicitly say they are for sale.\n\nPros:\n- Combat pacing is perfect\n- Progression feels good\n- Visuals are a step up from EV:Nova\n- Autopilot for landing, shooting, and multi-jumping is very good\n- The balance between speed, power, and heat means there's a lot of thought to put into customizing your ship\n- Customization of your ship is properly encouraged within limits; it's possible to have a "millenium falcon" type ship\n- Ship boarding actions are hugely improved from the EV series\n- Game is in a very stable and efficient state already\n- Mortgages and Crew mechanics are a great addition to make management of your liquid assets more complex\n- Fleet commands are of course a welcome improvement\n- There's plenty to explore and even late into the game I feel like there are more secrets that I will uncover with proper detective work\n- Game is open-source, free, and fully cross-platform. It doesn't get better from a licensing standpoint.\n\nThe Weird:\n- You never have to pay for fuel. At all. Yet much of the economy is apparently based around deuterium fuel processing. This makes zero sense, but I'm not yet sure whether it's a good or a bad thing for gameplay.\n- You seemingly can't buy any equipment to improve the quality of your long-range (on map) scans\n- Events happen, but I've yet to see any planets trade hands even when factions are at war. The game FEELS very static.\n- Every action takes exactly 1 day. You have no option to spend more days on a planet, just to use up time, and no matter how long the jump is, every hyperspace jump takes 1 day.\n\nThe Wanted:\n- A news feed\n- Distinction between privateers and pirates; faction-aligned privateers only prey on certain non-faction ships\n- Dynamic, persistent economy - ships should have real lives, taking jobs on worlds. If they die, they die. If no one takes a job, it stays there until someone does take it. If food gets dumped on a planet, then prices of food should plummet after the sale. Every planet should use/produce stockpiled resources at a certain hidden rate to determine how fast that depreciation recovers/occurs, and the planets should spawn new spacecraft at a given rate depending on their population.\n\nWonderful game with a long, long future ahead of it.","November 20, 2015","true","12.2"," 116 of 120 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","116","120","6","13"

If you do not know this series, much of the information here won't be as relevant, but should still give good insight as to what kind of game it is.\n\nFor the sake of comparison I will be using a Pro's and Con's list.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPro's:\n*Gameplay has been made significantly smoother compared to the EV games.\n\n*Travel is a breeze now;\n-Landing is done automatically.\n-Jumping through multiple systems only requires a single command.\n-You can initiate a jump from anywhere in the system.\n-Simplified controls.\n\n*The dialogue, port info and item descriptions are well written and fit in perfectly.\n\n*A treasure of content in terms of places to visit, ships to encounter and buy, outfits to use and secrets to uncover.\n\n*You can have a LOT of ships in your fleet.\n\n*You can outfit every ship in your fleet seperately.\n\n*Once in space, everything seems to be real-time. Meaning that a fleet jumping to another system can be found back if you follow them there, and your own ships can be several systems away while you are "jumping" ahead of the pack. (You can avoid this by holding the jump button.)\n\n*More advanced, better boarding mechanics with more options and actual finiancial risks, such as "death benefits" you need to pay when a crew member dies.\n\n*Simple but lovely graphics.\n\n*It's obvious, but still worth mentioning: It's absolutely FREE!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCon's:\n*Occasional typo.\n\n*Sound effects could be better. The dev has this high up on his priority list, however.\n\n*No music. Great opportunity to put up your own tunes though.\n\n*Currently only the "Free Worlds" main plot is available, meaning story-wise the game is quite limited. I believe the dev is still working on more main plot lines.\n\n*Lack of a Bar or something similar.\nEdit: The Space Port acts as the Bar, but without a news function, betting function or hiring function.\n-Instead of hiring escorts, you buy or capture ships. (I see this as an improvement as you can customize your own ships.)\n-Instead of news you occasionally get a text pop up when entering a port explaining some current events across the galaxy.\n\n*Doesn't seem like taking a loan will ever be worth the costs.\nEdit: It's worth the costs when using the money to buy more or bigger freighters, once you've found a good trade route.\nEdit 2: It can become quite tricky to balance out your loans' daily interest payment vs the gain in profit from increased cargo space. I stand corrected, this is not a con, it's a well balanced mechanic.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo...?\nI highly recommend giving this a try, whether or not you've played any of the EV games. There's something here for fans of RPG, Adventure, Exploration, Trade and Sci-Fi setting. If any of that interests you, don't let this one slip away.\n\n=== Review is subject to change without bias as I explore further in this universe. ===","October 31, 2015","true","9.3"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","53","57","0","1"

The sense of achievement of buying a new ship is great.\n\nFourth, difficulty (this may be a con for some people), this game has no mercy, if the game wants you death, it will spawn either a pirate flotilla or just a well armed pirate ship in the system just to destroy you.....yes this game is difficult as you dont know what to expect when entering a new system or leaving a planet, there is always the possibility of being  ganked by pirates.

Even if reverse thrusters were 1/4 as strong as the main ones, it would be much appreciated, and I think realistic; however, I don't know how difficult it would be to impliment that.

I'll explain why.\n\nThe short is: It's well put together for the most part; combat is little awkward but mostly avoidable. It is free, but seems to lack an end-game goal.\n\nOh, and if you do start, get the Cargo ship first. Consider the others once you're out of debt. In the Trading screen, hold Shift, Ctrl, or Alt to buy/sell multiple items at once.\n\nThe long is:\n\nFirst the good stuff:\nPrice: I don't know their intent with the game, but it is free. I've not found any kind of microtransaction BS, so it is completely free. Hard to argue with that.\nFew bugs: I shouldn't have to count this as a good point, but with the market as it is...\nAutosave: VERY frequent. Should the game crash or you get killed, it will send you back maybe a minute or two of playtime.\nYou can build a fleet of ships, rather than just having to upgrade one giant ship. There is some control in the orders you give. I still recommend only having a fleet of very big ships, and sticking to one ship until then.\nIt isn't hard to build up money after the early game.\nEverything has a 100% sell value. So if you buy stuff by mistake, it just costs you a second to correct it. Goods change value by planet, but equipment and ships don't, so buy and sell those wherever.\n\n\nThe bad stuff:\nMouse control for direction and shooting is unavailable, but would have been nice (I'm thinking like SPAZ).\nYour fleet isn't good at staying near you if they are freighters. So don't buy small ships for your fleet, they are pirate bait. Big ships can at least survive long enough to resolve the situation (regroup and kill, run away, land on planet, etc).\nIt is very easy to miss the storyline (I did) when trying to make a quick buck early on.\nThe economy doesn't evolve. Values in each system stay exactly the same. While this does make things easier, it also removes any incentive to find new trade routes when you have a good one. This also means the jobs don't really evolve, so the stuff you see early on is all that will be there.\nEach solar system feels tiny. You warp in next to the planet, and... that's pretty much it. Everything happens within sight range of a planet, so each system feels tiny, and all systems feel identical when you're flying around.\nYou start in debt. I realize this is part of the point of the game, but it feels weird having that weight hanging over our head for so long when jobs pay very little.\nYou can't switch between piloting different ships in your fleet.\n\n\nThe game doesn't seem to have an end goal, so you kind of have to set them for yourself. "Ok, I'm in debt. Let's get out of debt", "Ok, I'm no longer in debt, let's get a ship that doesn't suck". "I've got a decent ship, let's get the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the Galaxy". After that, uh, I don't know, keep going? Get a fleet I guess?\n\nGetting money is also a grind. You start off in debt, which means your #1 goal is to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible, because if you don't you'll run out. Running goods from system to system is probably the easiest and most boring way to do this. Once you get out of debt, it's all profit though. I mainly stuck to cargo runs, which does appear to be the fastest way to get cash, once you have some decent capacity.\n\nThe pirates are just random enough to be annoying but not consistent enough to be a threat to plan for until very late in the game. With your first ship it really is just a crapshoot if there is enough friendly ships to kill the pirates before they get you. Even with mid-size ships it is far better to run away than try to fight. Big ships can stay and fight, but it is still usually easier to just run away. If you're making money cargo-hauling, don't even bother with weapons until you have a super freighter or a Behemoth, and even then I'd say wait until you have two of them, because you can still just run away.\n\nVerdict: Above average\n","November 7, 2015","true","14.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

Basically your general buy low and sell high principle with missions and a couple other factors.  This makes the game very easy to pick up and enjoy within the first 10 minutes which is a luxury you don't have with most games.  It's not the prettiest game I've seen, but the low spec requirements make it playable on any system.\n\n\nPros: -Decent economy sim\n-Large variety of planets and solar systems; the map is huge\n-Some customizability for space ships (weapons, engines, etc.)\n-Can be addicting\n-Simple UI\n\nCons: -Not enough customizability with ships, both aesthetically and functionally\n-Tedious at times, sometimes it feels like nothing's really happening.  You have to grind to get the necessary money to purchase bigger and faster ships, whether that be by destroying other ships or being a merchant.\n-Annoying animation when you make the jump to another solar system.  Rewatching the animation, though it's only 5 seconds, can become irritating after a while. I realize that that's nitpicking a little, but it'd be nice to be able to skip that animation.\n\n\nAll in all, it's definitely worth it to check this game out.  It's a good game to kill some time, and best of all, it's free :) I haven't explored all the features of the game yet, which I suppose is a good thing! There's a ton of potential with this concept, and I'm interested to see what the developers can do to make this game even better.","December 24, 2015","true","7.9"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","2"

NAEV and Endless Sky.  NAEV has some people doing a great job (also a great game), but with much slower development.  Endless Sky is very polished, very content rich and has a lot of UI features none of this line of games ever had.\n\nEndless Sky is the kind of game I'd have made if I had the motivation and energy.  The fact that it's moddable is just fantastic and I hope it encourages a number of interesting mods in the future.\n\nI often spend small quantities of money trying out games on steam and didn't even realize until revisiting the store page that this game is FREE.  Holy cats.  I'll need to post a donation to the game devs.\n\nGood things:\n\n1) The turn based boarding mechanic is a wonderful way to add an interest to boarding operations without it consuming much time or interfering with the central feel of the game play of piloting a starship.\n\n2) Good ship progression.  I see some complaints of a slow/humble start.  I did experience that a bit.  The game does reward doing fun things like combat and piracy and tends to discourage focusing too much on trade or missions.  Once you get over the hump you start moving right along.\n\n3) Better shield regen is VERY nice for things like demanding tribute from planets.  In the old EV games, particularly Nova, it reached a point where your shield regen was basically how fast you could kill ships and you spent tons of time kiting and waiting.\n\n4) Kiting is less rewarding.  The ships turn and lose interest and often come at you at different speeds forcing more variety to how battle large fleets.  You're more likely to duck in and out of engagements with heavy ships and pull back to lick your wounds.  Also anti missile prevents waiting out long barrages of missiles.  A good improvement on EV style combat mechanic all around.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1) Battleships are god tier.  I tried so hard to make a lighter more maneuverable cruiser work, but in the end just wrecked everything with a shield beetle.  Probably hard to tweek the balance at this point, but it'd be fun to be able to get by on being 'dodgy'.  I'll keep trying a bit.  Not ruling it out completely yet.\n\n2) The lock on mechanics aren't great.  It uses a selection of always choosing the closest ship rather than selecting from what you facing or cycling through promising opponents (if re-selecting within only a second or two try a different ship than selected).  So that annoying fighter behind you robs your lock from the ship you actually want to strike.\n\n3) You can lock a target and spin to face it automatically.  I'm less into that.  I'd like to be forced to maneuver and fire with my perhaps my turrets and guns veering towards the target to the degree that each is able.\n\n4) Command points (ala Sword of the Stars) would be AWESOME.  As your notoriety grows or perhaps through some other means gain the ability to command more vessels and otherwise have a sort of fleet limit so that you have to be choosey with your ships used for end game content.  Perhaps a maximum of 6?  I see a lot of posts of people accumulating masses of shield beetles with shield regenerators to keep them alive and then enough weapons quantity to contribute to your killing.  Might be cool to limit that a bit.  Maybe command points are vastly more generous/more efficient for smaller ships as well?  Maybe you can have only one Heavy Cruiser as a command ship and all the others must be lighter?  Might need a good end game medium vessel to compensate that had some survivability.","April 24","true","56.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

It's a lot of fun running missions and generally trying to figure out how to make more money and do more things. I especially liked the non-intrusive and responsive tutorial at the start - the game as a whole really shines through its writing. I'm still enjoying running deliveries across the galaxy, so I can't vouch for the entire storyline, but the fact that there even is one that blends into the world so well is very impressive.\n\nI feel that the controls and mechanics could be more friendly - arrow keys were a surprise, as was the fact that ships in the 31st century don't have retrograde thrusters, and that you have to turn 180 degrees and thrust to stop. It's also a little jarring that you can simply jump into a sector to be absolutely demolished by a pirate cruiser, though loading from the previous save makes it no big deal.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game and I recommend it whole-heartedly, especially since it's free AND open source. The developer did a great job on this.","December 29, 2015","true","15.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/proberie/recommended/404410/","proberie","proberie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/proberie/","67 products in account","In the mid-90's there was a game called Escape Velocity released by Ambrosia Software, where you flew around in spaceships in a 2d universe, completing economic or combat based missions. I recieved a copy free copy of this game on a MacWorld Magazine disk and was immmediately hooked. I spent endless hours of my youth exploring the the Escape Velocity univerise. It's an open world, where you follow quests and decide which faction you were going to join and others that you were going to become enemies with. You could join the Confederates, Rebels, Pirates, or just remain an independent trader.\n\nEndless Sky is clearly modelled after the Escape Velocity series (Escape Velocity, Escape Velocity Override, and Escape Velocity Nova) and anyone who was a fan of those games should be playing this.\n\nThat being said, for me personally, Endless Sky brought back a lot of nostalgia from my gaming days in the 90's. Growing up I had a Macintosh computer, which really limited my computer gaming choices. There were the early Bungie games (Pathways Into Darkness, Marathon, and Myth 2) as well as Blizzard's Warcraft and Starcraft games. Bungie, Bllizzard, and Ambrosia Software were my three go to gaming companies and they all sparked my passion for gaming.\n\nEnough nostalgia, let's talk about the game. You start off with a trading ship and have to complete several trading missions in order to pay off the morgage you got for your first space ship. As the game goes on, you begin to explore the galaxy, earn more credits, learn more about the main plot, and eventually build and upgrade your ship. There appears to be one main storyline to this game (as opposed to the EV series where you followed a certain faction's story line) but you can go about it at your own pace. Some side missions pop up which also add an element of intrigue. All the missions require you to either take people/cargo somewhere, to fight other ships, or analzye something. At both the beginning and end of the mission there are no cutscenes but instead you read and sometimes make decisions on what was said.\n\nThe combat is a bit difficult to get used to at first and you'll need to buy another ship and upgrade a bit before taking anyone on. The first few hours playing this, not unlike my high school days, I always got my ♥♥♥ kicked. If you keep grinding out the trade missions, you'll soon have a ship to be reckoned with and can go face to face with everyone who wronged you. Also you can hire a fleet of ships to help fight along side you although you'll have to pay them x amount of credits to retain their services.\n\nI've played this game for several hours and it has kept me entertained and curious on how the story line will unfold. It's not ground-breaking at all, sometimes I got lost trying to figure out where the story picked up at, and the game is outdated graphics-wise but I'm recommending it.\n\nI'm also looking forward to the user created mods. Escape Velocity had a similar editor where there were a lot of great user created mods released for free and kept the game new and exciting after you exhausted the original game.\n\nIf your curious, give it a shot. You got nothing to lose but time - it's free.","November 11, 2015","true","7.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I didn't then, and still don't know if the similarities between the two games are intentional or not, but they are absolutely there. I have only played the game for a couple of hours so far, but it still feels like it is nearly the same game.\n\nIf you've never played any of the Escape Velocity games, I would go so far as to say that you missed out big time on those. There is good news though! This free game is a way to (kind of) rectify this!\n\nNow, obviously I am biased because the game reminds me so much of another title that I enjoyed. However, there's a lot of reason to like the game because of that. You start off in a sandbox universe that you can pretty much do what you want in. Do you want to earn your keep by transporting passengers around? You can do that. Perhaps you want to trade goods and earn your money through piloting a freighter. Well, you can do that too. Do those sound too similar? Well, then perhaps you should go hunt pirates instead. Don't want to hunt pirates? Then maybe you should BE a pirate. You can do that too.\n\nI haven't gotten far enough into the game to really comment on the story, but if it occurs the same way it did in Escape Velocity, it will happen over the course of your gameplay, and will tailor itself to you based on what you are doing. That means of course, that seeing where the story can take you will require experimenting with different playstyles. Now obviously this is just a guess, but the rest of the game is similar enough that I would be surprised if the story elements didn't function the same way.\n\nI would say that, as a gamer, you are doing yourself a disservice by not trying this game. Especially considering it does not cost you anything but time to do so. A lot of people comment on the game being free, and you will see why everyone seems so surprised this does not cost anything once you load it up yourself.\n\nEdit: Typo correction.","October 31, 2015","true","38.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

I'll be making dated additions to this review because the game is still in development.\n\nEndless Sky is pretty amazing if you can find the main plotline.  After I found it, the mysteries and plot twists kept me coming back.\n\nThe game takes place in the far-future of humanity.  By the year 3013, humans have colonized a great deal of the galaxy.  You, as the player, have always wished to head into space and pilot your own spaceship.  Unfortunately, not long after your dream begins to come true, a horrible catastrophe makes galactic civil war almost certain.\n\nPROS:Autosaves between planet landings, you NEVER lose your ship permanently\nAutosaves before vitally important plot choices\nSnapshot-style save system: you are able to redo quest choices over-and-over by saving before making a choice\nQuick response time when controlling your ship\n(Nearly) unlimited potential ship configurations (weapons, engines, shields, etc.)\nAttractive planet graphics and planet surface photographs\nMany planets to visit, all with various kinds of political and social climates\nPlot twists and unsolved mysteries\nAnyone can make suggestions and potentially help to add content to the game: https://github.com/endless-sky\nEven if you don't want to add any official content, mods are always welcome\nHelpful community\nCONS:Not many detailed side quests in addition to the main storyline\nRepetitive gameplay\nIt's possible to miss the main storyline for a long time, if you don't explore the right areas of the galaxy\nOf the three faction-based main storylines proposed, only one of them is currently 100% complete\nEITHER: (aka. points that may be +/- depending on your likes/dislikes)Gameplay takes place entirely on a 2-D plane\nAll of the plot is text-dependent\nThis is a one-dev project, he has the final say-so on changes made to the game; but he also takes good suggestions seriously\nThis game is a work-in-progress\nOverall, this game is what you make of it.  You can play the role of pirate, bounty hunter, renegade defender/pirate ship looter, rebel, or just a simple merchant/transport captain.  If you're stuck, there's a kind community around this game that's willing to help.\n\nI'm looking forward to what the future holds, because Endless Sky (so long as it's being developed) can only get better!","May 7","true","118.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I just spent a whole day playing this and I couldn't put it down - such a huge time investment!  :)\n\n\nAnyways - this game might have sold me on 2D game development being superior to 3D (focus on gameplay rather than 3D spacial arrangement).\n\nThere's a really good learning curve.   I felt great satisfaction when the lights come on how some part of the game works.\n\nThen there's the "futzing".  Futz futz futz.  I can stare at a ship build and go back and forth and back and forth "1 of these or 2 of those or 3 of the other?" trying to tune the ship to work *just right*!  Its comparable to Star Ruler's ship building screen, only here you have to fly the thing and it feels that much closer to the metal.\n\nYou start play with a bank loan which will sap all the money you make.  There are ways to "hide" the money and miss loan payments but then your loan size increases due to interest.  Anyways you come right out of the chute with your hair on fire, so to speak, and it is really satisfying to get the loan paid off.  It felt "grindy" during that phase of the game, because you know the starter ship is crap - but the mechanism is believable and compelling  (i.e. rewards aren't too high for doing tasks).\n\nLater in the game other elements come into play that provide really good tension, like capturing ships.  Especially when figuring out some ideal ship-build or fleet-build strategy.  I lost my whole crew trying to capture an enemy ship, and I thought we were well armed.\n\nReplayability is also very high, since once I figured out how some components worked, I wanted to start the whole game over again and try to play a better opening!  Also the concept of compounding interest may come into play, depending on whether this strategy is used...\n\nLastly - the game is remarkably polished.  It's like it is setting the standard for paid-for games, and it's a high bar indeed.\n\nGreat game.  You should try it!","November 2, 2015","true","27.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was making a bit of money on top of paying off my mortgage by transporting goods and people (mainly tourists) around the galaxy. In the middle of a couple of jobs, I landed on a planet in what seemed to be a quiet system with no ships in sight. I checked the job board on this planet hoping to find a small job to complete on the way, but considering my almost full cargo, I wasn't surprised. I then departed from the planet to find myself in the middle of a massive firefight with ships almost 10 times the length of mine. I quickly intitalised the jumpdrive autopilot, praying that I would be able to escape. There was nothing I could do as one of the pirate ships noticed me and fired a couple of missles at me.

The ships range from tiny to massive, and their handling changes as well. Great selection of stuff to customize with that forces you to balance heat, power generation, and ship handling with the amount of weapons or cargo you want to carry.\n\nInteresting world: this game has a LOT of lore to dig into if you want to find it, or you can just take it as it is. up to you.\n\nEasily moddable: I haven't installed any yet, but mods take the form of plugins that you just place in the appropriate folder, and its designed for you to be able to change things easily.\n\nOpen source: You can help make this game.\n\nLow system requirements: anyone with a PC can play this pretty much\n\nCons:\n\nOnly one minor downside\nStill in development: while there are benefits to a living game, one of the downsides is content with some loose ends to be filled in later. This also means there are a few minor bugs here and there. If you're reading this after 1.0.0 then this will probably be  a non issue, so download this awesome free game.\n\nAny other issues I've had are already on the list to be fixed, so don't worry about that.","April 6","true","69.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A nice mix of combat, exploration, and non-combat jobs. So, when starting a new game, you get a choice between a Shuttle, a Star Barge, and a Sparrow. CHOOSE THE STAR BARGE. While all three are pretty sucky and wimpy, the Star Barge is your best bet for earning the money for something better. Don't be tempted to get a Sparrow. It looks awesome, and it's designed for combat... or is it? It will easily be destroyed, and has little cargo/passenger space. So get a Star Barge, pick up the highest paying jobs available, and run like hell if a fight breaks out. You will, eventually, get the funds for better ships. So just hang in there. When you get the chance, I suggest buying a Behemoth class heavy freighter, and outfitting it for combat. You'll thank me later, as it is good at almost anything you'll need a ship for.","April 11","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After exhausting from "GameOver -> Load -> GameOver -> Load -> Repat", I simply just modify my save file (which is in txt form) and gave myself 2.5m shield, 500 gun/turrent ports (using python to generate all the gun 1 2 "Plasma Cannon") and 100k outfit space.\n\nAlso, at one point all I heard from the game is gun shooting sounds from my fleet thus I turned off the sound and start playing KPOP.

Everything starts out simple but things take a turn for the woese and then it's just a huge s***storm that's pretty enjoyable.\n\nWith that said, when you first make a new character, avoid starting the storyline since you'll die. You should amass a large reserve of cash by boarding and selling ships (it's fairly simple and there is a guide to it).\n\nALSO: with 16 GB ram, an i7-4790k, and a GTX 970 I had no trouble with fleet sizes below ~200. Once over 200, I had hige frame rat drops and the ingame CPU/GPU monitor typically spiked from 3%/2% to 200-600%/10-20% in very large fleet sizes. Though, I usually had task manager running through this and my ram never went above 4 GB and only 4 of my cores on my CPU were ever being used (not sure if the game uses more than one core but I saw activity on those graphs - could be from something else).\n\n","January 4","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JBrave/recommended/404410/","JBrave","JProX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JBrave/","34 products in account","Honestly, this game is so good, I feel like I stole it. It had been a refreshing break from other indie developers; all trying new formulas and gimmicks to make games seem "fresh". It's honestly refreshing that a developer was able to create a game, and polish what elements it had; instead of adding gimmicky addons to the game. This game doesen't lie about what it is, and does a great job at what it tries to provey.\n\nI'm not going to give you clear and cocise pros, and cons. Instead, I'll say that all this game needs is to be polished. Gladly, I haven't seen any major bugs; besides the lack of some content (ships that say they are obtainable, but require an item not presently in the game to obtain). But that's a part of the developing process. All I can hope for is that the developers go big on this game, and try to master the elements of this game further. Every loose end must be tied up before attaching any new strings.\n\nI'd reccomend it, as I inhaled a whole 11 hours of it within a day; and I'm not even all the way through to what I consider the end of the game.\n\nA message to the devs: as a consumer; you did a hell of a job. Some ideas once you tie up loose ends if you are thinking of continuing the project are:\nDynamic Events\nQuestlines\nSpawn rates of enemies in some zones are a little crazy. It's hard to live life stealing pirate ships if you have to fight 1v6 against ships greater than you. I mean; 1V3 is okay because it adds challenge.\n\nThanks for reading my review~\n","November 10, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

C'mon, it's free!\n\nA free game is always worth a look, and almost always worth a few minutes of play. At time of writing, Endless Sky has held my attention for eight hours.\n\nYou start out by taking out a high-interest loan from the bank and buy one of three ships - shuttle, transport, interceptor - and you can guess what each is for. I went for the transport because I was channeling Firefly and felt like pretending to be Malcom Reynolds. Once you start, it's time to get to work - that debt isn't going to pay itself!\n\nAfter the first hour, the gameplay is what it is. Pick up cargo from Planet A and take it to Planet B - sometimes as a mission, sometimes hoping to buy low and sell high, sometimes on a timer. You can even mix it up and carry people or escort ships. Alternatively, you can go hunting for pirates, or be one yourself and raid other ships.\n\nThe controls are what you might expect from a 2D space simulator - sluggish. If you've ever played S.P.A.Z. the controls will be familiar (and equally frustrating in a firefight).\n\nThe story will automatically unfold at specfic moments when you land your ship, and if you visit the spaceport at each planet you can potentially pick up story missions for one of the various factions in the galaxy or chance upon a unique mission (though it is almost always a variation of what I mentioned earlier). You can pick up jobs from the job board or, as mentioned above, figure out the price of goods at your destination and buy them cheaper at your location for resale.\n\nPut on some suitable music (there's none in game) and use your imagination as to why you care to build a fleet of ships.

It reminded me of the good old Elite, one of my fave games of all time. And that's the problem for me, ES is just too simple for today's standards and mainly played with two keys (J for hyperjump and L for landing, option for automated combat) while you trade/transfer cargo and/or passengers. Get some credits, upgrade ship, rinse and repeat. Storyline also midly interesting, not enough to keep me going.\n\nAs I'm already bored of Elite:Dangerous, which can be thought of as a modern and glorified Endless Sky, I could not recommend this game to anyone but hardcore fans and people with low specs equipment. It is open source (free), so give it a try and see if you like it.","April 7","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brightshine/recommended/404410/","Brightshine","Silverwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brightshine/","182 products in account","I randomly saw this on the front page of steam, then I saw it was free and was surprised! But moving on to the review and overall experience. But before getting to that, check out the Endless Sky site, it has good info you'll want to know when playing!\n\neasy review:\nPro:\n+A large universe\n+Plenty of ships to choose from\n+Plenty of shenanagins to get into (mostly fighting, escorting, and trading)\n+Definitley effort in describing each planet and lore (there are even holidays and events that happen on certain dates!\n+Moddable (right down to credits in a text file if you dont want to spend hours trying to get out of debt, but thats part of the fun! .... unless your a cargo/people carrier?)\n+Can be a sandbox if you want. (Not forced to do story missions)\n\nCon:\n- Sound effects could really use work (beam lasers and thrusters especially)\n- Lack of music (but that is what the steam music player is for?)\n- Uncommon graphical glitches (for my AMD graphics card at least). Extremely minor, just a flicker of a color (green or blue) for an instant, probably happens about once an hour?\n- Start off in massive debt (opening story), interest is very unforgiving. (not necessarily a con, but it makes it a rocky start).\n- Combat and flying takes getting used to (it feels awkward to me, as opposed to most other space games, I honestly thought it would feel closer to something like Starfighter: Disputed Galaxy)\n- Capturing ships is stupidly costly (Losing a single crewman and you are already paying 1/3 of the ship's worth, by the way, death benefits is calculated using the SHIPS WORTH, which is really really stupid and frusterating.)\n\nSory of my experience:\nYou start off taking a loan, a HUGE loan to buy a ship, you get to choose from a passenger ship, a cargo ship, and a combat ship. I personally chose the Sparrow. Named it the "Capt. Jack Sparrow" (the ship type was literally Sparrow) set off on an adventure and doing what seemed like tutorial missions with that guy heading off to retire! (good pay)\n\nQuickly realize I am getting milked dry from the ship mortage interest rate of 0.4% a DAY. Each system warp is a day, every time you land on a planet is a day, You have to make a good bit of profit to get out of debt! Choosing missions that are close and pay enough you get more money than you lose to make the trip (funnily enough escort missions are best for that to me!) Best part about escort missions? Who needs to fight? You can just spin up that hyperdrive with "J" and run like hell! Just watch all the bystanders and the navy mobilize to outright OBLITERATE any pirate who happens to give you a hard time! Ever seen a pirate dumb as bricks chase after you to the Sol system? I'd say you will, but he would be too busy dying within seconds! You wouldn't even get a chance to see his ashes! Tons of laughs for sure.\n\n*much questing happens*\nFinally made it out of debt! .... now what? Left directionless I just kept doing escort missions, saved up for a new better interceptor class ship! Bought myself a Beserker, instantly fell in love with it as opposed to my Sparrow!. I dubbed my new ship the S.S. Biscuit.\n\n*Some Escort missions later* Finally done enough to get better scort missions! Now instead of getting 15,000 or 20,000 credits per escort, I now get 60,000! however the ships turn like whales and are average sized freighters.\n\n*To be Continued* The story goes on ...\n\nP.S. They have a "cheat plugin" with tons of credits and all tech (Ships?) in human space. Enjoy.(for you sandbox lovers)","February 29","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It reminded me of the good old Elite, one of my fave games of all time. And that's the problem for me, ES is just too simple for today's standards and mainly played with two keys (J for hyperjump and L for landing, option for automated combat) while you trade/transfer cargo and/or passengers. Get some credits, upgrade ship, rinse and repeat. Storyline also midly interesting, not enough to keep me going.\n\nAs I'm already bored of Elite:Dangerous, which can be thought of as a modern and glorified Endless Sky, I could not recommend this game to anyone but hardcore fans and people with low specs equipment.

You live on a sparsely populated farming planet called New Boston, working in a textile mill. You've always wanted to leave, and have been saving for a Pilot's License since you were fifteen. When you finally have enough, you take out a loan and buy a starship. You have three choices, a cheap shuttle, a medium-priced cargo ship, or an expensive interceptor. From then on, you can modify your ships however you like, and get new ships with unique stats.\n\nSecond, it is configurable in plain text, meaning you can go into your save file or the game files themselves and change whatever you want. Creating a plug-in is EXTREMELY easy, as long as you can use Blender and GIMP, or have someone to do it for you (thanks, Positive!) The Steam community is very, very friendly.\n\nThe game may be confusing at first, but in the end it is a really great game, for free, too.","February 17","true","233.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

I don't stop looking at them as I use to do in other space games.\n- When you are in a system with asteroids... well, they look like popcorn to me.

You can try it and decide if you like it, without losing anything.\nYou start off with a loan and the choice of three different ships, after that you are free to do whatever you want. The game offers you a string of tutorial missons which show you the ropes of the basic playstyle of your ship, while gives you some small pointers as well.\nYou can have an entire fleet of ships which can escort you and you can issue them simple commands.\nYou can add stuff. While the game is in it's infancy I can imagine there will be a boatload of user generated content to it. And the whole thing should be easy to do as well.\n\nThe bad:\nUsing passenger or trading ships can become boring at first, as you only jump and land, and hope that pirates don't kill you. At least until you get enough money for a lot of ships (and crew) to guard you.\nThe controls are a bit hard to figure out without checking the preferences menu, and the game only shows them for a short time on the bottom-left corner of the screen. The ships have inertia, so combat needs a lot of getting used to.\nThe background during flight is rather bland (what else would you expect apart from stars), and the closeness of planets, while useful, make the entire area feel just bland and empty. The game also devoid of music, only having a few sounds for thrusters and stuff, making the game feel slower, so it can quickly become boring for those used to faster-paced games.\nThe game itself is not really hard if you know what you are doing, but there can be instances of getting swarmed with pirates after take-off and thus dying quite fast, especially when you have only a single ship.\nThe graphics are dull. Planets only show a single picture above their menu, while ships look like low poly 3d models. This however can be easily remedied with editing, so not that big of a problem.\n\nThe game actually have a story and while it doesn't immediately point you to it, it can be interesting. All in all while the game can feel like an empty sandbox with spaceships, made by amateurs, it is solid enough to be enjoyable. And also it's free, with the option to add stuff to it.\n\nTL:DR\nIts free, it's small, try it out.","October 30, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(Who, me?)\n-- It's free! No subscription required, needed, or existing. If you desperately want to pay money (o_O), too bad. There's no way to donate. :(\n-- You can play it offline. Unless you're using the Wi-Fi at your local overpriced coffee shop to play EVE, I don't see why this would matter too much, but hey.\n-- No real people, nice or otherwise. No scammers/trade hub spammers or price manipulators, but no amazing clan homies or complete strangers who give you 75 million out of the goodness of their hearts, either. You'll have to decide whether that's good or bad.\n-- Gankers are still around, though. Their being NPCs doesn't change anything. Remorseless pirates with serious superiority complexes? Same as ever. If you're playing with self-imposed hard restart... I pity you. Greatly. If you weren't completely insane before you started, you probably are now.\n-- No inflated prices, although some ships are pretty expensive.\n-- Banks are legitimate and actually trust you enough to give you a loan. Unfortunately, it's impossible to get one big enough to make skipping out and ruining your credit score worth it.\n-- There's a story, although I'm stuck at a certain point because my fleet isn't strong enough.\n-- Easier ship customization and cooler builds. (Crazy fast? Can do. Extremely hard to kill? You got it. No refueling needed? Quite right. Unscannable cargo hold? Indeed, my good man.)\n-- A much more casual, less intensive grind. (Endless Sky + trade route + music + relaxation = Endless Sky zen!)\n-- A surprising amount of stuff to explore and discover. While you may say, "But I can look at all the ships and outfit items from the Job Board!", those are only buyable ships and items from shipyards in systems that you've visited. So unless you've explored every nook and cranny of this huge galaxy (even the apparently inaccessible bits), that's not ALL the things. Nowhere close! There are alien ships available... they're just "not available in stores".\n-- It's open source. https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky Something you don't like or want to change? Make a plugin. Something you want to add? Go right ahead. Please. This game needs more! That is, unless you're scared of Git. No need to deny it. I don't blame you.\n-- Spreadsheets optional.\n\nTL;DR: If you like EVE Online but hate any of the following:\ndamage outputs\nweapon slots\npower and CPU balancing\ndecimal numbers\nfeeling like one of the poor and destitute 1%\nspending real money\nsinking all your free time into a game that, deep down inside, you hate\npeople\n\nthen try this game!\n\n-------------------------\nAdditional Notes:\n-------------------------\n\n[ship has tons of cargo capacity]\n[minutes of "clicklcickcliclcclicklicclkcliclkcliclkccliclkccliclkccliclkc..." at each end of trade route while buying trade goods]\n[eventually reads manual]\n"To buy more than one ton of a given trade good at a time, you can hold down the shift key (5x), the control key (20x), or both (100x). For players with enormous cargo fleets, the alt / option key (500x) can be used in combination with those other keys to sell up to 50,000 tons of cargo per click."\n[feels dumb for not reading manual]\nSeriously, read the manual. Even if you don't learn anything new, at least you'll know you're not doing anything terribly dumb, right? https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual\n\nOh, and don't root through the game files unless you're stuck or looking for spoilers. Even the filenames are spoileriffic.\n\nLooking for a good trade route? Try Food from Alioth to Denebola, and Medical from Denebola to Alioth.\n\nEven after you've found every alien ship, there's most likely still a ship left. It's supahsecret. You might have seen it flying around. Big, gray, and FAST.

Obviously created by some people who absolutely loved the Escape Velocity series but wanted a bit more. If you've played EV, the controls, gameplay, and star systems should feel, look and play familiarly. Good sci-fi trading game. Super happy it can be modded easily. 9.5/10 would be 10/10 if the sound bits weren't so choppy and harsh on the ears and speakers. I would pay money for this game - the fact that it's open source makes it that much more fantastic. Highly recommended for casual gamers.

Can't beat the price.\n2. Captures the feel of the old Escape Velocity series extremely well, with some much needed ease-of-use updates (such as being able to tell from the map what a system will pay for a given commodity, something you had to do by memory or with a notepad back in the day).\n\nCons:\n1. Piracy is not a viable option from what I can tell.  Even if you are able to disable a ship without destroying it (not easy in my experience), you only have maybe 3 seconds before some do-gooder tries to help you by blasting your prize into space dust.  If you do successfully manage to board a ship and attempt to capture it, you will very likely lose crew members in the process and end up paying death benefits.  Death benefits are, from my understanding, calculated as a percentage of the captured ship's value so you'll always make some profit if you sell the ship, but it can be too small to make it worth it.\n2. Combat itself needs a little work.  Large combats involving a lot of ships get chaotic and if your target is offscreen it can be next to impossible to track them on the minimap.\n3. There is a fair amount of grinding in the early game in the form of "deliver 12 tons of rubber goods to the Vega system" type missions.  That's true to the original series, but it's also not very exciting.  The good news is that if you're smart about it, that part won't last long.  I've seen a lot of people complain that you start the game with a mortgage on your ship, but if you trade intelligently and pick good missions (hint: plan your route efficiently!) you should be able to pay the mortgage off within an hour or so of play.  Once that's done, you should be able to work your way up to afford a decent ship not long after, and that's when things become fun.\n\nIn spite of those problems, it can be very addictive and will definitely scratch the nostalgia itch for those of us who remember EV fondly from back in the day.","November 1, 2015","true","32.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Who, me?)\n-- It's free! No subscription required, needed, or existing. If you desperately want to pay money (o_O), too bad. There's no way to donate. :(\n-- You can play it offline. Unless you're using the Wi-Fi at your local overpriced coffee shop to play EVE, I don't see why this would matter too much, but hey.\n-- No real people, nice or otherwise. No scammers/trade hub spammers or price manipulators, but no amazing clan homies or complete strangers who give you 75 million out of the goodness of their hearts, either. You'll have to decide whether that's good or bad.\n-- Gankers are still around, though. Their being NPCs doesn't change anything. Remorseless pirates with serious superiority complexes? Same as ever. If you're playing with self-imposed hard restart... I pity you. Greatly. If you weren't completely insane before you started, you probably are now.\n-- No inflated prices, although some ships are pretty expensive.\n-- Banks are legitimate and actually trust you enough to give you a loan. Unfortunately, it's impossible to get one big enough to make skipping out and ruining your credit score worth it.\n-- There's a story, although I'm stuck at a certain point because my fleet isn't strong enough.\n-- Easier ship customization and cooler builds. (Crazy fast? Can do. Extremely hard to kill? You got it. No refueling needed? Quite right. Unscannable cargo hold? Indeed, my good man.)\n-- A much more casual, less intensive grind. (Endless Sky + trade route + music + relaxation = Endless Sky zen!)\n-- A surprising amount of stuff to explore and discover. While you may say, "But I can look at all the ships and outfit items from the Job Board!", those are only buyable ships and items from shipyards in systems that you've visited. So unless you've explored every nook and cranny of this huge galaxy (even the apparently inaccessible bits), that's not ALL the things. Nowhere close! There are alien ships available... they're just "not available in stores".\n-- It's open source. https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky Something you don't like or want to change? Make a plugin. Something you want to add? Go right ahead. Please. This game needs more! That is, unless you're scared of Git. No need to deny it. I don't blame you.\n-- Spreadsheets optional.\n\nTL;DR: If you like EVE Online but hate any of the following:\ndamage outputs\nweapon slots\npower and CPU balancing\ndecimal numbers\nfeeling like one of the poor and destitute 1%\nspending real money\nsinking all your free time into a game that, deep down inside, you hate\npeople\n\nthen try this game!\n\n-------------------------\nAdditional Notes:\n-------------------------\n\n[ship has tons of cargo capacity]\n[minutes of "clicklcickcliclcclicklicclkcliclkcliclkccliclkccliclkccliclkc..." at each end of trade route while buying trade goods]\n[eventually reads manual]\n"To buy more than one ton of a given trade good at a time, you can hold down the shift key (5x), the control key (20x), or both (100x). For players with enormous cargo fleets, the alt / option key (500x) can be used in combination with those other keys to sell up to 50,000 tons of cargo per click."\n[feels dumb for not reading manual]\nSeriously, read the manual. Even if you don't learn anything new, at least you'll know you're not doing anything terribly dumb, right? https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual\n\nOh, and don't root through the game files unless you're stuck or looking for spoilers. Even the filenames are spoileriffic.\n\nLooking for a good trade route? Try Food from Alioth to Denebola, and Medical from Denebola to Alioth.\n\nEven after you've found every alien ship, there's most likely still a ship left. It's supahsecret. You might have seen it flying around. Big, gray, and FAST.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KansaiBene/recommended/404410/","KansaiBene","Tycho Brohe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KansaiBene/","76 products in account","While this free, open source game has a lot to be developed, it also has a lot of promise.  It's not a pure pile of a free game like many free games are.  It definitely isn't a F2P title relying on microtransactions.  The developer just realized he couldn't devote his life to making this game, and figured crowdsourcing it would be ideal.\nI am not far in yet, so perhaps I will be expelling massive frustration once I get to the point of trying to conquer the galaxy, but here's a rundown of what I see so far.\n\nYou start the game buying a ship thanks to a hefty loan hanging over your head, which you will spend the early part of the game paying off.  You have three options for a starter ship:\n1) A shuttle only good for transporting people around from planet to planet, along with some minor commodity trading.\n2) A cargo ship which is focused on hauling goods, and a few passengers.\n3) A fighter so you can jump right into combat.  It's transport and trading capabilities are limited, so you'll have to really engage if you want pay off that debt.\n\nIt seems like these ships correspond to difficulty settings, easy, normal, or hard.  However, I didn't find much difference in difficulty between the cargo ship and the shuttle aside from the fact that the starter shuttle can jump between one more system than the cargo ship without needing to refuel. Payouts for transporting people seems to be a bit slim compared to payouts for massive hauling.  There is something in the game about illegal goods, but I have yet to discover them, or maybe I did and just haven't been discovered hauling them, yet.\n\nPresuming you don't pick the fighter, the early game is about learning which systems need which goods and trading back and forth to rack up money so you can pay off that debt, and to acquire more ships.  One of the nice things is that you can acquire a second ship in your fleet rather early, with the debt still hanging over your head if you like, or just upgrade your ship to the next tier.  You'll need to hire extra crew to pilot extra ships, but that's far cheaper than the debt you are paying off.  Truth be told, the early game is really boring for a while.  It's just pick up a job/quest, buy some cargo, jump to the target system, sell cargo, repeat, with a lot of freedom in how you choose to make your money.  If you happen to run into some pirates, they'll likely destroy you, and you just reload and try again.\n\nThere is a story to follow, with only one campaign completed at this time, but progressing through the story is a bit random.  It requires you to land on certain planets in some sort of order, but I am not sure which planets or what order that is.  But hey, the game is open source.  If you want to see more depth, you are welcome to contribute to completing those other campaigns.\nAnother thing to do early on is explore all of the systems, so you can map out the galaxy and plan your routes easier, however many planets will sell you a local area map which eliminates some of that exploring for a fairly low price.\n\nThough it bears no resemblance at all to FTL (no entering the ship and micromanaging crew details), I feel it would make for a decent roguelite and I have been playing it as such, deleting my profile every time I die.  Ironically, that is more enjoyable for me, in spite of the fact that the early game is so repetitive.  Not sure why.\n\nAll in all, if you don't mind unfinished projects, and like the idea of being an intergalactic merchant, there's very little reason to not give it a try.","December 30, 2015","true","21.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I chose to start as a trader, and it's really easy for me to take on 20 missions at once and keep getting missions as I fly around completing them.\n-The descriptions and the detail put into it is great.\n-The idea of it being open-sourced and available to modify is great. I haven't tried it yet though.\n\nCons:\n-A bit of a confusing interface, and limited controls. When one of my fleet ships was disabled, I couldn't figure out how to repair it for a couple of minutes. I ha to beat off around 7-8 pirate attacks while I was trying to figure it out. A lot of those more hidden mechanics could be more obvious.\n-It's very confusing on what is mounted onto your ship, what isn't, and how each module affects the ship stats. I largely have only bought ships and put an extra cargo area on them. I'd reccomend putting a seperate window on the right side that shows the ship slots, and as you change modules, it also displays the changes in stats.\n-The game seems (so far) pretty limited to small fights and trading. It would be neat to have more space in between planets, allowing for ambush attacks and whatnot instead of jumping into a sector and immediately knowing whether there are enemies there or not. Things happen incredibly fast, and most of the time I die before I even knew I was taking significant damage.\n-After the short tutorial storyline, apart from a couple of things happening in the galaxy, I haven't been able to find the main stroryline again. Some subtle hints as to where it is would be nice.\n-Please, give me more control over my fleet's ships. I have had so many times where we're extremely far away from a battle, yet one of my ships insists on firing it's missiles and wasting credits.\n\nConclusion: I hope that this is not the end of development for this game. It feels complete, yet still missing a lot of potential. If this was paid, I wouldn't reccomend people get it unless it's extremely cheap, but as it's free to play, I would say that there's no harm in trying it out.","October 31, 2015","true","22.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you want to play EV Nova, GO PLAY EV NOVA - to this day, there is no suitable replacement for the original Escape Velocity games, and although Endless Sky comes close mechanically, it falls short atmospherically. The original EV games still hold up so if you are like me, with a hankering for that old EV feeling, you might as well just go play one of the originals.\n\n[EDIT: I feel like I should just amend my review to say that Sunless Sea is a great modern game which is mechanically (if not thematically) similar to EV Nova and does a great job with atmosphere and writing, just with boats instead of space]\n\nI was dying to play some EV Nova so I thought I'd try this game. It is a very accurate clone of many of the aspects of the Escape Velocity series, right down to the button labels and some ship designs, but somehow it doesn't all come together. Combat in Endless Sky isn't something you engage in, it's just something that seems to -happen- and then you either die or your enemies die. Every time I engaged in combat it felt totally binary, as if nothing i did tactically would alter my chances of win/loss. The game seriously needs to have its combat stats rebalanced to slow things down (esp. in the early game) and allow more drawn-out tactical encounters.\n\nI did very much appreciate some of the improvements to the map/mission/trading interfaces, they make buy-low-sell-high a piece of cake with their profit/loss tracker. BUT, after several hours I actually found this detracted from one of the things I liked about Escape Velocity - the writing. It was so easy to fall into a trading groove that I actually found myself not even glancing at the planet and spaceport descriptions, and I found that after 12 hours I hadn't absorbed any of the flavor of the universe. Every planet became reduced to a set of pricing data. It just turns into a game of how-can-i-make-these-numbers-bigger.\n\nMy recommendation to other gamers is that instead of playing this game, you just find a copy of EV and play that. My recommendation to the developer of this game is to find a way to slow combat down and recapture the tension of EV (where did escape pods / hardmode go?).","February 20","false","13.8"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","5"

I first want to just say that I give the developer props for trying but unfortunately, the game just isn't for me. I don't understand the complaints about the visuals but I do unserstand the complaints about the controls. They're a little clunky and slow. I would generally be able to look over that if the game brought more to the table but unfortunately it just doesn't. My biggest issue is the cost of mortgage and rewards from missions. Rarely does the reward for the mission meet the cost of mortgage and leave enough left over to make decent money. Not only that, but the majority of missions are cargo based regardless of your ship type. As a fighter, I found that I often wouldn't have enough space whatsoever for many missions. That directly plays into the rewards. Granted, as was brought out to me, fighters are best for working at enemy ships. Overall, I have to say that this game isn't worth it for me, but, you may feel otherwise.

It's on Steam so it's  open to criticism.\n\nBasically, this game suffers the same weaknesses as almost all other Github games. It was developed in an echochamber by entitled coder(s) with apparently little playtesting or outside player input, and the end result is a bunch of code that doesn't interact well. Lots of mechanics work against each other, and the game is barely playable as a result.\n\nThe problem with Github is that the average Github coder is a self-proclaimed creator who neither plays the game he helps create or listens to player input. The command structure is basic and not even the person who approves code merges bothers to playtest what he approves. As a result, Github games are always going to be barely playable messes. I liken Github to Communism: Wonderful in theory, completely dysfunctional and prone to failure in reality.\n\n>all enemies will shoot the player craft into disabled mode, but not destroy purposefully\n>pirates are completely ineffectual, random spawn mob enemies that die without accomplishment\n>there is no difference between police and military, all government vessels are massive warships\n>pirates only seek to disable other ships, nearly all other ships destroy pirates without attempting to loot\n>the random ship spawn mechanic is not remotely balanced\n\nWouldn't play if it wasn't free, and it's unfinished Github fodder that doesn't belong on Steam.","November 4, 2015","false","106.6"," 8 of 31 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","8","31","0","1"

Follow the yellow brick road that all the other planets are connected to?\n\nCause that REALLY helped, not, I kept following each and every one that the lines are connected to on the map and all we ever did was end up finding more pirates.   The hyperspace feature wouldn't stop going between the same places I've already found multiple times.\n\n\nWAY TOO TEDIOUS of a game.

I've played a few other games inspired by EV, but this is the first one I've actually liked. It captures the feel and mechanics in a way that very closely resembles my memories of EV. There are some minor differences, but nothing that really diminishes from the experience for me. In fact, some changes (e.g. loans/mortgages, being able to see what goods trade for in other systems, etc.) add to the experience. The game is free, open source, and (in my opinion) very enjoyable. If you're an old fan of EV, or even if you never got to experience it, I think you should give it a shot.","October 31, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played Escape Velocity a lot, then forgot about it -- only to now find Endless Sky on here. And it's on Github even, inviting others to help development. Absolutely love it!\n\nAs the only minor nagging point: I know the original dev of the game is against turning this into a multiplayer game (think I remember a comment of him to this effect). Personally, I'd love to see a small-scale multiplayer option though, say: a game session you can open that starts a universe with you and up to 3 of your friends. I believe this could add an entire new dimension to this game, without corrupting the original idea.\n\nThat said, even if this is never implemented (probably also not easy to do for a true free-to-play, open source game), I'd still happily recommend this game to anybody who enjoyed games like Privateer or Elite, and has a bit of a tolerance for comparably rudimentary, but functional graphics and design.","January 24","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only one faction is done and to even be able to do that one isnt very intuitive or easy. This really hurts the game, and makes me wish steam had a middle option.

For something free and 2D, this space sim is legitimately fun.\n\nPros:\nBuilding a frickin' fleet feels awesome.\nDecent storyline.\nFactions.\nVariety in spaceships.\nTrading system is decent.\nGettin' money, performin' a karate chop move on women.\n\nCons:\nCombat feels...dull.\nWhere is the story?\nWhat to do after I'm rich?\nWhat's the end goal?\n\nLet me praise this game for doing some things well; Trading is fun, making money feels fun, story is better than expected, and playing the game as a merchant/bounty hunter is really fun. Most of the game feels fun, but it lacks in some departments. Firefights? They feel...meh. Keep back and shoot missiles or get in their face with a huge ship and turrets. I don't know what else to say besides it feels pretty meh. Next, where is the story? Everynow and then, I'll encounter a mission, but then, nothing. Days, weeks, months go by, and there's no story missions to be found. Without them, the grind goes on and on and it feels like all my progress has been for nothing. Story missions should be closer together and easier to find and do, otherwise it leaves the player without a sense of purpose, which leads to, "why am I even playing this?" Also, if you don't get that thought, you'll be at a point like me, with a ton of large warships, and nothing to do. Also, the biggest warships seem a little week. That aside, once you're on top, there's nothing to do afterwards. I haven't "beaten" the game, because I know there are story missions that I haven't found. I'm just stuck, and that's what it feels like the entire game has been building to.\n\nCriticisms aside, the game is still fun, for a while. The developers seem to be hard at work, there were new ships within a week after I started, so I think that's awesome. The game is worth following, and playing, but after a while, you may find yourself stuck, with loads of money and nothing to do. It's boring, and the issue should be tackled soon. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. My sincere regards to the devs for making a great game like this.

However, right now it really lacks the polish that would make it fun.

Heck, even the asteroids move too fast. Combat is ridiculously fast, too.

However, there is a huge issue that I just can not ignore, witch is that lack of ships, planets, major missions, and upgrades. I have played Escape Velocity many times, and it too had the exact same problems, but it is not just that. After grinding for hours to get a good amount of income, I have found myself to a point at which doing anything other then trading was almost pointless. Other options to gain income never seemed to make sence with a good traiding rout.\n\nThe Job postings are not that fun to begin with, so realistically why would anyone do them if they serve no other purpose then that of a good trading rout. The space port missions are the only thing that allowed me to want to keep playing, as that is the only way to gain access to certen items, ships, etc. If there was something that Job postings could offer in the game that a trading rout could not, then that would deffinetly extend the enjoyment of playing this game longer.\n\nAnother thing that really just dose not have anything going for it is demanding tributes from planets. Other then the excitment of a bit of action in the game, demanding tributes of planets just dose not have a good enough reason to be done. I was hoping that there would be something more to it other then getting a few credits, but as it stands there really is no good reason to go through the effort of taking over a planet. Doing something like demanding tributes is just to repedative after awhile and the only reason I ever did it was to get rid of the hostile planets, so I could refuel on them. Like I stated before, it really serves no other purpose then that of a good trading rout.\n\nJust to make a point here, I keep bringing up trading as the only real good source of income only because it is the fastest and easiest way to make money in the game. I have always liked this about these kinds of games, as it always seemed to give me a good feeling of acomplishment when I watched the credits increse after each trade as I keep adding to my fleet. I know that the options are there for different ways to gain credits, but the best way is through trading.\n\nThis game dose have a lot going for it, like the fleet that you can creat is nice added touch. All the ships that can be bought is deffinetly one of the main reasons I like this game (but a game could always have more). And the outfitting options on a ship seems like I can never get the best equipment (but the game could always have more of these too).\n\nIf you give this game a reason to have bigger ships, and better items then I will have a reason to keep playing and have fun doing it. However if there is no other reason to do any Jobs, or taking over planets aside from gaining credits, then after I get the best ship and items I can get, there will be no reason to contiue playing. This game is very fun to play, and I suggest anyone that has not played, to do so. I know this is a early access game so please do not take this post as anything other then helpful criticism.","December 28, 2015","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers did not create a new universe, they tried to imagine what the futur of mankind would look like if we were able to spread among the stars of our galaxy. You get to travel to real stars like Proxima Centauri, Vega, Aldebaran or Antares and there's more than a hundred worlds each with its own little background.\n\n-  The best part was the main story :\nWhat I really liked about the story is that you don't really choose to do the main quest. In fact you don't even start as the main character, you are just some random guy wandering trough the galaxy taking jobs and trading stuff. You encounter a few special quests here and there and then at some point the main story just comes at you and you get caught up in it, it took me several missions before understanding I had actually started the main quest.\nI found the story to be quite rich ans really interesting, there is even some plot twists and it is pretty long, it took me about thirty hours to finish it. And once you are done there is still plenty to do (but no spoil).\n\n- Last the ships and outfits, I was again impressed by the work behind it, I don't see this level of involvement very often in a free to play. There is a great variety of ships and outfits, each part of the galaxy sells different models of ships and unique types of outfits (better reactors, batteries, weapons, cooling systems, etc). It gives you a high level of customisation for your ship systems but it is also quite strategic since you have to deal with your energy consumption and heat production.\n\nI recommend everyone to a least give it a try since it is free and as for me I look forward to any future update.","January 4","true","80.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the game is rather text heavy (It could REALLY use some cutscenes), the core game is great, and offers lots of freedom. Want to be a space pirate and take over ships? No problem! Want to be a trader, making a fortune travelling between planets? You got it! Want to be an explorer, mapping out the entire galaxy? Of course! This game doesn't really limit what you can do and what you can't do.\n\nThat being said, the game could use a little tidying up. Many times, I found myself jumping into a system, only to see a laserfight take place for virtually no reason, so I just jumped out without caring. Other times I got stuck and tried to contact a ship in order to leave. only to then realize I was contacting an attacker. Maybe some color system could differentiate between friend and foe? I dunno.\n\nStill, this game is a blast, and considering it's free, I think it's definitely a fun little game to sink many hours into.\nI would recommend this game to anyone who wanted to simulate being a captain of a ship, or people who are really into sci-fi. If you're looking for fantastic gameplay - this game may not be best suited for you. It is much more of an immersive experience, that's based on the world you explore and the way you interact with it.\n","January 2","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even with my 6 hours played so far I have gotten a few screens. Ships are upgrade able to your liking.\n\ncons: No way to see the Outfits on your ship without looking in an outfit shop. No way to see bonus or loss of outfits for ships.\n\nLike added: View ship Outfits outside shops. Tutorial needs you to buy at least one local map. It helps you find routes without running out of fuel. Larger map at some point. Way to talk to planets. May be added just not unlocked yet.

This game isn't finished though so it's not the best it could be. The begining is kind of stressful but in a good way. Being in debt drives you forward and hooks you to the game. After that, your free. You transport colonists, do bulk and rush deliveries and even hunt pirates. There's also a great campaign hidden inside this game and it does not dissapoint. Not only do you get to experience large scale battles, you also do diplomacy missions and some escort missions as well. The Free Worlds campaign was my favorite part of the game and even after you finish its still fun to play the game.  I do wish that there were more missions to the campaign and even mini campaigns after where you make more cool technology and have systems join the Free Worlds diplomatically, especially the ones in the dirt belt. Also I'd like new Free Worlds Capital ships and even some light warships and interceptors too.  The campaign was hard but not too hard that it was frustrating. There should, however be more content to this game such as a dynamic economy, more ships, faction only ships (this includes pirates), a variety of new ship names, more campaigns such as a Syndicate or a  Republic campaign and that every hyperspace jump isn't a day. Also I think interceptors should have a power boost because currently its not even worth owning one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krynnymuffin/recommended/404410/","Krynnymuffin","Krynnymuffin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krynnymuffin/","126 products in account","This game is free. This game does not seem like a free game now that I've played a bit. I would totally spend money on it. BUT I DON'T HAVE TO! The fact that this is only a beta version just makes me even more excited for what's to come.\n\nNot to mention, the game is Open Source and allows for anybody to add new ships, weapons, missions or planets without even needing the source! Just check the description, there are links and stuff. I haven't clicked them yet, cuz I have my own projects to worry about, but you have a go at it.\n\nDespite the way the economy works, as it is fixed for each planet, I found myself enjoying trading a lot more than other rpg's I've played, and, for once, the game didn't force me to carry an entire arsenal of weapons to avoid having a bad experience. I found this game extremely immersive, which is great inspiration for a sci-fi story, or something, if you're interested in writing.\n\nHowever, one thing I cannot forgive this game for is it's writing. I mean, not in the whole game, mostly just one part in particular. Not even mostly, it's exactly just one part in particular. It's not necessarily a bad thing, nor did it ruin the game for me, it's just something I'm cherry picking because it really annoyed me at the time. SPOILERS IN THE NEXT BIT.\n\nAt one point in the game, as you enter space ports in the Free Worlds region in order to activate an event that starts the Free Worlds storyline, a woman approches you from behind and points a gun at your head and says, "Think fast, Captain." You have a choice to ask her what she wants or defend yourself, with some move you saw in a movie no less. If you defend yourself, you kick the gun out of her hand and harmlessly slap her shoulder, pretty much. She responds by saying "I'd hoped for something better from you. First of all, if this gun were loaded, your brains would be splattered all over the sidewalk. And second, you fight like a girl. I have no use for hotheads like you." You can only respond with "well you ARE a girl!" or you can let her go.\n\nFirst of all, 'first of all' is not a good thing for this character to say. It just seems like a child explain something they believe everyone should know, even though there was no way the other person could know it. She behaves as though she's expecting me to know the kind of person she is, despite it being the first time I've ever seen her.\n\nSecond, the rebel woman looking to recruit you to help fight off a government doesn't want you to defend yourself when someone points a gun at your head. What? If I was trying to overthrow an unfair government, I'd most certainly want the hot headed-est, self-defending-est, badasses in the galaxy on my side, especially since treason is a death-warrenting crime. Sure, I'd want people who can keep calm under stress, but I cannot expect people to keep completely calm when a gun is pointed at their head and they are instructed to 'think fast.' 'Think fast' normally means something bad is gonna happen if you don't. Unless you know the person at the other end of the gun well enough to believe it means otherwise, like this stranger woman seems to believe you do, then you're gonna defend yourself.\n\nAnd thirdly, you have no chance to despute her claim. My very first thought after reading her response to my actions was, "I'm not going to trust a stranger's words with my life," and I really, genuinely suspected there to be a third option besides "Well you are a girl" and let her go. A second chance of redeeming myself in her eyes by demonstrating both my will to live and my ability to reason, but nope. If you defend yourself, you don't get to help the Free Worlds defend themselves.\n\nWTF KINDA ♥♥♥♥ IS THAT?!\n\nReally, it's just one line of dialogue that I'm annoyed about. One line of dialogue that think I can change at my leisure. I pretty much pick apart a sentence in four paragraphs up there. I've been told I have problems. It just really annoyed me. And, actually, it's not even a game breaking thing.\n\nIf you fail this event and use the fake movie karate and get that total BS, there are other events that start the Free Worlds storyline, so no worries.\n\nSo, yeah. It's really just me being picky, which I shouldn't be because the game if free, awesome, and pretty much fully editable.\n\nThis game is still so very great. I love it.","November 22, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ok well fine.\n\nPros:\n\nShip Customization: There is a fairly large variety of ships, all of which have thier own purposes, pro's and cons. I havn't played around with all of them yet, but its pretty apparent after a few hours that there is no single ship that does it all the best, there will always be another ship that does something better then your current ship, weather thats hauling freight, or blowing stuff up, or carrying passengers.\n\nEquipment Customization: Each ship is customizable as far as the type of engines, weapons, and sub systems your ship has. There is great fun to be had trying to optimize your ship while maintaining a functional balance... or you can just say screw balance and desighn a way way overpowered ship in one class, that sucks in everything else.\n\nMissions: All the various missions in the game are tailored to your ship/fleet. This is great starting out, as you wont have "kill/escort" missions dropping on your head that honestly your lil tiny freighter has no hope of completeing. Have a bunch of freighters/transports? You'll get alot of those missions. Have a fleet of fighters? Get combat missions.\n\nCombat: Combat is tough, and fairly hectic, but very enjoyable to watch/participate in. There can be massive fleet engagements, or slow duel's and dances.\n\nFreedom: You can pretty much play how you want, though some ways are easier then others. Can even conquer planets if you desire, though the owning faction will be fairly upset with ou.\n\nCons:\nStill in development: The Game has a few rough points, and can be a bit stale occasionally. Hopefully this will get ironed out, even if it doesnt, heck, its free. I'd have easily dropped 5-10 bucks for this as is.\n\nCombat: Remember how i said combat could be hectic? Well it can also be unfair, and its not very skill based. It usually comes down to who brought the most guns and the variety of guns involved. There is some ways to out skill combat, but usually it comes down to luck, and sheer fire power.\n\nStory: It is pretty lacking as of right now, but the developer is working on this.\n\nEquipment: Although equipment is there, there are few flat "upgrades" So there is little room for improvement of a ship once you have achieved the desire equipment setup. Most upgrades come from getting a different/better ship at this point. And once you have top tier everything, any sense of progression pretty much stagnates.\n\nNo risk: This is more of a personal preference/grey area then an actual con. The game auto saves often, so its very easy to go back to a previous save if things go south. Of course you could not reload, but I personally have a hard time ignoring the temptation, even though i wont a more perma death/risk like game.","November 23, 2015","true","159.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a good amount of side quests for bounty hunting, escorting, and ferrying as well as trading.\nThe galaxy is pretty decent in size already, but I have high hopes on it growing and seeing more planets and factions.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game is very reminiscent of escape velocity, I noticed it is a lot easier to start of as a barge and make trade runs and buy more barges to increase your cargo. I really enjoyed the autopilot bits for landing and jumping to other systems, the auto firing I really appreciated since I wanted to be like those other ships and not fire every gun at the same time.\n\nWishes:\nFaction specific ships, news, faction specific outfits, bigger galaxy, more factions, a steam workshop, junkyard systems, ship painting planets/stations. follow up quests or notes after helping people out, the ability to join a faction and fight as part of a fleet under a commander/work for corporations, after dominating a planet being able to shell out cash to upgrade infrastructure to add more ships, increase trade, increased population etc...\n\nCannot wait to see the game with more content in the future.","November 23, 2015","true","56.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's certainly got a little effort put into it - and it's free to boot. But on the flip side it's not a game anyone would have paid to play.\n\nIt's certainly addicting and plays heavy on the psychological urge to make the numbers grow - I played 8 hours of this yet I feel like I just started the game - but there's nothing I can honestly point out and say "that was fun" about those 8 hours spent. Just a compelling urge to get back to it to make money and get better ships.\n\nThe combat is over nearly the instant it begins. If you get attacked the game is already decided as there's no actual time to think or react; before you can even visually see an enemy you often get shot from offscreen by a torpedo or rapidly hit by a fighter's beams in a way that just kills you inside 2-4 seconds of popping into the system. If you buy escort ships they can defend you, but the combat is over too fast for you (the human-controlled ship) to actually participate in any meaningful way.\n\nThere are quests that spice the game up a little bit with story if you stop off in some spaceports. They're not terribly different than other jobs you can get in actual function, but you get a little story to go with the game.\n\nThe greater part of this game is just grabbing junk from one place and selling it in another place. Pirates show up at times and typically - if you're alone - they kill you before you can do anything about it.The game isn't brutal though. It autosaves everytime you land on a planet so if you die it's barely an inconvienence.\n\nIt's a free game so you can't really go wrong giving it a shot.","December 2, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Piloting a small, but fast Star Barge, I earned credits, albeit slowly, by flying small loads from one place to the other. Once I traded in the Star Barge for a Freighter, I was able to transport several loads of varied sizes at once and earn a more efficient income. I was amazed at the sudden difference of income just from upgrading ships.

If you want to see what games like Star Citizen should emulate, check into this. EV is a series that most PC gamers were not aware of. It launched on Mac first and did not get a PC port until the third and final game launched. The games were fantastic on their own but even better with modding. One of the most famous was the Star Wars mods which brought high detail star wars ships into EV. Endless Sky looks to be capitalizing on that.

In short: Yes! It looks like there's enough game material and enjoyment to eek out. After six hours I'm still definitely wanting more, and after about 4 hours into a single campaign before the story starts to get hot and saucy so it looks like there's plenty more fun to be had.\n\nThis is a simple top-down 2D space trading/exploration/RPG. All the basic concepts familiar to this genre are present: "jumping" from system to system to make your way across our galaxy (each system realistically aligned to our own galaxy and most having at least one or two planets with a short paragraph backstory) the option to either explore the galaxy and seek battle as a budding pirate hunter/pirate, flying the space equivalent of a ford transit van across the systems in comfy trading and occasional moments of absolute terror, or a hybrid mix. If for some reason you ever wanted to be a space bus conductor: there's passenger liners.\n\nI tried all three initial starter-pokemon ships but settled with the transit van for my current playthrough. in this time I have: delivered a giant space-lizard amidst a pitched fight between the navies of two factions, taken a poodle half the way across the galaxy, delivered funeral documents to grieving earther relatives, and in the mean time sandwiched every bit of my hold with cargo to sell between stops. if you want something immersive to play this ticks all those boxes in even the most direly boring way to play. Picking the "interceptor" starting career immediately throws you into the slaughter.\n\nSomething over reviewers haven't covered very much here but I think is worth whetting your appetite is ship customizability: Ships are sold to you relatively complete but also have a) some empty spots and b) none of the more interesting mod cons. Take for example my light freighter I have now. I bought this thing with a loan and 500k credits to spare, why? Because I had plans. I made hull modifications that shrunk my cargo hold but gave me some more space to fit other things. in these things I fitted oversized turning thrusters and an improved shielding generator. Cooling vents/tubes were put in place of some spare bunk space, which let me switch to a beefier turret that put out just a little bit too much heat.\n\nin the real world, I did the equivalent of buying a beat up old lorry, fitted it with armour plating and a 50.cal mounted in the passenger seat, and put a v12 where there was a v8. I now had a cargo hauler that could seriously ruin a pirate's day. you know when you watch star wars and you think "I want to have my own millenium falcon?" well now you can, and for free!\n\nspace trading games have been a personal passion of mine since I got my tiny 4-year old hands around a copy of Elite III.  It is a delight to play something that captures that essence of such games, and to do so for free is an unexpected pleasure. Thanks Mr Zahniser.

Compare to 'Destination Sol', they seem very alike in the controling. But 'Endless Sky' have more advance options in fleet building as well as in missions and trading. What I admire about this game are the many routes you can choose to create your fleet. You can be a multi-millionare merchant's guild like me in the game or maybe a military anti-pirate armada. Not only that, but it gives you a challenge with the advance pirate capital ships in the border or outer sectors. My tip is to avoid the outer sectors till you have the firepower. The easiest money maker for me was making simple 2 sector trade routes with feighters. Now with the big feighters, I get about 500,000 per load!

And evolve with the profits you generate?!\nWelcome to Endless Sky!\n\nHonestly, the graphics (and the looong list of commands) kept me away from the game for a while. It is only after I noticed we could barely use 3 keys (J, L, M by default) and have an unexplicable amount of fun during this game.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, but I honestly can't recommend this game enough. It's a very thrilling experience between travelling space, recruiting ships/crew, accomplishing missions, fighting/fleeing pirates, joining a clan...\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The other ships in the game are extremely random. Some planets are very calm, and one second after, they become raging with pirates and Republican resistance... Instant kills are in order!\n- No real story, really. The first missions show you how to navigate and play (some sort of tutorial) and then, nothing else. Just a bunch of exploding ships...\n- The ships you buy are default. No customization possible on their skins (though you can buy wepaons and stuff on them, still not accurate though since that takes up place from the merchandise too)\n\nWhat kept me playing for hours now:\n- Money! Money! MONEY! It's what keeps you farming circuits for hours!\n- 3 keys to manage it all; some sort of pre-built autopilot for your ship.\n- Reading about the planets and discovering new horizons. Each system has a planet or more with different stories. It's just amazing how much work was put in that!\n- The map is EXTREMELY, I say EXTREMELY WELL OPTIMIZED!! If you get to know it, everything is shown from missions, nearby planets with their economy, destination, where you should and should not go! It's the MOST amazing map in a ES clone-game I've ever seen!\n- Have a fleet, conquer space! Satisfy your ego!\n- Free open-source game!

The controls are straigtforward; there's a lot of freedom and choice; even the writing is good.  The game is also rather difficult and you die a lot.  That, in itself, is not an issue -- I like hard games.\n\nThe problem is that there is no penalty for death.  You simply restart from your last autosave... and that effectively removes all tension from the game.  Gameplay is no longer about survival, or getting rich, or being a badass fighter pilot.  It becomes a content treadmill where you grind through endless missions in order to upgrade your fleet... so that you can grind through more missions.\n\nEven worse, death is very random and largely out of your control.  You can jump into a star system and be instantly killed by pirates.  Reload from your last autosave, jump into the same system, and there will be no pirates.  It's not like you made a bad decision (or even a risky decision) the first time; you simply moved forward, and the result was instant death.\n\nI tried playing in my own personal "permadeath" mode, but that didn't work either.  The early-game is all about paying off a mountain of debt, and that gets very boring to replay.  As mentioned above, you die randomly all the time, so any "permadeath" session is going to be very short.\n\n(Also, they're *pirates*, not serial killers.  It makes no sense for them to vaporize me, nor does it make any sense that they'd be so interested in my single, low-budget cargo ship.)\n\nI have a recommendation for the developer: instead of having the pirates kill me, they could disable my ship(s), take everything of value, and leave me to drift in space.  Then, after they leave, I could get a loan, rebuild my fleet, and continue the story.","December 9, 2015","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very fun at first trying to learn what you can do making goals and trying to jobs and get a bigger and better ship. After you play a bit it gets kindve boring cause there isnt actually a lot to do, but there could be in the future!. Which i cant wait for and i hope they do continue to develop this game because it could become pretty fun. This is game is fun for the first 2 hours then kindve leans off of that cause again there isnt much to do just heading back and forth between places. You can fight other ships but its hard and the only way to get money from them is to bored them but that is pretty hard cause all the AI just destorys it.

Decent Graphics, Simple Controls, Great mechanics, and a not-too-shabby 'tutorial'.\nThere are a few drawbacks, though. Replayability is a bit on the low side, as progression is a bit slow and you end up doing very similar missions over and over until you have a ship capable of actually fighting Pirates, which can take a while to get.\nThere is an occaisional bug here and there, but other than that the game runs smoothly.\n\nAside from the progression issues, I see potential in this game. I love how you can run out of fuel in an uninhabited sector and have to call a nearby merchant for help. I like the money system, how you can ferry goods from one place to another to earn a profit. I like how the gameplay feels, and I would love to see a Multiplayer function.\n\nOverall, great game.

Compare to 'Destination Sol', they seem very alike in the controling. But 'Endless Sky' have more advance options in fleet building as well as in missions and trading. What I admire about this game are the many routes you can choose to create your fleet. You can be a multi-millionare merchant's guild like me in the game or maybe a military anti-pirate armada. Not only that, but it gives you a challenge with the advance pirate capital ships in the border or outer sectors. My tip is to avoid the outer sectors till you have the firepower. The easiest money maker for me was making simple 2 sector trade routes with feighters. Now with the big feighters, I get about 500,000 per load!

This game hits that right on the mark, This game takes a sort of FTL style and makes it so you have to either fight to survive or make good decisions and know what kind of recources wherever your going is going to need. Basically in this game you can either become a pirate hunter or pirate yourself and kill ships, board them and take their loot. Or you can go the more "safer" route and do trade routes and bring tourists places. For trading you can take jobs to bring tons of goods to certain planets or the same with tourists, You can also buy goods at a planet and bring the goods to another planet and sell the goods for a profit. All the while you are saving money to upgrade your ship or buy new ships. At the beginning of the game you take out a loan to buy your first ship and throughout the first year of the game you must pay off your loan. Events happen in thew game like civil war and special missions. Overall this game is very fun and if you like space sims or anything of the same you should try this game out. Plus its free so why not =] PS. i recommend going with trading and jobs instead of pirating first off because its a lot easier. Also i would easily pay $10+ for this game.","November 1, 2015","true","42.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To do so, you must decide whether you will follow the law or operate outside of it. Though the economy is simple and it is very easy to find a lucrative trade route and then supplement it with jobs, the universe itself is more than alive enough to keep you engrossed.\nIn my time, I have had the exquisite pleasure of desperately fleeing across outer rim worlds from a vastly superior pirate fleet that refused to give up its pursuit, periously weaving my way through a system engrossed in a massive all out battle, and dogfighting a significantly better ship while my lumbering merchant ships aligned for a jump out of a losing fight.\nIn this time, I've also had to learn how to bum hyperdrive fuel off of other ships when I warp into a new sector only to learn there is no civilization there, abandon a crippled member of my fleet to pirates in order to ensure the survival of my remaining ships, and bribe a successful pirate not to finish my sorry self off.\nThough by no means a perfect game, it is an engrossing and absolutely enjoyable experience that I recommend entirely to fans of economic sandboxes or space settings.","November 1, 2015","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like every game there must be a menu with all the controls to temper with. The beggining was a challange but soon u realise an easy but time consuming way of paying for your debt like going to a planet with a lot of pirates and freeworld/republic/merchants. After you get rid of your debt you are able to get new ships and build a fleet. Its funny how people complain about how slow their ship is when they dont understand the engine system. Your ship is as fast as its engine, not a lot of space? no worries just gotta find the right solar system who will sell you this green engine, its expensive but its lightwieght and effective, sometimes pirate ships have it. People also complain about how easy and annoying it is to die but thats when the auto save saves the day and its always a good habit to manually save.\n\nOverall, this game is really good, be mindful only 1 person worked on this game and even tho there is no soundtrack, you can always go on youtube to find a soundtrack.

Which I have never done before.\n\nFirst of all, it is absolutely free. No in game charges, no pay to play, nothing. And somehow it is better than so many titles that I have payed for.\nThe game is very customizable and only requires a small amount of effort in order to mod it. I have experience in multiple coding languages so maybe I'm biased, but I found the source code very simple and user friendly. You can even create your own ships with ease! The creator encourages it and even has the game on Github for your pleasure.\nThe game is very casual if you want, and very intense if you want. When I started I picked a Freighter and did the merchant thing for a while. It was relaxing, carrying people and cargo back and forth for a while trying to pay off my loan, but I decided I wanted something more. So I restarted, picked an Interceptor and went out to shoot some pirates. The point is you can make the game what you want. It can be hard, easy, fast, slow, up, down, left, right, start, select, anything!\nThe story is very engaging! Currently there is only one storyline you can play through (The Free Worlds), but I'll be damned if that wasn't one of the best stories I have ever played. I felt connected to Freya, Katya, and Ijs, when I fought with my fleet I cared about them and each ship lost was like a knife in my heart, I had let my comrades down.\nThe world feels very active and busy, kind of like an Elder Scrolls game. Very rarely are things just standing around doing nothing.\n\nI have only two problems with the game right now. The first is that sometimes there are game breaking glitches, such as when attempting to board a ship my screen would go black and I could no longer interact with anything, or when I sell the ship I'm currently piloting, but have one parked offworld and I am immediately sent to that ship.\nThe other problem I have is... There isn't enough! I want more! I want more Katya, I want to see Raven again, I want to learn about the Korath and the Quarg, I want to build more ships like the Dreadnought and the Kestrel, and I especially want to fight more Alphas.\n\nThis game gets a 10/10 from me and I would gladly pay money for it were it not free.","November 9, 2015","true","49.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As seen in the descritpion this is a spirtual sucessor of sorts to Ambrosia's Escape Velocity, and Escapre Velocity override, optimized for what gamers expect as the basics of more modern game.  Trade, bounty hunt, or shuttle folks around to make your living.  As you progress you can start to decide how youll want to proceed. Want a bigger freighter?  Go get it!  Want to be an unstoppable pirate disabling ships, stripping them down for parts?  Yes you can.  Hiring escorts can be expensive, but definatly cheaper than buying a new ship and starting over.

Decent Graphics, Simple Controls, Great mechanics, and a not-too-shabby 'tutorial'.\nThere are a few drawbacks, though. Replayability is a bit on the low side, as progression is a bit slow and you end up doing very similar missions over and over until you have a ship capable of actually fighting Pirates, which can take a while to get.\nThere is an occaisional bug here and there, but other than that the game runs smoothly.\n\nAside from the progression issues, I see potential in this game. I love how you can run out of fuel in an uninhabited sector and have to call a nearby merchant for help. I like the money system, how you can ferry goods from one place to another to earn a profit.

One complaint I do have, however, is that the UI and art style are just a tad too minimalistic to be immersive. It doesn't have quite the same personality Escape Velocity had back in the day, let alone the kind of personality its sequels had. That makes navigating spaceports to buy upgrades and take missions seem more like a chore than the interesting (and more importantly, addictive) distraction from combat and space exploration it really should be.\n\nHonestly, that could be corrected fairly easily.  Adding some music here and there, or even a little "beeping" sound or something when you switch between different planetside menues, could accomplish a lot to liven things up.","November 1, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has most of the features I loved about the EV series like; capturing ships and adding them to your fleet, open world exploration, RPG optimizing weapons and shielding, NPC factions that will attack if provoked and are governed by your reputation to them, and much more. Those are all the things I believe is what makes it so much fun.\nThere are only a few things I do not like about it and that is; some of the functions like item search oversimplify the game and prove counter productive, in that it makes it too easy to find the item you want rather than exploring the galaxy to find it. It is convenient but it shortens the end game. What I mean is I have only played a few hours and already have millions of credits with no hacks. All the items are shown, I just have to select one and it shows me where it can be found. To me, that is boring, I like exploring and finding new things. Finding a black market item that is not sold anywhere else and is better than the available items, is like finding gold. Sadly I doubt this game has a black market since all items are shown.\n\nThe positives outweigh the negatives, you should try it. :)","November 1, 2015","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is completely free to play, no bogus with paying for in game content, so absolutely everything is free. You get to fly around a pretty cool galaxy, with lots of different types of things you can do, each of which gets you money, which  then allows you to do fun things like upgrade your ship or outright buy a new one. The one thing I was worried about when i started, was that there would be tons of ships just acting as pirates, going around killing the newer players with weaker ships, but so far i have only died to pirates a couple times, and it largely happens when I am intenionally scouting out areas rich in pirate activity, so its pretty easy to avoid for the most part, since so long as you have enough fuel you can just warp away. Overall a pretty fun experience, so I'd give it an 8/10, only taking off some points because its not exactly visuall stimulating, and because there is no real story besides, get as much money as possible and upgrade the living hell out of your ship. But since its entirely free, and a really small download, you may as well give it a shot.","October 30, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game hits that right on the mark, This game takes a sort of FTL style and makes it so you have to either fight to survive or make good decisions and know what kind of recources wherever your going is going to need. Basically in this game you can either become a pirate hunter or pirate yourself and kill ships, board them and take their loot. Or you can go the more "safer" route and do trade routes and bring tourists places. For trading you can take jobs to bring tons of goods to certain planets or the same with tourists, You can also buy goods at a planet and bring the goods to another planet and sell the goods for a profit. All the while you are saving money to upgrade your ship or buy new ships. At the beginning of the game you take out a loan to buy your first ship and throughout the first year of the game you must pay off your loan. Events happen in thew game like civil war and special missions. Overall this game is very fun and if you like space sims or anything of the same you should try this game out. Plus its free so why not =] PS. i recommend going with trading and jobs instead of pirating first off because its a lot easier. Also i would easily pay $10+ for this game.","November 1, 2015","true","42.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had a wasp fighter get shot down, and upon reloading from the last planet as the game instructs my screen freezes on that same wasp fighter and makes it my flagship whenever I pass through that system so I lose control of whatever fleet I bring through.  I also lose whatever credits I spent purchasing newer ships as they somehow get stuck in that system as well and don't show up in my fleet when I reload. With no real tutorial that I've seen, the storyline quests can be pretty dumb and time consuming so essentially you just wind up cruising the stars hoping to earn enough credits to buy bigger and better ships. Not bad, a good time killer but that's about it - good thing it's free because it would be a joke if you had to spend any money on it. Check it out, and don't laugh too hard at the game developers.","November 20, 2015","true","66.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has so much potential to be such a great game. Let's give this game some time and see how this game progress from here on out. At the moment, this game needs some new content like new titles for the faction you're in for like bragging rights? Maybe perhaps allow the raiding and protecting of the space stations and colonies? Another way to secure an income for cash like mining minerals in space and selling them at the marketplace in planets? I would love some achievements too if it is not too much to ask for. An AI enemy would be nice too like an enigmatic alien race pillaging and raiding for some unknown motive could be foreshadowing for some really awesome storyline! Even a unsophisticated stats screen would be nice to monitor progress/progression. Documenting this game in its early stages is one of life's simplest pleasures that i derive from.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amerakee/recommended/404410/","Amerakee","Amerakee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amerakee/","187 products in account","What do I have to say about this game..\n\nEndless Sky is a completely free, top-down, 2D space game. But there's more to it than that; think Elite Dangerous meets 2D with text-based story telling charm.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay typically goes along the lines of this:\nGame: "Buy your first ever spacecraft! Pick from a transport, cargo ship, or a fighter!"\nPlayer: "I want the fighter!"\nBanks: "Let me just set your mortgage appropriately..."\n*Proceeds to suffer paycheck to paycheck*\n\nYeah.. Never start with the fighter. Bad idea.\n\nOnce you get the basics down, a lot of the gameplay boils down to your character trying to earn a living through either pirating, transporting tourists around, and/or shipping cargo around the galaxy, and avoiding pirate raids. Be warned, this game does take a little trial and error before you're able to get the hang of it.\n\nWhat catches my attention is the surprising amount of story a free game like this has. The random events can range from a funny little fetch quest (Go save my pookie!), to helping scientsts with something, to throwing you the chance to go off on a sudden story quest.\n\nThe writing has a charm to it. The dialog is surprisingly well written, every planet, starport, and space station has it's own bio and photo (There are a LOT of planets), and the science is well researched.\n\n\nOVERALL: 8/10\n\nUpsides:\n\nThis game is clearly someones passion project, and the passion shows. From how far I've played, the characters have personality, the writing is vivid, the planets are well thought out, and the story that I've experienced thus far is interesting. I can honestly say this is the first time a completely free game has thoroughly impressed me. This game has well over 15-20+ hours of potential minimum playtime.\n\nWell thoughtout universe and story!\n\nHuge number of ships, upgrades, and planets!\n\nNo Microtransactions!\n\nGood autosave system!\nForgot to save and now your flagship is destroyed, along with that cargo that was going to net you 124,000 creds? Don't worry about it, you can pick up back at whatever planet you last took off from!\n\n\n\nDownsides:\n\nThe initial tutorial quests, which do have some variation (+Brownie Point Get), don't cover as much as they could. They explain the game concepts well, but the only way to learn the controls, how to hyperjump, target, fire, et cetera, is to look in your options menu. This isn't a huge issue, as there aren't many controls for the game and they're fairly simple at that.\n\nThe UI could use a little improvement. I'd like to have my flagship's shield and hull stats next to the rest of my fleet, and the enemy's stats nearby, rather than have all three seperated. It makes it difficult to properly manage a ship (let alone a fleet) during combat.\n\nThere isn't any way that I've found that will make all of the ships in your fleet jump at once, they go at their own pace and become scattered between planets if you move too fast.\n\n\n\nStill not convinced that this game may be a hidden gem? Try it out, it's free, you have nothing to loose!","November 1, 2015","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
