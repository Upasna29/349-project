Fun game to play with friends. The variety in maps and game modes makes it interesting since it's kinda tough being good at all of them. Sound design is satisfying, always good to yell "♥♥♥♥♥" mid-game.\n\nShame there's no AI system or target challenege mode for single player possibilities :( strictly multiplayer\n\nI only strongly recommend if you plan on playing with friends\n\n","May 19","true","5.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dlastons/recommended/468800/","dlastons","D.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dlastons/","272 products in account","Product received for free\n\nArkshot is what I describe as an "FPS-twitch-arena-shooter" and I think that's a fitting title for it.\n\nI've been periodically testing it with the developers in their private testing group, and as such I has receieved the game at no monetary expense. That said, to me, this doesn't carry any sort of bias because I'll be buying it for at least one other person soon (as I was planning on purchasing it on release anyway), so keep that in mind I guess.\n\nWith that out of the way, time to talk about what I like about the game (and the few things I dislike)\n\nWhat that I love:\n1. This game is stupid fun. Like, really, really fun. Annoying your friends by bunny hopping around every shot they make and shooting them from above is hilarious. Not only that, but the intensity brought on by one-hit death gives a greater sense of urgency and keeps you on your toes.\n\n2. Character customization. You can change several things about your character before the match begins. You can change your clothing colour, your mask, your bow, and your taunt. Taunts are various different sound effects to choose from. Considering you can choose anything from an airhorn to the developer literally just saying "p e n i s" gives you an idea of what kind of diversity we're working with here (the perfect kind).\n\n3. The movement. The movement feels so satisfying. You have your standard movement options for FPSes, walking, sprinting, jumping, and crouching. But on top of that, you also have arrow-jumping, crouch-arrow-jumping (surprisingly difficult to pull off), and dashing. Everything you do in this game feels really smooth and nice. The developer recently let me in on a little insight that really helps out a lot. Diagonal movement is actually faster than only moving in one direction. For example, holding forward and right is faster than looking towards the right and holding forward. Some people would consider this a programming oversight, but this is fully intentional and adds a lot to the game that you might not originally think about.\n\n4. The interesting stamina system. Everything you do except crouching and walking removes stamina. Drawing your bow, sprinting, jumping, and dashing. I've never quite seen a mechanic that doesn't let you shoot if you have been sprinting/jumping too much, and it honestly is really unique and interesting. It adds a bit spice to the game, and really demands that you learn to conserve your stamina while not also not getting killed by everyone.\n\n\n\nWhat I don't love about the game:\n1. Lack of content. While the lack of content isn't severe, it's definitely there. There are only five game modes, no options to customize your game (score limit, max players, etc), and only a few options for character customization. However to my knowlege, some of these qualms will be changed in a future update. I won't go into detail about some of the things I've been told on the subject, because I don't even know if I'm allowed to, but it will most likely be changed very soon.\n\n2. Collisions. Sometimes collisions on walls are a bit buggy (specifically doorways.) They can allow the player to climb certain walls and reach the top of the level, where you can snipe other players while they're traversing halls. However, this may be intentional, I don't really know. While this is only a slight problem, it's still a problem nonetheless.\n\n3. If you're reading this, you probably haven't bought it yet. Go and buy it, dude!\n\nArkshot is a really good game, and for only $8 USD, it would be a shame for you to miss out on such a fun experience. Get a couple of friends together, sit down, and play a couple of hours of Arkshot. S'really fun.\n\nOh yeah, and a note to the devs: pls nerf mike. He's too good at the game.\n\n8.5/10 <3\n\nEDIT: Removed pointless swearing, making the review easier to read.\nEDIT 2: Avoiding censorship lmao","May 20","true","6.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It feels smooth and responsive. The jumping mechanic feels familiar to anyone who has played games like tf2; Where you can rocket-jump by shooting at your feet, or dashing mid-air. If you then mix that with the twitchyness of Quake, give it a flashy ps1-polygon aestethic and add a bow and arrow, you kind of got this game; Which is really cool!\n\nHowever, I've only had like 2-3 matches in my 1.7 hours of playing, and you can't even explore the maps without any other players, so if you don't have any to play with, you basically only got the training grounds. Maybe it could be fixed by making waiting for a match more exciting or atleast let you explore the map you're about to play, so you're not only stuck in a lobby. Or giving you some sort of incentive to wait for a match\n\nI really want to play more of this game because it holds the potential to be really enjoyable, so I do hope more players come around!","May 26","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not a fan of FPS games and I generally don't play games that are multiplayer but Arkshot is the kind of party game that makes it worthwhile to pick up.\n\nThere are several game modes including "King of the Hill" and "Capture the Flag" and my personal favorite "Headhunter". Along with a dozen or so maps of varying sizes with their own added challenges on top of the game mode. Also the powerups are really creative and interesting. For example, the punching arrows can knock *you* back as well as who you shoot at from the kickback.\n\nWhile there are no differences in the actual character models, you can change your color and wear fun masks as well as choose your bows (bows and masks are aesthetic only and change nothing about your build).\n\nWhile you can join public matches that are open anytime you can also make a private room and play with up to 3 other friends. It's really great to test your skills with people you don't know and friends.\n\nIn short I HIGHLY recommend this game :) It's really fantastic.\n","May 20","true","0.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend the game if I didn't truly love it**\n\nArkshot is a 4-player online FPS, and it's crazy fun. The simple fact that all of the weapons are bows, with realistic flight arcs, that need to be charged before shooting makes the FPS gameplay something very different from what you're used to. Game modes like deathmatch, king of the hill, and capture the flag are mouch more strategic when every shot has a bit of uncertainty to it.\n\nOh, and there's no aiming reticle. It sounds like a bad thing, but it really, really isn't. By design, this makes the skill ceiling pretty high, especially when paired with movement abilities like arrow-jumping (less dangerous than rocket-jumping) and crouch-jumping.\n\nHighly recommended to play with friends.","May 26","true","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The level design leaves a little to be desired, with a difficult distinction between walls and pits and rather difficult to tell different areas of the same level apart.

But Raven, if you like this game why are you saying you wouldn't recommend it?\n\nWell dear reader, here is your answer! First of all more people would read negative reviews, but this is my reason:\nNobody plays this game at the moment.\nNow that wouldn't be such a problem. Cool, it's a really good game and it's obscure. So?\nWell, this game is purely multiplayer. Sure, there is a training but you can do nothing in it really. Because there is no singleplayer you can barely play. I mean, I haven't played much of the game, but I know I only spent a tenth of my time legit playing. Not too much of a problem, sure...But it shouldn't cost £5.99 if I cannot play it due to the lack of being able to play.\n\nCons\n-You can't go singleplayer\n-Multiplayer usually doesn't work\n-Sometimes the chat bugs out and you can't talk\n-No voicechat\n-Polygonal graphics (I honestly don't mind but I know some people do)\nPros\n-Awesome method of firing\n-Nice narration\n-The taunts are fantastic memes. I can do the sad trombone and also airhorns.\n-Getting a kill feels so satisfying\n-Diverse gamemodes\n-Innovative maps\n-Friendly community (Though very small)\n-Trading cards\n-Character customisation\n-Low learning curve\n-Really awesome powerups\n\nHonestly? I rate 10. But due to the fact I haven't been able to play against 3 people yet and I've played for 103 minutes so far...That's not good. I've been waiting for too long. When more people play it would be fantastic so I think you should get it to help people play, but for now, I don't recommend it.

Super easy to pick up and play, had no connectivity issues when joining a friend to start the game, and matches don't take too long to get through. There is a fair bit of comedy in the style the game was designed, from what it says in the chat box to get you to type, to the taunts (and oh my, the taunts!), and everything else that will make you laugh. And don't worry, even if you aren't great at FPS like myself, you still might actually do pretty well! When no one can aim, everyone can aim :D\nHere's the footage from about half an hour of my own gameplay: https://youtu.be/NbXPmhHWI8o and trust me, you want to see the shenanigans in the second map. I really hope more people end up picking this game, so I'll be able to play with four people and not just two! Although it was still a LOT of fun with even just two, and the maps are the perfect size.","May 20","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can pick up power ups to help (or occasionally hinder) you during matches such as Free-for-all Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, and more! The best part is that you can just spam a button to have your character yell "♥♥♥♥♥!" as your friend watches you for a few seconds after their death.\n\nSome minor issues I have with the game is that it only supports up to 4 people in a match atm. It would be a ton of fun to expand some of the maps currently in the game to allow more players per match.\n\nOther than that, a great game for a good price. Make sure you have friends to join you!","May 20","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Note that the time I was searching for servers was at 930 PM US east.\nThe gameplay itself (in practice mode) is very awkward but obviously meant for you to play it for a while to get used to the movement, ammo, aiming, timings, and of course the powerups...but with no players it is impossible to tell how that would feel in combat.\nDefinitely don't recommend solely on the premise of no players.","May 28","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game has a good sprinkling of adult humour in the form of taunt sounds, for us less mature players.\n\nPros:\n- The movement is smooth, the characters move fast and can jump long distances. It's rather satisfying\n- Customisation. Choose your taunt, weapon, mask, and wizard colour. Lots of options\n- The arrows make a pleasing 'thock' noise when you land a hit\n- Adult humour. 'Nuff said\n- The art style is quite sexy\n\nCons:\n- Not a lot of players as of yet, so bring friends if you want to play\n","May 24","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To think only two people worked on this!\n\nIt's a shame barely anyone plays the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilerg/recommended/468800/","kilerg","KillerG Is Magic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilerg/","211 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis is just a balls-to-the-wall arena shooter. There\'s really not much more to say. They have a few modes, most of which are very simple, clean, and fun. The maps artistically are cool and unique especially some that change gameplay with thick fog or snow, and most just play really well. The gameplay itself is difficult, it requires you to learn and build skill to be able to actually get kills. This stems from the simple to understand, but difficult to master shooting mechanic, in that you only have a bow and arrow. There\'s some pickups for them, but it doesn\'t make things that much easier for you. So make sure to play with people you know aren\'t going to demolish you.\n\nI got this game from the developer to test out (shout out to the devs, they're actually pretty cool guys), but would it be worth it to buy this game for $8? Maybe. Would it be worth it to buy it on sale? Absolutely. Would I make my friends pay $8 to play it with me right now? Very likely.\n\nThis game is so simple all you can do is play it, there's nothing to show off or explain to get in besides the short tutorial level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nkdeffa/recommended/468800/","nkdeffa","DEFFA.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nkdeffa/","177 products in account","Arkshot is a twitchy arena FPS published by "Digerati Distribution" on 19 may of 2016 and developed by "Code Avarice" making their debut on steam. It is multiplayer only allowing players to play from several regions such as EU,US,ASIA,JP,AU. You can either create your own lobby and set it to private and challenge 3 of your friends in intense combat in a variety of game modes and maps or jump into someone else’s lobby or create a public one.\n\nUnfortunately,  there’s not really many of players at the moment. You would be lucky if you catch someone playing and most likely they will have their room set to private. However, if any of your friends has the copy of a game, two players is more than enough to have a blast.\n\nThe game is not really focused on graphics as the focus is on gameplay which is really simple and a lot of fun. As for weapon everyone has a bow with quake style mechanics and  several self-explanatory power ups located around the map. It mostly depends which one of these game modes have you chosen : headhunter,king of the hill,slow down,deathmatch,capture the flag,however none of this modes are as basic  as you may be used to in other games. For example, in headhunter, capture the flag and king of hill modes the capture points are moving around the map and spawning in different locations which makes it really hard for you to capture as you have to first find where the new location is in maze looking maps which are currently 14, kill your enemies again, and than capture it if you are fast enough or it’ll change location again so you don’t really have time to camp. The maps aren’t large enough for you to hide.\n\nThe main graphic options are resolution or preset graphic options. These are only accessible outside of a game along with an option of disabling v-sync shadows, etc. even though game is not really focused on graphics it still has some really cool effects working properly such as smokebomb or weather effects. In terms of costumization game offers variety of colors you can choose from for your character along with several different looking bows and masks along with variety of sound taunts which are quite funny but also spammy since you are triggering them yourself you can just run around non-stop spamming it to annoy and distract your enemies. It actually adds a bit of strategy to your play.\n\nPROS:Variety of Maps – (there’s quake style small maps with power-ups located all around,and with totally different enviroments,and fact that capture points move around,it makes it even more enjoyable and exploratory)\n\nVariety of Customization – (there’s several things you can customize such as weapon,color,masks and taunt sounds)\n\nVariety of Power-Ups – (there’s several types of power ups located around the map such as shields,invisibility, resize, stats,etc)\n\nVariety of Modes – (the game offers several game modes you can choose from such as headhunter,king of the hill,slow down,deathmatch,capture the flag)\n\nFast-Paced – (there’s no time for you to stop or hide somewhere,maps aren’t that big and capture points are moving all around,so you have to basically run around all the time,dodging enemy arrows,trying to kill them and be fast enough to capture point before they respawn which is pretty quick,or before the point re-locates again even though you have unlimited sprint, jumps, dashes and charging are taking of your stamina,so you have to watch out it not being at 0 when your enemies appear)\n\nGamepad Support –(game supports controller and u can sign any button)\n\nQuake Mechanics – (game feels lot like a quake,with jumps, jumpshots and with shooting mechanics overall)\nCONS:\nChatbox – (chatbox was getting bugged all the time after several messages,you could hear the sound of messages but it wasn’t showing anything besides the last messages after it got stuck)\n\nLack of players – (there’s a couple of players here and there but you have to be lucky to catch them,however game came out recently so it still needs some time)\n\nExiting – (game bugs out when you are quitting, taking some time and closing up with an error)\n\nBots – (game doesn’t support bots, which should have been a good feature for this kind of a game – if nobody is playing then you’re unable to play outside of a basic tutorial)\n\nOversimplified HUD – (it would have been better if there were scoreboard like in other games,when you can see kda and ping of every player instead of just having scoreboard in top corner and ping showing only in menu)\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews.
