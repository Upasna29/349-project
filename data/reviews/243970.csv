Moving past the buzzwords, it's a game where you move your units through randomized levels by observing the patterns of enemy movement and then avoiding them on your way to the exit point of the level. If you're lucky, you'll find some items or cash along the way. As you go further in the game, you face more and more dangerous enemies. Eventually you get spotted, die, and have to start again from the beginning. You do that last bit a lot, actually.\n\nI've noticed a lot people assuming that the game is similar to Shadowrun Returns or XCom due to the isometric perspective. It really isn't, and if you go in trying to play it that way you will end up being frustrated. Invisible, Inc. is a stealth game and a roguelike. Combat is difficult and usually not an effective way to deal with enemies. Also, it is a roguelike, to the extent that word still means anything, and you will most likely fail a lot as you learn how to play, and sometimes just because the random number generator screwed you over. How much you enjoy it will depend on your tolerance for that sort of thing.\n\nAlso, this being early access, there's always the question of whether the creators are going to actually finish the game. Klei is a pretty well established company at this point, and they previously did a public beta similar to early access with their game Don't Starve. Personally, I think they're trustworthy based on that track record. Not that I'm an expert or anything.","August 19, 2014","true","16.9"," 389 of 416 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","389","416","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/recommended/243970/","matseb2611","White Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/","317 products in account","All right, so I do recommend the game, but I'll say right away that it's easily not for everyone. In short, if you're expecting a well-pieced together story, you won't find it here, but if you're after a rogue-like turn-based dungeon crawler, then this game will be right up your alley.\n\nThe presentation is probably the game's biggest strength. It's put together well in shiny visuals, clean UI, and a fun gameplay concept that takes isometric turn-based combat and makes it stealth-oriented, where you're better off avoiding the enemies rather than engaging in fights. The game is fun, if you enjoy turn-based tactics that let you plan your every ally's move.\n\nThe gameplay concept is solid, but some of its execution was a fair bit annoying to me personally. A lot of the challenge presented felt simply artificial and unfair. The raising security level each and every turn forces you to rush each mission. Exploration is simply not rewarded under this system, because the longer you stay on your mission, the more security measures will be added after every few turns, which will eventually put you in a tight spot. I never came across any way for me to freeze or reduce the security level. It's just a rush against time, but on turn-based basis.\n\nI was also not fond of the fact that I couldn't buy any equipment for my party in between missions. The only time I could do it was if I happened to find an automated shop during missions, when I had virtually no money to spend. Of 4 agents I had in my missions, 2 were running about without weapons and just being used to sit on the guards. This brings me to another annoyance. If you don't have a weapon, you have no way to deal with the guards. No idea what sort of agents these are who can't even take out a guard from behind unless they have a tazer. Things start to get more complex when you meet enemies in armour, who are invulnerable to most weapons, and your only chance is to play a cat and mouse game where you're constantly running away.\n\nBut, I really did like being able to improve my agents in between missions by upgrading their stats, even if stats themselves did feel a bit unbalanced. Speed felt like the most useful stat by far, since it gave you more action points, with hacking being a close second, since everything requires hacking. But strength and anarchy felt next to useless. Strength only lets you carry more items, and anarchy makes you steal slightly more money from the guards.\n\nAnd lastly the story, well, it was mostly on the background. The most of it you'll see is in the opening and ending cutscenes. But the rest of the game you're just dungeon-crawling really. It was pretty neat to get to pick which mission to do from a wide selection. It's very non-linear and each mission simply increases your assets - either you rescue an extra agent to add to the team, or you find some new shiny gear to use. Though because of that, it also meant that there were no story-related reasons to do any mission. You could expect the same approach in each one and merely doing as many as you can to pass 72 hours in-game before having to do the final one with what you've got.\n\nI was also hoping there'd be some more character development. All the agents in your team were just mute puppets for you to control. They never showed any personality or had anything to say aside from a witty one-liner at the start of each mission.\n\nHaving said this, if you are a dungeon-crawl fanatic and like challenge, you should enjoy this game very much. It has higher difficulty modes, as well as an endless mode too where you have to survive for as long as you can. Overall, it's a worthy game to try and I have had my fair share of fun with it, even though the main campaign is rather on the short side.","July 10, 2015","true","7.7"," 271 of 290 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","271","290","10","26"

It feels a lot more like dancing, as your squad scampers around guards and rooms, trading places / items / roles.\n\nVery emergent qualities to the mechanics too -- you might make some noise to bait a guard outside, and he'll open a door and wander into your melee overwatch ambush... but then he left the door open, which means a hacked turret has line of sight to another guard in that room, and so the turret kills him -- the noise alerts other guards and raises the global alarm level, which shuts down your turret and spawns 2 more guards, etc. Things happen because of things, and almost every situation is avoidable if only you had planned ahead a bit better.\n\nAnyway, this is an exceptionally well-done game. Highly recommended. (DISCLOSURE: I completed the campaign on all 3 base difficulty levels. I didn't pay for my copy of the game.

The goal here is not to storm the battlements, mow down the guards, and plant a flag over their corpses.  You're outnumbered, outgunned, and certain death waits around every blind corner.  In true espionage fashion, if your team has to pull their guns, it means you've screwed the pooch, your team is compromised, and now you're in a desperate firefight to sprint to the exit before the corporate army seals off the building.\n\nAt the beginning, you pick two team members, whose special abilities will dictate your play style through an increasingly punishing randomly-generated corporate maze.  You can bring a sniper, sure!  But maybe a computer expert would be less noticeable than gunshots ringing through the halls.  Or you can bring a stealthy lockpicker, but then who's going to judo chop the guards when they show up wearing body armor? Along the way, you may have the opportunity to rescue captured agents and increase your team's size.  The agents available to be rescued are randomized, creating a different play experience each time.\n\nThe graphics and sound create an inviting, futuristic pulp-fiction atmosphere.  The music is appropriately dangerous, and fitting to the Mission: Impossible play style.  There are a ton of options to make the game easier or harder in whatever way you choose, so you can pick your own challenge level, from a casual romp through a save-scumming corp beatdown to hardcore, ironman, no going back, the-T-1000-is-after-you mode.\n\nGet it.

Complaints about the campaign being 'short' or the story not being very elaborate completely miss the mark.  Would you consider those things as negatives for games like FTL or Binding of Isaac?  No.  The campaign is simply half a dozen or so levels strung together with an endearing B-movie cyberpunk spy narrative.  It adds charm and atmosphere but is hardly necessary for the enjoyment of the game's mechanics.  Like Klei's other games, Don't Starve and Mark of the Ninja, the emphasis is on the core gameplay and not the needless fluff you find in most AAA games today.\n\nThe levels are randomly generated so you won't get bored challenging yourself on higher difficulties or endless mode to see how long you can survive.  There's also the right mix of characters, abilities, items, and hacking powers to keep things interesting when you customize your squad.  Additionally you are able to tweak various difficulty settings to tailor an experience that's the right mix of fun and frustration.\n\nIf you are a fan of turned based tactical squad strategy games that deliver a high amount of replay via randomization then you'll love Invisible, Inc.","May 16, 2015","true","50.4"," 153 of 170 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","153","170","3","7"

Your escape route is clear, but Banks still needs one turn to hack the brain of the Plastech CEO you were sent to interrogate. What do you do?\n\nAfter being beamed to the mission site, you are faced with two doors leading to the opposite sides of the building - one is watched by a guard and the other is clear. Send your team through the unguarded route and you risk being trapped at side opposite to the escape elevator when your intrusion is noticed. Have Nika knock out the guard so you can split up and he'll wake up in a few short turns, starting a facility-wide manhunt. What do you do?\n\nWhile ransacking a Sankaku tech office, Dr. Xu has been caught alone by an armed security drone, programmed to kill. The rest of the team, too far away to help, will be sighted by a patrolling camera drone next turn, revealing their location to every Sankaku security personnel within six city blocks. You only have enough power to hack one of the drones. What do you do?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495237730\n\nI don't think there's ever been a game more consistently suspenseful as Invisible Inc. Even when you dance around guards and fill your accounts with corporate capital uncontested you aren't allowed to forget for a minute that it only takes one miscalculation to launch you into a freefall. The biggest credit for this goes to the alarm mechanic. Invisible makes detection a matter of unavoidable, gradually advancing doom rather than a fail state or an excuse to turn itself into an inferior action game.\n\nThe alarm level creeps upwards with your every turn and every mistake, introducing new security measures and guards into the level, and not a single one of the many gadgets and programs available to your agents can do so much as slow it down. It will only stop when the sirens are blaring, private military troops are flooding the building and your agents are darting frantically from room to room, burning through every item and augmentation they have in order to stave off death for just a little while longer.\n\nInvisible isn't a game about avoiding detection, it's about surviving it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495237777\n\nThe core of the game, sneaking from cover to cover and ambushing guards, is immediately intuitive. Instead of of deriving false depth from superfluous mechanics it sets up complex situations and tough choices with just a few precision-designed rules. Things are mixed up by the equipment salvaged from the field, ranging from movement-boosting stimulants to electric door traps. Customization isn't the right word here, though - your resources are always scarce so you must take whatever you can find and build your strategy around that. Plans only last minutes before being replaced by mad improvisation.\n\nLet's go back Dr. Xu and his predicament. Maybe he found a rudimentary invisibility rig in the previous mission, not powerful enough to get him out of the drone's field of view but allowing him to run up to it and temporarily disable it with his EMP tool, an augment only he has access to. Or perhaps Decker can use a stimulant to gain just enough action points to reach the room and gun the drone down. Or maybe there's no way out, but Xu survives his injuries and can be recovered from a detention center later on.\n\nOh, and the corporations aren't short of tricks either. The reason Xu got caught? He opened a safe after you triggered a countermeasure program that sets an alarm to all containers on the level. And what if the program was activated by you stunning that same drone that's now threatening Xu so he could sneak to the safes undetected? This is where Invisible Inc. really shines - being a host to a multitude of tactical causes and effects without ever being overwhelming, and never letting you settle into a comfortable routine like many of its peers, even classics, do.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495237816\n\nThe soundtrack punctuates the action with surprising vigour and demonstrates some of the best use of reactive music since Proteus. When the tension rises, so does the tempo, making sure your heart will pump faster and faster as the alarm tracker keeps filling up. Likewise the art design is just as slick as one can hope for, taking a good step forward from Mark of the Ninja's and Don't Starve's Saturday morning look while still staying recognizably within Klei's house style.\n\nAs cool as its presentation is, in terms of UI design Invisible does stumble into an occasional tripwire. Finding the correct button to hack that pesky camera instead of a nearby server computer requires a bit too much fiddling with the camera than I'd like, and the times I've found myself unwittingly knocking out a guard with a conciousness monitor suggests that the varying abilities of guards and drones could be more clearly communicated. These are very minor gripes though, and would be hardly noticed if the rest of the game wasn't so well-crafted.\n\nIt is tempting to call Invisible an almost-perfect clockwork of a game but that would hardly do justice to the terror and triumph it evokes each mission and each turn. Every drop of sweat and tears I shed over it makes me more convinced that I'm looking at a future classic. It is the kind of a game that will creep into your mind and steal your heart.","August 6, 2015","true","73.5"," 116 of 123 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","116","123","8","0"

Invisible Inc.'s closest relative is gaming is probably Bionic Dues. Don't feel bad if you've never played or heard of Bionic Dues, because there's only like 3 of us who have. For everyone else, Invisible Inc. is a lot like FTL or Desktop Dungeons, if those games were turn-based stealth games. You spend the vast majority of your time inside missions, sneaking around, trying to hit objectives and robbing safes you come across. You manage several different resources as you do this. Power can be found in consoles, and you can also generate it on your own using different programs. You spend it to disable or turn enemy infrastructure and drones into yours. Alarms build up over time, and also increase when you are spotted or trigger certain things. Cooldowns are another resource to manage, as you can disable guards, but only short periods of time and only every few turns or so. Your items with cooldowns can also do other things. Finally, you have to manage your positioning. That's a bit more abstract than most, but you have to decide whether to split up and cover more ground, or stick together, minimize your visibility profile, and give your agents the ability to support each other. Once you've been through the game a couple times, it will feel like second nature.\n\nAt the beginning of each game, you choose your 2 starting agents (who each have predetermined unique augments, and some starter gear), a power generating program, and a hacking program. Each of these choices affects your overall strategy within missions. It's much like choosing your starting ship in FTL.\n\nAs you rob safes and recover objectives in the game, you get credits to buy your agents weapons, items, and cybernetic augments that they carry with them for the rest of the campaign (or until you sell them). You strategically choose your missions based on the rewards you'll get from them, and have limited opportunities between missions to buy and sell items from a fence. Between missions you can also upgrade your agents' stats directly.\n\nEnemies consist of drones, guards, cameras, daemons, and a handful of other things. Guards are self-explanatory. Drones are like guards, but you can hack them. Cameras are also fairly easily understood. Daemons are things that lurk inside of cameras, drones, and other hackable infrastructure that are essentially one-shot traps that trigger when you fully hack their hosts. The mix of these things you encounter are dictated in part by which corporation you're infiltrating. Each corporation has its own specialties and strengths.\n\nEach campaign lasts for 3 in-game days, with missions taking between 5 or 6 and 12 hours. That means you're running 8 missions, plus the final mission. Each campaign therefore lasts for about 5 or 6 hours of real time.\n\nThis is a poorly written review I did in a few minutes, so try not to mind my jumping around too much. All I'm trying to poorly communicate is that it scratches the same itch as FTL, with procedurally generated everything, big elements of both luck and skill, highly variable starting conditions, and the ability to pursue several strategies, as well as that roguelike sense of getting handed the dumbest stuff and still trying to make it work somehow.","May 23, 2015","true","188.3"," 79 of 84 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","79","84","6","3"

To date the high water mark for me has been Jagged Alliance 2 (+v1.13 mod) with the XCOM reboot and Frozen Synapse filling the other spots on my podium.\n\nXCOM2 has been at the top of my "eagerly-awaiting" list for some time and I figured I'd bridge the wait with Invisible Inc.  Turns out (pun intended) I hugely underestimated this game.  It is brilliant!  Not only is it better than Enemy Unknown/Within but even my prized JA2 may need to step aside.\n\nWhy?\n\nESCALATING TENSION\n\nThe stealth gameplay works wonderfully. As combat and time quickly escalate efforts against you, the need to be efficient in your infiltration is always at the forefront. This prevents idling/turtling as every turn matters. You need to know how far to push and when to cut and run. The pacing is excellent.\n\nMINIMAL LUCK\n\nThere are no probabilities to hit or variable damage. Even the path that enemies will move on their turn can be known. You might think this predictability would reduce the fun - it doesn't - it enhances it. All the information is there but you have to know how to get it.  This makes you supremely responsible for the outcome of your decisions and it is eminently satisfying.\n\nREPLAYABILITY\n\nThis is not a story dependant game. It's about the process, not the ending so repeated playthoughs do not feel repetitive. As the maps are procedurally generated there is no repetition here either. Even character builds are kept fresh between playthoughs as you only pick your initial two team members. Additional members (and their unique abilties), as well as available gear, are random. Rather than min/max a single favourite build, each playthough requires a solution using different tools.\n\nThere is more to praise about this game but the above are what I consider the key points that set it apart and elevate it to the top of the genre.\n\nThis is Game-Of-The-Year worthy.

I know I do it and invariably I come across "this game should be done already" guy.  You all know him.  He's the guy who buys an early access game and then goes on to say the game has a lot of bugs and that it isn't worth the money in its current form blah blah blah.\n\nWell here's the thing about invisible inc.  When I first played this game, it only had 3 characters and 2 or 3 mission types.  The items were limited to basically 2 different guns, some ammo, and med packs.  The hacking was a very simple system and you couldn't upgrade your hacking abilities.  The thing is though, I still had a blast playing it.  In fact, the game in that state was still well worth $15 in my opinion.\n\nA left the game alone for a couple months as I moved and finding a new place for my PC was a bit of an issue.  But when I came back to this game, I found the updates were incredible.  A wide variety of characters with varied skills (6 or 7 I believe).  There are at least 5 missions types and they are suprisingly different in gameplay experience.  Detention centres for example contain a prisoner which may or may not be another agent to add to your roster.  Chief financial suites give you access to vault codes for future Vault missions.  The inventory received a similar upgrade.  Many items and even different types of equipment including augments which improve your characters functionality in their role by giving them unique passive buffs or abilities.  Equipment is no longer limited to guns and ammo but includes hacking aids, stim packs, gadgets like deployable cameras or sound traps, and alternative weapons like darts, tracers, etc.\n\nWhat I am really trying to say here is that this game feels like it is a finished game with all the polish and content to justify its price tag and then some.  Technically, the game runs smoothly, the mechanics behave in a predictable manner without allowing the player to exploit them.  This allows you to plan ahead, and think of strategies that involve more than one turn.  There is nothing worse than having an awesome plan in your head, thinking it all through, executing the first 3 steps, just to have step 4 blow up in your face because the guard decided to turn around for absolutely no reason.  This is what I would call unpredictable mechanics and while a certain level of "randomness" or unpredictability can make the game more fun, Invisible Inc. is a game where once you learn how the enemies behave, the difficulty comes from having to use your brain and stay one step ahead of the game (not from throwing a random guard your way at the perfectly wrong time).\n\nTLDR? This game is leading by example.  This is exactly how early access should work.  The dev's could have cut and run and moved on to another project months ago, and they still would have been less buggy and more fun than a lot of "finished" games out there *cough Looking your way Double Fine cough*.  Klei has shown me that a dev company can truly care about the experience their customers get and work hard to make sure that the final product is something they can proudly put their names on.  If any of the dev's read this seriously GOOD ON YOU!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/243970/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Invisible is a turn-based stealth strategy game. It has often been compared to XCOM, but really these games take entirely different approaches to squad-based tactics. Here, your spy agency has been raided by the dystopian megacorps and you're on the run. You've escaped with two agents, minimal gear, and your hacker AI that's on 72 hours of emergency power. That means you have three days to bust out more agents, steal new gear, and prepare for a decisive strike back at the corporations. Every agent is precious, and if you want to succeed you have to use every resource that you can get your hands on.\n\nThe game is essentially a roguelike strategy game. A run through the campaign takes about 5-6 hours, and win or lose you gain experience towards unlocking new starting options like additional agents or hacking programs. Each mission is a procedurally generated network of rooms filled with safes to crack, terminals to hack, and plenty of guards, robots, cameras, and other defenses. A straight fight with armed guards is out of the question, so you have to peek through doors and stealth around security as much as you can. The behaviors of the guards are simple but must be managed carefully to prevent situations getting out of control. Guards are normally stationary or on a two-point patrol path, but if they see something suspicious, they check it out (using scanners and other tools if they have them!). Fully alerted guards break from their patterns and search for you relentlessly, so stealth is ALWAYS the best option. You can knock out guards with tasers or darts, but when they come to they'll be on full alert. Killing is an option but an expensive one; lethal weapons are expensive, generally need ammunition, and advance the alarm tracker.\n\nThe alarm tracker, by the way, is a brilliant little feature that makes sure you don't take a million years waiting out guard patrols and extended hacks. When you start a mission, the corporations know SOMETHING is going on, but not WHAT. So every turn, the alarm tracker advances a step. Every 5 steps, the alarm level advances and a new security feature comes online. It might be more cameras, it might be tougher firewalls, or it might be additional guards. Certain actions you take can additionally advance the tracker, like being spotted by guards or tripping a hacking Daemon. Your strategy needs to be balanced between caution and speed, and riding that line makes every mission tense and challenging.\n\nAnd that's just the basics! Robotic drones have their own properties and tactics, which ties into the whole hacking side of the game. Your AI can hack any of the networked features of the level to give you access to security cameras, safes, and even take over drones and turrets. This costs power, which you can hack out consoles, generate using your agent skills, or supply with programs purchased for your AI. And this is really the beauty of Invisible, that everything has so many solutions. Just with guards alone, you can create a natural distraction (opening a door) to stealth past them, you can stun them, you can kill them, you can set traps using special items, you can steal keys from them to open up alternate paths, you can hack turrets or drones to take them down with, or you can use special distraction programs to lure them away. Unlike XCOM, the random element isn't in whether or not a dice roll will make your strategy work, it's in what resources you will find to form a strategy around. You're not always going to find personal cloaks or AP-restoring stims, so you have to work with whatever you've got. It's guerrilla espionage, and it's thrilling when you make a plan work.\n\nMissions will earn you credits to buy new gear and upgrade your agents' basic abilities (max AP, inventory slots, etc.), augments to give them new abilities, programs for hacking, and chances to free new agents (up to 4 total). Even the selection of missions is randomized, as well as the travel time between them, so your overarching strategy for each game is going to vary wildly. It's a game made to be played multiple times and the INCREDIBLE wealth of difficulty options ensure that you can play at a level you enjoy. Beginner difficulty lets you rewind up to 5 turns per mission and even restart the entire mission once, allowing you to learn and experiment as much as you want. Experienced loses the restart option and cuts your rewinds down to 3, forming a good middle-ground between Beginner and Expert, the "base" difficulty which only allows one rewind. There are additional modes like Endless where you survive as many days as you can and Time Attack where you only have 2 minutes to take your turn. You can even expand difficulty options in any mode to tailor specific features exactly how you want them.\n\nInvisible has very quickly become the gold standard of strategy for me. The balance of stealth and strategy is perfect, there are tons of items and skills to work with, there are no unwinnable situations, and there's an amazing amount of replayability between the different modes and difficulties. The Klei art style is perfect for this as well, and it does the dark, slick oppression of megacorps really well as you skulk around. There is a story to the campaign but it's a very thin one and hardly the reason to dive deep into this game. It's consistently one of the most rewarding gaming experiences, and more people absolutely need to be playing it.","August 6, 2015","true","74.9"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","47","49","0","0"

Today id like to give unto you my review of the game Invisible Inc.\n\nFor those who haven't played it yet, or are weighing their options carefully as they peruse the reviews of the game, must be aware. Invisible Inc. is a turn based, stealth, procedurally generated game; somewhat reminiscent of games like X-COM or Wasteland in terms of turn based and team deployment, but with a major focus on stealth and subterfuge. Like X-COM, their is some resource management both in-game and out, but not to the same degree. The game is still not fully done yet and the developers are carefully approaching what their vision of the game should be.\n\nNegatives:(I like to start with these first)\n-Very unforgiving of mistakes. Enemies are quick to punish errors with the swift death of your characters. While it is possible to revive fallen units, it is extremely dangerous.\n\n-Balancing. All aspects of the game are undergoing constant tweaks and fixes, that sometimes lead to unfair advantages for both players and enemies.\n\n-Procedurally Generated. No two maps are the same. Certain rooms however will typically have aspects about them that are the same every time(I.e. Holding cell areas always have higher level guards, or robot sentry levels almost always have a random roving eyebot). This by itself is not a negative, but it can be when three or more of these higher difficulty rooms are placed next to eachother, making the player either waste a lot of valuable resources just to find an empty safe room or to enter a bloodbath.\n\nPositive:\n-Most important to mention for positives is the amazing dev team that regularly puts out game changing updates, including any number of new items, characters, revisions, tweaks, updates, etc.; all the while listening to their community.\n\n-Story. While vague so far, the story of Invisible Inc. has been developing more and more with each update; adding new dialogue here, a new description on that item, etc. Once the game is fully created I believe that we shall have a compelling and riveting story for us to play through.\n\n-Art Style. The environments, as well the characters themselves, have a very distinguished and marked style. Cartoonish in appearance but with a gritty realism that punctuates the plot and setting of the game.\n\n-Characters and Leveling. Starting off, you only have access to two characters with which you have full control of in game. All of the current characters within the game are capable of being chosen and played after you have leveled up an arcade-style profile experience level; which increases every time you play the game and complete a campaign run-through. The characters are all dynamically different, both in appearance and capabilities, that allow you to capitalize on certain items, enemies, and strategies that the game has available.\n\n-Interesting Gameplay Mechanics. While most of the game is a turn based, stealth ordeal; you must frequently hack and control electronics that affect events in the players world using an advanced AI, which is essentially a game of resource management. You can get past all of the guards and make it to the loot filled safes scattered around the levels but if you don't carefully conserve the power that your AI uses to hack things for you, you'll be ♥♥♥♥ out of luck.\n\n-Logical Gameplay. Every action must be taken with a myriad of variables to consider. Should you risk sprinting to cover more ground, but possibly alert an unseen guard? Should you purchase more ammo for your characters pistol, or invest in their stealth skill instead? Even something as simple as opening a door must be taken into consideration as you may have no idea whats on the other side. Invisible Inc. gives you the tools with which to complete your goals but it is up to you on how you use them.\n\n-Atmosphere and Setting. "Why are these missions always indoors?" -Shalem. The idea is that you, and a select few others, barely escaped an intelligence agancies form of a coup and you must send agents on missions to gather resources and support against the rising corporate giants around the globe. Set in a (not so far away or unthinkable) dystopian future where corporations seem to have more power than the world governments, you must use fantastic technologies such as implants, lasers, robots and super advanced AI to stop these Corporate menaces. While most of the missions are withing the corporate offices and labs that you are fighting, the game vaguely eludes to you that the rest of the world is none the wiser of whats really going on.\n\nIn conclusion, Invisible Inc. is a solid 8.0/10.0 for me, an avid fan of both stealth and turn based games. It is a very cerebral game, paired with the subtle cunning required for a stealth action;  making for interesting gameplay. While still not fully developed yet, this game is proving that it's great potential is being realized and capitalized on by their dev team. I have no doubts that this game will one day be a GOTY worthy candidate and will be within the libraries of all the strategy nuts out there(Like me!).\n\nThank You for taking the time to read this.\n-Bee","November 11, 2014","true","37.6"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","46","48","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TikiTDO/recommended/243970/","TikiTDO","TikiTDO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TikiTDO/","302 products in account","While the gameplay can have some fun moments, I can't say I'm particularly impressed with many of the design decisions.\n\nThere is certainly some fun to be had in playing the role of elite cyber-spies in a hostile world. The two core mechanics (the sneaky, explory, stabby part, and the hacky, chancy, resource managy part) work well together. The mission selection and character progression parts also add a nice strategic element to the game. The interface works well enough, though it's perhaps a bit lacking on the clarity. However, there are enough things wrong with the game that none of these things really make up for the shortcomings.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve is that there is a consistent refusal to present any pertinent information until after it would have been useful. That's certainly a good way to force replayability, but it does nothing to endear the game enough to actually want to go through the trouble. All it does is ensure that the first play-through is full of annoying experiences that could have been solved with a few more lines of dialog.\n\nIt doesn't end there. The stealth is a bit less exciting than you would expect from the people that made Mark of the Ninja. It uses the standard vision cone system, which doesn't really translate favorably into the slower nature of turn-based games. It's hard to feel excited when sneaking past a bunch of fairly predictable, and very dumb mobile vision cones. The only time there is any semblance of a challenge is when the computer floods the level with dozens of enemies, and broadcasts your location every turn. This takes the game from "stealth" to "I hope the RNG was kind to me."\n\nThe difficulty curve is quite inconsistent. The game is actually really simple once you get going. The missions are straight forward resource management problems; optimizing the use of AP, Power, Items, and Time. I would have liked a few more lessons about conserving resources and priorities at the start, but it's easy enough to figure out with a bit of trial and error. However, it will occasionally ramp up to night impossible when you failed to get a specific item for a particular situation, more often than not because you never even found what you needed. That's acceptable in a rogue-like where most game measure in  minutes, but much less enjoyable in a longer game where even a quick playthrough demands your attention over many hours of gameplay.\n\nThe levels are at the mercy of the RNG, sometimes making even high difficulty tasks a breeze, while other times putting an ever more aggravating set of obstacle in your way on even the easiest maps. There are plenty of dead ends and empty rooms, and little else to explore. With the inclusion of permadeath, and a very limited optional rewind feature this can lead to some annoying situations.\n\nI did enjoy the actual execution of the missions. There was enough flavor to the game that I enjoyed going through the campaign. Unfortunately, it lacked the depth of more complex games like Frozen Synapse, and it failed up for that lack of depth in any useful way.\n\nIn particular, the game would have benefited from a stronger store, and more interactive characters. Judging by the dialog there was a fairly interesting, dark, and deep world behind the game. There are certainly tidbits here and there hinting at an interesting story going on in the background. Unfortunately that world does not really come through; the inter-mission cutscenes are too short, and never change, while in game there is barely any dialog except a few triggered lines whenever you meet specific objectives.\n\nI think there was definitely a missed opportunity for some kind of data-collection mini-game with bits about the world.\n\nSome occasional character banter would have gone a long way; as it is your characters are just bland dolls you control. Sure, the narrator character mentions a bit of backstory when you select them, and they have different looks, and different equipment, but they might as well have been formless blobs for all it mattered. I would have liked to see a bit of in-game dialog of the playable characters reminiscing about old missions, or random events around them. This could have offered some depth to the story, and introduced concepts as the game went on instead of dumping you in a situation you were supposed to expect.\n\nFinally, I did notice a somewhat consistent problem with clicks failing to register. More than a few times I clicked on a character and sent them to a new location only to have my previously selected character run into the center of the action. It's easy enough to deal with by clicking on a character a few times, but it's just one more annoyance that takes away from the experience.\n\nIn all it's a passable turn-based tactics game, sporting a fairly basic stealth element that doesn't feel very well thought out. It doesn't really bring much interesting to the table. It doesn't do a very good job of introducing itself, and when you puzzle it all out the end result is not spectacular. It's a game that tries to force you to play more of it, without actually doing much to make you want more. I can certainly see some people enjoying it, but it's certainly not something that will have any sort of wide appeal.\n\nGive it a try if you really like turn-based tactics games, or if it's on sale. Otherwise save yourself the time and headache.","May 20, 2015","false","19.0"," 135 of 190 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","135","190","4","8"

Expect this game is quite unique as it's a stealth game where you don't want to kill people.\n\nThe gameplay :In this game you have to tackle on various corporations with more or less the same goal everytime : go in, keep a low profil, hack something or steal something, then get out, if possible with everyone alive.  It's very fun and rewarding to hack and use our brain to avoid the agents and other devices in our way. The gameplay is so solid and you really feel incontrol of your team : if you win, it's thanks to you. If you screw, it's also because of you!\nBetween each mission you have a world map where you can select your next target, with informations about the kind of mission and rewards, as well as the time spent to get there. Once 72hours is gone, you have to go on the final mission (that is btw probably the less interesting mission, kinda like xcom once again). Every missions you did before that served to prepare your agents, as well as your equipment for the final showdown.\n\nBetween missions you also have to choose, sell/buy your collected loot to keep what is the most useful for your crew, as well as uppgrading your agents and AI skills if you want. There is a lot of choices in aptitudes and items, so others playthrough are encouraged. Besides finishing one playthrough gives you xp and unlocks more agents, items.\n\nThe design of the game as well as the world portayed is REALLY stylish and unique. The main characters voices are really good and the graphics are also top quality.\n\nThe bad :On the bad points, I have to say that the story is not that interesting even though it seemed promising at first. The game tries to hint about a big conspiracy, with lot of corporations involves as well as government, but it ultimately fails to explain anything and the end is rather abrupt and feels very cheap. Worse, the ending feels like it was cut before a real ending was going to happen, like we are going to expect something more. I know this game expects the player to play multiple playthrough because of it's solid gameplay, but for me this was a big turn off.\nThe only other bad points about this game, is that it does not explain quite a few importants things. For instance I was hoarding implants for my future agents, until I discovered that I would unlock new agents only after finishing the game once. Very frustrating. As a conclusion I have to say that this game was a really good surprise. It's very solid and fun, with a unique design and style. But don't expect to have a compeling story, but I think if you are already aware of this fact before starting to play, you will enjoy the game a lot more than me.","January 26","true","8.0"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","34","36","2","0"

Even if they don't add many more features (as I write this, in a week a major 'warez' based update is coming out) it's still a really enjoyable, deep thinking game. It has even taken the place of X-Com for the time being, for those times I want my turn based tactical combat fix.\n\nAnother reason it really came to my attention is the hard focus on stealth gameplay -- alot like Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell -- but with a charming, cartoony art style. Your agents will end up being found and mercilessly gunned down as your Central Operator expresses her disappointment in your performance. And then you begin again with a fresh new team, in a fresh new environment (did I mention its PROCEDURALLY GENERATED which is something X-Com was never able to master) to raid, pillage and escape from various corporate facilities.\n\nIt's also a game that makes you say "Just one more turn" and staying up far later than intended playing it. If any of what I've said above peaks your interest, it get's a solid Recommend from me.\n\nTry picking it up on sale for insane value, but it's totally worth the $15.99 it is now.","October 20, 2014","true","5.8"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","2"

Set in a future where corporations rule the world and control the most advanced technology. Using 2-4 agents and the Incognita hacking system, you take different kinds of missions to steal money and upgrades for your team, all on the fly, in order to take on greater challengers and the inevitable final (very hard) mission.\n\nHighly recommended to tactical turn-based lovers.\n\nSeveral very impressive difficulties with an even more impressive array of custom choices that affect map generation, guard count, and many other aspects of the gameplay and difficulty. Permadeath is semi-optional but since you always feel like you deserve it when you are caught (and there are many other items and tactics that can still bail you out on even the hardest modes) it is fun to keep on. You can adjust pretty much every aspect of the challenge in the options, including Endless Mode.\n\nFully animated, fantastic voice acting and solid, slick writing. There's a story happening here with specific characters somewhat like x-com, but the characters are decidedly stronger and more unique - each playable agent is a specific character with endemic abilities, and there are alternative versions of each character with new costumes and abilities, all unlockable fairly easily.\n\nEven the music is satisfying and seems to be somewhat adaptive, pulsing more intensity as you make crucial mistakes and things heat up. The sound design and art direction in general seem immaculate. Other than grunts and 'huh?'s in the missions, only the two 'overseer' characters and Incognita (the hacking AI critical to your mission) herself are voiced, but everything recorded glows. Nonetheless, despite all the animated scenes and voiced dialogue, there isn't a single thing you can't easily skip through when trying to beat the game for the Nth time.\n\nFor me it picks up right where X-Com: EU/EW left off, with an evolving focus on moving safely and unseen through cover and controlling confrontations before they happen, and actual all out combat being rare or more or less phased out. Still, there are weapons, a combat system, armor and even dealing with bodies. All are equally important, but lethal ammo is somewhat expensive to find (and to use).\n\nThis game is insane for the price. I really think you should get it.","May 16, 2015","true","39.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","29","32","4","0"

If you've played Mark of the Ninja you probably have an idea of how well Klei handles stealth and it shines once again here in the form of turn-based gameplay, great skill/inventory progression and elaborate, procedurally generated levels that make every playthrough unique and results in high replayability.\n\nThe premise is simple enough; you choose two agents at the beginning of a playthrough (and can unlock more to choose from as you play, each with their own unique loadout and abilities), pick from a list of randomized targets that offer various benefits - such as banks containing large amounts of credits to buy items with or upgrade your agents' skills, cybernetic labs to augment your agents and offer them new abilities, server farms to improve your hacking software, or even detention centers where additional agents may be held that can be freed and join your team - and do what you can to prepare for one final mission. The different targets will have varying degrees of security which increases as you complete more assignments and start to build a reputation. Along with this is an "Alarm Level" system that increases for each turn you spend skulking around the buildings, adding a sense of urgency to every mission and making you weigh the benefits of staying longer to gather more resources against the risk of being caught due to the rising security levels. While initially places you break into may just have basic guard patrols and easily hacked technology, eventually the targets will start to have armored guards resistant to the tools at your disposal, automated drones and turrets that can't simply be knocked out and firewalls that trigger various defenses when tapped into; it's up to you as you play to make sure you prepare accordingly for the escalating difficulty and stay one step ahead of the new obstacles put in your way.\n\nTo top off the solid gameplay, Invisible also has wonderful atmospheric design. Between the music, characters and art direction this game pulls off a great near-future feel combined with espionage that really sells the setting and "story" despite how simple both are; you may very well find yourself basing your Agent choices not just on their utilities but who they are as characters in regards to their biographical information and personalities.\n\nIncredibly challenging and equally addictive, it's hard not to recommend this for as cheap as it is given the polish and care that's obviously gone into it. If you're looking to infiltrate high-tech facilities with informational warriors and feel the heat as you try to escape with the goods, I'm confident that Invisible, Inc. will more than meet your expectations as it did with mine.","December 30, 2014","true","138.2"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"

The concept sounded good, but I figured it might be one of those games that you really need to invest loads of time into to learn all the various parts, skills, techs and strategies.\nFar from it! The game mechanics are simple enough and there's not a lot here that will confuse people (although some perks are a little unclear as to what they do) but man, it will challenge you!\n\nThe game is challenging and your death and demise is ALWAYS your fault! There is no luck here. Laziness and lack of forethought will be your undoing. That's the beauty of this game. Randomly generated levels combined with solid game rules and permadeth equals loads of replayability and agonising consequences for screwing up.\n\nIf you like games where it's all about planning without the effect of luck, undpredicatble levels and the risk of losing with one mistake, this is for you.\n\nIt's not a shooter, in fact, that's your last and often unwanted resort. It's a stealth game to the max and it teases you with the random levels, as sooooo many times I've died just wanting to explore that next room, even though I've completed my mission and the exit is JUST THERE!!! Do you leave an unconscious agent so at least your game can continue, or or do you attempt to strategically resue them knowing that the gaurd numbers ar eincreasing and that they will find you eventually.\n\nGreat game.

With the number of optional things to do in each level, turns spent waiting for guards to move out of the way or your cooldowns to recharge still feel productive because you almost always have other objectives to work towards if you can't go for the final prize right away. And the combination of a constantly ticking alarm level with your most gamechanging gadgets having long cooldowns mean that even with the turn based system, you still want to carefully consider how to use each item. The biggest complaint I've heard so far is the short length of the campaign, but I did not find that to be a problem, because the game is very replayable with a decent number of different agents, items and augmentations available, many of which synergize well with certain other characters and pieces of equipment, as well as a great list of options for customizing your own campaigns with endless modes, faster alarms, sturdier guards, or any combination thereof.","July 29, 2015","true","33.4"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","0"

If you are like me and have played most any squad based tactical turn based game then you will like this a lot. First of all it is from Klei and those guys did Mark Of The Ninja and Don't Starve. I love those.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good and the art direction is neat. Sound and such are good as well.\n\nBut you play those games for the gameplay and it is quite solid. First the missions and objectives are quite good and this game is more akin to Commandos as you actually try not to kill the bad guys. You are leading a team of spies on espionage missions. You can kill but it is discouraged.\n\nThere are quite a few interesting mechanics that I have never seen in this type of game before. There is a fully fleshed out stealth which is a novelty for this type of games in general. There is also hacking which is pretty neat and later on in the game you get a lot of gadgets that make it very tactical how to go about completing the level. And talking about levels they are all procedurely generated which is pretty sweet and gives a lot of replay value. And one of the most novel things about the game is the alarm system. When you start a level an alarm bar starts filling up and different things happen when you get to new levels - more guards, hacks costing more, etc. So this makes it so you cannot take your time and a lot of times you are under pressure - do I go for that room or do I leave.\n\nOverall, I feel that the game offers a lot of cool new mechanics I have not seen before with good graphics and sound, and stellar art direction. And all of it procedurally generated.\n\nThe only drawback is that it can get a bit repetitive and since there really isn't a whole lot of story to it (yet) you might find it hard to go for another playthru or mission. I hope they do add more things to do between missions as right now it is just a map screen where you choose where to go next. Also, more variety in the mission tiles will be welcome as well as possibly ways to affect the light sources thru hacks etc.\n\nOverall highly recommended.","November 28, 2014","true","14.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

Like a single player version of Spy Vs. Spy. Multiplayer would be very interesting.\n\nInvisible Inc brings a lot to the table with slow paced game play where you have to think about where to explore next, can you spend the time looking for more loot and risk more guards showing up? Do you split up your team or keep them close to work together? Hack the safe or cameras?\n\nEasy to get into, but the challenge lies in balance the experience and equipment, taking only the necessary equipment with you  so you can steal enough loot to get the next upgrade.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that likes turn based strategy. The game is not easy or a walk in the park. It is not conventional in that you don't have to (and probably shouldn't) complete every level 100% before leaving it and moving to the next.

I'm not a fan of the genre due to its slow pace, often annoying cameras, unclear enemy vision/hearing cones, and repetitive AI dialogue (especially with AI that--after a mere 10 seconds--forgets you just killed all of their friends despite the pile of bodies and goes back to their patrol route like nothing happened).\n\nInvisible, Inc. distills the ideals of the stealth genre down into an easily digestible, cartoonish, isometric game that manages to be challenging and rewarding without feeling cheap, and also solves a lot of control/camera issues that are found in full on 3D stealth titles.\n\nMy sole complaint thus far is that--much like in FTL or any roguelike really--the items you can find or purchase seem too random to where you can either get a bunch of really cool stuff, or a bunch of meh. At the very least the agency merchant (Monst3r) could sell more items whenever you're between missions.

Haven't come across anything unbeatable yet (not counting the guy who posted the screenie of a level not possible to reach the exit, heh), but certainly difficult (Heavy blocking a vault with 2 guards inside it first mission, detention centre with 2 patrol guards and a Captain inside, double Heavy patrols, etc). I'm guessing that there's some general rules followed for placement of stuff, besides the obvious (no guards in starting room), and it seems pretty well done so far, the missions don't feel like randomness jumbled together, so good job. They feel like story missions even though they are in fact proceduraly generated. It's a bit like the generation of Binding of Isaac levels, except it feels less random than that even- I imagine it's  basically the same though, placing certain things with a small bit of patterning.\n\nre: graphics, interface, music\nI can never get tired at starting a fresh level and hearing the music start up, and then looking at Internationale's animation and grumpy face, good touch :)\nAlso the random blocks moving up and down and around in Incognita and the main game screen while playing a level. I never really paid attention to them before, but it's way better than a blank background :)\nWhile I'm here, the interface is really great too. I'm playing fullscreen and I just realised how the interface never gets in the way of anything, it's never intrusive, and even though the game is in isometric view, I never have problems seeing anything or seeing where stuff is (I do switch to incognita for a broader view sometimes), I feel like I've always got a good view of the immediate area and the whole level, and it always feels like the interface elements are invisible until I need them, since they take up so little space. I also rarely feel the need to rotate the levels at all, I've played a ton of missions and completely forgot that I could rotate with Q and E that it turned out to be a huge surprise to me.\n\nre: gameplay and balance\nBoth are great, keeping more entertained than the other half dozen games I purchased recently. It's a "hard" game, if you're a veteran at tactical turn-based you'll probably find it easy though (at least I think it's easy once you've got the game mechanics pat down).\n\nReccomend at base sale price Y/N: Y, if you're interested in this kind of game it's a fair deal in terms of gameplay(how much fun) & replayability(how many hours before you get bored) - or wait for an eventual sale, but either way.\n\nI have a low threshold for getting bored, I get bored by games really easy, so two thumbs up.

I didn't keep up with the game much during its beta development, so I was extremely surprised by the amount of quality content and polish pumped into the game for its release. I certainly have a bit of brand loyalty due to my extensive admiration of Don't Starve, but I'm under the heavy impression that Klei is one the best developers in respect to their early access protocol. Invisible Inc. certainly bolsters their track record. In fact, Klei probably fights with Amplitude for my favorite niche indie game developers. Out of my 100+ steam friends, only one other seems to have played the game, so I figure it's all the more worthwhile to try to get the name out there.\n\nAnyway, Invis Inc. is a squad-based tactical stealth game with a hacking emphasis and a beautiful cover and line-of-sight system. I hear it often referred to as "Stealth XCOM," and I think that fits the bill somewhat well if you're going for a short but sweet description such as that. Otherwise, I'd say Invisible inc. is very unique for what it is. It sports decent replayability thanks to randomized layouts, rogue-like item procurement, and unlockable content for future runs, but the amount of these features certainly don't stack up to other more prominent rougue-likes such as Binding of Isaac and whatnot. I'm often reminded of old stealth-based board games while playing due to the tile-based movement and layout.\n\nThe game takes place in a cyberpunk future wherein megacorporations have replaced governments and your squad of spies, fully armed with an anthropomorphic hacking supercomputer "Incognita," cybernetic implants, and futuristic gadgets, fight the man pro-proletariat under their noses. Or at least, as under their nose as possible. Crisp voiceovers are  a pleasant feature considering Klei's indie nature, especially with Incognita's Hal-esque quips prodding your throughout the game with a snarky twist. A fully (and gorgeously) animated cutscene accents the beginning and end of the game, although this aspect becomes moot quite quickly in a game meant to be replayed consistently a la most games with randomized features. The ending is pretty neat though, I'll say that much. Music is great, akin to espionage titles such as Gunpoint. It gets more intense as your alarm level raises as well, which is another nice feature. Oh yeah, great art style too. The little portraits of your spies' long, Norman Rockwell-esque faces slowly animated in boredom as you pick your next action is probably my favorite part of the HUD. Jeff Agala seems to have a knack for creating distinct and appealing artistic themes for the games he's created art for.\n\nSpeaking of HUD, the games does an amazing job at displaying what you need to know mechanically in order to properly make your way through the corporations with being caught. Enemy line of sight is clearly portrayed through different stylistic and color cues depending on whether you'll be hidden, slightly noticed, or clearly seen (all of which play a big part.) It's something that's changed since I played it in early access, and makes the game much, much more enjoyable. The cover system is satisfying and very well-done. It feels very rewarding to find yourself undetected inside a room otherwise completely monitored by cameras and guards. Finding out how to move undetected is easy as well, as your path in question is color coded depending on how much you'll be seen on the way (white/yellow/red.) Characters are unique and all share different roles and potential. Depending on what items you get through the game, you can build some real monsters on the way. (I'm looking at you, Nika and Sharp.) The stages and scenery also look great in a cyberpunk Deus Ex: HR kind of way.\n\nI could probably go on, but I think I've droned on enough anyway.

It manages to avoid the problem many stealth games appear to have, which is that every room is a puzzle to get through on its own with no relation to the rest of the mission, often with alarms cooling down after a few seconds of waiting and with oblivious guards. Invisible Inc is different. The alarm won't go down, the guards won't overlook you, and your agents aren't bulletsponges. In this game you will need to get through the whole facility and exit with your objective(Or without, if you fail it) preferably before the alarm is raised and all the guards come looking for you. To assist you in this, aside from your skilled agents, is the ability to hack into the building's security. You can take over cameras, drones, and almost everything electronic. It does stealth right - It's hard, it's lethal if you get spotted(But not impossible), and yet gentle enough that you can take risks and experiment with different tactics and builds to see how they perform and to push to the limits of your skill and the guard's vision.\n\nBeware though, if you are easily discouraged, this may not be the game for you. It takes from roguelikes and if you lose your agents, that's the end of that run. An agent who dies can be revived in the mission with expensive medi-gel, if you can get to them before the guards surround them, but if you leave without them they are lost forever(Or until you start a new game, at least) The game is harsh, but fair. If your agents get shot, they go down. If you shoot a guard, they also go down. Guards who have seen you will actively hunt for you, and if you move too slowly your presence will be detected, and the alarm raised. You may also find that if you are not prepared, you are up against much better guarded facilities than you can handle.\n\nAll in all, it's very much worth a buy, offering a unique experience that will allow you to keep coming back to it. And what's more, the developpers seem to be dedicated to finishing it. On your main menu there is a countdown in days for when the next update will come around. So if you get tired, you know how long until you can get back in and explore again","January 20, 2015","true","24.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

A truly remarkable, and downright mindnumbingly great game. One of the most interesting parts is that success or failure isn't merely some random luck of the die, but the result of your action. In a sense, you feel you succeed because you took the steps to succeed, and you feel like you failed because of your own mismangement, and not because of the game's cruelty to you. It's a game that gives you all the time you want for your turns (unless you're playing time attack), deciding where you want to put your agents, where you want to move them, what to do, what to hack and the like. But it only gives you very few opportunities to take those decisions back. You know that when you do make your agent do something, you hack something, that is a decision that you made and you will pay for it, however good or bad it will affect you in the end.\n\nOne of the most amazing things in the game is the soundtrack. Not merely for how wonderful it is, but how it actually slowly changes from a subdued theme to a heart pumping track as the alarm levels pile up, making you feel the tension that's filling the air as security becomes more and more difficult to deal with. It add to that layer of how the game feels, how everything is meant to get you into the mood of how tense all the action is getting.\n\nI will say, the game isn't perfect. It does have its flaws. The story, though nice and quite good, is a rather short one. Even with the tension of 72 hours, you're given a story that gives you details, but only just. You get some idea of the world, but not enough to get a better picture. But these are issues that don't detract from the solid game that is still there.","May 12, 2015","true","299.3"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","21","26","4","0"

This game is supposed to be kind of a fusion of both, a stealth-based tactical RPG. I was dissatisfied with it for reasons I’ll list below but because its was extremely early Alpha I decided to just wait until it became more complete. Unfortunately it really hasn’t changed much.\n\nRight now the game is a mess, people claim it is hard, but it’s all artificial difficulty to an extremely punishing degree. Unlike beloved stealth games like MGS, Thief, Splinter Cell, Dishonored, and Klei's own Mark of the Ninja this game actively punishes you for taking your time and being cautious due to an alarm system that’s constantly ticking up from the start of a level even if you’ve been completely undetected.  The procedurally generated levels also can throw you into unwinnable situations.  Even fans of XCOM: EU will be probably be dissatisfied because as I said this game punishes you for being cautious, which is the cornerstone of good XCOM playing. Your agents aren't nearly as expendable as XCOM troopers too which makes it even more ridiculously punishing. Stunning enemies is rather pointless because they just get up after two turns and shooting them just brings down the whole building on you. The only real way to beat levels right now is totally speed-run them (Which is even harder due to the procedural generated levels), which is not what a stealth game is inherently about; stealth games are about being taking your time and exploring your surroundings by doing things like studying camera locations and guard patrol patterns. Invisible Inc. just throws that all away and it really suffers for it.\n\nThis game as it is right now is just for masochists. But it still is very early in development and I really hope Klei turns it around because there is a lot of potential here to make a fun and fair game. The groundwork is all there.\n\nI’ll keep this review updated when big enough updates come around.","August 23, 2014","false","1.3"," 195 of 336 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","195","336","3","17"

However, the premise, and how elegantly these components come together, is nothing short of art.\n\nAs the driving force of a spy organization on its last legs after some unknown infiltration, your last two agents must undertake missions around the world in a last-ditch attempt to regain capital and resources, in the form of bionic augments for your agents, buffs for your UI internet ICE program, Incognita, cool-as-the-other-side-of-the-pillow spytech, and cold hard cash for whatever else comes along.\n\nThe squad at Klei seemed to have considered everything, alllowing for your agents to lure the hapless security guards out of position for them to be avoided, subdued, or removed with extreme prejudice, according to your preference as a player.  Offsetting this level of care, "Invisible, Inc." is BRUTAL.  One mistake, and your agents will be spotted, cornered, and removed from play with one-shot-one-kill nonchalance.\n\nFrom the art style, reminiscent of Nagel-gone-Tron, to the "let's play it again" gameplay, "Invisible, Inc. is a masterpiece, and is one of those games that infiltrates my thoughts while I'm away from the keyboard.

With the exception of the final level, combat/gun battles bring in the law of diminishing returns, so your primary resources really are desks, corners, chair backs, potted plants, etc. Confrontation is ultimately unavoidable, but even then because of the escalating alert levels, ambush and misdirection work far better than firepower.\n\n- its exquisite interface. Take the classic board game template with its sense of control and overview. Randomize the 'board' each time and have it unveil itself bit by bit as you move across it (especially clever here is the way electronic devices such as consoles, cameras, safes, act as little 'beacons' within unexplored areas, helping you feel out the edges of the map). Switch between AI and agent-operator modes at the touch of a button, spin the map, and even toggle the amount of wall cut-away to keep abreast of all your options.\n\n- its emphasis on tactical gameplay. Some may disagree with me here, but I feel that there's only a limited amount of strategy involved, as procedurally-generated levels and randomized items mean you are mostly confronting unkowns. It's all about how you adapt your options to each new circumstance rather than sitting back to watch a master-plan execute itself, and this means each turn is as riveting as the last.\n\n- its high tension-low frustration ratio. Despite its crazy odds, perma-death, and fearsome difficulty at the later levels, I've never once felt the kind of exasperation that most games present when ratcheting up the challenge levels. Great pacing and balance keep this game totally absorbing even while you're failing (which is what you'll spend an awful lot of your time doing).\n\n- its charming visual design, characterisation and voice acting, which loads of other reviews have already commented on.\n\nMost of my other games are shooters, but even I can see that Invisible Inc. is what gaming can be at its best...","May 8","true","242.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

As such, it fits a niche that I haven't seen filled, and it does it quite well.  The turn system is very similar to X-Com, but without the randomness.

This is a good thing, and it eliminates the frustration found in X-Com where your sniper would miss time and time again on shots that had a 99% chance to hit.  While the AI in this game is not the smartest, the fact that every level is randomly generated, and you can't go back to a previous save when you fail, means that every playthrough will be different and still challenging.  During Early Access this game was incredibly good, but incredibly hard.  The release version now includes diffculty options and a story arc (a very good one so far, I might add) allowing you to ease into the game.  Once you are finished with the story in the game, you can play on endurance mode, where the game will just keep randomly generating harder and harder missions for you.

Invisable, Inc. managers to combine the turn-based "combat" from games like XCOM and combine it with the stealth of games like Deus Ex and Splinter Cell. The game has a unique mechanic where the level of security goes up every five turns, meaning that if you take your time you may have a much harder time escaping later. This also means that you can't just wait around for the guards to move because more will show up if you take too long. Another great thing is that the guards NEVER give up searching after they see you. The bottom line is if you want a very tactical stealth game based on skill and planning and not waiting and luck, this could be the game for you. It feels very polished for an early-access game.","August 19, 2014","true","19.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

In my opinion it plays like a blend of old school xcom (line of sight mechanics, turn based gameplay, overwatching) and the first metal gear solid games where stealth is a huge part of gameplay and getting noticed by guards has dire consequences. It is not an easy game at all, however you do feel like you're getting better and learning more after every death.

After I got over the fact that there is no simple way to buy a gun and shoot everybody I realised that right now this is one of the most interesting and innovate stealth strategy games on the market. And besides, where's the fun in a stealth game where you can simply buy a machine gun to mow down all your enemies?\n\nA lot of stealth games encourages you to stand around for ages to wait for guards to get into the right positions so that you can do whatever it was you set out to do. Invisible Inc recognises that if you were a superspy, you wouldn't be able to spend all day waiting around while the entire corporate fortress you have infiltrated goes into full lockdown mode. A superspy would move fast, take what they came for, and get out.\n\nThere is a nice tension to Invisible Inc. and it really feels satisfying when your team of highly trained espionage agents move like wraiths through a building hacking systems, stealing corporate info and tech and dissapearing before the security system realises what is going on. Take too long, and the chances of your agents making it out alive becomes smaller every turn.\n\nIf you like stealth games and you can deal with something that it a little tense and challenging, you should definitely buy this game. A word of warning though, this game can be really punishing and the learning curve is quite steep, so be prepared to die early on and start over a few times.\n\nMy only complaint at this stage is that the game could use a little bit more content and a lot more context. The procedurally generated missions are fine, but outside of missions there is very little to do. The story mode involves you having agents on the run, infiltrating corporation after corporation in preparation for a final mission. There is an "Endless" mode but right now that is simply story mode again without the final mission, which means that essentially it feels and plays a bit like a survival game. It really feels like there should be a "career" mode (for lack of a better term) where you can systematically build your espionage agency.\n\nThat said, the price is reasonable and the game is still in early access. Knowing Klei it is likely that more content will be added before and after the full release.","January 2, 2015","true","52.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

In every level the enemy hacks your ai and rises the alarm level every game round until there are more and more guards swarming the level. And if you take out a guard it does not raise an alarm(only if you kill a guard, the alarm level goes up) but start to search the surroundings. So this spy game is basically not about stealth but getting your mission done while being hunted by guards. And this concepts makes this game for my taste incedibly annoying. Its not about careful planning and tactics. Its more about having luck to take the right way in the beginning, dodging guards by staying out of line of sight and clicking things.\n\nI also don't like the automatically generated maps. The result is that all you do is hacking terminals, hacking cameras, hacking safes or free a prisoner. All that with a simple mouse click. Always the same, even if the levels look different. If the game is difficult then not in cause of a complex tactical situation but just because there are many auto-generated guards swarming the room you have to go through.\n\nThere are most of the time no "alternate solutions". You can't expect more than an additional door.\n\nI was expecting a more Deus-Ex like gaming experience, with nice gadgets, more complex hacking, real stealth, alternate approaches and ways to solve a problem. Remember that game? Tons of way to get into a enemy base. Secret intel about the enemy base to collect. NPCs you could talk/force into helping you. Background information about the things you do. I also miss any kind of small story lines about the companies and enemies you rob.\n\nSo... No immersion. No believable game world. Just automatically generated level where you start to get hunted by guards sooner or later while trying to find the exit.","October 21, 2014","false","2.1"," 55 of 92 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","55","92","6","0"

Its difficult and you have to think about a lot of different aspects with every single move you make as they WILL have consequences for how the level plays out.You also have to be careful not to waste turns as the security becomes more intense with every security level.

I've been playing it over the past 2 weeks, and the more I play, the more I like it. Currently have 45 or so hours clocked in the game, which is actually the second highest playtime of any game in my Steam library! It's also one of the most addictive games I have played in recent memory that keeps drawing you back for more. Those 45 hours were played in under 10 days.\n\nAnyways, the gist of the game is that it is a punishing "rogue-lite" turn-based strategy game, with a heavy emphasis on stealth. It draws inspiration from XCOM Enemy Unknown and has got similar interface, but the core tactical gameplay is very different.\n\nThe game's campaign can be completed pretty quickly (on your first try on Beginner, you should do it in under 4 hours), but this game has been thoroughly designed with increasing difficulty levels in mind. From Beginner to Experienced, and then to Expert, you should get three complete runs at least, each offering a unique playing experience. Also, you will die a lot, particularly when you get to expert, so the game makes you learn from your mistakes to improve future runs.\n\nI myself played the game on Beginner first, then after 15 or so tries I got through Expert, after which I played Expert Ironman and finally completed Endless 5/10 days in the same run.\n\nThe game's levels are always randomly generated. Initially, I didn't like this, cause sometimes you can be dealt an unfair hand and the level generated could be extremely difficult to traverse. But eventually, over time, you learn to deal with it.\n\nThere's an element of risk vs reward. Do you go slow, at the expense of your alarm tracker increasing quickly...or do you go faster, at the expense of being spotted by the enemy?\n\nEven though I've played for 45 odd hours, there are so many unique combinations of augments, programs, items and weapons that the game has got an incredible room for experimentation. Since all of these are randomly obtained or bought along the way, you always have to adapt your playstyle, and as such, the game doesn't become boring or repetitive.\n\nThere are 4 different enemy corporations, each of them having a different unique threat, so that adds to keep the game fresh as well. There's also around 7 or 8 different mission types, and you have to make your choices count on which mission type to select, based on your needs.\n\nWhen I played the game on Beginner at first, I liked it. Then moving on to Expert, I found it too frustrating to the point I was almost going to stop playing. However, once I cleared that hurdle and moved on to Ironman and Endless runs, I have grown to absolutely love the game.\n\nRecommended if you like turb-based strategy like XCOM, and/or if you like stealth games, and/or if you like challenging games that punish and make you learn from your mistakes.","June 13, 2015","true","50.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","18","25","2","0"

For an early access version, it's really well polished and balanced. Without knowing this I'd think it was a full release version. Before I played it I didn't think that it was possible to do a roguelike, procedural environment suitable for stealth gameplay, but there it is. This is a gem. Tough, fair, fun.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo it came out of early access and it's even better. There are voiceovers, there is a final mission that is a total nailbiter and some cinematics. I dig the art style. I just beat the game on expert and hoo boy, only 53% of achievements unlocked. And because it's a roguelike, replaying on tougher challenges (and the endless mode and the endless plus mode) means that I can keep playing without getting bored: levels don't repeat themselves.\n\nThe one OP thing seems that the rescue missions give you extra agents. Once you're up to 4 it makes the later missions a lot easier. I'm not sure whether 4 agents is the maximum you can have, but even with 4, the last mission becomes a hairball quick. I won't talk about the last mission not to spoil it, but the layout also changes from one replay to the next (I failed my first ironman take on it), so it can affect your tactics greatly.\n\nPro tip: guards have two vision cones: the big cone (noticed squares) and smaller cone inside of it (watched squares). You can step into noticed squares without getting shot, and guards will investigate that square. You can kite them off their paths this way.\n\nYou're welcome.","March 24, 2015","true","38.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Three guards bore down on them, weapons drawn. Banks looked wistfully at the ginger hacker who had become her friend, then shook her head, reached out, and took Int's hand. "I'll see you next go 'round." she whispered, and jammed her custom paralyzer into her friend's arm. The frail hacker's eyes went wide with betrayal, then understanding as half a dozen bullets slammed first into Banks. then her own thin frame.

When it only takes one shot to kill you, the fact that you're breaking into a facility filled with guards and robots and (most of the time) making it out alive again feels incredibly empowering. Also it makes each characters untimely demise feel all the more painful.

This adds in beautiful artwork and voice acting, although the gameplay proved a bit klunky for the first two hours.\n\nOnce I broke the learning curve and began winning six or seven missions in a row, the game continued to reward me with extra items and improved skills (no surprise there). Even for an alpha game, this is a great buy. Glad I picked it up for 25% off.\n\nUPDATE: Still a great game, but the developers seem to have thrown on a lot more mechanics than necessary.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/left4dinner2/recommended/243970/","left4dinner2","Law Abiding Engineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/left4dinner2/","144 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have only played this game for a small amount of time, and I do have a few other things to try out for it, but here is my review on the game, Invisible, Inc.\n\nFirst thoughts, this game is challenging and even sometimes unfair because of how hard and tricky it can be to complete the objectives, not just partially, but completely.   It is very punishing for if you make mistakes, such as not looking before entering a room, or for not closing the door behind you as you ran pass it.   However, this game is somewhat like a game of chess.  You have to think ahead, plan on what to do if certain events occur, and know when to stay down and wait, and when to be aggressive and go for the push.   With that said, this game will not do well for those who play without thinking, or jump first, look second.\n\n\nGameplay:   Invisible, Inc. is a top-down isometric game that is turn-based, meaning that after you do whatever it is you do, the enemy has their turn to do whatever it is they do.   Also, this is a rogue-style game, so you will die often, and when you do, you will start from the very beginning.    In terms of mechanics, you pick to play with two agents who each have their own little niche in things.  One agent has better movement ability, so he can move farther and let others move farther too.  Another agent can scan for computers and electronics in a certain radius.  Aside from that, the agents all have their own, slightly unique, stats.  The stats are broken down to Stealth (affects movement), Inventory (storage space), Anarchy (affects stealing traits), and Hacking (affects hacking skills).   You earn money to buy upgrades.\n\nThere are also items and weapons that can be used to assist you in the break-in.  These range from lethal weapons such as pistols and rifles, to non lethal weapons, such as paralyzers and target marking guns.   There are also tools to be used in helping such as an invisible cloaking device, items to instantly hack a computer or camera, or a noise distracter to draw the attention away from you.    With storage being limited, you have to think wisely about what to buy/take and what to sell or not take.\n\nAside from tools and weapons, there are collectables to steal that will fetch a nice sum of money, an even hostages to rescue, who can help reveal more locations for you to break into.\n\n\nGraphics:   Just looking at the pictures on the store page should give you a good enough idea on what to expect.  IMO, the good thing about graphics like these, is that they are unique enough to give it its own style and not rely on 'super 4k HD parallax & mega bloom" style of graphics, and thus keeps the focus on the game itself, rather than the looks.   And of course, people with weaker performing computers, can easily run this game.\n\nSound/music:   Not many sounds or music things going on but the current sounds that are heard, are good in that they make it easy to tell what it is that is going on when you hear it, like the sound of quick loud footsteps means a target is running, instead of walking.  Or the Alert, target spotted, sound played when you get spotted.   There is very little variety, if any, music, but that keeps the atmosphere focused.  Personally, I wouldn't mind there be more styles of music, or a music style change after the guards have spotted you for the first time (kind of like how payday the heist was)\n\nOther thoughts:   This review will be updated sometime after the big big update that is set for sept. 30.   Since there are hints for new things coming, I will most likely change this if it adds more stuff to the game.  Until then, I would like to point out that this is an EA game, and it is clear that it is not complete.  What I mean by this, is that the story mode of this game, is short.  After you complete, you unlock Endless Mode.   And after playing through it a few times, there is nothing much to do.   The levels are randomly generated I believe, and that does give it a nice 'new ffel' to things, but the building tiles used for each 'unique' place, are pretty similar and it can be repetitive.    Also, being randomly generated, there are times where the AI or the setup of the guards, is just outright, impossible to counter, and usually ends up being a game where you either all die together, or one person makes a break for it, but make sure to not get spotted, or else you have one action to do before you get shot.\n\n\n\nOverall:  This is a great turn-based stealth game that has a lot of potential, and in my opinion, is an example of an EA game, done right.   Hopefully this next update will add the amount of stuff that it is showing.  Til then, I'm just going to try out new things and see how it goes.","September 28, 2014","true","16.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

This game is a perfect example of Early Access Done Right.\nThe game is built around a solid base of turn-based stealth with sound risk/reward mechanics, and new features are added every patch that add to the experience without introducing horrid imbalance or aggravating bugs (yet).\n\nThe core game is very challenging, even on easy, and mistakes are often brutally punished. But it's a good kind of challenge. Once your agents are skilled up and have a decent augment or two to their abilities you'll be much better equipped to roll with the punches. The brilliant part is that the punches get harder the longer you play. If you risk a lot early, you can be ahead of the curve, if you play it slow and safe then you may find yourself ill-equipped for later challenges.\n\nWithout having hit final release yet, I can already recommend this game as being one of the all-time greats in gaming.

I've been watching this game since it came on Early Access but I never buy/play before the final release. Lucky for me I didn't because now I can see my life disappearing down the wormhole of "just one more run". This game manages to perfectly balance the risk vs reward combo that is a necessity in all "resource management" rogue-lites (think FTL). Too many times I have had an agency retired by a single guard standing in the way of some final corporate safe that I think I can make only to find out that I've just over reached...\n\nAnd then I start again. There was an excellent Extra Credits piece on how the speed of restarting can be very important and it is only ever a few mouse clicks to restart an agency here. The combinations of skills, implants and software where all approaches feel valid leads to a game that feels infinitely playable.\n\nIt also never sacrifices its vision. Despite being able to stand up to the corporate forces in any singular instance, it is never going to be a winning strategy and stealth should always be your first option. The limitation on rewinds forces needing to learn how to read a room, guard patrols and alert statuses in order to pick which side of a bench you are going to crouch behind... pick the wrong side and you'll be hitting restart shortly.\n\nReasons Not To You have work tomorrow\nYou have an assignment due that requires more than 5 minutes work\nYou don't want to play one of the best tactical turn-based or stealth games ever released","May 24, 2015","true","55.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Almost. I say almost as among all the other levels of the game, it cant be even compared to the last level of the game. Turrets in most of the rooms with daemon protected firewall along with all the other system.  Daemon protecred firewalls are basically like negative event or debuff that will occur to your team should you completely hack the protected system with that firewalls. With armoured guard and robots roaming the level. If you manage to get this far into the game and not all of your teammates have armour piercing taser or guns, be mentally prepared to have a hard time.\n\nThose of you who had played Xcom: Enemy Unknown, the gameplay is relatively similar. The difference is that you dont go in gun blazing, with rockets and nades flying all over the place. You go in quietly. The consequences of going in loud is harsh as the game progress on that level. Customization wise of your agent loudout before starting the mission is at bare minimum. You are not giving a variety set of tools and weapon to play with at the start. Those set of tools and weapons can only be bought through shops which can be found during your mission playthrough. The cost of such items is expensive and at this stage you must consider on sacrificing on leveling your agent or getting new sets of tools,weapon and augmentation. Even if you decide to buy things of the shop, the item being sold is randomize. So every level the item is different and you might get the items that you are not looking for.\n\nThere isn't much content honestly (since I'm able to get to the final mission in just a few hours) as the game is just in early access. The game also mention that this is the 'last' of the content of the game so far should you be able to reach the final mission. The replay value so far is the wanting of unlocking new agents and perks for you to run through the game again. As the story mode allow you to pick the default 2 agents that is available as you start the game for the first time.\n\nI'm currently planning to go for another run of the game with the new agents and perks to see if can beat the game completely. Either that or waiting for new content being released before playing again. Those of you who like to play turn base movement strategy game and want to try something different yet similay, may want to consider in getting this game. For those that havent play such a genre before, I would recommend you should wait for the game to be out of early access. 8/10 would recommend this game.","January 1, 2015","true","24.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

You choose two agents at the beginning of each campaign, and you're tasked with gathering resources (weapons, gear, agents) to prepare them for an end mission after some allotted time. You're given a map filled with different missions, and each one is tailored such that you're given something special in return. One mission may filled with credits to spend on items, while another may supply you with a third agent to help you. Deciding between these missions is crucial, as all of these assets you're sent out to gather are important to survive and succeed in the end-game.\n\nThe missions themselves are highly engaging, compelling, and challenging, and takes on a turn-based mechanic like in XCOM. It's a stealth game, so you either have to maneuver around enemies, or take them out silently. Everything in the game is a one-hit KO, so being spotted once is most likely going to lead to death, which is probably my favorite part of the game. It feels so engaging. Every turn matters, and the decisions you make have dire consequences if carried out recklessly, however, you must act swiftly, because every turn ticks a timer on an alarm, and the higher it gets, the harder the missions become (more surveillance cameras, more enemies, higher hacking costs).\n\nThe game is also a rogue-lite, so each subsequent run awards you exp which unlocks new agents and gear to bring along to the next one. You're also given an exhaustive list of different customizability options from changing the length of each run to changing how many guards appear on each mission to how many rooms there are in each mission. It's crazy! You make the game as hard or easy as you want.\n\nThe art-style is also gorgeous. Definitely has that Klei feeling.\n\nThe gameplay is so deep that it's hard to go over every single aspect of it, but for the price it's most definitely worth the price of admission.

Every move counts. Every turn counts. Every detail in preparation, be it the equipment you choose, the mission type, security level or travel time matters. One single mistake can mean the difference between a massive reward or a botched op.\n\nThe game uses an alert level system which increases at every turn, pushing the player to act before it gets too difficult. It's a little unsettling at first, especially in the beginning when agents don't have a lot of action points. But it's there for a reason: without it, there would be little challenge because of the nature of the game: it's a stealth game. Without it, you could take 300 turns to recon all point of interests and patrol routes and the game would get boring fast.\n\nThe game challenges you to remain undetected as much as possible, as killing guards raises the alarm level instantly, while neutralizing them is only temporary, after which they will actively search for you.\n\nSneaking past patrols and using cover is immensely rewarding. I've seen comments about some situations being unwinnable because of the random level generator, but that's simply not true. Every situation has a solution, but you may lack the proper preparation, strategy or equipment to win it. If that's the case, the game actually encourages you to cut your losses and head to the nearest exit. A failed mission is a lot less painful than losing an agent, since the game only has permadeath.\n\nInvisible Inc is a gem that no other game can really compare to. It's in its own league as a stealth-based turn-based strategy game.","October 17, 2014","true","74.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The replayability is through the roof, the procedural elements are fantastic, the style and mechanics are slick, and with each new iteration it just gets better.\n\nDon't Starve and Mark of the Ninja, also developed by Klei, are excellent games in their respective genres, but neither held my attention for very long.

Took about 2 hours to play through the easy mode story. It shares a lot of features with traditional rogue-likes (perma-death, procedurally generated levels) and turn-based games like x-com (action points, overwatch abilities) those two things blended with the stealth aspect make the game perfect for me. The alarm stages must have been toned down since the complaints I heard, while they add more guards, I always felt they ramped it up nice and slowly. I never felt like the game was pushing me through the level, but the alarm stages helped pile more danger onto things when you messed up.\n\nCan't wait to go through it again on the normal/ironman modes with all the new agents.","January 10, 2015","true","39.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game still feels barebones and needs plenty of improvements, but the partial content so far is impressive.\n\nWhat stands out positively is its stylish hand-drawn artstyle along with decent UI and gameplay. The characters and their personalities are fun as well, but I can't help but to hope for a little more interesting & diverse cast by the time the game is published. Or perhaps to learn a little more about them in-game as the intro text is all the description you will ever get on both the characters and the world they live in.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, like in most rogue-like & perma-death genre games, there is a steep learning curve and while it is entertaining, levels can quickly become devastating. It offers a very tense, challenging experience but I wish there was more context for some of the game's attributes, such as the passive "alarm level" timebomb or the purpose of "reputation."\n\nI'll have to add more when newer builds get released, but I think this has the opportunity to become a brilliant game & I hope it suceeds.

After leaving it for some time, I returned a couple of days ago when it was fully released. And holy hell, the game has been seriously, SERIOUSLY polished.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nGorgeous. Every character is stylised and are distinctive in their appearance, making telling your agents apart a breeze. The music is wonderful and frankly rather catchy. It doesn't intrude on your game, rather simply bolstering the experience. The tempo of the music speeds up as the alarm level rises, toying with your sense of urgency and driving you to get your agents out as fast as possible.\n\nGameplay/UI\nThere has been some beautiful polishing here. Guards can be easily identified, along with their visual area - parts of the map that are in their cone of vision but behind cover are also easy to spot, making navigating the somewhat tricky rooms nicely intuitive. Cover is abundant when it needs to be, but never clutters the map.\n\nVisual representations of information are good, too. Footsteps generate little echo pulses, rooms you have visual on are nicely distinguished from rooms you don't, etc.\n\nThe UI is clean, well-designed and frankly wonderful to look at. Abilities are easy to comprehend\n\nThe game is, above all, a challenge. The turn-based nature allows you to take your time and make planned decisions, but every mission has a propensity to go straight to hell  because of a guard walking into a room just as you're crouched over his mate's body rifling through his pockets. The game doesn't pull punches and you frequently have to make sacrificial decisions as to whether you want to risk everything on getting those lat couple of safes or play it safe.\n\nThe addition of limited rewinds (The ability to undo decisions) is a fantastic one. You can switch 'em off if you feel it's too cheaty, but the game only allows you to rewind a few times before you're stuck with your choices. You have a safety net, but it's made of dental floss and chewing gum.\n\n\n\nLong story short: If you like tactical, turn-based games, well done stealth elements and games with a good difficulty scale, you need this game.","May 14, 2015","true","30.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I played during early access and was really quite interested in it, It's great to see how far the game has come and the things that has changed. Highly recommend getting it if you're interested in turn-based strategy-ish games, and who doesn't like secret agents?. Just don't expect it to be easy ;)\n\nThe basic storyline is that Invisible Inc. HQ was overthrown by a surprise attack, which resulted in the company fleeing the building. Central, the owner of the company managed to retrieve the special program "Incognita" before leaving, but the program can only run on backup power for another 72 hours.\n\nIt's a turn-based stealth game where you take control of a handful of secret agents (2 to begin with, but can increase to a maximum of 4) which break into big corporation buildings. Your agents move silently (while not running) but with guard patrols you have to plan your moves carefully so they don't get seen, which involves hiding behind cover.\n\nYour agents have weapons such as the Neural Disruptors which temporarily disable guards for a few turns, while an agent is on top of them they will pin them down and the guard won't be able to get back up. You can also steal money and key-cards from guards to get through locked doors. Once a weapon is used, most have some sort of cooldown. There are also weapons that can kill guards, but killing guards will set off their heart monitors which raises the alarm level.\n\n"Incognita" is a special program which Invisible Inc. owns, it allows them to hack cameras, safes, turrets, and other objects to take control of them. You need power to hack objects, which is gained from consoles around the map. If an agent is seen by a camera it will start recording them and guards will be alerted to their location. If a guard finds them, it will enter overwatch and will shoot during the players turn if the agent being targeted moves into an open area. The agent must either find cover (behind a object in the room 1 square away), use a cloaking rig to turn invisible, or the guard has to be taken out.\n\nWith a limited timer in the main game (72 hours (not real hours), though there is also a endless mode) you have to choose places which are near, and determine which buildings are best to visit first. For example, some places such as the bank vaults (money!!) require special access cards gained from other levels to get into the high security vaults (aka: extra room with lots o' money). Also look out for detention centers which hold another agent which can join your team if you manage to rescue them.\n\nAlso, graphics are great, cutscenes are beautiful. I just love the high-tech look of it all, even the menus are pretty. <3","June 1, 2015","true","22.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I usually like games which focus completely on a few mechanics, but obviously that only works if those mechanics bring a lot of depth. Invisible Inc. has depth, but it doesn't take long to understand every mechanic of the game and learn how to play the best. Because of that the only thing which kept me motivated was the unlocks. I started my first playthrough on easy and beat it in my first try, then started my second playthrough on hard (or whatever the second difficulty level is called) and beat that also in my first try. Then I already unlocked every agent and I guess almost all programs, but there are still alternate loadouts I can unlock I think. My third playthrough I played on extreme difficulty and here I failed like 2-3 times now and the game had some frustrating moments. It also has some really nice "Aha!" moments when you manage to complete the mission with all your agents while getting surrounded by multiple agents and cameras and drones reactivating.\n\nI like that the game does not have anything with chances. When you attack an enemy, your attack will hit 100% of the time, if the enemy attacks, he will hit 100% of the time. That is very important for a stealth game, because the moment you get spotted it gets hard. What I like is that its not completely over when you get spotted, if you have a good position. Instead of alarming every guard in the building of your presence the game just increases the alarm level by 1 and you still have that one guard watching you. The thing is that there aren`t that many decisions you have to do as the player. When you get spotted there will probably one or maybe 2 spots where you could evade to and the choice is obvious most of the time. The way you move through the levels, engage guards, hack mainframe devices is the same most of the time. That is why there is not much depth in this game.\nWhat is fun is the resource management though. Deciding on what you want to spend your money on is crucial, you could spend it on gadgets, leveling your agents or on programs. All of these options make sense and some things have nice synergies or you can compensate with some things for the lack of others.\n\nIf you expect a story or something then you should know that there isn't a story in this game, just a premise which sets up the game and explains your situation and the systems behind the game. You will have to dig really hard to find something which tells you about the world or characters and most of it is just flavour text of agent descriptions or items.\nAlso I don't understand what the point of the ending is. If this was a traditional game with a start and a finish (without the rogue-lite elements) then I would understand why you could have an ending like this. But for a game like this, which is designed for multiple playthroughs, the ending doesn't make any sense and conflicts with the design of the game itself and I really hate that.\nThe artstyle and character design is really beautiful and unique like in most Klei games. The voice acting is good enough and the music is nice and fits the game. The framerate is weird sometimes, but that isn't a problem, because this is a turn-based game. If you can get this game for less than 10€ you won't regret the purchase, for higher than that it might still be worth it, but I can't guarantee it.","June 30, 2015","true","11.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The emergent, ever-changing circumstances combine with a myriad of gameplay elements during missions to produce memorable situations, heroic escapes and tragic deaths.\n\nThe game's short yet highly replayable campaigns can be doomed by certain mistakes, and while the random map generation might occasionally make missions harder, the ultimate result comes entirely from the player's actions. A solid plan can provide enough battlefield control to put a team through seemingly impossible scenarios.\n\nStealth is always the best option, it's immensely fun and doesn't devolve into mindless action the moment agents are spotted. Unless part of an intricate plan, detection leads to a frantic revision of strategy and securing a escape route becomes paramount. The enemy corporations always have the upper hand in the event of a direct fight, which coupled with the ever-rising alert levels encourage the player to be quick and sometimes bold to outwit their adversaries.\n\nOverall, Invisible Inc. offers an unparalleled turn-based strategy experience and possibly the best stealth gameplay in the history of videogames. Definitely a strong Game of the Year candidate and a steal at 20 dollars.\n\nBuy it now and gear up, Operator!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MagerBlutooth/recommended/243970/","MagerBlutooth","Mager Blutooth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MagerBlutooth/","98 products in account","Invisible Inc. is a wonderfully refined, highly addictive turn-based strategy stealth game. You control a small team of special agents that must infiltrate a randomly generated facility filled with just about every type of security measure you can imagine. It's your job to guide your agents through the facility and use the various tools at your disposal to complete your objectives.\n\nThe game is short, but its value lies in its complexity. Everything in your arsenal, be it your agents, your hacking programs, your cybernetic augments, or your collected equipment, can dramatically affect how you play, making for a tremendous deal of replay value. Also, despite being a stealth game, the gameplay is incredibly fast-paced. Though you have an unlimited amount of time to make each move (unless playing Time Attack), every turn you take increases an alert tracker that makes the mission harder as more turns pass, creating an interesting balance between being careful and being swift. Though for those who prefer things more balanced towards one or the other, the amount of custom options available basically allows you to play however you wish.\n\nThis game is all about progress. You start with a small collection of tools and must consider where to send your agents, what to spend your money on, and what you need most for the final mission that will determine whether you win or lose (provided you make it that far). Though the feeling of progress is unceremoniously lost to the void after completing said final mission, it's only really disheartening when you lose.\n\nThough the game gives you the ability to take back a handful of your moves each mission, this game can be very challenging on the higher difficulties, and while luck can be a factor, I find it comforting that the majority of my losses have felt like they were the result of my own mistakes, rather than the game placing me in a no-win situation.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone interested in complex strategy games, games where every choice matters and every tool can change your play style. This is the kind of game you really get into once you understand how to play. Then you really, really get into it when you really understand how to play. Also, if you like computer hacking sound effects, this game has some nice ones.","May 16, 2015","true","115.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Mark of the Ninja was a brilliant blend of platforming and stealth, and we're all familiar with the great survival game that Don't Starve is (even if you're like me and only know anything about that game because everyone you know seems to play it). Klei has given us another stealth game, except this time it's a cyberpunk turn-based game with a hint of strategy, and it has the be the best combination of those things I've played since Syndicate.\n\nYou've got your standard cyberpunk themes in this game; giant megacorporations that rule the world, cybernetics, and everything including the coffee maker being hooked up to the internet. That last part is particularly important to you, because one of your most important tools in this game is an AI called Incognita who you will use to deal with the enhanced security you would be expect in a cyberpunk setting. Cameras? Hack them. Safes full of corporate goodies? Hack them. Menacing turret in the center of a room with four guards? You could hack it, but it might be a bad idea, as enemies usually have heart monitors that raise the alarm when you kill them. Doesn't mean you can't knock them out with your futuristic stun gun, though!\n\nGameplay is fun and decently challenging, with the game never putting you in an outright impossible situation. Levels are procedurally generated,with often fantastic results, striking a good balance between obstacles and things that can help the player. The player navigates these levels with a team of up to four agents, though is limited to two at the beginning of every campaign. All campaigns have the same plot, but can vary based on which difficulty is chosen and the luck of the player with level generation. Completing a campaign, regardless of win or loss, rewards the player with experience, which unlocks more agents and hacking tools to choose from at the beginning of a campaign. With so many ways to start a campaign and so many ways a campaign can go, the game has tremendous replayability.\n\nThe story is rather nice for what the game is. The game is actually fairly short, with most of the potential to steal your time coming from doing multiple playthroughs. Thus, there really isn't that much space for a story to fill, but it uses that space very efficiently. The game establishes its setting very well, and the player will have a good feel for the game world after one or two playthroughs. That said, there may be a few holes you won't fill in on your first playthrough, and characterization of the agents you have access to takes a few playthroughs to be truly complete. But at least every agent is unique in some way or another, both in story and gameplay. The plot itself isn't anything award-winning, but it will keep you interested and you'll love how it ends (No spoilers!).\n\nThe graphics are nice, though it definitely took a cue from the style of Mark of the Ninja. The UI is great, and the player is given multiple ways to view and assess a situation.The music is nice to listen to, and every sound effect sounds just right (Something is really satisfying about hearing my agents tase the crap out of a guard).  Everything compliments each other very well, and it definitely adds to that stealthy feel.\n\nI actually can't find anything big to complain about with this game. It's been finished and polished very well, and I haven't seen any bugs or glitches on my end. The biggest problem in the game is that as a consequence of the level generation, security is occasionally placed in nonsensical locations with strange schedules, such as a guard that spends the entire level staring at a blank wall, and that's a really small problem. The game is terrific on every front, and in my opinion it's definitely a game that money is well-spent on. This is definitely a game that belongs in the library of any true stealth game fan.","May 17, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As soon as I begun playing, I fell in love with it. Not especially unique, somewhat similar to Boarderlands (in my opinion), but very enjoyable and suits the game's dystopian theme down to a tee. The versatile 'customisable difficulty' mechanics are superb, allowing the game to be as challenging or not as you want. A casual experience for those who want it, but it can be brain-crushingly hard as well. The campaigns are short (unless you play endless mode), but have a lot of replay value; as someone who likes a challenge (playing with no mission restarts) I've yet to 'beat' the game, but it's not at all upsetting or frustrating. The game itself plays a lot like the board game (or video game equivalent) Space Hulk; turn-based with grid-based movement. In game, every decision, move and action counts, something which is handled very well. The money, resource, upgrade and item systems are all very well balanced (assuming you have conventional settings). All of which accumulates into a very well designed, stimulating and challenging game. It's a very gameplay based experience, so the lack of story, exposition and character development shouldn't be a bother (and if it is, you're looking in the wrong place).\n\nConclusively, this game is some of the best value for money on the market, I would happily pay more than £15 pounds for it.

There is consistently much more to manage in-game.  It proved a little too much for me.  In addition, sometimes the procedurally-generated levels seem a little uninspired.  Lastly, the game expects you to play through multiple times, and perhaps to fail on at least one of these playthroughs.  However, when you fail, you unlock a few more options for the next go-around.

I personally love the game, it's fun sneaking around and complaining about mistakes I make that led to me killing everyone on the floor. Of course you shouldn't, since this is a stealth game. Always good to know when you make a mistake later on you can just slay everyone.\n\nOf course the game will be hard at first, but after you get used to it it's enjoyable. Standing right next to a guard as you steal from him and watch him walk away. This game won't get repeatitive compared to other stealth games because it's randomly generated levels. Of course there's that chance you get a level you can't sneak past, but that's why we get guns and stuns. Thus far most levels I have been able to sneak past, I can only recall three levels I had to murder the whole floor to search it. And that's after 60 hours of gameplay.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like stealth and rogue, good idea to consider this game, not expensive either. And after that wonderful early access for Don't starve, I do believe we can trust these guys to handle this one as well. This game is pretty much done honestly in my opinion. I've yet to run into any major issues or bugs, and the one time I have few hours later there's a hotfix for it.","October 14, 2014","true","102.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In Spelunky, every random thing you run into makes the game more fun, even if it kills you. In this game, it's just a coin flip, with some outcomes good (pick up a new agent, get a useful augment) and most bad (pick up a bearded dude, get a useless augment).\n\nAnd in Spelunky (which yes, I mean to suggest is an excellent game), you can choose to play it safe, avoiding much of the randomness if that's your style. The same is true in this game in a sense: within a mission, you can always leave early, taking the exit elevator as soon as you can reach it. However, the kind of randomness I have a beef with is unavoidable -- you typically have little choice but to take a mission with a coin flip at the center (a detention center or cybernetics lab).  Even the other mission types are pretty lame, for example requiring a wad of cash (server farm, nanofab),\n\nI think they should just take out the bad outcomes (useless agents, permanently grafted augments) as well as the information about mission type. Let it just be described as industrial (which will prove to be cybernetic, server, nanofabs or a combination) or a bunker (containing either data on other locations or money) or something else that entails learning about the nature of the facility only by exploring it. Picking up agents should be incidental to the missions you choose: some might be mercs or prisoners found on missions; some might approach you in the strategy layer; and some might pop up as special limited-time rescue missions from MONST3R (your fence in the game).\n\nAnyway, the tactical game is very fun even if the strategy layer isn't, so I'd recommend it.","October 23, 2014","true","16.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First, you have to accept that you will die, and you will fail. Like many rogue-like games, it rewards multiple playthroughs and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the situations you are put in. You will be outnumbered, you will make mistakes and you will accidentally walk into a group of guards with no way out.\n\nWhat you will also do is learn. You will learn when to be cautious and when to run like a maniac. You will learn when to take a guard down and when to sneak by quietly. You will balance the rewards of exploring the whole level versus the lives of your agents.\n\nThe game is well developed for an early access title and Klei once again doesn't disapoint.

I picked up Invisible, Inc. due to the genre and the merits of Klei's last game Mark of the Ninja. Several sleepless nights later I can tell you that this game is fantastic. The world and art style is great, the mechanics engaging, and the replayability factor is very high. The higher difficulty levels of the game will really make you think about each turn, future turns, and how to spend resources upgrading your team between fights.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I would say the one shortcoming of the game is the length of the main campaign. It can easily be completed in one sitting on the easiest difficulty, although the game is designed for multiple replays which in turn unlock additional characters for use in future playthroughs. The story and voice acting are really well done and I wish I could have experienced more.\n\nIf you are a fan of roguelikes, turn-based, and/or cyberpunk games then this is one you'll definitely want to start playing immediately. 9/10","May 24, 2015","true","94.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay is intense, it leaves you thinking of up to three or more future moves. The multitude of equipment and augmentation gives this game a great feel and want to repeat the game all over again. It is an almost unforgiving strategy game and it gives a thrill that many games just don't.\n\nThe maps are randomly generated and give a feeling that although some rooms are almost similar, the placement of the rooms make this game endlessly playable.\n\nThis is my only criticism and I am aware that improvement on storyline is planned but at the moment it is very bare. You aren't really motivated by any larger goal and you aren't sure what the agency really is at all.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone and keenly look forward to further additions.\n\n20/10\n\n(Would rate higher if I could)","January 17, 2015","true","57.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After finishing story mode, and turn dead after 5 days in endless mode for a countless time, i have to say - this game will be one of the best games on steam. Its not easy even on easy difficulty. And if Klei will add a lot of other stuff, as weapons, hacking devices, characters, perks, etc. it can be balanced on a really high level. I really really recommend this game, cos it has great gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, and you will spend a lots of hours playing it, even after your agents die - just, again and again and again.

Well done.\n\n*******************************\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW\n\nI simply love turn-based, tactical games. Add the word "stealth" to the equation, and I'm drooling all over it.\n\nThat's why Invisible is kind of a disappointment to me.\n\nIt delivers in mostly everything: artwork is superb, gameplay is smooth... you can improve your spies' abilites, you can explore the map, sneak past guards or knock them down, pickpocket them... you can hack servers, cameras... you can unlock safes and steal valuables... well, it's got everything really.\n\nEverything... except that, because the maps are generated at random, half the time the obstacles spawn in such locations that you just cannot sneak past guards and cannot knock them out, not without losing one or more of your agents.\n\nOther times, you are so ill-equipped agaisnt the vast amount of armored guards and high "disabling cost" cameras and other obstacles, that no matter what strategy you devise, you will lose.\n\nAnd because playing this game has been such a frustrating experience, with sorrow I will not recommend it.\n\n3/10","January 10, 2015","true","118.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

But the progression is nice, rising in dificulty as you figure out the details bit by bit.\n\nAlso there is quite some randomness involved! The game can keep you on edge, not so much through it's story, but by throwing you into randomly generated levels that you have to explore and adapt to on the fly.

The older I get and the slower my reaction become, so my desire for turn strategy grows. Unfortunately developers have moved away from the Laser Squad/Sabre Team stylings of yore and demand ever-twitchier players.\n\nFortunately Klei, famous already for the amazing Mask of the Ninja and Don't Starve, have turned their talents to the action-point loving genre and produced a masterpiece. Everything is beautifully balanced, level generation is partly randomised but always feels cohesive and, like any good roguelike, there is plenty to unlock.\n\nThe graphics are excellent and the sound equally so, but the real stroke of genius is how flexible and adaptable it is. You can tune it to anything from a game that makes Peggle seem complex into the most difficult game since a blindfolded Dark Souls run.

It has a great amount of depth to it and requires more longterm strategy than any other rouge-like i've played.\n\nThe game plays like a stealth orientated x-com, where instead of shooting the aliens, you're sneaking past and pick pocketing guards. Of course there is the option to knock out/kill the guards as well, but those options come with their own consequences.\n\nWhat I really love about this game is that every turn you play requires thought: deciding where you're going to end your turn to keep out of sight, deciding what order to hack the electronics, whether you want to knock that one guard out or wait a turn for him to walk past. As I mentioned before, there's also a lot of long term planning as well, specifically deciding how you're going to upgrade your operatives and the tools at your disposal.\n\nAt the end of the day this is a really fun game and if the three words "Stealth Strategy Rougelike" appeal to you, than I couldn't recommend this game more.","December 21, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a turn based strategy STEALTH game. This is one thing I really wish I knew more about going in. If you attempt to brashly plow your way through levels, you will lose quickly and painfully. Planning becomes key, and strategically dissecting the levels becomes a necessity at experienced difficulty and beyond. This game is extremely punishing, and will annihilate you for the first 10 hours that you spend in it.

You WILL die, you WILL get aggrevated, and you WILL feel cheated early on.\n\nBut then, 10 hours in, something clicks.\n\nAs you play this game, you will begin to crack the code on the gameplay mechanics bit by bit. The better you crack them, the easier and more fun it gets. Within 15-20 hours, you end up pulling off some complex tactical manuvers without even thinking about it. Once you get into the meat of this game, it is a MASTERPIECE. Let's get into why.\n\nMost of the game involves finding an objective, breaking into and stealing something from the objective, and leaving through a teleporter. When you enter a level, you have no idea where anything is. Your main job is to explore the area, find both the objective, and the teleporter, then execute a plan to get to both. While it may not seem that genius at first, the stuff that you may have to come up with to get there is remarkable. The game tests not only your ability to think, but also your ability to work under pressure. There WILL be times when you have to make the best of a bad situation. This is where Invisible Inc. is at it's best. In my time playing the game, I've ran into plenty of these situations, and when I have, it is the most fun I have in modern gaming. It's tense, it's tactical, and the problem solving involved is devious. However, if you can get out of those situations without a scratch, you walk away feeling like a champion. You will fail occasionally, but that's OK. The game wasn't meant to be easy. To me, that is a definate positive. There are also multipe side-quests throughout these levels as well. Stealing credits, and hacking nanofabricators so you can buy prime gear become almost as important as your original goals.\n\nSo, overall, what's the verdict? The first few days playing it may seem tedius, but play on beginner difficulty, beat it once, and then try it on experienced and expert. Once you can get past the firewall of a learning curve, the game reveals  a vast network of strategic options and amazing gameplay that is unparalleled in the market today. I fully recommend this game to any fan of turn based strategy, or indie games in general.

It has a great amount of depth to it and requires more longterm strategy than any other rouge-like i've played.\n\nThe game plays like a stealth orientated x-com, where instead of shooting the aliens, you're sneaking past and pick pocketing guards. Of course there is the option to knock out/kill the guards as well, but those options come with their own consequences.\n\nWhat I really love about this game is that every turn you play requires thought: deciding where you're going to end your turn to keep out of sight, deciding what order to hack the electronics, whether you want to knock that one guard out or wait a turn for him to walk past. As I mentioned before, there's also a lot of long term planning as well, specifically deciding how you're going to upgrade your operatives and the tools at your disposal.\n\nAt the end of the day this is a really fun game and if the three words "Stealth Strategy Rougelike" appeal to you, than I couldn't recommend this game more.","December 21, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Great visuals (similar style to Mark Of The Ninja) and sound effects. The gameplay mechanics are really interesting and unique.\n\nMissions are randomly generated and increase in difficulty the longer you spend in the building. You can complete side objectives to earn extra money but you risk stronger enemies appearing and harder security measures being activated.\n\nI really like the way enemies react when they spot you - you have to use your next turn move your agent behind cover to break line-of-sight or they'll fire. You can predict guards' movements and use that information to plan your attack (or evasion).\n\nYou can also upgrade your agents and anti-security methods between missions. You can change the way agents are used by upgrading particular aspects over others (Do you want them to be speedy, or strong? Do you want them to be a good hacker, or better at stealing from enemy guards?).\n\nDefinitely recommended!

It really lives up to its homepage claim of a TBS stealth-em-up that gets you thinking ahead. Getting spotted by enemies can be so easily done and drastically counter productive to the mission that you have to put a lot of effort in to not getting caught.\nThey also cater for your missions with an array of nifty gadgets and weapons so that the ways of infiltration never end up being just a linear game of Grandmother's footsteps.\nIf there was any complaint it would be that while I play Endless Mode setpieces tend to repeat themselves, and the missions do not vary enough for continual use.

Pleasant, challenging, and requires some real skill and thinking, The universe and atmosphere are not fully fleshed out yet but already feel really nice.\n\nI don't really understand why that game gets compared to XCOM. Maybe it is just that there is no better comparison to make, but IMO it does not feel much like XCOM (the 1994 original game) and possibly even less like the modern sequels and remakes. Invisible, Inc. is not a game about fighting enemies. It is not even completely a tactical game in the classical sense. It is a game about taking the right decisions to achive an objective in a constrained situation.\n\nIn my opinion, the defining feature of the gameplay is that nothing is free and every decision you make has a cost.\nYou stunned that patrolling guard? He will wake up in a few turns and investigate.\nYou killed him? That will quickly increase the security tracker (and eventually spawn more guards)\nYou used an item? It will be on cooldown for a few turns when you may need it.\nYou shot a security drone? You will have to buy some ammo now.\nYou hacked that camera you could have walked around? Maybe you should have kept your hacking power for the one in the next room.\nYou unlocked a door? Now the guards can open it too.\nYou did nothing and stayed hidden for one turn? You wasted your agents' action points, and the security tracker is rising.\n\nIf anything, the game reminds me of chess and other abstract turn-based board games. Every turn, you are confronted to a new situation and have to take the right action. Should I stun that guard? Kill him? Let him walk away without noticing me? Lure him away to another room? Each choices has different merits and drawbacks, and you constantly have to consider how the overall situation will evolve. It is challenging, sometimes frustrating when you find yourself in hopeless situations or when you forget a minor detail that turns your masterplan into a disaster (how many times have I ended up with my team dead just because I forgot to press the "Melee reaction" button for one agent?), but usually lots of fun.\n\nThe current early access phase means the developers are still adding content, balancing the game and refining the gameplay. The technical part is already very good; the game runs smoothly and is very stable (stabler than many "finished" games).","November 5, 2014","true","70.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The unpredictability of the procedural levels has ended many of my games abruptly, dished out incredibly good fortune and most importantly, created tense stealth moments – I'm a fairly big Metal Gear Solid fan, they've captured that satisfaction of pulling off dangerously close manoeuvres around outnumbered and more dangerous enemies. Stealth is generally the order of the day, but there's success in gunning down your enemies, too, whether that's with your own weapons or hacking turrets to do it for you.\n\nI see a few people asking why there's any reason to keep playing, for me the procedural levels and the range in different characters' abilities is keeping me going (at the time of writing, 6 characters, 5 with an alternative version). The continually escalating alarm, which gradually turns on more security cameras and deploys additional guards keeps the situation tense.\n\nThere's plenty I've barely explored, I haven't even tried all the characters yet and it's clear there's a wealth of upgrades for them and Incognita (the system you use to hack) that I've still not touched. I've completed the story, but I still haven't got into a vault yet...\n\nThis is probably the best early access game I've bought into, the unpredictable content is already enough to keep me invested, the quality of the art and music is great, and it's created cool moments I want to tell other people about – a sought-after quality in games for me. If you like games like FTL and/or stealth you should give it a go.\n","February 2, 2015","true","44.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a beautiful art style with audio lending a fitting ambience to your teams role as corporate infiltrators. Furthermore there are little to no noticable bugs in the current content, a notable achievement for an early access game. That does however bring us onto the point of content, of which there is remarkably little at the moment.\nCurrently the game relies heavily on it's procedural generation to extend the gameplay experience with few options in terms of mission or agent variety available to the player. Furthermore one could argue the punishing difficulty the game demonstrates is based on the random element of the levels rather than any true difficulty with some missions being extra punishing due to at most 1 room in which 3 or more guards may have by chance built their route. I personally encountered a situation where an obbjective room was filled with 3 seemingly stationary guards which made it effectively impossible to access any of the items in the room forcing the mission to be scrubbed.\nFurthermore noticable usability features such as a undo button remain absent from the game with  1 misclick representing the possible loss of an hours worth of missions. A lack of a between missions inventory screen or shop makes inventory management awkward and makes early missions excessively punishing as the game may make it impossible to effectively access a shop for several levels.\nI'd say invisible inc represents one of the highest quality early access games available, it tempers the developers ambitions in the name of polish and stability while leaving room for those ambitions to be added later down the line when they can be added in such a way that maintains the high quality gaming experience. This is the level of product early access games on steam should be held too rather than the overly ambitious bug ridden messes that populate most of the category.","August 23, 2014","true","19.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Invisible Inc. is not one such game, it punishes violence. Not familiar with turn based games, the learning curve is fairly steep, but having an affinity for stealth gameplay helps in learning the game. The noir atmosphere and graphics are gorgeous and traditional stealth gameplay elements are adhered to strictly. There is no apparent story of import, but that doesn't bother me, however there are some flaws. Pop up features (peek/door) block other pop ups (# of turns) depending on camera angle. A limitation that is presumably found in turn based games is the need to change the camera angle often, and sometimes to no avail as the rooms are very difficult to see and observe where your character is. There is no restart button or in-game saves so you must fully commit to a mission until completed which is very difficult in these fog of war maps. Most of these flaws can be forgiven as it is an independent game with a small development team. Invisible Inc. is an ambitious, but flawed, early access sneaker that pushes new boundaries for the genre.","September 15, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every level is guarded with guards and CCTV cameras, with an alarm level that increases over time to send in more units, activate more cameras and make hacking more expensive.\nI’ve had had a mostly positive experience with Invisible, Inc. However, it can be frustrating when you fail, as you have to start again. Invisible, Inc. has many unique features: hacking, strategic combat, stealth and looting.\n\n-Hacking\nA massive part of the game is hacking. You will need to hack a lot to progress through the game. Among the things you need to hack are: CCTV cameras, laser barriers drones/robots, Corporate safes, turrets and generators, executive control panels, console/camera databases and nano-fabricators (shops).These are the most important thing you have to hack but there are many more. To hack you will need Power (PWR). You will slowly get power through ‘Power drip’, a program provided to you by your agency. You can also get power by hacking console, which usually give you 2-3 PWR per console, but be careful, some consoles are monitored by security.\n\n-Combat\nTo take care of security guards, you will have a Neural Disrupter by default. The Neural Disrupter is a melee weapon to stun enemies for 2-3 turns. You can get upgraded versions from some nano-fabricators. Other weapons include pistols, dart guns and rifles. Killing guards with heart monitors will raise the alarm counter by 2 bars. An agent can go into melee reaction so if a guard goes past, the agent will knock them out and keep them pinned. Alternatively, your agent can go into overwatch, so if a guard/drone goes into it’s line of sight, He/she will shoot it. If your agent is firing bullets the guard will be killed. If they’re firing darts, he will be knocked out. Drones cannot be knocked out and are unaffected by darts/ Neural Disrupters, but some can be hacked.\n\n-Stealth\nStealth is vital to the game. It is nearly impossible to go in guns blazing and succeed. You have to stay in cover to avoid the enemy’s line of sight, otherwise your agent will be shot. If your agent is shot, He/she will be critically wounded, however, the other agent can still get to the elevator to exit the level or revive the wounded agent with medi-gel. By default, Deckard will have a cloacking rig, enabling him to be invisible for a turn if he’s out of sight. An upgrade version can be bought from some nano-farbricators.\n\n-Alarm Counter\nThe alarm counter will increase over time but certain events such as a guars getting killed or a security-monitored console being accessed will increase it too. As the alarm counter rises, it will reach levels (1,2,3,4,5,6 etc..). At these levels, the mission will get harder as hacking will cost more PWR or more guard are called in.\n\nI highly recommend this game as it’s a lot of fun to play, But I suggest that you play the tutorial as it teaches you a lot and without it you’ll probably fail the first mission.\n","September 6, 2014","true","47.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Except it doesn't detect weather anymore. It breaks safes, converts enemy robots to your cause, disables laser barriers, and occasionally makes you wonder whether it's becoming sentient.\n\nThe game successfully subverts a thorn in the side of stealth games by randomizing the corporation maps and only allowing for a certain number of "rewinds," essentially a reload of a save. In older stealth games memorizing enemy patterns is a way to cheese the system but that's just not possible with Invisible Inc.'s robust design.

The only thing you can do is reset the turn before.  This game is intense because you cannot fight head on the guards and even if you could it brings up a set of issues for each guard you take out.  Every fix turns the game adds an element on the map, more guards, hard to hack computers, or alert the remaining guard to your location.\n\nI really enjoy this game it is very intense and the game play is very tight.  However, this game is very short, it gives you a lot of options for replay however the main reason I play was for a bit of a story and building my base back up.  I thought at a certain point you could rebuild your base.  (spoilers) (No you can't)\n\nI am left with a bit of wanting more after I beat the game in experienced mode on my 4th run.  Because after my 3rd run, I knew what is useful and what is not and which missions to take.  Part of how hard this game is, is the learning curve and once you get pass that the levels do not get harder.  Besides the last mission.\n\nI feel and suspect the designers knew their game is too short and wanted to make the last level as hard as possible.  And the last level puts up turn sinks where you have to waste turns on a spot.  Thus making the level harder, I think this is a cheap way to force the time spent on your game.  I would like a free DLC, maybe there will be one I haven't read the forums but this game leaves you hanging.\n\nAnyways, 2 more days until Witcher 3.  This game was a nice distraction.","May 17, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it is different from Mark of the Ninja, with a focus on strategy and tactical planning over timing, the games have a lot in common.\n\nInvisible Inc. is a fantastic deconstruction of the stealth genre with a healthy dose of squad tactics and cyberpunk hacking. There is no random number generator that the player is fighting against - every action has a defined cost and a defined outcome. Also, the areas where your agents will be seen are clearly marked so there's no guessing what the AI can and can't see - as long as you take the time to cautiously scout ahead that is. At the same time, there is a constantly (and predictably) rising alert level that will activate additional defenses the longer you take so each mission becomes about managing your resources and deciding when is the right time to take a calculated risk to move closer to securing your objective.\n\nEach campaign takes place over 72 game hours before your team must confront the final mission.  This time limit makes each mission choice incredibly important and keeps the campaign to a very modest length (about 4 - 5 hours for one campaign I'd say).  At the same time though, each mission layout is procedurally generated so challenges are new and different every time which keeps the game constantly fresh.  Also, at the beginning of each campaign you get to pick your starting agents and hacking programs from a handful of options which can change your tactics significantly.\n\nObviously, I absolutely adore the game, and if you are interested enough to be reading these reviews and to have gotten to the end of this one, I'm sure you will too.  So go buy it already! :)","May 17, 2015","true","24.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bortington/recommended/243970/","bortington","Bort","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bortington/","86 products in account","The biggest problem I had with this game is the short time frame the main story mode campaign is based on. You have 72 hours to gather your forces and prepare yourself for the final showdown, and the very first mission you do takes 10-12 hours off that clock.\n\nWhile that doesn't exactly lend itself to in depth gameplay, allowing you time to figure out the game, that doesn't matter. Every time you fail, and your spy agency is destroyed, you gain experience. Enough experience, and it unlocks new Agents and Programs.\n\nWhat I found worked very well for learning the game though, is the Custom campaign mode. You can use it to configure just about every aspect of the missions, from the number of safes and consoles available to hack, to the number of guards on duty, and even what the alarm does. You can even set it to Endless mode, which takes away the three day time limit.\n\nI don't recommend sticking to Custom though. Changing all these options is great for learning how to play, but it does take away the actual storyline.\n\nAs for the style of gameplay, it's like a cross between Evil Genius, and XCOM. Evil Genius in that you have the world map, and select your missions on there, and XCOM in that the missions themselves are turn-based and have the same top down view that XCOM has. Unlike XCOM though, you are not there to shoot stuff. In fact, if you have to shoot stuff, chances are you're losing.\n\nKilling, or even tasering, is an option of last resort. You really want to stealth it, sneak around behind the guards, picking their pockets as you go, but try not to kill them, and if you stun them, they wake up after a few rounds and go hunting for you. Not the most ideal situation to be in.\n\nAll in all, a very fun game that offers something a little different.","January 27","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushmachine/recommended/243970/","crushmachine","Jojo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushmachine/","90 products in account","a nice roguelike game, but rather simple in mechanics if you are to compare with other klei games itself. it lacks some variety in the combat and the stealth mechanics, like, in mark of the ninja you could kill, disable, use traps, make enemies go bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy by throwing corpses at them and they would kill their friends and things like that, and was one of the things that made me love the game, the variety. in this one, you get to stun, kill, extend the stun period, and pretty much that. It falls too short on the variety factor and it kinda kills the replayability of it for me, i could imagine a ton of mechanics that would have made the game far more replayable, and expand your possibilities in combat (like you could get the enemies as hostage, implant something in them to make them your ally for some time as you make with the robots, it would be so fun), expanding the fun.\n\nIt isn't a bad game, not really, in fact this review is positive, and i have replayed the game (that, story wise is rather short, didn't bought the dlc yet to comment on that) multiple times, but i'm seeing that i'll  not play for as long as i would like because of the lack of variety. the artstyle is neat, ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous, the ost is fine, i din't pay too much attention, not that memorable, but is there and it's not bad, the character roster is sweet too, they vary the gameplay in very unique ways, and the augment system is there too, you put implants in your agents and they get special abilities such as wireless hacking, increased armor piercing.\n\nYou should note that, before buying, that it is a pretty brutal game, if played in the hardest difficulties. You have to plan very carefully, as you have no room for mistakes and you can get killed at any moment for something as trivial as a spot you moved in wrongly.\n\nOverall, a solid game, fun, but the combat gameplay possibilities kinda dissapointed me, compared to any of the other klei titles (see shank, don't starve, mark of the ninja...), it's a very good game, i can recommend it to any turn based or roguelike fan, and hope that new features are added in future dlcs.","December 1, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

That a turn-based game can create so much tension in almost every single randomly generated level I've played is just amazing. There are so many memorable moments emerging from the tight design and brilliant procedural generation!\n\nLike the time my whole squad played ring around the rosies to narrowly evade the one guard with armor we could not neutralize,.. Or the missions played with 4 agents with 3 weapons between them after starting the campaign with 2 rescue missions... Or that mission where I thought I could go deeper to  loot some safes and ended up barely making it out while running out of lethal ammo... Or the one where the financial executive we had stolen the codes from was running around like a panicked, headless chicken and kept spotting my agents...\n\nOne thing that makes it work is that you can pick your risk vs reward... if a missions starts out easy, you tend to try to explore/loot more, until things start getting too dangerous, which can happen quite suddenly if you make a mistake or just overextend. Another thing that helps is the full information and zero randomness (once the level is laid out), so that you never lose an agent to an unlucky shot (as is the norm in xcom). This, combined with the relatively short campaign makes iron-man-like modes viable for me.\n\n","December 6, 2015","true","77.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I don't think it'll ever be the game Klei are really remembered for, it's got a lot of good about it. Things you need to know:\n\n- Every map is procedurally generated - the parameters are similar, but no two facilities will be truly identical, and at the game's intended difficulty, there's just enough flexibility for truly crazy things to start happening\n\n- The game is hard! Either go golden or go home, because every mistake could be your last!\n\n- The background and story of the game are sometimes a bit sparse; sometimes the two main characters tend to steal the limelight from characters you're actually more likely to become attached to, so don't come to this game expecting the story to be its main selling point.\n\n- There are many viable strategies to win this game. Set deadly traps for your enemies, or simply sneak past them!\n\n- You can set up custom games very easily, and all the options you're likely to want are right there on offer. Enjoy!\n\nIn short, Invisible Inc. is a really good game - obviously not without its odd hangup - but it's rare for me to find a game in this price bracket that will give me more than 60 hours of solid thrashing before it becomes boring; and I expect to get a good few more hours out of it yet!

Except it doesn't detect weather anymore. It breaks safes, converts enemy robots to your cause, disables laser barriers, and occasionally makes you wonder whether it's becoming sentient.\n\nThe game successfully subverts a thorn in the side of stealth games by randomizing the corporation maps and only allowing for a certain number of "rewinds," essentially a reload of a save. In older stealth games memorizing enemy patterns is a way to cheese the system but that's just not possible with Invisible Inc.'s robust design. Every new room you enter is a gamble, one that might end up with your valuable agent(s) dead.\n\nI hope this game spawns a long line of sequels or imitators in the stealth-tactics (RPG?) genre.","May 13, 2015","true","31.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is incredibly tense and i highly recommend it. I'm serious! This is one of those rare gems that is both challenging and fun, and all because you GET challenges that you have to overcome.\n\nThe game is largely stealth based; you last as long in a firefight as a chicken would in a slaughterhouse. The game encourages you to watch guard patrols and stealth for as long as you can, only resorting to direct confrontation when you can either lure your enemy to you or ambush them from behind a table. You get a knack for exploring the levels and figuring out where guards will come from, where you can hide, what you can take for an escape route. Sometimes the guards can catch you by surprise, or they have special enhancements that force you to rethink your entry strategy.\n\nI do have some qualms. There are a few scenarios where I would expect guards to be able to spot me, but that in itself is nitpicking. I'd appreciate a means of acquiring a melee weapon from freed agents during detention center levels, and an ability to use recharging melee weapons at a cost of power, balanced of course by being expensive and punishing. More ways to deal with guards would be nice, like an ability/chance to bribe guards to leave you alone when nobody else is observing them (perhaps attached to anarchy).\n\nThere are a few other qualms I have, but really this is just nitpicking. On the whole, it's a very solid stealth game and it's worth your time. To give an example, in my most recent play-through I had to deal with a guard who turned out to have armor. I had to move my agents all about, luring them into all different rooms while also dealing with daemons that prevented Incognita from opperating. Deker literally had two guards and a security bot pointed at him when he cloaked and ran away, and two of my agents were trapped hiding in side rooms by guards on the prowl. To make a long story short, a lot of shuffling and strategizing later, all my agents made it out. How the hell I figured that one out i'll never know, but it was all the more gratifying knowing that I succeeded in such a difficult scenario.\n\ntl;dr: buy this game!","May 16, 2015","true","189.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It is turn based and all the interactions are fairly clear and deterministic, so it's easy to play in that sense. It is a stealth game, so it has the classic mechanics of running away, hiding, and using gadgets to set traps. Also, it is randomly generated and loseable, which removes the chore of replaying stages over and over again like in a traditional stealth game.\n\nIt also adapts those mechanics in a novel way, since the game focuses more on stealing money and gear in preparation for a final mission than clearing specific objectives in individual missions. This adds a nice risk management element, and valuation is required to know what to steal. It also has loads of characters and customization options, all of which are very welcome.\n\nSo I really recommend this game. That said, it's not without its flaws. Unlike most modern strategy games, most of invisible's flaws are related to gameplay and are very difficult to even notice. It took me 70 hours of gameplay to really notice anything wrong with it, which is an incredible testament to its design. I strongly recommend this game, and if you are thinking of buying it maybe it's best not to read about its flaws, and just stop reading now. But otherwise, here:\n\n-Character balance is bad. Some characters are miles and light years easier to win with, some are much harder to win with. Same thing with the programs you can start with, once you realize which ones are good, you realize they are good by a huuuuge margin. I guess you can still play with the bad characters/programs, if you want.\n\n-The game has LONG arcs. One playthrough is something absurd like 150 minutes (even longer with the DLC), which is very long considering you should be replaying it a lot. As a result you get feedback as to if your strategies are working very slowly, and a loss will cost you many minutes of thought.\n\n-The game's risk management... Well, it took me 78 hours to realize this, because of the second problem, but it turns out that the final mission is very doabe with little more than the equipment that you start the game with, if you pick the right starting agents and programs (even on the hardest difficulties). So the idea of trading risk for resources... If you are playing optimally just do the least risky thing if you've picked a good enough starting team.\n\nAnyways, in spite of its flaws, the game delivered almost a hundred hours of high-quality enjoyment to me, so I strongly recommend it.","February 15","true","87.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had my doubts as to how stealth would work in a turn-based format but Klei did a great job. As with Mark of the Ninja, the game clearly conveys everything you need to know about the stealth mechanics. This removes any ambiguity or guesswork and lets you focus solely on planning your next move.\n\nThat said, if you're expecting a story-driven experience or a lengthy campaign, you'll be disappointed. The story is sparse at best and entirely forgettable. Instead, Invisible, Inc. shares much in common with rogue-likes: short playthroughs with a focus on replayability, permadeath, procedurally-generated levels and random loot, The intended difficulty setting (Expert) is pretty challenging but the custom difficulty settings let you tailor the experience to your liking. Finishing a playthrough (whether by success or failure) earns you XP, which unlocks new characters and hacking abilities. This provides incentive to continue playing even after botched missions.\n\nAll-in-all, another great game by Klei and definitely worth your time.","May 17, 2015","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Klei Entertainment already has a solid stealth game, Mark of the Ninja, under its belt, so continuing with another stealth title is no surprise, and a real treat. Each agent has his or her own unique abilities that allow for a variety of tools for and methods of reaching each objective, and the characterization and voicework help flesh out a lovely dystopian future.

If xcom was a roguelike. You have a squad of spies and go on missions to complete objectives. Your spies have special abilities, can be upgraded and can use a variety of items that you can find or buy. You also have a computer AI that you can use to hack cameras, terminals, robots etc.\n\nPros\n- randomly generated level maps\n- actions are permanent, death is permanent\n- ironman mode by default (no save loading)\n- tactical to the max. There is no RNG in combat, attacks always hit. If you have a good plan it will work and you won't miss an attack. Equally if you put yourself in a bad position only tactics and abilities will get you out of it, guards won't miss their attack.\n\nCons\n- short campaign. The intention of the game is that you play one playthrough in easy or normal to become good at it and then come back to play the campaign again in hard or with custom settings. I can see this working because of the randomly generated levels, am now playing on hard after beating the campaign on easy.\n- no multiplayer.

Turn based stealth in randomly generated levels rouguelike.\n\nYou play as the "Operator" under the command of the chief of Invisible after they got ambushed by the corporations, a thing that will baffle your two main characters Monst3r, a broker with an income "bigger than a small countries GDP" and Olivia Gladstone, the aformentioned chief.\nAs the operator you guide your agents and a computer AI, Incognita,  through the corporations in hit and runs to get info and gear, preparing for the final mission.\n\nThe game starts with a tutorial on all the main mechanics with Decker, your modern day Noir agent.\nhere you will learn the most important thing about Invisible: getting seen is the first step towards failing the entire mission in many occasions\nMain mechanics are:\n-Walking and taking "peeks", your most important tool in my opinion, with your AP. This includes using camera and guard blind spots\n-Knocking out enemies who will NOT stay knocked out for the entire mission\n-Using your AI to hack and manipulate the electronics in the enviroment\n-Opening and closing doors a surprisingly useful tool to block vision and lure guards\nI could go on and on how many cool little things and items there are in the game but I find its better to experiment and find out. This IS a rouguelike, so its designed to be played again after failing.\nThe most interesting part of this game is the capability of choosing your missions. You have 72 hours to prepare for the final mission. Invading certain sites will give you certain benefits (money, gear or even the possibility of unlocking a site of your choice).\n\nYou have to roll with what you get and that is fun e.g. I got a very high level item and had a choice of selling it for some cash or using it even though I never had before. It worked out well.\n\nThe thing you will also notice it you are on the clock. Every turn the alarm will go up and the level will slowly become harder.\nHere the stealth comes in very nicely. Getting spotted advances the tracker prematurely as well as killing guards among other things so being expertly sneaky you will make it actually easier for you.\nAnd yes, the game reminds you. You have NO CHANCE in a stand-up fight against the corps. EVERY guard is a deadshot and will down your agents in ONE shot if they see them and you move or take another action except ducking for cover or taking them down.\n\nHere I would like to gush how this game reminds me of Shadowrun. There are 4 megacorps: FTM, K&O, Sankaku and Plastech. They all have different guards, Sankaku will have bots in their sites others will have special units of other kinds. I still have not been able to figure out all the specifics, but you will soon figure out which corp you hate the least to invade.\n\nLike many roguelikes if you die or complete the final mission, your experience will unlock things for other playthroughs like agents and programs for Incognita\n\nAnd having learned from Don't Starve: The modes you play are fully customizable to insane levels of painfulness so there is no real end to your challange, but as well as making the game a LOT easier should you have trouble with it.\n\nThe game has its flaws im sure but the only real one I could figure out was that sometimes it can be hard to see where you are going and clicking on squares for your agents to move which can be countered by camera rotation mostly but it nags me a bit.\n\nEnough rambling if you love stealth you will enjoy this game because instead of planning an attack you will plan a movement and action strategy to evade.\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\nTip: I recommend your agents have something I like to call "saving grace items". Cloaking rigs, flash grenades a tranq gun or in an emergency a lethal gun to make sure the agent can deal with being spotted by one guard as ducking for cover is sometimes not possible. Decker has one of those items making it a good reason for him to be a starting character.","May 22, 2015","true","33.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's an excellent turn-based tactical game along the lines of XCOM, but without as much of that game's strategic overhead and randomness.  More than being like XCOM, Invisible, Inc. is a stealth game that encourages you to avoid guards, cover your tracks, hack and pickpocket rather than hunt enemies, set up shots behind cover, and kill.\n\nThis difference creates a great deal of tension and excitement. The moment-to-moment decisions are suspenseful because of good tradeoffs between exposure, the costs to move and peek, and the ever increasing security level. You can take out guards, but only for a little while. All your decisions are important and deliberate. You don't feel screwed by the game because it has hidden outcomes and costs behind dice rolls: If you lose an agent in Invisible, Inc., it's because of the tactical choices you made, not because they missed an 80% quick shot!\n\nThe levels change significantly, as they're generated procedurally, and provide a good variety of situations and challenges. The look and sound of the game is great, with a light cyberpunk theme and sharp, stylish character art. It's currently playable only with the mouse and/or keyboard; adding controller support would make this easier to enjoy while on the couch in Big Picture mode—but that's wish-list stuff.

The good news, its fast paced and encourages the players to move fast and plan for a quick insertion and departure. The opposing force can be tricky and depending on the difficulty level, overwhelming. Settings can be customized to remove detection cones, increase play time, increase guards, etc. Time is of the essence so sometimes its better to grab as much cash as possible and bug out even if the objective isn't finished. The bad news is that I had expected something story driven like Mark of the Ninja. This is more like a tactical game like Masters of Orion. That's not a bad thing, just wasn't what I expected. There are other modes and if you want a rogue like game with endless levels they do provide that. There is a respectable difference between beginner and experienced. Beginner shows you the ropes while being engaging as you learn the basics. Experienced builds upon beginner in that you need to pay attention to what corporation defenses are present on a mission. It makes a difference whether you can expect drone armies, automated turrets or armored guards.

I didn't think I was going to beat this mission. Barely recovered another MIA agent.. Was only able to hack the turret providing overwatch to the entry to the interrogation room, to neutralize the lethal threat, before moving in. Had to leave surveillance cameras active in order to have the remaining power to break open holding cells. Brought maximum security alert up pretty quick.\n\nThrough a combination of using the turret (until it ran out of ammo), hiding under cover, intentionally catching the attention of the cameras for distraction, and carefully placing an unconscious guard as a lure, we managed to get out of a cornered situation in the interrogation room and evade the elite guards and heavy security closing in on us. After 10+ terrifying turns at maximum alert, we reached the exit. It helped that I left 1 agent out in the other rooms to act as eyes and a decoy while the other 2 broke into the interrogation room.\n\nThere were a couple really close calls too with agents tossing what few stun weapons we had between each other when we were almost overrun. Only one of our weapons was able to penetrate light armor, and nothing we had could have dealt with the heavy security. Cleanup cost us a bit with 2 destroyed turrets and 4 dead security guards, but got the whole team out alive. Only missed one safe. Made me feel like a total badass when I had all 4 agents assembled in the escape room.\n\nBut never again do I want to put my team in that situation.\n\nI had to think about it beforehand, knowing through early scouting that I'd have to trigger high security to make it into that room. I seriously considered aborting the mission for the first time. Figured rescuing an agent outweighed the risk.\n\nAND there were 2 surprises (stationary guards in highly inconvenient places) that I could have only known about after committing to infiltration. Did I mention I took a huge risk...? 3 surprises, actually, if you count not knowing who I was breaking out of there until we made it to the holding cells.\n\nTurned out the captive was Central's bodyguard/head of security, so it really helped that she knew hand-to-hand combat during one of those close calls. If it had been some kid the corp picked up off the street for ticking them off (which has happened), he would have been enough baggage to be left behind or even lose two of my agents.\n\nStill coming down off the adrenaline 25 minutes later.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChristmasCandy/recommended/243970/","ChristmasCandy","Candied Observation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChristmasCandy/","160 products in account","tl;dr : The best stealth game I've ever played. Buy it with the expansion.\n\nInvisible, Inc. is a rouge-like turn-based stealth game where you're controlling several agents through procedurally generated maps filled with guards, traps and loots. Its turn-based nature make it sidestep the central problem with stealth genre : The fact that waiting is boring. In this game, you never needs to wait since your agent is the one observing enemies for you. So instead of wasting your precious time, you're using an agent's action point to make a strategic decisions on whether it's worth it to determine the guards' patrol route or peek through doors.\n\nSince the game is turn-based, it only make sense to make the map procedurally generated. So I guess they just went all in and made the game a rogue-like. And it works. The only time I got bad maps that I'd rather not deal with is during early game of Expert Plus difficulty runs which includes more guards. Every playthrough also feels different since there's a lot of variety with agents, programs and items. Extra point for making the unlock painless, 2 successful campaigns and I already unlocked all agents.\n\nLast but not least, I strongly recommend playing the game with contingency expansion. The campaign on base game is short (around 9 missions, compared to around 16 with contingency) and it feels weird since it's basically just several early game missions before jumping to the end mission. Endless mode fixes that by adding exit pass, but I bet people won't be able to guess that there's some unique mechanics in endless mode. Also, Endless mode is improved with contingency too, so there's no reason to not grab it.\n\nIn closing, if you have any interest in stealth games, Invisible, inc. is a must buy. It's a solid blend of stealth and rogue-like, bringing forth the strength of both with many customization options if you find some aspect undesirable.\n\nPS: I strongly recommend playing endless mode until 3rd week after you got decent at the expert campaign.

The execution is great, leading to a game that is both strategically challenging and genuinely nerve-wracking: Recently, I started the last level right before going to bed, and--one nail-biting hour later--I found myself unable to sleep because I was still pumped up on adrenaline.\n\n(For a game, that's a good thing.)\n\nLike XCOM and other strategy/action hybrids, the game basically has a mission phase and a planning phase: On a mission, your agents are dropped into a procedurally generated level, through which you sneak, steal, KO, and kill your way to your objective. Every turn, an alarm increases and after five turns, something bad for your team happens, whether that be more cameras, a new guard, or revealing the location of your agents. Along the way, you manage your Power, which you can spend to  hack safes, turn off cameras, and control drones. It all comes together surprisingly well, and each piece requires attention, but never feels overwhelming.\n\nIn the planning phase, you spend money on upgrades and equipment, and pick your next mission--there are about eight mission types that range from liberating agents from detention centers to looting company vaults to getting cybernetic upgrades for your team. Weighing which missions to take based on the rewards, difficulty, and travel time isn't difficult, but it is thought provoking. The strategy required in this phase is pretty basic--it's no XCOM, but it's engaging enough.\n\nFor wimps (i.e. like me) the two easier difficulties give you a set number of Rewinds per mission. Basically, you can go back in time one whole turn and can re- or un-do the mistakes you made. This makes the game far more accessible, considering that losing an agent can often mean the end of that run. and the hardcore can reduce the number or turn it off entirely. I typically play games on the hardest difficulty, but I actually found the middle difficulty a nice balance--the hardest difficulty (and its one rewind per mission) demands a fair number of restarts, which I just wasn't committed enough for. If none of those sound appealing, there's a plenty lengthy set of custom difficulty options, which is even better.\n\nThe only complaint I have is minor--the main incentive in most rogue-likes to go back and re-play them is experimineting with different playstyles. In practice, the agents don't play all that differently and the eight mission types are largely similar. I wish the agents had some stronger differentiation and/or there were some sort of other agency-bonus that made trying different strategies and tactics more rewarding. Some missions that felt drastically different--and demanded a different style of play--would also be welcome.\n\nOverall, though, those are minor complaints. This is a great example of a well executed mash-up that ends up being greater than the sum of its parts. And I love the style, too.  Top notch work.","July 22, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gameplay is turn based, as you move your agents around office style environments that are divided up into a square grid. Movement distance is limited by Ability Points, and most weapons and gadgets have cooldowns. Its a system that has been growing in popularity over last couple of years, so if you've played games such as Xcom, Shadowrun or Wasteland 2, you'll instantly feel comfortable.\n\nThere is more of an emphasis on stealth, rather than direct combat. Ammo for lethal weapons is rare, so most weapons simply knock out guards temporarily. Its best to avoid confrontation for as long as possible. The security alarm increases each turn, and any time you're detected, or you kill a guard, the alarm rises even faster. Higher alarm levels bring more tech online (surveillance cameras, firewalls, drones), and summon more guards. There's always a tough choice between exploring the map for more loot, and getting out fast, before the security level becomes too high.\n\nMission locations include prisons, where you can rescue an agent (you start with 2 agents, maximum squad size is 4), bank vaults which obviously have lots of cash, finance offices where you can find special key cards to use at bank vaults, manufacturing plants where you can find advanced gadgets (such as cloaking devices and stun grenades), and server farms where you can acquire programs to help you hack and disable security tech. You have limited time to prepare for the final mission, so again there are some tough decisions to be made when prioritising which missions to play.\n\nMaps are randomly generated, which adds a lot of replayability. There's also a form of permadeath. If all your agents die on a mission, its game over. I think any game that combines these two elements needs to be careful with the difficulty balance. Getting screwed over by a particularly evil random map could be frustrating. Thankfully, Invisible Inc seems to have good balance. There are lots of options where you can customise the difficulty level, including allowing the possibility of rewinding a turn to undo a mistake, or even replaying entire missions. And the various gadgets and abilities can help get you out of some really tough situations. Its also worth mentioning that there is no random chance relating to combat. If a weapon is able to hit an enemy, it will hit every time.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the story is very basic, and unfortunately its the same every time. The game is designed to be replayed multiple times (a complete campaign will only take around 4 hours), so it would have been nice if the story allowed for some branching based on player choices. As it is, you'll listen to the dialogue once, then hammer the skip button on every subsequent playthrough. And its not really that interesting first time around anyway.\n\nOverall, Invisible Inc is a really good game. If you like tactical gameplay you should find alot of enjoyment here.","June 23, 2015","true","32.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A steep learning curve can make it difficult to warm up to, but impressive depth, customizability, and replayability easily make it worth the time.\n\nThe major highlight is the variety of abilities, both for your agents and hacking entity “Incognita”. They give the player a great degree of control and flexibility – essential for the high difficulty and occasionally unfair procedurally-generated maps. I also like the moody visual/audio presentation, which aptly depicts the oppressive corporate-dominated sci-fi world.\n\nI have an issue with the length, though. The last mission in particular feels less like a finale and more like a turning point, after which I was expecting the story to begin a new arc. But...then the credits started rolling. It's a shame, because the way the game is designed would have made it easy to write a longer, more thought-provoking story. Thankfully, the replay value of the 5-hour campaign is very high; it's fun to play around with different abilities and character builds.\n\nAs it is, Invisible Inc. feels like second-tier turn-based strategy, behind XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Valkyria Chronicles. As a fan of stealth games, I love how unique it is, and how deep it can be at times, but I also feel that it could have been much better. No regrets picking it up, though.\n\n(Rating: 8/10 “Very Good”)","June 21, 2015","true","38.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/recommended/243970/","redwolf29","RedWolf_29","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/","145 products in account","What's it about?\nInvisible, Inc is a turn-based, rogue-lite, tactical stealth game from Klei Entertainment, the makers of such delights as Shank, Mark of the Ninja and Don't Starve. You direct agents on missions in a number of randomly generated levels in order to build up enough power and resources to take on the final mission, all over the course of three short days.\n\nHow does it play?\nThe closest comparison one can make for Invisible, Inc is the XCOM series. While there are some obvious similarities, flying between missions in your own Skyranger-type aircraft, unit customisation, perma-death, steep difficulty curve etc, there are some equally significant differences. For example, there is no hit-chance RNG that made me give up on XCOM. If you make your agent ambush a guard, or shoot at them, they just do it. It will always succeed unless the guard is armoured and your agent is equipped with a weapon that does not pierce armour.\n\nApart from the XCOM-style unit direction, the main mechanic of the game is manipulating the field by using Incognita, a powerful AI, to hack into the levels mainframe. You can take over security cameras and robots, disable generators and unlock terminals with which to buy new items or programmes for Incognita. Some devices in later levels have Daemon programmes, which cause negative effects when the device is hacked, so caution should be exercised at all times.\n\nThe game is very fun to play. The controls are very fluid, and the gameplay is smooth. The UI can tend to get a little cluttered if  a lot of things are close together, but since the game is turn-based this rarely matters too much. Much like indie hit FTL: Faster Than Light, Invisible, Inc is a game that hinges on your ability to make decisions and manage resources. Since you have such a limited amount of time to prepare for the final mission, you must decide how to spend your money, how to assign roles and if it would be worth risking that high-security firm for the promise of a rare item. When things are going well, you can get a real sense of power as you disable half a facilities security measures, then move your agents in to take down two guards at once. Of course, if things start to go wrong, it can become a heart-pounding game of cat-and-mouse as you try to keep your agents alive and get as much out of the level as you can before (hopefully) escaping.\n\nAlso like FTL and XCOM, Invisible, Inc gets very hard, very fast. The difficulty ramps up rapidly throughout each campaign; armoured guards and weaponised drones become more common, and mainframe devices require more power to hack. Despite these spikes in difficulty, however, the game is never completely unfair. If one of your agents ends up getting caught and gunned down, more often than not it's your own fault for not making sure you were adequately prepared, or for putting your agent in a silly place. The game is designed to be played through multiple times, with random generation, different characters and a persistent XP and unlock system providing the motivation to keep trying again. Kind of like Don't Starve, really.\n\nHow does it look?\nKlei Entertainment are noted for their use of unique art styles across all of their games, all grounded with design and animation that is distinctly 'Klei'. Invisible, Inc is no exception, sporting an incredibly sleek and cool-looking pastel-colour, posterised aesthetic that suits the cyberpunk setting down to the ground. The clean and clear character and environment design lends itself to the gameplay, with the various guards looking different enough to allow you to sum up a situation at a glance, and also allowing for routes to be planned in no time.\n\nHow does it sound?\nInvisible, Inc's sound design is very good indeed, with lots of atmospheric music and crisp sound effects. The guards, who appear to all be Canadian, have just enough different ways of saying "Looking around" to avoid it becoming tedious, and the voice acting of the main characters is charismatic and engaging. Incognita's little sound bytes also give the impression that you are in control of a powerful, emotionless AI. Just like their art direction, Klei have always done sound very well, and Invisible, Inc is no exception.\n\nLong story short...\nInvisible, Inc, apart from having an amazing title, is a great little game. Well put together, smoothly executed, and neatly presented. It would benefit from some DLC offering more agents and items, but that could come later down the line. For now, Invisible, Inc is a superb, inexpensive game that provides quick bursts of engrossing, brow-sweatingly tense fun. It's appeal is perhaps more niche than Don't Starve, but give it a go and you may find lots to enjoy here. Just don't expect much of a story.","May 28, 2015","true","17.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It feels like an xcom 2 base game but obviously not the same because of the gameplay, you play as the agents from invisible inc. completing your objectives and rebuild your lost HQ that somehow they got compromise.\n\nThe cutscenes of the choice of artstyle I really like, I just wish they add more cutscenes instead of only two and more like Mark of the Ninja that has several shorter cutscenes. I want to have a small connection to my agents and the head leader, maybe the villians I want to hear their objective in this whole missions we were task on. Yes there are some brief history each of the agents including the leader, but what I meant was having an interaction between my agents as they are doing their brief missions. (after they finish talking to the main objective)\n\nEach mission is important depending on the resource you need and depending on the objective the level will be increasingly harder as you progress into complex buildings. You have an alarm meter that fills the alarm bar each turn and each level of alarm will get the level harder which adds more tension to the game and leaves you an adrenaline feeling when you're trying to complete your objective and will say to yourself of "oh shoot I got to get out of here, level 3 has been activate too many guards."\n\nIt leaves you the same excited feeling when xcom did this and invisible inc. nail it right out of the park for the creation of stress (in a good way) of either gambling to stay and get more loot or leave as soon as possible, not to mention the soundtrack they have is suburb when guards spotted you or when you just got to get the hell out, each action counts. You can't kill guards unless you have lethal weapons but if you do kill them the alarm level will be increase by two so watch out if you do. Is all about stealth and is better to not stun them then stun because that means you have to watch over the body so that he won\'t wake up and start searching for you.\n\nThere's your companion AI Incognita which she is a huge life savior at times through hacking, destractions, all kinds of cool gadgetss but each skills require power which you need to hack into terminals in order to get more power for use of Incognita. Each agents has its special abilites and I feel frustraded that you can only carry 2 agents at the start but later when you do rescue hostage you can get additional agents, although the only negative thing about the hostage rescue misssion is that you can't get their "unique" gear that he/she is special of using it, so you are stuck with a basic "normal" agent until you buy their gears back from shops that you can hack in buildings from your objective.\n\nThe game is short roughly around 6 hrs to complete but the modes is what kept the 20 hrs as of this review going because it adds more challenge into the game and having good replay values. The ending is a brain scratch for me and is obviously building up a sequel or hopefully an expansion pack which in my opinion I don't "mind" much because I sort a want to expand the game more to have all new challenges to play.\n\nCONCLUSSION\nDon't let my mix expression toward the ending stops you from buying this game, this game is mostly for gameplay value and it is excellant, the story yes could use some more in depth story telling to really earn an upcoming sequel pack, but the extra modes to fill in the extra hrs is still worth the price to buy. 8/10","June 1","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You control a team of special agents who are trying to infiltrate a number of high-security corporation buildings to gather intel and gear. After 3 in-game days (approximately 8 missions), you're thrust into a climactic final mission that is nail-bitingly difficult, even on Beginner mode. Difficult, but not unfair.\n\nThat's really true of all of Klei's games. Every time you "fail," you learn more about how the game works. And in this one, much like Don't Starve, you also earn XP toward unlocking new agents and AI programs that make the process easier.\n\nMaps are procedurally generated, there are lots of unlocks and several difficulty modes (including an Endless mode) so there's the potential for 100+ hours of fun gameplay here, easily.\n\nIf you like these kinds of games, you really can't go wrong. It's an amazingly polished experience all around, extremely challenging and tons of fun.","May 14, 2015","true","20.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It avoids complex skill lists and makes each of your crew valuable and individual, while maintaining the high-tech human theme.\nThe randomly generated maps are a good length, and their design is tight.\nI have just finished the beginner campaign, but I will definitely play the harder difficulty (something I rarely do) with the new unlocked characters.

The game opens with your HQ being attacked. Barely escaping and left with barely 72 hours, you're expected to get to the source of the attack and neutralize it, and save your organization's AI asset - Incognito - in the process.\n\nMake no mistake here - unlike most turn based tactical games, Invisible, Inc. is designed to be very fast paced. Emphasis is placed on making strategic decisions on whether to explore each procedurally-generated map and harvest maximum resources, or achieve mission objectives with minimal risk. All the while, the Security Level rises at the end of each turn, and stacks more and more opponents against your agents.\n\nBeing the underdog, you'll find that fighting the enemy head-on isn't going to get you far. Stealth and speed is the mode of play here.\n\nThe game is also designed to address the propensity to "save scum" - instead of being allowed to save in game, players now have a choice to rewind the game a limited number of steps instead. "Beginner" difficulty also allows you to retry the level (regenerate map and start again).\n\nCampaigns will not last more than a day's worth of play. Yet the game has great replay value - other than procedural maps always keeping you guessing, each agent made available to you comes with special abilities and you should alter your gameplay to exploit fully.\n\nIn a way, Invisible, Inc. tries to improve on turn-based tactical games and add a mix of roguelike. The result is interesting and definitely worth a try for those who enjoy turn-based tactical games.\n\nAs always, developer Klei did a good job with sounds and graphics to immerse the player into the world.\n\n\nPros:\n- Turn Based Tactical game done properly.\n- Replay value from different agent capabilities/upgrades, and procedurally generated maps.\n- Fast paced game and incremental Security Level makes the end-phase of each map exciting (instead of boring).\n- Rewinds offer a different way to avoid deadlocks/mistakes.\n- Excellent visuals and sound.\n- Good value, considering the cost.\n\nCons:\n- Randomness and short game-length can be an issue - difficulty can spike, augments/tools you want may not be always available, etc.\n- More back-story would have made the game more engaging for replays.","May 16, 2015","true","27.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Turn-based, strategic, square-grid, isometric, cyberpunk, stealth roguelike puzzler.\n\nLike FTL, you can be utterly screwed by the random generation of the levels, and can spend hours getting to the end fight, only to lose horribly because you just couldn't get enough of the right equipment, or the mission targets were impossibly placed. Other times, you can approach it like a puzzle game, where there *has* to be a solution if you just think about it hard enough. Or like chess, perhaps? And then other times you find yourself roleplaying the agents and their different strengths and personalities.\n\nFTL's biggest drawback was the limited campaign length, where just about the time you felt that you had gotten things under control, you had the boss fight, and were either prepared or not. And then the game ended either way. XCOM had a limited campaign length, but ended right before you got tired of it. Invisible, however, offers you an "endless" mode, once you've gotten the hang of the campaign mode. It has custom options for all of the cool bits, so you can make it as difficult or easy as you'd like.\n\nI highly recommend this one.

Leaving with the basic tools of the trade, I selected a "Guarded" mission - from what I could tell, this was the one that was least likely to hand my ♥♥♥♥ to me through use of an industrial bacon slicer.\n\nSpawning in with instructions to find the elevator and maybe steal a few priceless artifacts if I felt like it, I quickly explored the area with my two agents. They already felt very different - Mr Bond 2.0 galloped about the level like a majestic stallion in padded socks, crossing rooms in a graceful yet silent leap, whilst our resident lady-spy hacked computers from a mile away to fill the battery to doxx n00bs, celebrities, and any security cameras and safes that were unfortunate enough to find themselves in our randomly-generated path.\n\nFlash forward - lady-spy was in the vault hiding behind a safe having disabled both layers of laser trap, waiting for the battery to fill just once more level to unlock the safe. James was racing for the elevator, dodging irritated patrols that had been knocked unconcious one too many times through a combination of electric shocks and homoerotic terror (disregard for lady-spy). It was halfway through the final room when I froze - fiddlesticks, I thought, lady-spy has the keycard for the elevator! In my haste, I had neglected to open it on the way, out of a combination of ignorance and moderate stupidity.\n\nWith the alarm level raising continuously, I had to double back. I carefully guided James to the safe, hands shaking, nose pressed up against the monitor, and brought lady-spy to rest behind a desk in the elevator room. Battery having charged, I grabbed the final priceless treasure and hustled my trench-coated ♥♥♥♥ back to the main room. Suddenly, the alarm level escalated once more, and a new guard was brought up into the elevator. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe new plan was simple. Lady-spy would run to the now-open elevator, knock out the guard inside, and James would then join her - his extra movement abilities would allow him to bypass any possible guards that noticed the commotion or turned around to view the kerfuffle taking place. Palms sweating, I navigated lady-spy to the elevator, in position to knock out the guard. However, much to my dismay, there was a second guard in the elevator whom I could not see, but immediately saw me and moved to shoot. I had one square of movement for cover, and ducked behind the elevator door for cover, readying for combat if a guard moved to my square. James was placed next to her, also ready to attack. They could take out both guards, and we would be free!\n\nAlas, t'was not to be. Unfortunately, a third and fourth guard had heard our bickering. Elevator guards one and two were knocked out, leaving us with no defence when three and four riddled us with more holes than a swiss cheese at a double penetration party. I swore loudly at the computer.\n\nBuy it. It rocks.","August 21, 2014","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","4"

Quizá el sigilo es un poco light y la estrategia por turnos también, pero es la toma de contacto con un género nuevo y es inevitable que en sus comienzos sea un tanto rudimentario.

You are an elite team of stealth operatives. Your goal - get the most money you can. You can choose what kind of enemy bases to infiltrate and can choose to go after advanced technology, additional characters to join your team, programs to upgrade your hacking ablilittes, or a vault to score huge amounts of money. However, the longer the game goes on the harder it gets; you will have to build your team to be able to even escape at the later levels. The levels are procedurally generated, so every level brings a new tactical sitation that you will have to conquer.

The randomly generated levels feel dull and same-ish within about three(and several types of mission WILL require you to break stealth and start tazing or killing people, not counting the times where the randomly generated levels force it aside from that), you'll never really need any weapons or gadgets aside from one EMP thingummy, some tazers and a single armor-piercing weapon for the occasional heavy guard. I usually forgot I even had the rest.\n\nThere's also some twelve agents but they're not really particularly different, aside from Banks and Internationale, both of which are great for having a far less annoying playing experience. Start with any other team if you hate yourself.\n\nSome people praise the shortness, but to me the shortness just made me lack any sort of investment in what I was doing. It was all going out the window by two missions down the road, anyway, and the game lacks the variety in either player   options or challenges that'd make it fun to replay more than once.\n\nThe intro does look gorgeous, though. Bit of a shame that everything in the actual game is so zoomed-out that you never really get to enjoy the art style again.\n\nBuy Invisible Inc. if you feel like watching a trailer for a better game that they chose not to make and enjoy repetitive exercises without variation.\n\nDon't buy Invisible Inc. if you like varied challenges or interesting challenges.","July 5, 2015","false","6.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

As a team, Klei Entertainment has made indies that are are both innovative and fun, and I respect that. However, I really wish this game could have been better...\n\nMy actual rating is: Mixed, but in absence of that option, it leans towards negative\n\nInvisible Inc is a gameplay mechanic driven roguelike that holds a huge amount of promise, if only the game didn't feel like it was made entirely by the gameplay mechanics and graphics teams, two areas where the game shines. This is a game that was designed to be replayed a lot, and to remain challenging each time. Unfortunately, the weak story deprives the player of a lot of motivation to invest in that content. Let me elaborate:\n\nThe Pledge: A stealth driven random generated roguelike where confronting guards heads on is infeasible, the objective is to build the best team you can in 72 hours, like FTL. Excellent cutscene introduction sets expectations high for great visuals and great plot points. This game had one of the very best Pledges, setting my expectations really high given the slick execution of the first two hours\n\nThe Turn: Tense game of Cat and Mouse, with each action decidedly a calculated risk and the ever increasing security timer forcing an aggressive play style. Difficult to get new items, and soon PWR is a scarce resource to be rationed. New guard types (thankfully no dogs), viruses, and new goodies to buy keep moderately interested but lack of any story content during missions / barely any between missions is a gigantically big missed opportunity. Feels more like an elaborate puzzle than an actual strategy game due to the limited patrol areas of guards, and the extremely strange rule of sitting on top of guards as the only way to prevent them from waking up, while taking them out comes with strong penalties. Strategic decisions are related to which missions to pursue (each provides different boosts dependent on the type of mission), and where to invest your limited cash reserves (augmentations / gadgets / skill upgrades).\n\nThe Prestige: Where it all falls apart, only one ending, though the level map and specific enemies & locations are randomized. Due to a lack of context due to a dearth of story content, the ending feels both abrupt and all too sudden, with no fair visibility given on what will happen next in the series (beyond the very obvious). This was the point where I started questioning my purchase.\n\nThe Aftermath: Where the bulk of content is held, new agents, alternate agents (different abilities), and new abilties for your AI. Unfortunately, due to a lack of new story it came across as less appealing than it probably is, and I doubt I'll be investing a lot of time in it in the future.\n\nFor specific demographics:\nPrice sensitive: If you enjoy the Aftermath, it's worth the price, otherwise you're out of luck\nGenre sensitive: Lots of throwaway cyberpunk joy, but never synthesized in any way that makes sense. Tons of tidbits but no overarching narrative that puts the pieces into context, major letdown\nStrategy gamers: Frankly the game feels a lot like a puzzle but does have meaningful strategic choices, so it's worthwhile\nDiversity seekers: Good premise, decent gameplay, fair variety in Aftermath. If you don't mind a weak story, go for it\nThose with older systems: Game worked and ran beautifully and smoothly on my humble laptop, should run well anywhere\nArt lovers: This, like Transistor, is a treat to the eyes\n\nFinal verdict: Great potential, if only it had invested more in story, this version feels incomplete. If you like mechanic driven games or particularly Turn Based games, go for it, it's a great product. For others, check out videos first and then take a call.\n\nFor more on the Pledge/Turn/Prestige/Aftermath Review structure, check out my blog, criticalh1t on Blogspot","June 14, 2015","false","8.3"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

This is closer to FTL than XCOM, and you're obviously supposed to re-play with different starting agents and difficulty levels if you want to get a lot of the time out of the game. I actually like that, as these days I just don't have the time to sink 40+ hours into any game that isn't Kerbal Space Program, but if you've got more time than money, this might not be your game.\n\nOn the other hand, hour-by-hour this is a wonderful exerience. The mechanics are very simple and easy to grasp, but create a lot of strategic depth. A lot of other people are talking about those aspects, though, so I want to devote some time to the save mechanics. Rather than have either a traditional unlimited save system (which would lead to save-scumming, in a game like this) or having no saves (which would lead to either frustration or cheating and backing up the save file), you get a very limited number of one-turn "rewinds" per mission. These are enough to soften the learning curve and keep you out of game-ending screw ups, but not so wild that they feel cheat-y; the rewinds feel like part of the game, so I don't feel guilty about using them.","May 19, 2015","true","41.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The stealth is great. The guards are not OP when looking for you and hiding behind there view is really well done. The hacking is great, most the time the power points are easy to find and there are lots of things to hack but I have been on a couple of levels that have too much things to hack and points are hard to come across but as I said most of the time it's fair. I one of the things that annoyed me was that the story of the game was very short. I played though about 5 or 6 levels and it ended. The ending of the story was good and it could be carried on easily by (spoilers) fighting back against the A.I that takes over in the end and started to destroy place all over the world. The game could have easily carried on and been a much bigger and better but other than the short ending and the power points at times being unfair, it's a fantastic game and it's worth playing.\n\nI would say overall I would give this game a 8/10","May 19, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game successfully combines rogue-like elements, such as randomized levels and perma-death, with the gameplay of a turn-based strategy, which results in a great experience.\nThe campaign (although slightly short) and art style give the game a great atmosphere, while the varying difficulties, potential for themed runs, and randomized levels give plenty of replayability. Sticking with the atmosphere, the voice acting is well-done, and the soundtrack gives a good background to the game, which also seems to react based on whether you've been spotted / security level etc.\nOverall, this is an incredibly slick game that I can't recommend enough.

One of their strengths is that they make you immersed in the theme of the game. They made you feel like a badass ninja in MoTN and here you feel like a mastermind in the craft of espionage in this roguelike turn-based strategy game.\n\nBoth games share another trait: Despite there being an emphasis on evasion rather than confrontation, the game gives you the choice to go for a confrontational playstyle without it being too difficult to achieve. This playstyle does have a "skill barrier" due to the fact that the lethal gear costs a healthy number of credits to obtain and killing guards raises alarm levels by a considerate amount. However, the option is there and that is what's important.\n\nThe amount of choice you are given from the get-go is lovely. With a roster of 8 different agents (6 of whom have alternate "archive" playstyle) with their own unique passives and gear, you can select two of them to start out your missions. There are many little synergies between them, and even on their own they bring hefty benefits to the table. The ability to attack twice in one turn is great for clearing out tough situations, revealing electronic devices behind walls and being able to unlock keycard doors without need said card key are all strong by themselves both early and late game.\n\nYou are given the ability to take over the enemy's electronic devices with use of Incognita, your intelligent SHODAN-esque AI. Visiting server farm locations to upgrade her is a must, the later missions' electronics require stronger hacking tools to take down quickly. The resource system for hacking is PWR, which is generated via the chosen generation tool at the start of the run and also be lifted in small amounts from enemy consoles within a building. Using hacking programmes costs PWR, and you have a variety of tools for the job. Managing PWR is extremely important late game due to the stronger firewalls and the cap on max available PWR, but it is well balanced. I only ever ran out of power due to my own poor choices.\n\nThere are different types of missions which hold their own loot for the taking. You can choose missions from a world map which displays the time it will take to fly to that location, mission type, the corporate name and the security level. You need to choose your missions with care. Are you in desperate need of credits? Visit a Vault. Need some advanced gear? Go to a Security Dispatch. Got plenty of credits to spare? Nanofab Vestibule contains stronger items available for purchase. Hacking feeling lacking? Incognita would benefit with tools from a Server Farm. There are additional mission types but you get the idea.\n\nMissions themselves are simple at first glance. You avoid guard patrols and cameras, gain access to the mission loot while stealing whatever you can then you find the teleporter and get out before the security level rises so high it becomes impossible to deal with. You can hide behind furniture and machines for cover which allows for sneaking past guards, or you can sneak up behind them and knock them out for two or three turns.\n\n\nI've had amazing fun with this game through Early Access and I hope it has huge success on full release. It's an amazingly designed game that Klei have put their love into, providing a bar which other Early Access developers should strive to come up to.","May 12, 2015","true","82.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you liked XCOM or Shadowrun, I'm pretty sure you'll like this, especially if you're big on the whole stealth thing, and you like challenging games (i.e., playing on easy is still challenging and unforgiving if you're not careful).\n\nMy only advice is... if you get it, and you get your ♥♥♥ whooped, don't give up.

I enjoyed upgrading my agents, infiltrating facilities to make sure they had what they needed, and stressing out over the five armed guards in the next room. If you're into stealth and/or strategy games with whimsical party banter, then definitely give this a shot. The story is sadly short and linear, but the gameplay and character line-up more than makes up for it. You're given enough detail to get a taste of the high-tech world in which the story takes place, though it is regretably just a taste. You're also given a choice between an even amount of male and female characters, and it's a diverse choice of characters.

I understand the randomness and difficulty is part of the game's appeal and a selling point but it felt terribly unfair quite often. Even tweaking the difficulty levels (the game provides a robust system to customize things to your liking), you often paint yourself into a corner and it can be unavoidable not to do so.\n\nThis is due to the random level design, camera placement, item availability, and guard patrol patterns. You can run into a level that has a guard with armor and you never came across armor piercing weapons prior to this level - you're sunk. Yes, you have a rewind feature (a necessary addition to all but the most hard core players) and the option to replay a new randomly generated level if the one you started is just ridiculous. I dislike that player skill can become a negligible factor in your ability to finish a level depending on level layout and what items you managed to find.\n\nThe randomness is, thus, both a big positive and a big negative. Same with the difficulty factor. It raises sharply for each facility you infiltrate. This keeps you on your toes and you always feel the odds stacked against you. And this often leads to yelling profanity at your monitor.\n\nI like the game but all of its strengths are also its weaknesses.\n\nThe developers did a good job of balancing things, but the randomness can be a killer. Technically, the game is stable, I've never had any bugs or issues while playing. Invisible Inc. is entertaining but it can be annoying for the reasons stated above.","June 28, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This will also give you the time to explore different setup to complete the mission in different ways.

My first playthrough lasted 5 hours on Beginner difficulty, which seems short, but it's meant to be played multiple, multiple times (with like 7 difficulties shown from the start).  You gain experience each time you finish the game, win or lose (so you always get credit for your work), unlocking more stuff as you move on to higher difficulties.\n\nRandomized hacks and items have been really interesting so far, with me feeling as if my limited choices and combos of those choices really matter.  You also choose what kind of missions you will undertake as you prepare for the final mission, unable to complete them all (and they're also randomized each game as are level layouts and guards/drones/etc), deciding whether you want to steal agent implants, heist a vault of credits (to upgrade your agents or buy items/hacks), rescue new agents, and more.\n\nI didn't think the game structure would be as interesting as it is until I won once and started on the second difficulty.  It was noticably harder and I failed, but felt just fine about starting up again and trying out a different agent's abilities and hacking loadout.\n\nNot to mention the awesome futuristic "hacker" world and art style, complete with the nice touch of "demoscene" music when you're buying abilities from random hacked terminals in a level.

The gameplay is sharp and tactical: the game never misinforms you or tricks you, every mistake you make is definitely your own. This combined with the cutting throat nature of losing agents extremely easily when you get caught out makes for a thrilling permadeath experience.\n\nThe core gameplay itself is simple: stay out of sight and steal a lot of dollars. But of course there's much more to it. The hacking aspect is sublime, forcing you to manage your power as a resource is as huge a deal as putting your agents in the right spots. The choice between full-on ghost stealth or a bit more aggressive (but smart) use of weaponry to kill guards is balanced well: weapons make a lot of noise and you have to pay a clean-up cost at the end of the mission for every bodybag. A vast array of items and hacking programs mean pretty much every playthrough is different since you never know what you find this time. Combined with the progression of receiving XP from every campaign you complete or lose and unlocking new agents and starting programs gives the game a ton of longevity.\n\nIt should also be noted that this game has a great set of options, including colorblind mode. Also, you can customize your own difficulty or choose from presets: if you find that some aspect of the game irks you in a particular way, chances are you can tweak it to either be easier or harder. These options are available from the start, which is really cool. No more banging your head against the wall trying to beat the game to unlock second wave options.\n\nI absolutely recommend Invisible, Inc. The game was good in Early Access when I played back in September 2014; in full release, the game is just stellar.","May 16, 2015","true","51.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And at a start it is really hard, and makes you think two and three times, but I do lack some thing extra to lift it in the genre. As it is now it´s is really fun, but the campaign is really short took me about 2 hours to finish it from start to goal, and then I took my good time with it, to really try to do everything on most lvls.\n\nBut hopefully the creators get some new materials in quickly and prolong the campaign (which the end invites too at current date). Would mainly wanna see some more interaction and stuff to do while off mission, maybe in the case of more moral choices that will effect the game play and so on. But it´s kind of cheap, got potential and most important have a good game concept that just need that little more extra to become great.","May 14, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has the random map generation and permadeath of dungeon-crawling roguelikes, but instead of mindlessly mashing through weak popcorn enemies most of the time you have to cautiosly sneak past guards and manipulate your enviroment while carefully calculating your every move. You'll encounter many tough close-call situations that test your planning and improvisation skills. The game also is almost never unfair, as the gameplay is deterministic and everything is avoidable if you think far enough ahead.

While it was still in early access I purchased it but only after I thought it through for a long time. So when I finally did the deed and started playing I started to doubt my decision. The result was that I did not spend much time playing this game at all.\nAnd now it is finally released from EA and I have played only 9 hours according to Steam. And it is truly an enjoyable 4 hours. This game is very addictive to play. At first it might seem difficult to play but it really is not. As soon as the game mechanics is grasped the game starts to flow. It can be challenging but not in the extreme. O and there is a handy rewind button for mistakes you make. Although limited it is very handy. The movement of the characters are unique and sort of funny. At first the walls in the game was a bit of an obstacle when moving the characters but with a press of the ALT key they disappear for a better overall view. And if you’re put off by the graphics, don’t be. The graphics, fun characters, upgrade system and easy to grasp turn-based gameplay all adds up to the overall character of the game and a very enjoyable experience.\nI will without a doubt recommend this game. I’m sure you will not regret it. This is a Klei Entertainment masterpiece. I love it.\nSo this review is taking up valuable game time so I'm done. Its invisible time now.

You start the game by selecting 2 agents and then you have 72 hours to prepare for the final mission. You see a map where you can choose the type of mission you want, for example, if you want cybernetics, credits, items e.t.c. Each mission takes a different amount of time depending on how far away it is, but there's a max cap of 12 hours. For each day that passes all the missions gets harder.\n\nIf you die, or win, you will get points and unlock new agents and softwares. Note that each agent has its own backstory, skills and starting equipment.\n\nAnyway, once you start a mission, a level is randomly generated. Therefore you need to explore carefully since you don't know where everything is. Normally you're looking for the exit and the objective. This while evading guards, robots, cameras and other fun stuff. There are also objects you can interact with throughout the level, such as safes that contain money, consoles you can hack for power, a resource used by your AI, Nano-fabricatos which are basically shops where you can buy stuff and other things.\n\nEach turn you spend in a level increase the alarm meter by 1, for every 5 the alarm level goes up by 1 to a maximum of 6. It can also go up from other thing such as you're spotted by a camera or guard or you kill a guard without disabling his heart monitor. For every alarm level something bad happens. A new guard might spawn, firewalls get stronger, they detect one of your agents. None of these are random though, you know what will happen before hand. In fact, there is very little RNG in terms of game mechanics. For example if you attack a enemy you will always succeed, there is no random factor involved. This makes the game very tactical and less based on luck which is a good thing.\n\nUnlike other stealth games Invisible Inc has a big focus on staying undetected, by that I mean you don't even want to knock out a guard. Because when he wakes up he is not going to return to his patrol, moving from A to B and B to A, instead he is going to actively search for you in the entire level.\n\nI should also mention the game has several different difficulty modes and also a custom mode where you can select anything from the amount of rooms in a level to disabling the alarm meter going up by itself every turn. There's also a endless mode that doesn't have a 72 hour time-limit and a final mission.\n\nAs for the game length it has taken me about 18 hours to beat the game on Beginner, Experienced and Expert Ironman. But I didn't lose once for those playthroughs so you should take that into account as well. Don't expect to rush through it like I did, the game is not easy and I had a lot of practice with old-school Roguelikes. Even if I've beaten it thrice I still continue to play it, this time with the endless mode and 2 agents I haven't tried yet.The game is really meant to be played over and over.\n\nThe final verdict is a 5/5. That does not mean it is perfect, no game is perfect, but it doesn't have any glaring flaws and the mechanics is well thought out. Get this if you enjoy turn-based tactical games and you like analyzing/thinking.","May 28, 2015","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though an individual campaign lasts up to two or three hours, Invisible, Inc maintains extremely high replayability with procedurally generated levels and well as different starting characters and equipment that significantly changes the way the game is play, much like FTL: Faster than Light.\n\nFor those who don't feel like they're chess grandmasters, that's okay! Before starting a campaign the game allows you to customize many, many different options, all of which can significantly change the difficulty of the game. Feel the game is too hard? You could give yourself a boost in starting cash, or perhaps guards get knocked out one turn longer. Feel the game is too easy? Add more guards to each level.

The gameplay is sharp and tactical: the game never misinforms you or tricks you, every mistake you make is definitely your own. This combined with the cutting throat nature of losing agents extremely easily when you get caught out makes for a thrilling permadeath experience.\n\nThe core gameplay itself is simple: stay out of sight and steal a lot of dollars. But of course there's much more to it. The hacking aspect is sublime, forcing you to manage your power as a resource is as huge a deal as putting your agents in the right spots. The choice between full-on ghost stealth or a bit more aggressive (but smart) use of weaponry to kill guards is balanced well: weapons make a lot of noise and you have to pay a clean-up cost at the end of the mission for every bodybag. A vast array of items and hacking programs mean pretty much every playthrough is different since you never know what you find this time. Combined with the progression of receiving XP from every campaign you complete or lose and unlocking new agents and starting programs gives the game a ton of longevity.\n\nIt should also be noted that this game has a great set of options, including colorblind mode. Also, you can customize your own difficulty or choose from presets: if you find that some aspect of the game irks you in a particular way, chances are you can tweak it to either be easier or harder. These options are available from the start, which is really cool. No more banging your head against the wall trying to beat the game to unlock second wave options.\n\nI absolutely recommend Invisible, Inc. The game was good in Early Access when I played back in September 2014; in full release, the game is just stellar.","May 16, 2015","true","51.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It felt like Mission Impossible, X-Com, with some RPG leveling elements. It had great music, intriguing characters, and even dialog choices in a decent overall plot. Sadly, it was not marketed well and suffered from an infuriating bug toward the end of the game that made it nearly impossible to finish due to a repeatable crash. Probably because of lack of interest, the support just wasn't there, and it wasn't long before you couldn't play the game at all unless you put together a VM with the exact version of Java and the patch that sometimes fixed the bug.\n\nAnyway, I hoped Invisible Inc. was going to be like Shadow Watch, and I am not disappointed. This is exactly what I was hoping for--Shadow Watch updated and improved. I did not expect the Shadowrun-ish cyberpunk storyline, but as a fan of SR, that's all the better.\n\nIt does feel a bit short, even with the FTL-like repetition and deep mechanics, but it is still worth the $15+. I look forward to mods and DLC. I snatched this game the moment I saw it was available for Linux, and it plays perfectly on my Arch machine.","May 17, 2015","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You work as an operator for a corporate espionage company called Invisible Inc. The game starts off with your HQ compromised and your operatives MIA, KIA or worse; in a corporate deprogramming chamber. You are outnumbered, outgunned, on the run and have only 72 hours to launch a counter-attack.\n\nYou start the game with 2 operatives and Incognita, an AI capable of hacking corporate firewalls and teleporting your operatives into the enemy complex. During your missions you attempt to steal credits, gadgets, and implants for your operatives to use, for Incognita new programs can be downloaded from certain terminals. Occasionally you get the opportunity to rescue one of your operatives who were captured during the raid on HQ. These additions to your team and equipment will prove to be very useful for completing the more difficult missions.\n\nThe game gradually increases its difficulty by raising alarm levels during your missions, which activate more and more security measures, and globally (on the map view in between missions) as the security levels increase each 24 hours. These security levels indicate the amount of resistance you encounter while infiltrating the corps, this is also where the 4 corps differ from each other.\n\nSome corps specialize in security drones or armored personnel; preventing your operatives from taking them down, if they don't have the right equipment. Other corps specialize in tougher firewalls or Daemons, special programs which generally cause bad things to happen when hacked by Incognita. This really helps in giving character to the corps and makes you consider your loadout before choosing your missions.\n\nDuring the missions the key to staying alive is staying out of sight, carefully observing enemy patrol routes and using blind spots to your advantage. As the enemies you will be facing are relentless; they will hunt you down and shoot on sight, so evasion is the key here. However the real fun (and difficulty) starts once you have been detected and you have to think quick to either eliminate the threat or to extract your operatives, sometimes without being able achieve the mission objective.\n\nAs you play through the game, more operatives and programs for Incognita will unlock for you to use in your next playthrough. This is a nice feature, which allows you to mix up your tactics, as the operatives are all unique in their personal starting traits. These rogue-like elements help to make the (somewhat short) campaign highly replayable. The 5 extra game modes are also a lot of fun for the more seasoned players.\n\nAll in all, this game does an awesome job of delivering that "danger around every corner" feeling. So stay on your toes and peek around those corners to achieve your objectives and keep your people alive!\n\nI can recommend Invisible Inc. to anyone who loves stealth games and tactical turn-based games. Though for some people the rogue-like and RNG elements may be off putting, for me it adds to the replay value and challenge of the game.","May 17, 2015","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is closer to FTL than XCOM, and you're obviously supposed to re-play with different starting agents and difficulty levels if you want to get a lot of the time out of the game. I actually like that, as these days I just don't have the time to sink 40+ hours into any game that isn't Kerbal Space Program, but if you've got more time than money, this might not be your game.\n\nOn the other hand, hour-by-hour this is a wonderful exerience. The mechanics are very simple and easy to grasp, but create a lot of strategic depth. A lot of other people are talking about those aspects, though, so I want to devote some time to the save mechanics. Rather than have either a traditional unlimited save system (which would lead to save-scumming, in a game like this) or having no saves (which would lead to either frustration or cheating and backing up the save file), you get a very limited number of one-turn "rewinds" per mission. These are enough to soften the learning curve and keep you out of game-ending screw ups, but not so wild that they feel cheat-y; the rewinds feel like part of the game, so I don't feel guilty about using them.","May 19, 2015","true","41.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You start the game by selecting 2 agents and then you have 72 hours to prepare for the final mission. You see a map where you can choose the type of mission you want, for example, if you want cybernetics, credits, items e.t.c. Each mission takes a different amount of time depending on how far away it is, but there's a max cap of 12 hours. For each day that passes all the missions gets harder.\n\nIf you die, or win, you will get points and unlock new agents and softwares. Note that each agent has its own backstory, skills and starting equipment.\n\nAnyway, once you start a mission, a level is randomly generated. Therefore you need to explore carefully since you don't know where everything is. Normally you're looking for the exit and the objective. This while evading guards, robots, cameras and other fun stuff. There are also objects you can interact with throughout the level, such as safes that contain money, consoles you can hack for power, a resource used by your AI, Nano-fabricatos which are basically shops where you can buy stuff and other things.\n\nEach turn you spend in a level increase the alarm meter by 1, for every 5 the alarm level goes up by 1 to a maximum of 6. It can also go up from other thing such as you're spotted by a camera or guard or you kill a guard without disabling his heart monitor. For every alarm level something bad happens. A new guard might spawn, firewalls get stronger, they detect one of your agents. None of these are random though, you know what will happen before hand. In fact, there is very little RNG in terms of game mechanics. For example if you attack a enemy you will always succeed, there is no random factor involved. This makes the game very tactical and less based on luck which is a good thing.\n\nUnlike other stealth games Invisible Inc has a big focus on staying undetected, by that I mean you don't even want to knock out a guard. Because when he wakes up he is not going to return to his patrol, moving from A to B and B to A, instead he is going to actively search for you in the entire level.\n\nI should also mention the game has several different difficulty modes and also a custom mode where you can select anything from the amount of rooms in a level to disabling the alarm meter going up by itself every turn. There's also a endless mode that doesn't have a 72 hour time-limit and a final mission.\n\nAs for the game length it has taken me about 18 hours to beat the game on Beginner, Experienced and Expert Ironman. But I didn't lose once for those playthroughs so you should take that into account as well. Don't expect to rush through it like I did, the game is not easy and I had a lot of practice with old-school Roguelikes. Even if I've beaten it thrice I still continue to play it, this time with the endless mode and 2 agents I haven't tried yet.The game is really meant to be played over and over.\n\nThe final verdict is a 5/5. That does not mean it is perfect, no game is perfect, but it doesn't have any glaring flaws and the mechanics is well thought out. Get this if you enjoy turn-based tactical games and you like analyzing/thinking.","May 28, 2015","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I understand the randomness and difficulty is part of the game's appeal and a selling point but it felt terribly unfair quite often. Even tweaking the difficulty levels (the game provides a robust system to customize things to your liking), you often paint yourself into a corner and it can be unavoidable not to do so.\n\nThis is due to the random level design, camera placement, item availability, and guard patrol patterns. You can run into a level that has a guard with armor and you never came across armor piercing weapons prior to this level - you're sunk. Yes, you have a rewind feature (a necessary addition to all but the most hard core players) and the option to replay a new randomly generated level if the one you started is just ridiculous. I dislike that player skill can become a negligible factor in your ability to finish a level depending on level layout and what items you managed to find.\n\nThe randomness is, thus, both a big positive and a big negative. Same with the difficulty factor. It raises sharply for each facility you infiltrate. This keeps you on your toes and you always feel the odds stacked against you. And this often leads to yelling profanity at your monitor.\n\nI like the game but all of its strengths are also its weaknesses.\n\nThe developers did a good job of balancing things, but the randomness can be a killer. Technically, the game is stable, I've never had any bugs or issues while playing. Invisible Inc. is entertaining but it can be annoying for the reasons stated above.","June 28, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In Invisible Inc, units are alive, unconscious, or dead, with no inbetweens, and you know beforehand whether or not what you're attempting will succeed.\n\nIt changes the traditional TBS experience of poring over hundreds of numbers between each turn into a more chess-like experience, where all the information you need is simple and readily available, allowing you to focus on strategy rather than math.\n\nSame goes for the stealth. Too many stealth games make it unclear whether or not enemies are aware of your position, and again, Invisible Inc removes all ambiguity from the equation by a) changing the common "gradient" scale of visibility to a binary yes or no and telling you exactly when you've gone from one to the other, and b) being turn based, which means that once you've been seen, you have all the time in the world to pinpoint the exact route you need to take to get away.\n\nI bought this game and finished the campaign on the middle difficulty the same night I bought it. I have yet to beat it on the high difficulty, but I'm loving every attempt.\n\nIf you want a game that gets away from the needlessly obtuse systems of numbers that too many turn-based games fall back on, and allows you to spend your brainpower on actual STRATEGY instead of math, give this a try.","June 23, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The more you stick around to crack every last safe / get every last credit, the tougher the environment becomes.

In Invisible Inc, units are alive, unconscious, or dead, with no inbetweens, and you know beforehand whether or not what you're attempting will succeed.\n\nIt changes the traditional TBS experience of poring over hundreds of numbers between each turn into a more chess-like experience, where all the information you need is simple and readily available, allowing you to focus on strategy rather than math.\n\nSame goes for the stealth. Too many stealth games make it unclear whether or not enemies are aware of your position, and again, Invisible Inc removes all ambiguity from the equation by a) changing the common "gradient" scale of visibility to a binary yes or no and telling you exactly when you've gone from one to the other, and b) being turn based, which means that once you've been seen, you have all the time in the world to pinpoint the exact route you need to take to get away.\n\nI bought this game and finished the campaign on the middle difficulty the same night I bought it. I have yet to beat it on the high difficulty, but I'm loving every attempt.\n\nIf you want a game that gets away from the needlessly obtuse systems of numbers that too many turn-based games fall back on, and allows you to spend your brainpower on actual STRATEGY instead of math, give this a try.","June 23, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I first layed my eyes on this game and felt in love with the artstyle. I had to instantly get this game and give it a shot. I had no prior experience with any Klei Entertainment games before this.\n\nThis game was pretty challenging when I first started out but once you get used to it then it is all about your decision making. All I would have issue with is with the zooming of the camera but it was not a big deal.\n\nThe story is pretty simple, just an excuse to stealth because big corps are doing their usual business and it's time to take advantage. All the characters have their own useful abilities and can be improved as long as you stay alive.\n\nThe game has incredible customization so if you took a wrong move you can re-do it. You can set yourself a limit as little as 1 per game or as many as 99. You determine your experience, just fidle around with it until you find your difficulty.\nThere's nothing wrong with playing this game as casual as you want it to be. I just want you to know that this game is incredible and if you can play it any way you want.\n\nThat said, other reviews are written more in detail and bring the real meat of this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverlife/recommended/243970/","silverlife","Silver Aura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverlife/","242 products in account","A pretty incredible stealth game which has a very strong aura of "Chess" toward the latter half of missions when ♥♥♥♥ starts to hit the fan. You're thrown into missions which you choose from a limited handful each playthrough to build yourself up to a grand finale.\n\nAt the beginning of each mission, you're thrown into a facility with no idea where your goal or your exit is, and control up to four agents at a time to achieve it. With the clock ticking, things get crazy fast. Real fast. Often a step ahead of when you expect, which keeps things constantly exciting.\n\nThe story is very simple and wont single handedly hold you through more than your first playthrough, but that's to be expected. It's just vague enough to set the stage without being so detailed that it's obnoxiously repetitive. Good for a rougelike which is primarily meant to be played multiple times from start to finish.\n\nCharacter bios are significantly more indepth than the game ever fleshes out which was a disappointment but a mild one at best. Don't Starve has similar indepth lore without much in-game use, so consider lore a bonus to the game, not an essential detail.\n\nAll and all, if you enjoy turn based games and stealth, you'd be hard pressed to find anything to be truly disappointed over in this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wormerine/recommended/243970/","Wormerine","Wormerine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wormerine/","269 products in account","Very very very very strong recommendation. I am a big fan of stealth, team based tactics and turn based strategies so this game is all I could ever wish for.  While it is an unusual combination, Inv. Inc. is a kind of game, which makes me wonder why has no one done that before.\n\nInspirations for this game are quite obvious – there is a lot of XCOM in there, as well as FTL and other rogue-lights. Don’t be misled though, as it is a game of its own. If you long for a lengthy XCOM campaign with base building, you won’t find it here. Also at the moment it is not a brilliant rogue-light. The score system has been removed from the final release, as it wasn’t well polished and forced players to play in very specific (often not practical) way. If you hope for leaderboards you won’t find it here (at least right now). Also the progression and items you get, while very well designed, does not have the FTL wonder and variation.\n\nBut let’s talk about the really good stuff. If you are into stealth, all you need to know is that it is the first game I have ever seen to expand (and not only replicate) mechanics introduced in Thief: DP and Thief 2:TME. Stealth is great but it did have some unresolved issues for years. Games’ quality mostly depended on the quality of level design. Way too often stealth’em ups were an exercise in patience and didn’t actually require skill. Often the most fun way to play was sneaking but either it was just easier to shoot your way through the levels or being revealed was punishable in either instant failure or unavoidable death. On the other spectrum, sometimes there really wasn’t much repercussions from being discovered, and sneaking felt kind of pointless.\n\nInv. Inc. solves those issues with a simple, elegant mechanic called alarm meter. As you infiltrate enemy territory the automatic alarm system detects your presence. With every turn alarm meter fills up by one point. Every couple points alarm level rises and new counter measures appear: extra cameras, new guards, higher level of security (hacking.) This forces you to be efficient, as the more time you spent on the level, the more dangerous it will become. Once you get to alarm level 6 you’ll be better running straight for the elevator.\n\nBut this is not all. Get spotted, kill a guard and the alarm rises as well. Thanks to that, your failings have repercussions and game punishes you for mistakes, but it is never an instant gameover (unless you do something really careless.) As a matter of fact my best experiences with the game were when things got hairy.\n\nAdd to that the way guard work – they follow their own stable patrol routines until you disturb them (be spotted or stun them – stunning does not take guard out of the game forever. He wakes up after couple turns.) When alerted they will be actively looking for you. They become unpredictable and dangerous. The ideal way is to ghost through the level. Even stunning a guard (and you will probably have to do it almost every mission) carries consequences.\n\nThat is about stealth mechanics. They are absolutely brilliant. The story is serviceable, mostly explaining, why you do what you do, but it does have some nice touches and is supported by great art-style.\n\nThere are a few game modes to choose from. There is the story mode, which is the main meat of the game. It has couple difficulty settings, to allow new players to get to know the game, without tearing their hair out, and some tough ones for those who crave for extreme challenge. It is a 72 (ingame) hour campaign, with a final mission at the end. You take on different missions and build up your squad in preparation for the final level.\n\nThere is endless mode, which removes final mission, allows you to go forever but the difficulty spikes beyond this of the story mode.\n\nTime attack gives you a time limit on your turns forcing you to think quickly and make snap decisions.\n\nSandbox allows you to modify rules of the game (even remove the alarm system, which I don’t know why would you want to do….) and create as easy or as difficult experience as you wish.\n\nIt might not seem like much but between excellent procedural generation, roster of different agents and their alternative versions and programs to use (ha I didn’t even mention hacking! It is basic but well designed. Has more depth than seems at first and adds to the ever present resource management) you will be able to sunk hours upon hours into this game on a story mode alone. It is a game for those who like PLAYING games, and not only BEATING them.\n\n","May 12, 2015","true","148.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

It really makes you feel like a runner up against the megacorps.\n\nGameplay-wise, you get a map to select your next infiltration target. Each mission provides different benefits (access to new implants, lots of money to upgrade your team, unlock for better missions...) and you can do only a handful before the "final" mission. Everything you do is meant to prepare you for that last one.\nIn mission, you move on a grid with action points, avoiding guards and cameras, hacking them or directly taking them out. There is quite a number of elements to interact with, be it safes to pilfer, turret to take control of, or mainframe to hack to get info on the level layout (those are just a select few).\nYou control physical agents (starting with 2, and up to 4 if you happen to free some), plus an IA capable of hacking firewalls ("locks" on interactable devices) and doing misc jobs: distracting enemies by sounds, hindering guards visions, bypassing daemons (basically, traps)... All of those are done using "power", which management is a conundrum in itself (different ways to generate and spend it).\nEach turn, and on each detected action, the security counter increase. Every 5 levels, bad things happen (firewalls get reinforced, more guards appear...), until you are forced to evacuate or plainly be wiped by security forces.\nEscape in itself is important: getting the money is good, but you have to reach the exit teleporter of the level to evacuate your team to get any use out of it.\n\nThe standard "campaign" is quite short (about 10 levels), but you get a lot of customization options like "endless mode" or difficulty tweaks (cash modifier, map size, guard number...), so it catters well to both invested gamers and more casual ones.\nAnd if and when you actually beat the game, you get new agents/programs to start the game with, so as to provide some sizeable replayability.\n\nTL;DR: this game is a good roguelike, with interesting mechanics.\nIf you don't like roguelikes, it will probably won't please you much.

The result is an absorbing game that scratches an itch I never knew I had, and there's enough replay value here to keep me playing for a good long while.\n\nI bought this game while it was in Early Access, and I'm glad to say that investment paid off. When I bought it, it was a great game and well worth the asking price, and it has only gotten better since then.\n\nCongrats to Klei on an excellent game!","June 10, 2015","true","109.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At the beginning of each game you select 2 agents to be your operatives with the ability to unlock more permanently by gaining experience after each of your runs. While there appear to be a decent amount of agents (10 + alternate skillsets for half of them), at the time of writing this review there are only really 2 that you will ever pick as they have vastly superior starting skillsets/gear than the other options - the default International and Banks.\n\nLevels are randomly generated and amazingly feel very good for a stealth game it is extremely rare that it will generate an unwinnable scenario and you can always see what was the cause of your downfall when it does happen leading to it feeling like you made a mistake rather than the game cheated you. At 20+ hours I've only had one instance where I felt cheated. There is a tension build up as you play on with it having permadeath (if your squad is wiped you start over from day 1)  and when you finally reach the final mission it can be nailbiting and extremely rewarding to pull off the victory. There are also multiple difficulty options and you can toggle just about any important aspect of the game before you start playing - don't like permadeath? Toggle level retries on, toggle starting money, power, etc. just about anything you want but the default options are great as is as well.\n\nLike any good rogue-like each game will play out differently based off the type of gear you find as you go along. One playthrough you may find an upgrade for your hacking AI that lets you break down firewalls easier or a cybernetic enhancement that lets you move more every time you knock someone out. The gear in the game seems fairly well balanced and just about anything can be useful. Managing your time and money to get the most bang for your buck in terms of what to buy, upgrades or gear is important to learn to do better and a rewarding experience.\n\nWithout a doubt Invisible, Inc. is my favorite strategy game of 2015 and I highly encourage stealth, rogue-like and strategy fans to all give it a go.","May 28, 2015","true","57.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seriously, it's amazing. Hands down, one of my favorites next to Xcom and FTL.\nIt has the vibe of both games. On the Xcom side, you have your stan- amazing turn-based strategy game, where one miss click can put you back at the start, and you can potentially lose some one every turn. You have to be super-considerate on where you position your agents, study the patrol patterns of guards, and make it out alive. But there's a twist. Every five turns the level gets a million times harder. On the FTL side, you have completely random, completely on the spot generated, every mission/area is different every time you play, with difficulties that make Xcom's classic mode look like a breeze. Invisible, Inc. has some beautiful art styles, like FTL, and great character development like Xcom, being able to make up your own stories for your agents. Although, you can't exactly customize he agent's anywhere near the level of depth of something such as Xcom, where you have over 9000 combinations. I do have a major problem with this game though: The story mode (not including Endless) is terribly short, making it hard to maximize your agents for the final mission, such as in Xcom or FTL. I wish as well you got more punishments for aborting missions instead of completing them, such as in the Detention center missions, if you abort without saving the Courier/MIA Agent, Central Scolds you, but there is no punishment. It would have been nice to see different story lines based on your actions, such as if you go into  every mission with Shalem 11 and Archive Decker, guns blazing, you get a more evil ending, or if you go in like a ghost, never getting caught, you get an ending fitting that play style. Something to spice up the already amazing game, letting you have many different approaches to missions, unlike Xcom, where you go in killing anything that moves or looks like it can kill you, or FTL, where if it isn't a shop or special event, you're going to kill some thi- Scratch that, a lot of things. Still, this game well deserves an 8/10.","May 26, 2015","true","63.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverlife/recommended/243970/","silverlife","Silver Aura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverlife/","242 products in account","A pretty incredible stealth game which has a very strong aura of "Chess" toward the latter half of missions when ♥♥♥♥ starts to hit the fan. You're thrown into missions which you choose from a limited handful each playthrough to build yourself up to a grand finale.\n\nAt the beginning of each mission, you're thrown into a facility with no idea where your goal or your exit is, and control up to four agents at a time to achieve it. With the clock ticking, things get crazy fast. Real fast. Often a step ahead of when you expect, which keeps things constantly exciting.\n\nThe story is very simple and wont single handedly hold you through more than your first playthrough, but that's to be expected. It's just vague enough to set the stage without being so detailed that it's obnoxiously repetitive. Good for a rougelike which is primarily meant to be played multiple times from start to finish.\n\nCharacter bios are significantly more indepth than the game ever fleshes out which was a disappointment but a mild one at best. Don't Starve has similar indepth lore without much in-game use, so consider lore a bonus to the game, not an essential detail.\n\nAll and all, if you enjoy turn based games and stealth, you'd be hard pressed to find anything to be truly disappointed over in this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wormerine/recommended/243970/","Wormerine","Wormerine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wormerine/","269 products in account","Very very very very strong recommendation. I am a big fan of stealth, team based tactics and turn based strategies so this game is all I could ever wish for.  While it is an unusual combination, Inv. Inc. is a kind of game, which makes me wonder why has no one done that before.\n\nInspirations for this game are quite obvious – there is a lot of XCOM in there, as well as FTL and other rogue-lights. Don’t be misled though, as it is a game of its own. If you long for a lengthy XCOM campaign with base building, you won’t find it here. Also at the moment it is not a brilliant rogue-light. The score system has been removed from the final release, as it wasn’t well polished and forced players to play in very specific (often not practical) way. If you hope for leaderboards you won’t find it here (at least right now). Also the progression and items you get, while very well designed, does not have the FTL wonder and variation.\n\nBut let’s talk about the really good stuff. If you are into stealth, all you need to know is that it is the first game I have ever seen to expand (and not only replicate) mechanics introduced in Thief: DP and Thief 2:TME. Stealth is great but it did have some unresolved issues for years. Games’ quality mostly depended on the quality of level design. Way too often stealth’em ups were an exercise in patience and didn’t actually require skill. Often the most fun way to play was sneaking but either it was just easier to shoot your way through the levels or being revealed was punishable in either instant failure or unavoidable death. On the other spectrum, sometimes there really wasn’t much repercussions from being discovered, and sneaking felt kind of pointless.\n\nInv. Inc. solves those issues with a simple, elegant mechanic called alarm meter. As you infiltrate enemy territory the automatic alarm system detects your presence. With every turn alarm meter fills up by one point. Every couple points alarm level rises and new counter measures appear: extra cameras, new guards, higher level of security (hacking.) This forces you to be efficient, as the more time you spent on the level, the more dangerous it will become. Once you get to alarm level 6 you’ll be better running straight for the elevator.\n\nBut this is not all. Get spotted, kill a guard and the alarm rises as well. Thanks to that, your failings have repercussions and game punishes you for mistakes, but it is never an instant gameover (unless you do something really careless.) As a matter of fact my best experiences with the game were when things got hairy.\n\nAdd to that the way guard work – they follow their own stable patrol routines until you disturb them (be spotted or stun them – stunning does not take guard out of the game forever. He wakes up after couple turns.) When alerted they will be actively looking for you. They become unpredictable and dangerous. The ideal way is to ghost through the level. Even stunning a guard (and you will probably have to do it almost every mission) carries consequences.\n\nThat is about stealth mechanics. They are absolutely brilliant. The story is serviceable, mostly explaining, why you do what you do, but it does have some nice touches and is supported by great art-style.\n\nThere are a few game modes to choose from. There is the story mode, which is the main meat of the game. It has couple difficulty settings, to allow new players to get to know the game, without tearing their hair out, and some tough ones for those who crave for extreme challenge. It is a 72 (ingame) hour campaign, with a final mission at the end. You take on different missions and build up your squad in preparation for the final level.\n\nThere is endless mode, which removes final mission, allows you to go forever but the difficulty spikes beyond this of the story mode.\n\nTime attack gives you a time limit on your turns forcing you to think quickly and make snap decisions.\n\nSandbox allows you to modify rules of the game (even remove the alarm system, which I don’t know why would you want to do….) and create as easy or as difficult experience as you wish.\n\nIt might not seem like much but between excellent procedural generation, roster of different agents and their alternative versions and programs to use (ha I didn’t even mention hacking! It is basic but well designed. Has more depth than seems at first and adds to the ever present resource management) you will be able to sunk hours upon hours into this game on a story mode alone. It is a game for those who like PLAYING games, and not only BEATING them.\n\n","May 12, 2015","true","148.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Honest.\n\nInvisible, Inc. could be called X-COM Except You're Burglars: The Roguelike-like. It has a cyberpunk aesthetic and soundtrack to die for. The turn-based gameplay is genuinely tense and compelling, yet intuitive, and it presents a solid array of tactical factors at nearly every stage. What makes it so tense is that unlike most stealth games, the detection system is pretty much already tripped for every level and you're more or less on the run for almost the whole game.\n\nMore often than not, you'll have to choose between scarce resources and safety. One misstep could blow your cover or even the whole operation if you don't deal with it effectively...and if you configured the difficulty to have less or even no rewinds, you'd better think fast.\n\nInvisible, Inc.'s campaign itself is short, but has great replay value, and there's an expansion pack (it's a bit too substantial to call it DLC) that lengthens the game anyway...and that's not counting Workshop support. The characterization & banter between the agents, and the nature of the Invisible, Inc. they're working for, make for an economical yet intriguing story. Difficulty levels are extremely customizable, which is great for challenge-oriented people and their opposites as well.\n\nThere's two main issues I can find. One is that the UI can become somewhat cluttered; be prepared to scrutinize and scrutinize some more when corporate security guards are bearing down on your agents. Levels are also randomly generated, which can occasionally result in unfair situations in an otherwise highly-strung yet fair game. In fact, the game is tense enough that, as good as it is, this is decidedly not a 'relaxation' game in any way, shape or form. Not unless you consider sending agents to their doom relaxing.\n\nI'd still absolutely recommend this if you want great stealth and/or dislike corporations in some form.","February 2","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its roguelike features allow for a great replayability value. The difficulty configuration allows several very valid approaches to it (You can either keep the game's original rules or craft your own; for example, you can set the game so the "alarm" that is automatically raised every turn when you're infiltrating somewhere doesn't advance automatically, but in exchange you advance whole alarm levels when spotted).\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a roguelike whose combat mechanics do NOT rely in RNG at all makes it extremely pleasant to play. A plan fails when it's ill conceived or you didn't take something into account. A good plan will always work, regardless of what you get on a dice roll.\n\nAll in all, it's a very good game if you like stealth and/or tactics games.","January 9","true","36.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, it's somewhat unique, and feels like a strategy/tactics game, even if ultimately, you don't ever really feel like you have very many viable options. A much worse problem is the fact that Invisible Inc doesn't have a clear goal, instead opting for a "High Score" thing.\n\nWith all of that said, it's still worth a few plays, for sure.","September 27, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The various components of Invisible aren't anything new. There's no new "wow" factor here. We've seen this before.\n\nBut it is an exceptionally well crafted experience. The mechanics of the game are simple - hide from your enemies. As a general rule you really can't kill them. But you can knock them out for 3 turns. All the while you're avoiding patrols, cameras and bots. You can instruct your friendly AI to turn off security systems and open safes, but you're always limited by power as to how much help the AI can provide. Meanwhile, there's a clock ticking that makes security get tougher every 5 turns, so you need to move with haste. Your operatives have limited skills, limited inventory slots and even more limited funds, so you're going to have some hard choices.\n\nPut this together and you have a very tight package of gaming goodness. It's not hard to pick up but it does get difficult to master. Even on the easiest level the game is a challenge. On higher levels, you simply can't make mistakes and there's no save function here. You have a very limited ability to rewind to avoid a screwup, but limited is a key word in that sentence.\n\nThe "campaign" isn't very long - you'll finish it in fewer than 3 hours. But you mayl want to play this again and again since all levels are randomly generated and the various difficulty levels will always provide a good challenge.\n\nNow my biggest problem with the game really revolves around the longevity. Even knowing the levels are random doesn't help what become some fairly simple gameplay mechanics. So while I found the game exceptionally well-crafted and worthy of your dollars, I'm not going to see a lot of long-term gameplay from this title in my experience.","May 15, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

EAch level has a limited number of turns before a full blown alarm is blown.\n\nThe lore states that although you managed to get in undetected, the secuirty system eventually discovers there is an intruder.\n\nThis completely ruined the experience for me, in all tactics turn based games, I like taking my time, with leap frog tactics and a lot of observation. This games potential to make this a possibilty was switched to time constraints. Really wish they'd have used another mechanic to create pressure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DragonDai/recommended/243970/","DragonDai","Dragon Dai (Uey)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DragonDai/","381 products in account","Very unique take on the turn based tactical genre, but the difficulty goes from "So easy I could do this in my sleep" and "Cannot beat second mission after 17 attempts (literally)" when you switch from Beginner to Experienced (the next difficulty up and middle of 3 standard difficulties). I don't mind difficult games, but I want to be making progress. So far, I've made literally none. And whether that's cause I'm awful or because the game is very bad at explaining things (the first is likely true, the second certainly true), it doesn't really matter. When you can make progress, even a little progress, fun dies.\n\nYou CAN customize the difficulty down to the last detail, which is nice, but it would be nice if the official difficulties didn't have such a massive difficulty jump.\n\nAs of now (and probably as of ever considering this games been out for a while now and a LARGE balance pass is unlikely), I have to not recommend this game, in general. If you're REALLY jonsin' for a TBT game AND you don't mind just INSANELY frusterating difficulty OR mindnumbing bordem (because it's too easy on lowest difficulty), than yeah, give it a go. It's certainly different, looks great, has interesting game systems, and is overall a worthwhile experience. It's just not for people who don't hate themselves...a lot.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, and the game is made to be replayed, a BUNCH. This is accomplished by having even winning games be VERY short (each map takes MAYBE a half hour and you get about 9 of them per game, lose a single one and it's game over). The downside is that every single time you play the game again you have to listen to the exposition in the form of little naritive boxes with voice over. They are skipable, but you have to skip 2-5 boxes per exposition chunk (sometimes even more), and each box requires a seperate click and there are a LOT of them (1-2 between each mission). So be prepared to skip the same dialog over and over and over and over. It's not a big gripe, but it does get REALLY annoying, REALLY fast and it's something the devs could easily fix.\n\nEDIT 2: So yeah, game is shelved indefninetly. Played another could tries and on the attempt before I quit and uninstalled, I had to use all three restarts on the first turn, because guards walk into the only room you can exit the starting room into on turn 1. And then, on turn 2, 2 guards walk into the starting room...I Tazed them both, but a third guard walked into the room after the starting room on turn 3, while I was trying to leave. There was literally nothing I could have done about it. So yeah, difficulty = bananas or boring. If that's your sort of thing, enjoy.

Basically a turn-based stealth roguelike, with the stealth mechanics done right.\n\nWhat really makes this work is that the game provides all the necessary tools to make the stealth gameplay work - you have variety of scouting options including hacking cameras and predicting visible enemy routes, but they all have an opportunity cost. Due to the options to gather information, there's very little randomness outside of the actual mission generation (though there are plenty of opportunities to take calculated risks). You never feel like you were cheated by something you couldn't have accounted for or that winning is more luck based than skill based.\n\nThe balance is also very good considering it's still in Early Access. It does have a bit of a learning curve to figure out what works, but once you get rolling the missions are challenging but reasonable.

Basically a turn-based stealth roguelike, with the stealth mechanics done right.\n\nWhat really makes this work is that the game provides all the necessary tools to make the stealth gameplay work - you have variety of scouting options including hacking cameras and predicting visible enemy routes, but they all have an opportunity cost. Due to the options to gather information, there's very little randomness outside of the actual mission generation (though there are plenty of opportunities to take calculated risks). You never feel like you were cheated by something you couldn't have accounted for or that winning is more luck based than skill based.\n\nThe balance is also very good considering it's still in Early Access. It does have a bit of a learning curve to figure out what works, but once you get rolling the missions are challenging but reasonable. The main difficulty is in how greedy you want to be - there's a soft time limit in each mission, and plenty of optional loot; usually you can't afford to try to get everything, so you have to make some tough decisions. But the game keeps scaling in difficulty, so you can't leave behind too much loot...\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who enjoys stealth games.","August 22, 2014","true","69.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Its challenging, tense, and always encourages players to think outside the box and address problems in interesting ways. As normal for the studio, not only do they offer rocksolid mechanics, but also deliver incredibly in sound, music, theme, and mood. While this game is undoubtedly a roguelike (which 9 times out of 10 means a light story), the characters' banter and the overall vibe of the game really makes me wish there was more there.\n\nFor the player that aren't fans of the tense gameplay, the options are versatile enough to allow lots of tweaks to suit your playstyle. For example, many negative reviews highlight that you aren't allowed to 'take your time', because every stage grows more dangerous the longer you stay there. However, you can turn off the creeping alarm completely so you can take your time. You can also make disabling guards last longer, allow yourself to find more money, or even decrease the number of guards per stage. Inversely, you can go full on masochist Iron Man, and remove the option to rewind turns, the ability to abort missions, and enforce a real time Time Attack that ends the turn if you take too long making decisions.\n\nTo be honest, I was hesitant when I first read up on the game some years ago. I never thought turned-based and stealth could work together, but Klei married them together beautifully. As a design junkie, it was a joy to follow this game through early access, seeing how tiny changes completely shifts the gameplay with each update. As mentioned, the story does suffer, and comes to a VERY abrupt end (perhaps a higher difficulty allows you to go further? I don't know). However, if Don't Starve is anything to go by, we'll see more content before long, and I honestly can't wait.","May 18, 2015","true","34.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The basic concept involves you moving your agents around a randomly generated grid based map, once you've made your move you end turn and the NPC controlled corporation guards make their move. Things are made tense with an ever increasing alarm system. So even though their is no time limit, you are always conscious of the alarm level and the the difficulties it brings the higher it gets.\n\nMore to follow....","May 12, 2015","true","77.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And much like a dancer, both the intense satisfaction of completing your routine and the sweat dripping from your brow as a result of doing so are key reasons why I recommend this game. Invisible Inc. is produced by Klei Entertainment, which should hopefully bring a smile to your face - they are the creators of the superb "Don't Starve", and I can confirm they haven't disappointed here either. I won't go into every reason for this game's success, but I will say that the gameplay, the style of which I have never really been a fan of, is tremendously fun and challenging, there is, much like Don't Starve, plenty of replayability due to the procedural nature of its level generation, and the visuals/audio are beautifully sublime, or sublimely beautiful, whichever you prefer. It also had the odd effect of instilling me with some sense of morality - typically a "tank" style of gamer with little regard for the fleeting lives of my computerized opponents, I completed my first playthrough without killing a single guard (with the exception of a walking-camera-droid-thing, and really, does that even count?), and actually frowned at the unlocked character I received afterwards, Shalem 11, because his special ability is the use of a sniper rifle. Life changing game. Thoroughly recommended.

I would recommend this one, but not at its current price. Here is why :\n\n\nIt's a good little game, with  a great concept, that relies on a series of X-Com-like tactical missions that help you beat the final one. However, you cannot rush into the missions with heavy weapons and grenades. Here you have to reach the objectives by being stealthy and hacking into the mainframe accesses as fast as you can, because every 5 turns the security level increases.\n\nI've had fun with it, and I liked the initial challenge, but ...\nThe campaign is far too short. I finished the Beginner campaign in less than 6 hours, in 4 attempts. What I liked in X-Com games was that you had to slowly improve your equipment, level up your roster and finally, after several hours, defeat the enemy against all odds. Here I finished the campaign in 2 hours, and some 6 or maybe 7 missions and with only one agent (the other one died in the third mission). I would have preferred a more rewarding game.\n\n\nAlso, each failure gives you experience, that will help you unlock new programs and agents. I've been a bit disappointed by the agents and more so by the programs I've unlocked (I've unlocked 4 agents and 2 programs).\n\nThere are a full set of options you can play with to increase the level difficulty, and the number of missions you can do before finishing the campaign, but now I have finished it, it seems a bit spoiled.\n\n\nSo yeah, I recommend it, but if you can find it at 5€, no more.","May 16, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AUDAN/recommended/243970/","AUDAN","AUDAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AUDAN/","141 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHere's the problem. The game is amazing, but there is a fundamental contradiction. Random generated levels are very good thing when you have the time to traverse and explore them. But when you have brutally limited time for the whole mission and for the K.O. of the enemies (many of which you are forced to attack, because of generated level setup), and on top of that you have a cooldown on your attacks, the whole experience starts to feel like playing a lottery of what level you get generated and hope for a lucky one, because very often you will stuck on a simply unfair setup.\n\nWith such pace-pushing time-constrains we shouldn't be limited with attack cooldowns and what not. We don't have time to make a good approach. We need to act fast, but our actions are harshly limited. I think that The Alarm Level should not rise with time (I literally enter two empty rooms and the Alarm Level is rised). It should rise only with actions (when we are spotted, attack a guard, etc). For example if a guard stands up after a K.O. he should call his supervisors and that will rise the Alarm Level (rise it a lot). Also every hack could rise the Alarm Level. I though about percent chance (of hack rising alarm level), but I don't think chances are a good game-design anyway. So you could go kinda back to the old Alarm System with more points to rise so it could accumulate with more actions. I know the game is closing to release with every day and your design-decisions are more and more permanent, but you shouldn't let your game-development Alarm Level to force you into rushing a room full of media cameras and armed consumers, because this will not be a successful mission.\n\nI have a lot of respect for you at Klei Entertainment. You did a great work with Shank (1 & 2). Don't Starve is not my cup of tea, but its genuinely good game nevertheless. And I absolutely love Mark of the Ninja. So I bought Incognita (before you've renamed it to Invisible, Inc.) right away. It was a pleasure to see how the game shapes and evolve. Now I hope you will address the issue somehow and make the game less chaotic and more reliable.\n\nP.S.\nI gave thumb-down only so Klei could potentially see this when they scan for criticism. Otherwise the game have all my fingers up. I just hope it will be improved even further.","August 27, 2014","false","29.2"," 33 of 66 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","33","66","0","1"

You sit there playing map after map and suddenly it's 3 am. Rewarding tactical challenges and lots of interesting stuff to play around with like different agents, equipment and hacking programs.\n\nThe campaign story is relatively short (1 play through ~6-8 hours), but well done and it fits into the game world seamlessly.

Its challenging, tense, and always encourages players to think outside the box and address problems in interesting ways. As normal for the studio, not only do they offer rocksolid mechanics, but also deliver incredibly in sound, music, theme, and mood. While this game is undoubtedly a roguelike (which 9 times out of 10 means a light story), the characters' banter and the overall vibe of the game really makes me wish there was more there.\n\nFor the player that aren't fans of the tense gameplay, the options are versatile enough to allow lots of tweaks to suit your playstyle. For example, many negative reviews highlight that you aren't allowed to 'take your time', because every stage grows more dangerous the longer you stay there. However, you can turn off the creeping alarm completely so you can take your time. You can also make disabling guards last longer, allow yourself to find more money, or even decrease the number of guards per stage. Inversely, you can go full on masochist Iron Man, and remove the option to rewind turns, the ability to abort missions, and enforce a real time Time Attack that ends the turn if you take too long making decisions.\n\nTo be honest, I was hesitant when I first read up on the game some years ago. I never thought turned-based and stealth could work together, but Klei married them together beautifully. As a design junkie, it was a joy to follow this game through early access, seeing how tiny changes completely shifts the gameplay with each update. As mentioned, the story does suffer, and comes to a VERY abrupt end (perhaps a higher difficulty allows you to go further? I don't know). However, if Don't Starve is anything to go by, we'll see more content before long, and I honestly can't wait.","May 18, 2015","true","34.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I would recommend this one, but not at its current price. Here is why :\n\n\nIt's a good little game, with  a great concept, that relies on a series of X-Com-like tactical missions that help you beat the final one. However, you cannot rush into the missions with heavy weapons and grenades. Here you have to reach the objectives by being stealthy and hacking into the mainframe accesses as fast as you can, because every 5 turns the security level increases.\n\nI've had fun with it, and I liked the initial challenge, but ...\nThe campaign is far too short. I finished the Beginner campaign in less than 6 hours, in 4 attempts. What I liked in X-Com games was that you had to slowly improve your equipment, level up your roster and finally, after several hours, defeat the enemy against all odds. Here I finished the campaign in 2 hours, and some 6 or maybe 7 missions and with only one agent (the other one died in the third mission). I would have preferred a more rewarding game.\n\n\nAlso, each failure gives you experience, that will help you unlock new programs and agents. I've been a bit disappointed by the agents and more so by the programs I've unlocked (I've unlocked 4 agents and 2 programs).\n\nThere are a full set of options you can play with to increase the level difficulty, and the number of missions you can do before finishing the campaign, but now I have finished it, it seems a bit spoiled.\n\n\nSo yeah, I recommend it, but if you can find it at 5€, no more.","May 16, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Having different characters on your team each with strengths and weaknesses influences tactical play. Voice acting for main characters is very good.\n\nOverall, the premise of the story is good. It sets the scene well and the gameplay makes sense within the game world. The Storyline was ok/good but not it's strong suit - and I'm a sucker for a good story. I will return to play on higher difficulties. An addictive challenge.

Why do I say that? Because the way your "pieces" behave makes no sense within the game's theme, which is "tactical espionage." Your pieces are supposedly spies, and carry tazers. Fine so far, except that none of them have the faintest idea how to throw a judo chop or put a shirt-and-trousers rent-a-cop in a sleeper hold. The absence of guns, and the hugely expensive ammo when you actually do happen to get guns is explained in the in-game lore in a satisfactory way. What isn't explained, however, is the way in which these elite spies you're meant to guide through levels are incapable of satisfactorily incapacitating threats. Taze a guard? Okay. Then leave him on the ground, gun and all. No, they don't have zip ties or knives in the future, and your elite spies don't know how to snap a neck. By the end of missions, you're invariably stuck on tiny maps with convoluted layouts and 10+ guards running around hunting for you as the "level entropy" rapidly increases, some of them the same rent-a-cops you've been forced to taze 2-3 times by that point. And then all your agents get killed by those same rent-a-cops you've tazed multiple times, and that any elite spy with a functioning brain would've either killed or tied up, gagged, and stashed under a desk or in an air vent.\n\nEdit: I'll add another thing: the room layouts. I get that it's procedurally generated, but, unfortunately, not in any way that makes thematic sense. These are meant to be corporate offices, yet judging by the way these rooms are laid out, only schizophrenics are allowed to be architects or interior designers in the future. It's nothing but a mad jumble of squares populated randomly by furniture or game objectives. This would make sense if we were crawling through Undermountain looking for orcs, but corporations today, and probably 60 years from now, when the game takes place, are not going to be hiring Halaster the Mad for their interior designer.\n\nThis total disconnect from even the remotest semblance of verisimilitude might be understandable in a new developer, but Klei is hardly new to making stealth games. Mark of The Ninja, in fact, is one of my favourite games. It boggles the mind that the same people who made that gem are responsible for this near-perfect train wreck, but train wreck none the less. It's torture seeing a game so close to perfection and greatness get turned into unplayable garbage by something so small, and something that could've been caught had the developers taken a more objective look at their own game as it grew instead of adapting to dysfunctional systems and growing unconscious of the blind spots created by their own habits.\n\nSadly, this is another title that leads me to believe that Klei, in spite of coming up with quite a few excellent ideas, is a one hit wonder when it comes to coherent and harmonious implementation of holistic game systems. Don't Starve has a crippling flaw that renders it unplayable due to its terrible inventory system, and Incognita similarly has a crippling flaw in the way it emphasizes arbitrary puzzle nonsense over even remotely realistically represented stealth, espionage, tactics, and all that good stuff.\n\nEdit2: And a moderator banned me from the Invisible Inc forums and locked my thread discussing these topics. I guess that's how Klei deals with criticism of their perfect award-winning games. Hope you're comfortable in your echo chamber, fellas.","August 11, 2015","false","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Why? Because I've read those positive reviews before making the purchase too and I'm very disappointed.\n\nInvisible, Inc. mixes oldschool stealth mechanics with innovative ideas. You move around sticking to the areas out of sight of the Corporations' security agents and robots and your goal is to hack or hijack as many of their installations as possible. There are multiple kinds of hackable objects and each of them gives you different rewards - from simple credits, through cutting off the power to electric blockades, to giving you access to bionic labs and shops of different sorts. It's during the missions that you will both earn and spend most of your credits. You can also use your cash to upgrade your spies' abilities and occasionaly buy something from Monst3r's black market. Hackable close-circuit cameras will help you uncover what are the badguys planning against you and what patrol routes are they on.\n\nAlthough the basic security will not give you much trouble, the elite patrolmen later on will really make you think twice before you decide to open fire or attack them with your power winches. They come equipped with a lot of gadgets that allow them to quickly track and take you down. Same goes for the robots that you're going to face. They are all hackable, but you won't be able to operate them for more that a couple of turns.\n\nWhile the easier difficulty levels allow you to experiment with different strategies (you can invest your money and bio-enhence your spies in 'heavy approach', stealth, more effective hacking and so on), the harder ones will leave you no choice but to go for speed and invisibility - the only way to beat the hardest levels. SInce the game is based upon replayablility (on this later on), it is a bad ballancing decision and probably a design flaw too.\n\nOne of the mechanics that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is the need to open doors to peak into the corners of the rooms behind. Now, why on earth bionically enhenced futuristic spies are not equipped to deal with this issue is beyond me. Even modern portable optical-fibre cameras could do that. Invisible, Inc. spies can feel the virus programs and see electrical circuits through walls, yet they must open the door to see what is in the corner of the room behind them. I wouldn't even mind, if this mechanic would not be a gamebraker on the highest difficulty levels, where you cannot see danger zones if you don't see their sources. Often times you will start the level only to find yourself in an impossible situation and lose right away. And remember there is permadeath in this game. That is the price we pay for procedurally generated world + this one bizzare mechanic.\n\nThe levels are generated rather nicely and once you lived through the first couple of turns, you'll most probably never find yourself in an impossible situation. There is always enough cover for the team and various objectives are usually guarded by the Corporations' security in a sensible way. Definitely extra points for that.\n\nThe hacking UI itself is very clean and done with a lot of thought. It's fun to fight the enemy firewalls and it adds to the general feeling of the game - this aura of people being totally dependent on computer programs.\n\nIt all does sound rather well, doesn't it? Well... here comes the reason why I cannot recommend the game. It's too expensive for what it has to offer. The main storyline takes 3-4 hours to finish and then the player is rewarded with new hacking programs and unlockable spies. Sounds great? Someone has already mentioned that the Invisible, Inc. is a mix of FTL with X-COM. The problem is, that FTL was fun every replayed time and X-COM had a nicely driven story line that kept player occupied and interested in upgrading the team. Invisible, Inc. is somewhere in between, with nice, but very short story and a couple of good mechanics, and replayability-based gameplay that isn't really all that fun to try again.\n\nAfter beating the game in different game modes and difficulty levels I found that 90% of unlockable stuff is useless and does not help you getting better scores. Finally I dropped the game entirely after maybe 7-8 hours of gameplay simply, because it was no longer fun to play it. During that time, I used found only one unlocked program and one unlocked character to be of any use for the team. The rest was just... bad.\n\nI see a lot of potential in this game, but cannot recommend it for more that $5 on a sale. It's not worth the price its tagged with. If only the devs would have taken more time to create a longer story mode and ballanced the game to allow for different playstyles it could have been fantastic. Unfortunately, in its current stage (and it is not an early access title) this game offers somewhat frustrating gameplay experience, inconsistent universum and not a very entertaing replay-grinding. It's not enough for me to recommend it.\n\nI hope you found this review informative enough.

When I first saw this game, I was pretty impressed by the art style and the idea of a cyberpunk future where you infiltrate places for...stuff (though I'd argue teleporting is more sci-fi based). The more I played, the more I became bored. While its all randomly generated, it all felt very samey to me. The only times it felt different was at the very end, on the last level. The voice acting was more akin to reading straight from a script, the wide array of characters mean nothing when only 3 or 4 of them are useful for anything. It just feels like this game was more of an artistic representation over the gameplay. The times the game becomes interesting is when the game becomes overwhelming with 6 guards buzzing all around you like rabid dogs. Oh, and a lot fo this game is RNG. Guard paths, level rewards, all of it is RNG, which means you can be legit boned by the RNG. While its a 'rogue-like', it...isn't engaging like one. I could never finish the last level due to the overwhelming amount of heresy the game continued to throw at me, forcing either a level restart or game over.\n\nOverall, I'd give this a pass. Artistically, its phenomenal. Gameplay-wise, it plays like potato in your hands: makes a mess and hungry for food.","August 16, 2015","false","10.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Beginning each adventure with only two operatives you have everything to lose, even in the very fist mission. It can take a while finding a play style that works.\nHowever, despite all this, it is very satisfying when you begin to get good at it. Slipping passed guards, cracking safes, and generally having a plan go off without failure feels great. The more things you attempt to pull off, the more can go wrong and Invisible, Inc. challenges you to get better as it ramps up the difficulty considerably as the game continues. This may be my only gripe. As each level is randomly generated to a point, sometimes there can be purely trap rooms between you and your goal (sometimes even straight out of the door) and it makes it impossible to win. You could have planned levels in advance, but other than that, it's impossible to foretell. I think this may have been a mistake on the end of the random generations and may be fixed by the developer, but it's hard to tell sometimes.\n\nKlei Entertainment is a good company and they do listens to what their fans want. They've made a well polished, great looking and sounding game. Invisible, Inc. is both worth putting time into playing, and also watching out for in the future, as each update until release seems to change the gameplay in small but refreshing ways.

It's a challenging game; even on easy it can be unforgiving. All too often I find my agents essentially too far afield and unable to navigate the room maze back to the elevator. The challenge is what makes this game the most rewarding for me.

It used to be a kind of turnbased rpg where the goal was more or less "complete goal X then leave the building" but now it is more of a roguelike, but it has an amazing twist on the genre.  Since you play as a spy, and most teams don't even start with weapons, you have to us stealth, hacking, and lock-picking to make it through the hostile buildings you find yourself in.  This might sound boring, sneak in and out while gathering anything you can, but it leads to some absurdly tense moments.  One such moment for myself was when I had been spotted and knocked out one guard while I had another one already knocked out but I couldn't just leave them knocked out because they would wake up 2 turns from one another blowing my cover completely so I waited maybe 20 minutes trying to make a plan to escape, I failed.  Two agents permanently gone.  It's a wonderful game and I recommend it to roguelike fans, stealth fans, and tactics fans.","August 20, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Back then, it was intense, even if it was barely playable. There was more action (Deckard started with a silenced gun since the beginning of every stage, for example), and the atmosphere was more "James-Bondish".\nThings changed, it seems. PG direction is no more choosable, and those darn elevators now have a cooldown. Weapons are rare, and all the "grid thing" was simplyfied. But do not take this as a complain: Invisible Inc. is still an incredible game, where truly, every action matters, even the simpliest one, like closing a door or hacking stuff in a particular order. The IA still needs some work, in my opinion, since it prefers to privilege quantity over quality, when depolying threats for your party.\nTl, dr: it started as a great game.

I loved every minute of it!\n\nI bought this game yesterday at the end of the weekend sale, not too sure if I deemed it worth 12 bucks, but after finishing the campaign on the easiest difficulty in 6 hours (almost in 1 sitting). I'm sure this game is going to played and enjoyed more than you usually get for this kind of price. I tend to divide the price by playtime, to see if a game is worth it's money. GTA V kept me busy for 90 hours at 60 euro, so 0.66 euro per hour. Witcher 3 kept me, so far, occupied for 110 hours for 25 euro, so less than 25 cents per hour. This game will definitely clock in 12+ hours and thus reaching the value of 1 buck per hour - a steal!\n\nThese days a lot of games are more about graphics than gameplay. This game, though the artstyle is amazing, is definitely more about gameplay. It's basically a turn-based puzzle, where the pieces get mixed after every turn. Progression feels really good and it's almost sad to start over, but the increased difficulty and the unlockables between playthroughs (another level of progression) make it worth it anyway. The random generated levels make playing through the campaign 3 times still a lot of fun.\n\nThere are a few different missions, which mostly means you get a different rewards for reaching your objective, but apart from that they're all pretty much the same. The beauty in this lies in the random level design. You might get dropped in an impossible situation, where you actually have to trigger an extra alarm, just to continue, because the deactivation station lies out of reach. You will definitely have to use all of your wit combined with your spy gadgets, to finish a level - especially because some of the mechanics are very unforgiving and this gets worse as difficulty increases (a simple misclick can result in the death of an agent).\n\nThe story is okay, the artstyle is brilliant and the gameplay takes this game home.\nThe developers seem to have a love for bringing really cool games and giving you value for your money, so if you're even slightly interested in this title, definitely pick it up!\n\nToo long, did not read?\nPros:\n- Gameplay!\n- Unique artstyle\n- Very good replay value\n- Workshop/mod support\n- Support indie-titles!\n- Still receives updates and bugfixes\n\nCons:\n- Short campaign\n- No multiplayer support\n- Unable to undo a misclick","August 11, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In a way, this is a good thing as it adds the very necessary tension that makes the game worth playing. However, later in the game ("Endless" mode) you encounter levels that require a special keycard to exit the level, which is supposed to be hidden in a safe. I quadruple-checked that I had explored every last inch of the map and double-check every safe, even (with the help of rewinds) checked every original guard. There WAS NO EXIT KEYCARD and my entire campaign was ruined. Shame of them for allowing this to happen.","October 1, 2015","false","57.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

All seems good.\n\nSo you beat the game and then sink another 6 hrs in to experienced mode.  Two problems, one, the disconnect from coming from super powered agents way back to basic agents on a harder difficulty setting is jarring, you make too many mistakes.\n\nSecond is just how hard this is with out level resets, and the difficulty seems to have been adjusted too much, what is a 2nd or 3rd mission is very hard with out the correct hack tool, which you know from beginner you get later... It's not vastly different from beginner, but the combination of disabling level restarts - so you have to start the entire campaign again - and the addition of trying new characters out is too much. Then also the difficult shield level is way out, you don't have the hack tools needed. This can be fixed by enabling level restarts - but then you're not playing experienced you're playing custom, no awards for that.\n\nOn first play through most people I assume would be doing stealth and avoiding kills, the default characters are this way. You happen to get a couple of characters later which are geared around killing which would be best for a second play through - I just don't see myself playing through beginner again though to get use to it.\n\nAlso on experienced, even when you ARE experienced, the shield difficulty indicators, the things which tell you how hard something is going to be, were way out. 2nd or 3rd mission in a 2 or 3 level became impossible because I didn't have the right hacking tool (area effect hack), but having played beginner I know that that tool wouldn't be got so early.\n\n(I think I got up to turn 37-45 in one map, dragging a body along a map which was basically one long corridor while 8 guards swamped around, a lot of micro. Obviously it wasn't meant to get like that and should rewind before, but it was fun enough to do.)\n\nThis may be a problem of expectation. Because some in beginner which are marked as "do not advice infiltrating" level 5-6 aren't that hard, yet on experienced a level 2-3, what should have been easy, wasn't. I'm wondering if it would have been better to have started the game on experienced, just so the expectation was set, but even so. Or to have my suped up agents from beginner carry over, just so I could tell if it's the agents or the game.\n\nIt can sometimes degenerate into a game of drag the body and sit on it, but there are other tools available (like an 8 turn ko syringe)and I'm sure I've not seen even half of them really, it will take a few more play throughs.","April 26","true","32.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do believe that it is a good game, but I feel that what keeps it from being a great game is a palatable lack of balance and direction.\n\nThe regular campaigns are brief enough so that any single session does not overstay its welcome, and that is intelligent design. However, a consequence of deriving inspiration from a roguelike is that not every playthrough is fun. Even when I win, it’s because I am scraping by with skill, although I would prefer to experiment with cool gadgets. Endless mode is a solution to the abbreviated campaign, increasing the likelihood of maxing out four agents to a certainty as long as the player is talented enough to not lose. At times, I feel that endless mode the best, “unintentionally intended” way to play Invisible, Inc., but then again, as of this writing, I am on day 11 of endless and my agents seem invincible even at alarm level 6 (based shock trap III). I feel challenged, but I don’t fear losing. Then again, I routinely play games involving heavy strategy.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Invisible, Inc. to gamers looking for some strategy in their lives, but are disinterested in a game with a skill ceiling as high as the nosebleed section.\n\nFull Review: http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/pc/review-invisible-inc/","October 18, 2015","true","45.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What i like most about this game is the amount of options you have to tailor the game to your liking and to make it as challenging as you want. It's also a change from most of the turn based games as it's about stealth and avoiding trouble . It also has a really good risk/reward system that tempts you into trying a bit more than you can handle to get some more loot.\n\nThough an individual campaign might not be that long there is a lot of replayability through having a good selection of stuff to unlock that can change how you play and adds variety . The game is definetly designed to be played multiple times.\n\nI like games that make me think each turn what should i be doing and how to do it and also have the tension of knowing it could all go horribly wrong if you make a mistake. It can be a challenge and you can tweak it to make it as hard or easy as you like.\n\nDefinetly worth buying if you think you might enjoy it , it does what it says on the tin.\n","April 18","true","19.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
