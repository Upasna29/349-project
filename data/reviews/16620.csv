She likes to play it because she can finish quite a few levels by pressing down 1 button... the 'forward' button. Ok, ok, you need to use 3 more buttons and a lot more skill if you want to win a gold medal on each course but she isn't interested in gold medals. She's happy if she can drive the car to the finish line... which she can by pressing that one button.","December 27, 2011","true","7.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","18","19","10","0"

I loved this game and how fun it was to play. The monster trucks were awesome to play once you put in the cheat code to unlock them. I loved each level because they were all different and creative. There were times that you would fail and not understand why you failed so badly but just plain persistence and patients pays off when you beat the course record and get gold. If you want codes to help you out here are the best one's:\nGo to the Settings menu and enter the codes into the Unlock extra features box.\n\nDEVHOSENAUTO: Unlock Formula Monster Truck\nPIGGYRIDE: Unlock Pig Monster Truck\nYELLOWMONSTER: Unlock School Bus\nDEVIWANTALLGOLDNOW: All Levels GOLD\nDEVIWANTITALLNOW: Unlock all levels\n\nI loved this game and all it had to offer, just make sure to find this one on sale because then you will get your money out of it. I have totally loved playing this game and if you liked the game Trials 2: Second Edition then you will love this one!","March 27, 2012","true","2.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I thought... this is cool.  Turned it off and never turned it back on.\n\nYou are just jumping but you do not actually control the trucks, you just do the set up and gas, but no turning.  So no reason to play more than 20 minutes of fun in my opinion.","March 31, 2012","false","0.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
