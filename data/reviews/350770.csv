"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AllisonKnight/recommended/350770/","AllisonKnight","Hello Allison!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AllisonKnight/","1740 products in account","I really hate to say "No" on this one, because I like these devs otherwise and I like Giana, and I like this game. But it wasn't anywhere near ready for release.\n\nAt its core, it's a pretty basic platformer, with its similarities to Mario still very present in this incarnation (they'd be pretty much gone by Twisted Dreams, but they're still in full force here). It has a lot of levels, it has some really nice music. The lack of a sprint/run button is a bit of a shame, but it doesn't break the game. A bit worse is a real lack of level variety, with very little to make areas stand out.\n\nThe problem is that the game is busted in weird, weird ways. There's a few little things that are weird, but harmless (achievements not popping until the game closes, the score counter starting at 12 million points for whatever reason, stage numbering on the loading screen is weird) and a few things that are annoying but not dealbreakers (menu controls could be more responsive, some achievements don't work), but the big issue is level progression is very weird, in ways that I've never seen before.\n\nPut like this: When I played 1-1 for the first time, it crashed at the end. Reloading it and playing 1-1 again, it loaded a wholly different level...and then loaded it AGAIN for 1-2, and beating it again took me to 1-3. I quit to the map, reloaded 1-1, and got the first level again...and then clearing it again and going back to the map revealed that my progress hadn't been saved and I had to redo 1-2. This happened again with 1-8 and 1-9, 2-1 and 2-2, and 2-9 was a level from a later world altogether until I relaunched the game entirely and got the actual level with the boss. For all I know, I've missed a few levels and not realized it, due to the game's loading the wrong ones.\n\nIf they fixed that, the other stuff'd be easy enough to overlook, but as it is I can't say this is ready to be bought or sold. I'll happily redo this entire little writeup the moment it no longer applies.","November 6, 2015","false","3.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I actually don't mind that this is much more simple and significantly easier than Twisted Dreams, superior of a game as it might be. The music is lovely as always and the sprites for Giana are fabulously detailed and animate.\n\nWhat I do mind, however, are levels loading out of order if not two-to-three times in a row, sometimes brick walling progression in the progress. Poor background tiling and biased hit detection don't exactly make the experience any better, either.\n\nA shame; this could have been a solid port of the DS title, but a complete lack of polish from outsourced development cripples that potential entirely.","December 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Those of you who thought Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams/Rise of the Owlverlord had levels much longer than they needed, this game is for you.\n\nBad news! It's a very poor phone port that doesn't do resolution correctly, has a bunch of collision issues, and is actually sort of ugly.\n\nIt's competent but it's nowhere near as creative as the newer GS titles, this is straight up a throwback to the Commodore era Mario-clone, and includes 32 "retro" levels alongside the main game. (I admit it has been a long time since I booted a C64 to know if they're the original game's stages or just facsimiles.) It's full of content, but the whole package is sloppy. In the end, despite my love of the series, I can't bring myself to finish it, it's going to be my new textbook definition of "soulless".","November 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Losaru/recommended/350770/","Losaru","Losaru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Losaru/","43 products in account","A Simplified Giana Sisters: Great for Newcomers, Little Challenge for Veterans\n\nI was extremely happy to this game added to Steam since I have never been able to get my hands on a DS copy (Someday my pretty). So much so that I sent a copy to my sister. We both played the original Giana Sisters on Commodore 64 back in the day. It was essentially our Mario.\n\nThat is probably one of the flaws I find with the game: It's very easy for seasoned players. I think it is mainly because the power-ups have been scaled back from the original and boss enemies have been removed, at least from the 'Retro' levels. I don't know how far I have to go to find a boss in the newer levels, but thus far, there are none and I haven't gotten a game over yet on these newer levels.\n\nThat is not to say I don't recommend it. Far from. This is a great little platformer for one's collection and the price on sale is not bad at all at the time of writing this. The graphics are crisp and bright, controls work well, although the camera can be jerky at times, and you can customize the controls to your liking.\n\nBlack Forest Studios also got one thing spot on: Music. Giana Sisters was very famous for its chiptune music and the remixes are a delight to the ears, even for someone that generally has music turned down when playing.\n\nAnd, although simplified, I am very happy for the addition of the retro levels as it brings back a bit of nostalgia.\n\nTo those that have maybe played Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams, this is not that game, nor a sequel but a port of the DS version that many of us older Giana Sisters fans not in Europe either wished they had or had to import.\n\nIf you want a simple, cute platformer with awesome music, check this out. For veteran players such as myself, it is your call. For you, it may be more of a Giana Sisters Lite.","October 25, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The collision detection might be slightly buggy.\n- When playing retro mode, the game would show the level number as I started each level. And I apparently I played level 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 8-10, and 1. In that order. That doesn't sound quite right.\n- There's one level where I'd die instantly as the level loaded, and that repeated until I had one life left. That was a bit awkward.\n- There's various graphical artifacts when playing at 2560x1440. I didn't try lower resolutions so maybe they're fine.\n- When getting hit, the character will start fading in and out for a few seconds. Makes it a bit tricky to actually see your character and line up jumps.\n\nSo yeah, the game's a bit buggy. I think I'd recommend the DS version over this port. But I'm still gonna give this a thumbs up as the music's great, and this is a pretty cheap price for pretty awesome music.\n\nI'm still slightly baffled about the amount of points you start with. This is definitely the only game where I was pretty high up on the leaderboards without even having played the game yet. Maybe I'm just that good.","October 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","31","37","15","0"

The Mario Brothers have NOTHING to fear from this series. Giana Sisters 2D is my first venture into this beloved cult classic and I'm prepared to take the slings and arrows from the people who view this as some kind of sacred cow. WELL I believe NOTHING is sacred and EVERYTHING is up for ridicule and critique.\n\nI had no expectations coming in. It looked like a cute platformer, and I love me some platformers. Some of my all time favorites are Super Mario Bros 3, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Donkey Country 2 and Banjo & Kazooie. With that said, I found this to at first be alright, but the further I got along, the more the issues started to present themselves. All of them technical. And because of those technical difficulties it gives the game a bad case of fake difficulty[tvtropes.org]. These things being...\n\n- Wonky placement of ceilings when jumps are concerned (these don't allow for wiggle room. Either get it right or die).\n\n- Diamonds a plenty to try to hide these issues. You could get past all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t level design from world 3 forward if you just grind enough lives in earlier levels to give you a buffer and just keep tossing yourself at the levels until you win. Which makes you wonder why they couldn't just fix the erratic placement of BS blocks above you in tight spaces where there it a bottomless pit.\n\n- Movement is wonky in segments. For example, if you try to move while the game is just starting, you remain in place until you let up.\n\n- Hitboxes are wonky too on certain enemies. You will have PLENTY of times where you should be safe from an enemy and get hit anyway.\n\nOverall, the tech issues (ESPECIALLY the ceiling issues) spoil what should be an otherwise middle-of-the-road, but still enjoyable platformer for me. If the above doesn't bother you, then get it while on sale. Don't recommend for full price unless you're one of the Giana faithful.

But it wasn't anywhere near ready for release.\n\nAt its core, it's a pretty basic platformer, with its similarities to Mario still very present in this incarnation (they'd be pretty much gone by Twisted Dreams, but they're still in full force here). It has a lot of levels, it has some really nice music. The lack of a sprint/run button is a bit of a shame, but it doesn't break the game. A bit worse is a real lack of level variety, with very little to make areas stand out.\n\nThe problem is that the game is busted in weird, weird ways. There's a few little things that are weird, but harmless (achievements not popping until the game closes, the score counter starting at 12 million points for whatever reason, stage numbering on the loading screen is weird) and a few things that are annoying but not dealbreakers (menu controls could be more responsive, some achievements don't work), but the big issue is level progression is very weird, in ways that I've never seen before.\n\nPut like this: When I played 1-1 for the first time, it crashed at the end. Reloading it and playing 1-1 again, it loaded a wholly different level...and then loaded it AGAIN for 1-2, and beating it again took me to 1-3. I quit to the map, reloaded 1-1, and got the first level again...and then clearing it again and going back to the map revealed that my progress hadn't been saved and I had to redo 1-2. This happened again with 1-8 and 1-9, 2-1 and 2-2, and 2-9 was a level from a later world altogether until I relaunched the game entirely and got the actual level with the boss. For all I know, I've missed a few levels and not realized it, due to the game's loading the wrong ones.\n\nIf they fixed that, the other stuff'd be easy enough to overlook, but as it is I can't say this is ready to be bought or sold. I'll happily redo this entire little writeup the moment it no longer applies.","November 6, 2015","false","3.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I actually don't mind that this is much more simple and significantly easier than Twisted Dreams, superior of a game as it might be. The music is lovely as always and the sprites for Giana are fabulously detailed and animate.\n\nWhat I do mind, however, are levels loading out of order if not two-to-three times in a row, sometimes brick walling progression in the progress. Poor background tiling and biased hit detection don't exactly make the experience any better, either.\n\nA shame; this could have been a solid port of the DS title, but a complete lack of polish from outsourced development cripples that potential entirely.","December 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

At least it will be because of yourself and not because of a badly implemented and designed game port.","January 27","false","10.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Those of you who thought Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams/Rise of the Owlverlord had levels much longer than they needed, this game is for you.\n\nBad news! It's a very poor phone port that doesn't do resolution correctly, has a bunch of collision issues, and is actually sort of ugly.\n\nIt's competent but it's nowhere near as creative as the newer GS titles, this is straight up a throwback to the Commodore era Mario-clone, and includes 32 "retro" levels alongside the main game. (I admit it has been a long time since I booted a C64 to know if they're the original game's stages or just facsimiles.) It's full of content, but the whole package is sloppy. In the end, despite my love of the series, I can't bring myself to finish it, it's going to be my new textbook definition of "soulless".","November 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
