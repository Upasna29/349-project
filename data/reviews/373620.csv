You just might be the hero that the world needs. So hop in that conveniently-nearby protoype mech, stuff your face with cake, and get ready to make some magic. Explosionade is what I like to call a "thinking person's shooter". Yes you control a sweet mech that's loaded with fun toys, but that's just the beginning. In order to master this game you have to understand your movement, your weaponry, and most of all, your enemy. Only then can you quench your thirst for explosive goodness.\n\nA "thinking person's shooter" is probably not the most appealing description for a game. It sounds so technical and boring that I get tired just thinking about it, but that's how the cookie crumbles. Your adversaries choose cowardice over suicide, and they will retreat to more favorable positions at every opportunity. They also don't have any problem with clogging your passage with bullets and grenades. If you want to get the most out of this game, you have to adapt. Your gun can fire in any direction, but there are walls everywhere. Your grenades can break through some of them, but you can only fire three at once. Also, while your mech is capable of jumping and hovering, its walking speed is pretty slow.\n\nThis is where you begin to appreciate your shield. While it can be used entirely for hunkering down and deflecting enemy bullets, it's most effective when your mech is in motion. While the shield is up, you can bounce off of walls. Through the usage of momentum, finding the right angle, and a grasp of physics, you can become an unstoppable force. Mowing down a handful of aliens with your machine-gun could take 10-15 seconds, or you could barrel through everything in a quarter of the time. The shield isn't always the solution, but it's your most effective tool for when everything seems hopeless.\n\nExplosionade really comes into its own, when you get over the initial hurdles. You'll find yourself rocketing through stages, leaving no mutant alive or pile of gold un-looted. This makes the learning curve rewarding. If this was just another blastemup, there wouldn't be walls and the enemy wouldn't have anything approaching AI. There is an unexpected level of thoughtfulness that goes into each stage. You can't approach every situation in the same manner, but at the same time you're not wasting several minutes debating the pros and cons of your approach. This is a very short game, with play-throughs taking thirty minutes. Just think of it as more time to hone your ability and increase your scoring potential. Along with multiple difficulties, there are also different speed settings. If you're having trouble grasping the ins & outs, you can slow everything down. If you're looking for a real challenge, then crank everything to the max. At double speed, this game can move extremely quickly, and deaths become more common. Oh, and if you're looking for something completely different, try getting the "no-kill" bonus in each stage.\n\nWhile it would be easy for me to write "HOLY SMOKES THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME!" and make a bunch of dumb jokes, the fact remains that Explosionade is cut from a different cloth. Underneath the ridiculous plot, the 80s references, and a heaping helping of kaboom, this an action-puzzle-platformer-shooter. An odd concept like this is usually a recipe for disaster. Thankfully, through solid controls, accurate mechanics, and strong game-design, Mommy's Best Games is able to deliver on their unique vision.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 11, 2015","true","2.8"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","2"

The controls felt really tight (played on Xbox 360 Controller) and I really liked it, considering more possible ways to deal with enemies - aggressive grenade rushes or defensive tactics with shield.\n\nWhat surprised me is the fact that the game shows you all gameplay mechanics and enemies (except bosses) in first levels. You can't expect anything more, just the levels are getting harder but the enemies and your skills remains the same. But that fits the length of the game - it's pretty short and, depending on your playstyle, you can beat it in less than an hour.\n\nThere's three difficulty options, 40 levels (challenge rooms) and three bosses, which aren't any particularly unique by their behavior (they'll float, spam missiles and shoot). The game actually has a silly story, but it felt really bad and cheesy and I even haven't found a gag I would liked.\n\nEven when the visual style is nice, if you're into crazyness, the whole presentation is ruined with the resolution scaling - graphics are made for really low resolution and if you are going to play it on fullscreen, prepare for seeing something really ugly.\n\nAs the game has a co-op option, with the whole style, I think it would deserve a recommendation for a stoned couple, they would have a lot of fun for sure. Otherwise I don't share the excitement from the game with others and it felt more like weird indie experiment that I rather would not recommend to somebody who want to enjoy some platformer.\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of Explosionade was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 30","false","4.6"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroalarm/recommended/373620/","retroalarm","Alarm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroalarm/","2513 products in account","Explosionade is a throwback to mech-centric platform/action games of old.  With tight controls and rewarding gameplay, this is a short but fun experience and one you are likely to want to replay several times, especially with a friend.\n\nIf you choose to, you can get through most levels in seconds by not killing everything and collecting all the gold.  You miss out on all the score bonuses (but can get a time bonus) and – by not getting the gold – you miss out on repairing any damage to the mech.\n\nOn the default setting, it took me around an hour to complete, but I had continued a few times.  As I got into further the game, the mechanics of the game became apparent and the controls are tight and responsive – one highlight is the use of the shield to bounce higher – a clever mechanic that you do not need to complete the game, but is satisfying to use.  The ‘sticky’ grenades are another highlight and you can aim them through small openings to damage the enemy.  The controls are well designed and are fully configurable.\n\nThere are leaderboards for all the difficulty settings, and this game is best approached with that in mind.  It is easy to get through all the levels and the bosses are not difficult, but to get as far as you can without continuing is where the game shines and has that ‘just one more go’ factor.  This is a game you can return to when you feel like destroying stuff.  It has local co-op too, which is bound to increase the fun.\n","September 26, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Others make you think the developers were drinking scorpion venom. Explosionade does both these things.\n\nMommy's Best Games might just be my favorite indie group out there. Anyone else's four-dollar game is, at best, a failed experiment they wanted to ship out the door to recoup on their investment. Mommy's Best Games' games might all be "experiments," but boy-howdy do they WORK. Any indie dev could come forward with "let's stack guns on top of other guns!" or "let's make a vertical shooter where you control like 30 ships!" or (as is the case with Explosionade) "let's make a game about a giant robot with infinite grenades and a rubber laser shield!" But it takes skill to craft those insane ideas into insane games, and Mommy's Best are one of the few with the skill.\n\nIt's not a long game--let's get that out in the open. It's meant to be an 'arcade' style game, where you're meant to first play on the easiest difficulty setting and feel like an invincible god of war, and then you progress to the higher difficulties and really earn that ability to curb-stomp your enemies. And earning that power is what puts this game over from "a fun time" to "LEGEND." You've got a robot with a hover boost that works like a twin stick shooter. Easy enough. And you've got infinite grenades, two types depending on when you let go of the button, one that you can use to bounce down hallways to smear some alien guts against the walls, or you can plant a sticky grenade to blow out some concrete and come crashing down on some mutant mall cop's head. And then you've got a shield which renders you invulnerable to damage as long as it's up, but it overheats quickly, so you need some True Ninja reflexes to time your shot eraser juuuust right and laugh at their puny attempts to take down your glorious golden asskicking robot. You can also use the shield to bounce against floors and walls, which, when mastered, means you can become a Cueball of Electric Death, bouncing around without touching the ground and carpet-bombing weak, ground-bound lesser creatures.\n\nYou've got all those options, and you won't grok what they mean on that first difficulty. But once you've beaten the game once, it all starts to come together, and you're using the game's systems like some sort of Computer Wizard to bend it to your will and send it home crying, and the options they give you mean you're not just "gittin' gud" at the game, you're approaching it with a certain style that'll all your own.\n\nIf you're looking for something relaxing, or if you want a video game that is an "experience" with plot and worldbuilding and an extensive cast of characters, you're going to be disappointed. If, however, you've always dreamed of becoming The Laughing God of Slaughter, playing this game is a lot cheaper than buying scorpion venom.\n\nOh, and check out the developer's other games on Steam. Serious Sam DD XXL may be a real game but is probably just a bad acid trip I had, people love Weapon of Choice and there's a hookah as a weapon sometimes (?), and Shoot 1up is a vertical shmup where your "extra lives" accumulate on the screen alongside you so you have a horde of ships instead of a measly one. The best thing a game can make you say is AM I ACTUALLY DOING THIS and yeah, yeah. YOU SURE ARE.\n\n8.5/10 it's okay","October 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

One fateful night, in a distant corner of home base, you stumble upon a secret prototype combat walker...whatever do you do? Oh, and did I mention there are snack cakes in the glove compartment?\n\nThese and other life-altering questions will be answered by playing Explosionade, in which your job is to, come heck or sewer water, get to the exit in one piece, one screen at a time. Of course, there are boatloads of nasty critters and obstacles between you and the "stage clear" screen, but thankfully your newly-discovered war mech is as armed to the teeth as you'd hope. While smaller ground troops can simply be squished by touching them (a guilty pleasure if there ever was one), you've also got an endless-ammo machine gun, auto-reloading grenades and a regenerating force field to ensure you're ready for anything that crosses your path. The basics aren't tough to figure out, but there are a couple of essential tricks to master: if you activate the shield just before descending from a jump it will "reflect" you higher and allow you to reach most any part of the screen, while grenades will either bounce off of or stick to walls depending on whether you hold the "launch" button as they travel, allowing you to sneak the little buggers into all manner of places with a little practice.\n\nAs you progress from room to room you are granted a small point bonus for finishing quickly, but greater rewards are obtained by taking your time, bombing walls and exploring everywhere you can reach (including those tricky areas the developer has hidden behind foreground elements) and eliminating every last Horrornym in your sights before moving on - of course, you'll want to collect all of the chunks of gold (which refill your health and eventually enhance your grenades, since your mech, naturally, is powered by it) and obligatory pies you can, too. A rather lengthy health meter and frequent pickups combined with the shield makes for fairly easy progress, at least at first, but even the lowliest of your foes can be uncharacteristically aggressive and resourceful once they've spotted you, so death can quickly make a surprise appearance if you let your guard down. Your mount also has an appropriately heavy feel to it, which can become floaty when using the "shield bounce" to get around, both of which take some getting used to, but a bit of combat experience should solve that issue fairly quickly.\n\nOut on the periphery, the game's looks might best be summarized as "endearingly chunky", though the music is easily overpowered by the sounds of detonating grenades and death-screaming cannon fodder. My personal favorite bits are the occasional, exasperated exchanges between your in-over-his-head soldier and his chronically PO'ed commander, though they can be skipped if you prefer. While not everything comes together perfectly here, several improvements have been made since the XBLIG release (a laser sight for easier aiming, better bullet visibility, etc.), and the game still has one of my favorite taglines attached ("When life gives you explosions..."), so it's tough for me not to recommend parting with a few dollars and taking it for a spin.\n\nJust don't mention my name if the commander yells at you.","October 6, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"
