I appreciate the whole retro-aspect and I do dig some of the classic games that are somewhat similar to this (Spy Hunter or Action Fighter for example) - but Organ Biker is a weird mess that fails it's retro-forefathers in every possible way.\n\nA summary of the story or the actual gameplay is hard to do: you collect golden hearts, avoid cars and incoming projectiles and can occasionally throw those hearts into an ambulance for extra points or something. While the first stage seems like there is at least some kind of concept behind it all, subsequent stages are plain weird: I can get hit by missiles and bees, there are "+" appearing next to my bike and I can crash into watertowers, but I cannot crash into bears or trees. And there is no way to destroy incoming helicopters or attack planes that litter the screen with missiles that don't do anything!? I don't get it, at all!? What is going on!?\n\nDespite all this, I somehow managed to finish story mode, because after getting past stage 1 (The Highway) it is next to impossible to die unless you crash into things on purpose. But I think I will just leave the game at that  - all in all a waste of time and money.","July 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","16","22","4","0"

Pretty straight-forward where you try to get to finish line while dodging obstacles before your "hope" (fuel) runs out, so you need to determine to either drive slower so you can dodge easier, or put the pedal to the metal and dodge like crazy to hit the finish line faster.  Later levels essentially turn into one big Bullet Hell dodge-fest where you need to strategically plan to use your special attacks to wipe out the enemies on the screen.  The price point is on the mark, it's nothing above and beyond an NES game of this nature, or a really oldschool 80's arcade would offer, and not something I'd expect people to invest much time into, more of a "pick up and play to waste 10 minutes here and there" sort of game.","June 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stlpaul/recommended/365310/","stlpaul","stlpaul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stlpaul/","2884 products in account","Old-school NES-style game where you dodge obstacles (cars, jets, bullets, bees, bears, etc.) while trying to make it to the finish line. The game has cut-scenes and a story about deliverying organs to hospitals with loads of nostalgia tossed in for good measure. Music and visuals are good. It has a pseudo-CRT effect with scanlines and even a moire effect.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty basic but it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Even the first level is quite hard to get past. It respawns you in the busiest lane of traffic and you just get pummeled by a non-stop flow of speeding cars. There is a period of invincibility for a few seconds after respawn but it doesn't always work, sometimes you just die instantly even though your guy is blinking.\n\nOn the Xbox 360 controller, the d-pad is used to steer (left/right) and control speed (up/down). Given the famously poor d-pad of the Xbox 360 controller, I often find myself accidentally speeding up or down when trying to steer. That's not the game's fault and in my case, with no other controller options, I think it's actually easier to play this game with a keyboard.\n\nOverall it is simple but frustratingly fun. The furthest I've made it is level 3.","June 23, 2015","true","3.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","3"

Not a big problem until you realize that enemies can also drive on that side. So everytime you start to move an enemy will crash into you and the inevitable cycle of starting and stopping repeats itself. This could easily be fixed by letting you have invisibility frames after you start moving instead of keeping you in one place for a second and a half. The other problem is the motorcycle moves way too slow. For a "precision" game, you move a snails pace across the screen. Meanwhile the other cars blaze on by. Might not be a problem but i have had a whole lot of  random factor of 3 trucks catacorned with each other going full speed and you cant dodge that.","June 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","1"

Game play is driving down the road dodging obstacles, collecting hearts/points, & throwing hearts to medivacts until you get the progress bar to the end part. your bike has 7 speeds that will deplete your hope bar slowly or faster if you're not on the road but collecting hearts will give you more "hope". if you get close to the side of a vehicle a + will pop up and if you hit it or other object you'll lose "hope", be set to the right side of the road, & your speed will be dropped to 0. you also lose "hope" if anything hits you. every so often a medivact will show up and a square will be highlighted on the road, and you can throw hearts at it if your in the square but you'll lose some "hope" though if you give it 4-5 it will refill about half your bar when it leaves. you do get1 attack if you collect 4 hearts the word hope will flicker and you can clear the screen of most enemies. everything comes at you at random so you never really know whats going to happen.","September 17, 2015","true","6.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

After an hour of playing I only made it just over halfway through the first level. The tutorial is very vague and mostly leaves it up to the player to discover the mechanics. I loved the old-school graphics and soundtrack. The bits of story I did see were very stylish and fun. The controls were mostly solid, my only frustration coming from the second or two you're forced to wait every time you hit another vehicle.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinmai/recommended/365310/","shinmai","shinmai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinmai/","1625 products in account","Note: I only played Arcade mode, but no story could save this game from it's unintuitive gameplay and weird design quirks.\n\nOrgan Biker is horrible at communicating with the player. It first launches as a teeny tiny 256x240 window, which is the only place where the game outlines the controls, which make no sense to you if you've never played the game.\nOnce in the game, what you do is dodge cars (and later missiles from stealth bombers), collect pick-ups and when an "ambulance plane" comes on screen, you enter the green "launch zone" and shoot hearts at it for points. If you crash, your bike respawns on the right side of the road, and you're invincible for a while.\n\nTo move left or right, you need to have speed, or "MOJO" as the game intuitively calls it. Logically you lose your mojo when you crash, but your input is disabled for a while after you crash, leaving you watching a flickering stationary bike for a while.\nThe game doesn't in any way indicate the input is disabled, so the first time you'll likely not understand what's going on, and crash again, because, natureally, the cars *CAN* drive in the part of the road where you respawn. The next time  you'll be manically hammering UP to get your "mojo" on and be able to get out of the way of danger. Why this happens, I have no idea. It definitely doesn't add anything to the game. According to a recent developer announcement, there should be a six seconds invincibility period, but in effect this is usually wasted on waiting for input to become active again.\n\nYour HP is called HOPE, which you refill by picking up heart pick-ups. You lose HOPE over time, whenever you crash and if you get hit by the stealth bombers missiles.\n\nPicking up four heart pick-ups grants you one use of a screen clearing bomb that, unfortunately works on a delay, so more than once, not wanting to waste it, I tried using it at the last second, but because the actual clearing of the screen happens after the heart animation has played, I still crashed. Trying go gauge the right time to use the bomb is pretty difficult, and later in the game it's almost useless anyway, because of the time it takes to collect four hearts is very long in relation to the amount of hazards you face.\n\nOrgan Biker doesn't have any animations at all just static sprites (well, the bike sprite gets flipped when you "turn", but even then the sprite is almost symmetrical). Some of the "old school" effects just look weird (especially the moiré-effect looks like it's just a static texture).\nThe music is very hit and miss, luckily you can choose it manually so you can just opt to never to listen to the worse tracks.\nUnless you disable the arcade-effects, some of the text is pretty hard to read, because your combo and score are not displayed in the same pixel font as the rest of the UI, but instead in a standard serif font, that the arcade effect makes pretty unreadable.\n\nThe game doesn't have a pause function, and no apparent way to quit mid game, appart from just closing the program with Alt+F4.\n\nBottom line is Organ Biker just isn't fun, the controls are iffy and some of the design choices are just arbitary and weird. Apparently the game is still beign worked on, which gives hope, but at this point, I definitely do not recommend buying it. If there are any updates to the game, I'll make sure to update my review.","June 22, 2015","false","2.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","1"

I still can't figure out what's going on most of the time. Playing this game well seems to depend upon a combination of moving left and right and accelerating and decelerating at the right times in order to manuever around the various hazards. But Organ Biker is designed so sloppily, is so glitchy, and there's such an absurd amount of obstacles to dodge that I actually don't think it's possible to play it well. Instead, I think the developer just understood that what they were asking the player to suffer through was impossible, so they just made the entire thing really forgiving. This retro-inspired overlay isn't doing the game any favors either, make that ♥♥♥♥ optional.
