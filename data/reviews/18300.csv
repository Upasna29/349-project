After restarting the level, all the doors locked themselves for no good reason, forcing me to restart yet again.\n\nThings only went downhill from there. The level design itself was boring, unimaginitive, and generally extremely easy, consisting of platforms made of dated textures suspended in vast amounts of empty space. Almost every level ended in the exact same way (one giant jump ramp to the finish). Most of the challenge came through the glitchy air physics and camera. I frequently lost my jumping ability for no good reason. Even if you do manage to get past it all, there's surpisingly little content for a game with the subtitle "Extended Edition". I finished the game start to finish in about an hour and a half (and then threw it on while I slept a year later when trading cards came out).\n\nIn the end, this both looks and feels like a tech demo from the late 90's than a proper game. It seems to be trying to be another Marble Blast or Super Monkey Ball, but it falls short in almost every imaginable way. Just roll right on past this old clunker.","December 8, 2013","false","9.6"," 40 of 55 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","40","55","2","0"

Guide your Spectraball through the maze as fast as you can trying to avoid the traps.\n\nControls are easy enough, but does take some practice to move & rotate camera together. I liked the level designs, each being very uniquely themed & scaling in complexity (although there are not many to choose from making it relatively short game). There are some challenging sections which need precise control of your ball, which I found myself dieing over & over. This wasn't overly frustrating as resetting is friendly.\n\nI felt a sense of accomplishment when I figured the next step out sometimes as there are some areas you need to stop, look & discover what's next - its not always obvious or easy on later levels. So it may be relatively short, but the what you get in the content is good.\n\nIn 2012/13 the game got complete engine overhaul, now called the 'Extended Edition', including some additional content - now less buggy & it looks great! Awesome little game for the price! Not too many like it.\n\nFound this video on the community hub that had some good gameplay in it if you want to see more (straight gameplay so may contain spoilers):\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=194797951 (Gameplay footage uploaded by WizFish)\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","September 29, 2013","true","5.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

Everything is kinda mediocre, and there is a fair share of bugs, but it has its moments and I still had a lot of fun.

I would recommend this game to anyone who like challenges. It can be unforgiving at times but rewarding in return.

Shame the game has only 7 levels.\nGraphics can be distracting and sometimes awkward when you have to move or view around to see where you have to go as objects sometimes block your vision.\n\nCouple of minor glitches I had found while playing this game:\nRandom points through out the game the ball may either get stuck in corners or wedges.\nSometimes when jumping it doesnt always do it then and there. (Very rarely on odd occassions)\nlvl 6 The TNT boxes sometimes get stuck and dont drop when needed too.\nlvl 7 The last jump at the end you sometimes get stuck in free fall and forced to restart from the last checkpoint.\n\nWith only those minor glitches I have found, I still enjoyed playing this game and will enjoy playing it over again.\nPersonal rating: 7.5/10","May 26, 2014","true","4.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

Some levels are very frustrating, but you could still have some fun for a short while. If you already have it, you might as well try it. If you don't, don't bother.\n\nOverview: Spectraball is about rolling a ball through levels, managing speed, jumping around, taking physics into consideration and solving puzzles. Basically, it's a brainless platformer with a few puzzle elements.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful landscapes\nThe overall experience provides some fun\nUnlockable items and skins for your ball sphere\nCons:\nTextures and graphics, when seen in detail (and not as a whole), leave much to be desired (but, to be fair, the game is from 2008)\nPoorly positioned checkpoints make the game a bit more frustrating than it should be\nThe camera - oh, God, the camera! - sucks and it's one of the hardest aspects in the game\nA bit on the short side\nControls sometimes feel a bit unnatural--at least when you're in the air, camera positioning affects the 3D movement, making some jumps harder than they should be\nPuzzles seemed uninspired and are either too easy, or really frustrating because of either the camera or the controls\nExtra minigames are boring and bland, not to mention the lack of BGM while you play them\nBought on: Steam Auction for 1400 gems. I feel slightly disappointed in myself for buying this game under these circumstances, but it wasn't a complete waste (it has trading cards, too). It's been as cheap as US$ 1.24 (R$ 3,56) on Steam Store.\n\nVerdict: Spectraball is another game I'd rate neutrally if I could, but I can't really recommend anyone to buy this. Some levels are very frustrating, the lack of checkpoints, the camera and all that, but you could still have some fun for a short while. So if you already have it, you might as well try it. If you don't have it, don't bother.\n\nSimilar games: Other games where you roll a ball across levels while solving puzzles are InFlux, and Lost Marbles. While I haven't played any of those yet, the latter seems more promising to me.","January 10, 2015","false","4.3"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

While the platformer part may be right, it is not a real puzzle game as thinking is not required. The so-called puzzles are way too linear and obvious to be a challenge and the only hard thing is beating your own timerecord, which shouldn't be the case for a puzzle game.\nThe graphics may have a rather good quality compared to other games of the genre, but there are a ton of useless and not good-looking shaders that make the game look even more unrealistic than it already is because of the platforms hanging free in the air (which is of course needed to qualify the game as a platformer, the devs may think) An example of the shaders that were put in the game without thinking can be seen in the screenshots: Every surface reflects the magic shine of the ball, may it be stone, dirt or snow.\nThe level-design is done very poorly and broken. The major problems include but are not limited to: Way too easy and boring parts, shadows hiding passages that don't seem to be meant as a secret passage (It would make no sense to hide it), and most importantly: About 50% of the obstacles are easy to overcome by just speeding towards them and then jumping all over the puzzle, skipping the complete part that would of course not have been a challenge otherwise.\nThe gameplay is way too short. I was able to complete the whole game in only 2 [Edit: 3] hours of gameplay. I did not try to be as fast as I can and instead tried to have fun with the whole world, but there are no extra parts or passages in it, only the straight obvious ways the player needs to take. I also played many levels multiple times because I got tired of this game when I first tried it and then decided to play it completely several months later.\n\nI definetely do not recommend the game. Only 2 [Edit: 3] hours of gameplay are not worth the price and I did not enjoy any level of it and would not even have bought it if it was on sale for 20% of the full price if I knew that before.\nI remember playing Ballance on my old computer, if anybody knows that. It is not as fast as Spectraball but sure has its similarities, being a true puzzling and platforming game.

It plays out more like a platformer where your character is a ball than a real...I'm not sure what you'd call it, but a game that focuses on the the physics, abilities, and limitations of the ball. The physics model of the game is lacking, level design feels uninspired, and there are many frustration points with long jumps back to checkpoints.  To top it all off it doesn't support controllers properly, only giving digital movement to the analog stick.

You will actually be mostly crawling through the levels at a slow Marble Madness pace. Control over the ball also feels very loose and is easy to fall off the ledge on simple turns and narrow paths. The loose control also makes necessary speed and jump markers easy to miss. Small sections of the level will need to be attempted many times before a successful run.

I got the game because I got 50% off with the coupon for completing a badge, and I must say it is pretty addicting for $3. You play as a ball and the goal is to get to the end of the level through a series of platforming and puzzle solving. The camera control is pretty spot on when you are playing, and each level introduces a new map mechanic that can make the game more challenging. The game has a few bugs which are pretty minor, nothing huge. However, one of the bugs I feel must be said is when you die the camera flips around to where you are supposed to go. So for example if you get to a checkpoint and the correct way is north, when you die and spawn you will be facing south.\n\nAll in all I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platforming and puzzle solving.","August 21, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I have just a few gripes with the game:\n\n1. Checkpoints aren't placed in spots where they absolutely should be placed. This leads to replaying easy areas that lead into trickier areas, sometimes over and over to the point of annoyance.\n\n2. The camera has some wonkiness (which is actually poor level set up) and leads to situations where you can't see the ball. This is less of an issue than #1, but from time to time, it's still annoying.\n\n3. You can easily screw up on loops by pressing in the wrong direction (which is actually the direction you start the loop on). In most games that change your direction while moving, the movement continues in the direction of momentum as long as you keep the movement button pressed in the same direction you started with, which is what they should have done here.\n\n4. Level size is much larger than one would expect starting even from the first level. Smaller levels up front, longer levels as you progress should be how it goes.\n\nOverall though, a decent game. I would prefer if this was more of an RPG, as the levels are long enough to support some kind of progression for the ball (more speed, better control, etc.).","February 3","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravityunown/recommended/18300/","gravityunown","GravityUnown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravityunown/","51 products in account","Before I get to the game, I should point out that I play on Mac only, but due to the poor coding of the game some of the content (like achievements and online leaderboards) won't work natively despite the game clearly being advertised for all platforms. Because of this I have to run the game through a Windows environment. When I have to emulate the game on a platform I'm not normally supposed to play in, that's a not a good sign.\n\nI will give the game credit for its appealing visuals and super cool marble skins, but for the gameplay itself? It's highly lackluster and in some cases poorly made. The marble you control is slippery as all can be; trying to maintain your footing on platforms is a jarring task itself because of how bad the marble controls. There's also a severe lack of control when the marble is in mid-air too. 50% of the time when I'm trying to move while in mid-air the marble is just stuck almost in a straight, vertical line, and I end up undershooting a ton of jumps. The final unlockable you get in the game is a double jump for use with the power-up button. This should have been selectable by default because without this ability the level exploring is atrocious and ultimately an unpleasant experience. This game could have been something really impressive if they took more time to fine-tune the controls, make the acceleration less slippery, and overall make the movement more fluent. I would dare say this game is enjoyable only after you've gotten perfectly used to the awful controls, which is not good.\n\nApart from the main 7 levels (yes, there are only 7 levels in the game) are 3 different mini-games you can play. Arena is a poor-man's survival game where you can hug the center chain and last hundreds of seconds before the enemy marbles knock you off, Laser Jump is a basic jump-rope game with no real strategy to it, and Crate Chaos is an abysmal "air-time" game that is infuriating to try and last 100 seconds on due to the aforementioned poor jumping controls. One cool feature I will admit adds more replay value and is somewhat enjoyable is the addition of a custom levels archive, which can be downloaded in individual sets for more action. They're shorter and surprisingly better designed despite most of them not being as aesthetically pleasing to the eye. As of this review, it's the only portion of this game that is bringing me back to play it from time to time.\n\nOverall I found this game to be a disappointing experience. Poor Macintosh compatibility despite clearly being advertised on all platforms, slippery physics & controls, disorientating motion blurs, convoluted level design, and unfair achievements that test the raw sanity of its players. I do not recommend getting this game, even if you are an avid marble platformer game fan. I recommend playing something like Lost Marbles, Switchball, or MarbleBlast Gold instead.","July 27, 2015","false","11.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

I often found myself with no clue what to do. "Volcanic Crater" was so bad, that I thought I would give up completely - not only it is hard to find the right way, but you can´t even see a damn thing. Other levels were only a bit better, with maybe snowy one being decent/enjoyable.\nEven if you manage to orientate yourself in this mess, the game will throw graphical glitches, (gamechanging) bugs and unpredictable physics (requiring you to have godlike reactions) at you.\nSimply put - campaign/main levels don´t bring much of a joy.\n\nThen we have three mini games. Two of them are quite bad - "Gladiator" can be rigged easily and "Epic Crater" is heavily based on luck. The last one, "Laser Surgeon" is actually enjoyable, but you won´t be playing it over and over since it´s always the same.\n\nGood things that save the game from being really bad are decent music and level creator.\nCustom levels are much better and are the only reason you would possibly want to play the game more/again.\n\nI would probably rather stick to Spectraball ´s modern predecessors such as Marble Blast Gold if you want to play a game of this kind.

It however screws up totally when it comes to actual level design, its just not good. Why? Too many reasons to count and several of them even contradict each other.\n\nFirstly: Some levels are just plain too confusing, you can often find yourself in certain areas with no clear idea on where to go or what to do. You then however get levels which are too SIMPLE and are finished off in a flash (and with the low level count as it is, this is very much a bad thing).\n\nSecondly: None of the levels are memorable in any way, most consisting of a very basic theme and long stretches of dull lifeless jumping puzzles. The long levels really suffer for this (such as the Egypt level) where you can be bored still moving through it and then suddenly angered by the other two issues.\n\nOne of these issues being the small 'Rage' points in the game which just seem designed to be mean, balancing plinths that dont behave the same way, wind blasts that have little indication and the occasional 'Faith Jump' where you cant even make out where you are supposed to be landing.\n\nThe last issue is when you hit one of the many glitches and bugs. These are through the game and damage and already damaged product. I have gotten stuck in rocks, behind areas I wasnt supposed to be, in the floor at one point. I even managed to somehow get the achievement for the 'Balance' minigame by just staying still and getting trapped by all the other balls that were being shunted into the playspace, said balls didnt move the plinth at all.\n\nBasically just leave it alone.","November 25, 2013","false","1.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

These type of games usually are nothing more than glorified tech demos that showcase and engine’s graphical and physics capabilities.\nIn this regard, Spectraball is no different. You control a ball, have three possible unique powers to help you on the stages, and your goal is to try to reach the end of each stage as fast as possible.\n\nAlthough the game says it has puzzle elements, in reality this is a pure old-school platformer on par of the most well-known ball-busting hard NES titles from decades before.\nThis also means Spectraball is an excellent game for those who like to speedrun platformers, especially since the game has online leaderboards.\nSadly, the game is short, with only seven stages and three survival challenge maps which each offer an achievement.\n\nOverall, if you like challenging platformers and indie engines which utilise wonderful graphics, this game is for you. If you want a puzzle game though, you will more than likely be disappointed. If I had to add some numeric value to this review, I'd go around 60/100; the game doesn't really have many strong or weak points, it's just another indie platformer.

This game is a lot of fun and it has a lot of replayability. In addition to the seven maps in the main game, there are also many custom maps created by users that you can play through. My personal favorite level is the snow one. It is just a joy to play through.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, you basically roll a ball through beautiful and varied levels in order to reach an end goal and move on to the next. In addition to rolling, you are able to jump and use a power brake to instantly stop. Once you have beaten all the levels, you unlock ball designs inspired by each level and two new abilities you can use - teleport and double jump. There are timed leaderboards for each level and high scores for each of the minigames. Of the three minigames, the only one I returned to over and over was Crate Chaos because I was competing with someone for high scores.\n\nI asked the person I played with if she wanted to add anything to this review and she said: This is a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game. It is challenging without being too frustrating. I absolutely agree, but with that being said, I have to admit there were times when each of us rage quit out of frustration. That's the thing about this game - sometimes you might struggle with sections that seem ridiculously simple and other times you might breeze through them. There are absolutely challenging sections as well. There is an achievement for completing the seven main game maps in order without falling out once but I can't imagine ever dedicating the riduculous amount of time (and I'm going to say also luck) that it would take to accomplish that.\n\nAs for controls, I played throught this game once with the X-Box controller and once with the keyboard and mouse. What I found was that it was much easier to control my jump with the gamepad and easier to make tiny course adjustments with the keyboard/mouse. If you are struggling with one or the other, I suggest switching control schemes.\n\nIn short, this game was hours of fun for a very low price and it has the potential for tons of replayability. Especially if you were a beast at Marble Madness, you're probably going to want to check this out.","May 5, 2013","true","33.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I just didn't find it much fun.  It does have one of the most compelling villains ever to grace a game like this, or really a game like anything.  At first the camera seems like a helpful friend, somebody you can rely upon when you need it.  Then, betrayal!  And oh, what a betrayal.  From then on, the camera does everything it can to hinder you.  Putting track elements in your way when you're trying to navigate a tricky part, requiring an angle to position yourself that makes the route forward invisible.  That sort of back-stabbery.\n\nIn all honesty, I can't really say too much else is wrong with this game.  If you're into playing a platformer where you're a ball, similar to marble madness but without the rollerball control, then maybe this game is something you'd like.  But unless that is a very specific gameplay type that you really want to play, you'll probably have more fun with one of the many, many other games out there.","June 19, 2014","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then no ball responsiveness for you!\n\nAside from that, the camera is really the worst part of this game; It clips through walls and blocks your view, so you are constanly battling with the view angles while also trying to avoid falling off-course. Whee?\n\nThere is a REASON this game has a :vein: emoticon! If you enjoy the game of labyrinth and like wasting HOURS trying over and over again, then by all means ignore my review and proceed onward, intrepid self-flagellist! Better yet, go find yourself the Lament Configuration puzzle box and have yourself a grand time! New dimensions of pain await you!\n\nOhhh, suffering...

The playthrough time is really short but for example to me it took ages to get The Impossible achievement. Too bad devs didn't make more maps but luckily there are plenty of community maps avaible. There are also some minor bugs which appear now and then like speed boosts sometimes work randomly and ball might get stuck and you are not able to jump but those happen so seldom that it didn't really bother me at least.","December 31, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
