The main gist of the game is to solve each problem as optimally as possible and see where you rank in the leaderboards in 3 different categories: objects used, overall beam length and the always important logic tics that it took to arrive to said solution.\n\nRather nice that the game allows you to save different solutions to the same puzzle and you can redo/undo all you want.\n\nIf this seems enjoyable to you than rest assured, it will be enjoyable.

Lasers can be one of three primary colors (red, blue, green), and outputs can be any combination of those outputs, allowing for a number of difficult scenarios.\n\nLasers are manipulated through the use of mirrors, "mixers" which combine lasers, "splitters" which act as mirrors but also allow the laser through, "diffusers" which take input on every side and send out on every side, "prisms" which take white lasers and split them into the three primary colors, and logical AND, OR IF and XOR gates.\n\nIn addition to the general "find a solution" challenge, there are a series of other challenges relating to number of items used, length of lasers, and whether or not you have any "dangling" lasers which don't connect to anything.\n\nThe UI can be a little cramped on lower resolutions, but there's a lot of variety in how to approach the problems (fully rotatable, can be tuned into a top-down 2D view, etc). All in all, this is an excellent puzzle game which is well worth the asking price. Think of it as a game which is to logic design the same way Spacechem is to programming. I had to crack out K-maps for the first time since college, and it was delightful.","February 2, 2015","true","7.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/recommended/332830/","explodingbosoms","The Pasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/","349 products in account","AbstractThis game is quite the mind bender. In fact, it bends your mind so much you may swear you can hear it screaming for you to stop. Prelogate is pretty much what it says on the main page; A game that uses lasers and mirrors to solve complex problems. The game itself is pretty straight-forward in that you just have to solve the puzzles. The music selection is slow and ambient, which is nice, but felt grating at some points. There's a...sorta plot, but at the same time its not entirely a plot. While the game itself is a challenge, it gets to a point where the challenge is excessive and one relies more on solution codes than spending 3 hours on one stage. While I would recommend it, it's not something I'd recommend to just anyone.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is, as said before, using lasers and mirrors. Cool, right? Who doesn't like using lasers for weird stuff? Unfortunately, the fun part wears off pretty quickly. The game starts with simple mirrors and lasers, relying on reflection and splitting to get to an endpoint. This lasts for a few levels before the game introduces logic gates; IF, OR, AND, XOR. Naturally, anyone with a smidge of computer science learning, or fumbling around in programming, knows what these are. So it's rather an unhappy moment when you realize these logic gates don't really...feel like they belong. Sure you know how they work because of the small text window, but that's all you get. You have to figure out how they work entirely in the levels they give it to you, because it does not get esaier after this point. It is here you realize the game is about to turn from difficulty curve into a full blown Kleiner's bottle of difficulty; no matter how hard you climb, you never really escape it. Solutions become downright maddening just to clear one step out of eight. Again, it is here you start to rely more on solution codes than actually working it out.\n\nMusicIt's there, sure. It's pretty basic, nice space-like ambience to make you feel relaxed. Which doesn't help because this game needs you to fire all cylinders in your brain. Strange how that works.\n\nPlotThe game has some...interesting mechanics outside of the actual game. However, these interesting mechanics are simply superficial; They're there to just sit there and look nice. You can interact with the pre-level UI in some ways, but it doesn't really do much. Can't explore who you are, why you're there, what kinda people are working with you. It's just for kicks. Part of me thinks it was going to be a part of something larger, but was scrapped for reasons unknown. While the over-arching plot is you making AI systems with lasers, I felt like there could've been a little more.\n\nOverallI personally just could not enjoy the game after getting halfway through it. The logic gates really made the puzzles far more mind-bending than they deserved to be and the unfortunate reality to feel like I was too stupid to figure it out for myself, let alone for the rest of the game, really gave me a terrible taste in my mouth. The game does what it sets out to do, and does it well. That said, don't be surprised if you fall short of what the puzzles ask for and end up flailing hopelessly because you just don't entirely understand it. Thankfully, the pricetag is quite an enticing factor, so even if you don't really like it, 3$ for 64 levels of puzzles is a pretty rad deal.\n\nI'm reluctantly recommending it on the off-chance people are masochistic and love a good challenge. Don't say I didn't warn you!","November 7, 2015","true","7.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The early levels are a bit easy but it's nice to have the opportunity to get to know each new part and use them several ways before the more complex and surprisingly difficult later levels.  Part of what I found really fun an interesting is that there are times that you must use simple gates to create more complex one.  Like, for instance, using xnor's to make other logic gates.  There is real world practicality in figuring out these problems, as these types of puzzles are at the heart of computer and electronics technology and some of the very same challenges faced in real-world engineering.  The relaxing motif and approachable presentation make it a rather fun diversion.","September 8, 2015","true","5.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Instead of finding a single solution, you build your very own solution. Later puzzles can get very tricky when you have limited space, but everything is solvable if you think and plan hard enough. After you have solved everything, you can optimize your solutions further to enhance certain aspects like f.e. the number of used devices. If you are competitive enough, you can add a lot of play time this way while climbing up the leaderboards, and I am far from done with 17 hours played.\n\nHowever, this game is not for everyone. You need a strong analytical mind to have fun here.

The difficulty curve can be a bit uneven across challenge sets but there are plenty of puzzles to keep you thinking and it continously introduces new puzzles or new ways of thinking to solve puzzles. It can get pretty darn hard too, though not quite as hard as some other pure-logic puzzles out there.\n\nOne thing I like about this game is that you can tell when your solutions work in advance, there's very little real trial-and-error. Though plenty of times where you fix a problem in one step only for a new problem to arise in a different step... but eventually with enough careful consideration the solution becomes clear.\n\nThe music is very nice and relaxing, I appreciated it.

Example:\n\nIF gate will allow a beam to fire through it, if the gate is struck by a separate beam.\n\nAND gates will fire a beam if both sides of it are hit by the same color (some exceptions with secondary colors)\n\nOR gates will fire a beam if either side or both sides are struck by a separate beam.\n\nXOR (exclusive or) gates will fire only if one side is being struck. So an OR will fire if both sides are being struck, an XOR will not.\n\n\nThen you have to recreate these gates without them... some of those are particularly rough. Once you get past those 2-3 puzzles the difficulty drops back down to reasonably hard. Other than these quibbles with difficulty curve spike. this game is fantastic and will make your brain feel amazing when you complete puzzles.\n\nDon't let the simplicity or low price tag fool you, this game is serious business. Definitely not for the average puzzle fan, this is some hardcore logic wiring puzzles.

In each step, a different subset of lasers / receivers are active, and laser beams must not hit inactive receivers.  Your solution must be valid for all steps simultaneously.  This is an innovative take on laser puzzle games that is interesting and challenging.\n- There are 10 sets of puzzles, and almost every set of puzzles is based on a different theme and plays differently\n- Can be quite challenging\n- For additional challenge, you can make your solution "clean" (laser beams don't go off the screen or hit obstacles).  You can also optimize your solution to minimize the number of devices used; the total length of the laser beams; or the number of devices plus the number of separate beams.  See comment below.\n\nDislikes:\n- UI is clumsy.  If you click Play, you can't navigate to previous solved levels (need to click Level instead).  If you click Level, you can't proceed to the current unsolved level (need to click Play instead).  No quick puzzle reset (need to escape to menu).  Some pieces are hard to visually distinguish (e.g. mixers and diffusers).  Visually unclear in 2D view (e.g., raised walls are nearly invisible).  Always need to rotate camera when starting a puzzle.\n- Every puzzle is progress locked\n- For the Obstacle and Platform sets of levels, the puzzles felt a bit uninspired, and less interesting\n\nComments:\n- The optimization aspect of the game is reminiscent of SpaceChem, but the puzzles are not as open-ended and engineering-focused as in SpaceChem","April 7, 2015","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's difficult as hell and I love it for that. I've always loved mirror puzzles like this, and I've only seen colour-mixing light puzzles in one game before - Runescape. But in that section you were constantly harassed by enemies so it kind of ruined the enjoyment. You've taken the best part from that puzzle and stripped out the bad, and for that, I utterly love you.\n\nI will be reccomending the hell out of this to people who played that quest, lemme tell you.","April 18, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I like that it is a simple concept with no gimmicks. The store page description and screenshots give a pretty honest look at the game. Not much else to say other than it is extremely difficult if your "mind doesn't work that way" but still rewarding. I would recommend it if you are looking to challenge yourself.","June 15, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A puzzle game that actually makes me feel stupid!\n\nSeriously, though, the puzzles are fairly balanced. You'll never feel like it's the game's fault for being a bit unintuitive. The only problem I DO have with it is that there's no way to cap the FPS, so the game will constantly run at 800 FPS even on a low end machine, which can wear your computer out in excess.\n\nGreat game, I'd recommend it.","April 11, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Having played it for a little while its one of those games that gets under your skin a bit, there are no enemies or action involed just a series of ever more complex puzzles to push your thinking skills a little bit more each time.\nThe game involves placing mirrors, beam splitters, prisms and logic gates over the playing area in order to connect light emitters to their appropriate recievers by mixing (to get different colours) and diverting the beams of light, all of which is made harder by multi stage levels in which different emitters and recievers are switched on and off.\nMinor gripes are with the control system which can feel a little awkward and the clarity of the objectives during the tutorial but overall this is a fun and challenging game and one I would definately reccomend.","April 12, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
