"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SomeLameStuff/recommended/408120/","SomeLameStuff",".#MissYouBowieAndRickman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SomeLameStuff/","229 products in account","This is a story driven game, and so it absolutely crashes and burns when the story doesn't hold up the game at all. The story is incredibly short, but less "short and sweet" and more "well, where's the rest of it?". It understays its welcome, and having such a short story means that the characters are not given time to grow at all.\n\nThe relationship between the two main characters is the main focus, but the player isn't shown any of that development. Instead, the two characters talk, one of them delivering extremely creepy dialogue that wouldn't be out of place in a stalker movie, and then there's a time skip, and then another section starts and they're somehow magically closer to each other. The sudden transition from friends to "I love you" is jarring and really poorly paced.\n\nAnd speaking of which, the sections where most of the story is delivered is in an MMO within the game itself (gameception!). The main problem of this is that this segment is so incredibly poorly programmed. The pathing around is practically broken, which makes the "combat" frustrating when your character gets stuck on a piece of terrain. There's only ONE combat animation per character (and the character with an arm cannon doesn't use it to attack, but rolls up into a ball and glows instead?). This can be forgiven if the story being delivered was decent, but as stated above, it's not. These MMO segments quickly become a chore, since the story won't progress until certain markers are met. The three different MMO segments are basically just palette swaps of each other, and don't hold the player's attention at all.\n\nThe game seems to rely entirely on the underwear cutscenes to draw attention and sales. The way it plays out, it seems like the developers wanted to make a short movie rather than a game, but decided a game would sell better. They say it takes 1.5 - 2 hours to complete, but I finished everything in 50 minutes. This game really would have benefitted a lot more from another hour or so of content, with more time to develop the characters. Instead, it immediately jumps out of the gate and falls flat right on its face. "Based on a true story" doesn't excuse the story and characters from being lifeless.\n\nThere's no replay value, the story is just boring, the gameplay is frustrating to non-existent. I requested and got a refund. Definitely not worth the launch price of $7.64. Definitely not worth the full price of $8.99. Definitely not worth your time.","November 2, 2015","false","0.8"," 618 of 744 people (83%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","83","618","744","15","5"

I get that some games prioritize telling a story over having enjoyable gameplay, but Cibele basically has none. The gameplay itself is just incredibly boring, and doesn't offer the player any substance. All it consists of is playing a fictional game where you click on enemies, and nothing more. It is excruciatingly boring. This game should have just been created in the form of a short video.\n\nThe story itself is told via voice-overs and files on the player's computer. At first I thought the story would be somewhat interesting, but it is told in a terribly cringey way, which made it impossible to relate to the player character.  Having the main character say "i always do my best to look anime ^_^", and yes that is a literal quote, is the easiest way I've ever seen to drive people away from a game. Not only is the method of storytelling executed quite poorly, but the story in itself is nothing to write home about. I found myself completely unable to care for the relationship between this Nina and her internet boyfriend.","November 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 291 of 358 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","291","358","5","4"

For what it is worth Cibele is a good idea that had a lot of potebtial, but the story itself felt very rushed,compact. The acting in the actual real life parts of the game seemed a bit stiff at times, along with a little of the voice acting(though the voice acting was good in others). If felt as though I was always waiting for the good part to start or waiting for something cheesy to happen, but it just left me with a sour unfulfilled feeling. The story ends so much faster than you think and that is fine, but the main arcs of the story are so brief  that is hard to keep up with. I liked it for what it was worth, but in the long run this game made me wanting more background to the whole situation. Don't get me wrong if you plan to buy this game it is not a bad buy, but it really leaves something to the imagination.","November 2, 2015","false","1.0"," 343 of 439 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","343","439","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/facialist/recommended/408120/","facialist","kinggimped","http://steamcommunity.com/id/facialist/","387 products in account","I really wanted to like this game. I like quirky, unusual games. I like alternative or unusual storytelling methods. I want female developers to succeed because their gender should make no difference whether or not their games are taken seriously. I like games that explore small, everyday things like a budding online relationship. On paper, this game looked pretty interesting.\n\nCibele, however, is barely even a game. Pretty much everything about it is just... poor.\n\nI'd love to discuss the game's mechanics, but unfortunately... there are none. As the game unfolds, it alternates between three formats, over three time periods during which the 'relationship' between the girl and boy unfolds:\n\n- a (very user unfriendly) virtual desktop, where you can browse the files, folders, emails etc. of the game's 'protagonist'. I hesitate to use that word, but I'll get onto that in a moment\n- the multiplayer game that the 'protagonist' plays. If this were a Flash game hosted on Newgrounds in 1997, it would still be considered terrible by those standards. It's obviously just supposed to act as a placeholder, a window through which we see the interaction between the 'protagonist' and the guy she likes unfold. But it's one-dimensional, horribly made, ugly as sin, and just annoying to 'play'. It's basically a casual clicker game, but worse\n- videos of a girl sitting at a computer in her underwear, taking photos of herself in her underwear, and doing other assorted things in her underwear. These make up a tiny portion of the tiny amount of gameplay in this 'game', but make up the vast majority of the screenshots and marketing. Doesn't take a genius to work out why (hint: underwear)\n\nAs for the story... I understand that I might not be the target demographic here (male, older than a teenager), but I found it awful to the point of grating. The girl through whom you view the events of the game is a completely one-dimensional, weak character. The's the 'protagonist' of the game only because you play 'through her eyes' - there is never a point in the game where you can make a decision that changes anything. It's entirely linear and on rails - the only reason this simulation can call itself a 'game' is because of the sequences where you play the fake game, and as above, that is awful and basically just completely pointless clicking until the game decides to move you on.\n\nAs for the guy that the 'protagonist' falls for... he's a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He's creepy, he's overbearing, he's pushy, and completely awful. I honestly thought the game was shaping up to be a cautionary tale to tell naive girls not to talk to creeps online.\n\nI thought there might be some intrigue to the way the story unfolds passively - you don't see every interaction between the girl and the boy, you only view their relationship via the three sequences above. For example, the second time you're looking at the girl's desktop, there are new files in her folders, showing a little of what she's done in the meantime. A better storyteller probably could have woven an interesting tale by letting the 'player' fill in missing details, but unfortunately that's not the case here either. The whole thing feels forced and completely artificial.\n\nI understand that probably a fair bit of work went into making this game, so I didn't want to dismiss it with a one word review. But quite honestly, there's probably more content in this review than there is in the game. I'm gonna leave it here. **Don't waste your money on this thing. It's not good.**\n\nWant to play a game that tells a story in a unique, alternative way? Try *To The Moon*, or *30 Flights of Loving*, or literally anything else. Just don't buy Cibele, it's a waste of money.\n\nAvoid. Avoid it hard.","November 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 163 of 196 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","163","196","8","1"

It's mostly meant as an encouragement to the writer and developers to do better next time, as they clearly have a lot of talent and inspiration and I will still support their originality and their much appreciated personal "touch".\n\nAnyway, bought, played, and finished Cibele yesterday, all in about 30 minutes. I don't mind short games, they are like short movies or short stories and I have an appreciation for all of that. But in this case, I must say I am quite disappointed. I *AM* the target audience for this kind of games, as I like stories, I like human exploration and I do not consider "emo" a bad word. So I hate that I have to give it a negative review, in fact I supported the project and the effort by buying it right away, but the end result is simply too shallow, simplihistic, and as a consequence of that it results inherently narcissistic, to carry any weight (it is important that you understand why I put "narcissistic" at the end of list, as it's the least problematic part). I did not dislike the game/story being told, and I appreciated the way Nina Freeman, the writer, chose to tell it. But after three very short jumps ahead in the timeline we are left with a conclusion that fails to convey much intensity by hurrying to a bare bones conclusion which almost reduces the two characters to a cliché.\n\nNone of what happens in the story and none of the lines being said are out of place, and it is all very faithful to a reality that lots of us probably know first hand. But that's exactly why the characters, their emotional confusion, chaos, turmoil, insecurities, armours and all, deserved a bit more than what, when the end titles roll, feels like a High School project more than a College one (let alone a 10 dollars professional product).\n\nI am glad I played it. I don't hate it, and I enjoyed my time with it. But I was hoping for MUCH more. It probably reminds me a lot of my own old journals, and there's a reason why I don't sell them. (And please, do not think that any of the opinions so far expressed is based on the price tag. Everything I wrote in the first two paragraphs would stay true even if this were shared for free).","November 3, 2015","false","1.4"," 160 of 202 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","160","202","2","0"

That being said - if you really want to play it to see how it is, I would reccomend sharing the experience with others; at the very least, then you're not just paying for a quick hour-long thing, you're paying for something you can keep bringing out and talking about with your friends. There are some very, very good things about this game that are worth apprieciating; I just can't wait to see those initial ideas be refined by other aspiring developes, or even polished up a fair deal by Freeman herself somewhere down the line.\n\n5.5/10","April 19","false","0.8"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","37","41","2","0"

Following in the tradition of other confessional genres, Nina Freeman uses her own old notebooks, fanart, chat logs, and, yes, lingerie-clad selfies to create a realistic history for her character. As a result, the haphazardly organized photographs, poem drafts, and archived personal websites on Nina's laptop could easily have been taken, with only minor changes, from my own computer when I was a teenage girl.\n\nThat's when I took a deep breath and knew that I was really in for it.\n\nIn the reviews I've been reading of Cibele so far, there's a certain point where everyone begins talking about themselves and their own experience of love on the internet. When I was in high school, I met a girl whose name I now cannot even remember through Livejournal. We had so many nicknames and shorthands for each other that I know I won't think of her name until the end of this review. She lived in Baltimore, Maryland (or as she taught me to call it in a mockery of her accent, Murlan) and I lived in California. She was falling in love with me, and as a girl who had never thought about being anything other than straight, I was totally clueless about it. "ilu," we would sign off to one another on AIM as birds began chirping outside our windows. We saved our lunch money to buy phone cards and lost even more sleep. The months went by and she became increasingly jealous of the friendship I was developing "in real life" with the girl who would become one of my best friends, and I became increasingly aware that there was something going on under our jokingly explicit declarations of undying love, and everything slowly, gradually fell apart. It was a relief that we had never met face to face, and that I could simply ward off uncomfortable feelings with an AIM away message.\n\nIn that relationship, I was Ichi.\n\n"What are we even doing?" Nina giggles at one point, as you float aimlessly together through the calming pastel world of Valtameri, killing enemies with little sense of purpose or direction, and talking in much the same way. What is it that we even do in these early internet friendships? Cibele manages to capture some of that sense of endless time spent online, chatting with friends, keeping up with your PMs, writing bad poetry, the whole world ahead of you. Ichi isn't Nina's only online friend--we get a sense of her wider life in Valtameri, an ex who shared a private photo, a female friend missing out on their "girl only" boss runs. But he's the one who makes her giggle nervously, who encourages her to complain about her college friends taking her away from the game, who inspires her to have expensive underwear shipped to her dorm and pose awkwardly in front of the mirror.\n\nWe know where this story is going, but Cibele, short as it is, won't let you flinch and miss any of it. Ichi (whose real name is Blake, we piece together after another between-act absence from Nina's computer, only to find it exploding with mentions of BlakeBlakeBlake) tells Nina multiple times that he isn't interested in a relationship, but she believes he'll change his mind once they meet "face to face."\n\nNina's vulnerability is painful. At times you want to reach through your computer (her computer?) and tell her to get offline, to go out on a blind date, to go to a party, to just go to bed. But she is still learning, about relationships, about love, about female friendship, about who the self is that she wants to be. For Nina this is a moment of transition and pain as well as love and romance.\n\nLike some other reviewers, I felt that the story wrapped up rather quickly, ending right at the end of Nina and Blake's brief relationship. I really wanted to log on to Valtameri one more time, to feel that emptiness, to see more unanswered emails from Nina's classmates, to find Nina's folders reorganized, maybe with her photos of Blake buried out of sight with those of her family home and her high school grin. But perhaps the aftermath of the story is less interesting because all of us, Ninas and Blakes alike, know what comes next. Graduation, adult relationships, the fading of that magical online world. We can't go back to the Cibele stories in our own lives, and we're probably all thankful for that. But with this game, for an hour or two, we can.","November 4, 2015","true","1.3"," 218 of 337 people (65%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","65","218","337","12","11"

And it does this pretty well. It made me remember my life back when I used to play WoW a lot.\n\nThis game is an idea - an instense idea charged with emotion. It feels very raw and extremely personal. Being allowed to go through her desktop, reading chat logs and looking and sent pictures, felt very intimate. It really plays with one's voyeuristic curiosity. Then there are the voice chats, which again feel like overhearing someone's intimate conversation - full of sighs and "hmmm". Nine is a charming and pleasant-sounding person, whose voice I found enjoyable. But the central events quickly unfold and end. One hour, and you're done (including browsing through the contents of the computer).\n\nBefore playing this game, I read an interview with the creator (Nina) about it. Concerning the central plot, I feel I got almost as much from this reading as I did from the actual game. The main difference was in the details. The game is just much better at conveying emotions and re-creating the atmosphere.\n\nOverall, while I can't say that I didn't enjoy this game, I was left with a strong desire that it was deeper, that there was more to it. In its current form it felt like a mere illustration of an idea, rather than a full-scale experience I came to expect from games.\n\nIn its essence, this is a intriguing, but tiny art project. I feel that those that would appreciate the game already see parallels with their own life and want to experience a short, but intense surge of nostagia and tickle their voyeuristic curiosity.","November 7, 2015","false","0.8"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","0"

The game is based on a true story, of a girl named Nina, who starts an online “relationship” with a man who she meets whilst playing a game called Valtameri. Those of you who have played online games such as Worlds of Warcraft will probably be able to relate to this game a lot, as there are always those two people in your guild who acted like this.\n\nThe gameplay in Cibele is simple. You are a girl who is playing the video game Valtameri. The gameplay in that game is simple, and you have no chance of dying, you simply click to move and attack the enemies, that is it. There is no hidden agenda here; it’s just a method in which the story can progress. You are in a voice call with your friend, Blake, after every so many kills of monsters, the dialogue will progress into the story more. Between each chapter, you get a real life cut scene featuring the two involved. This game should be considered only for mature audience and should not be played when young eyes can see your screen.  Whilst you are in the world of Valtameri, you have other options to explore, such as the instant messenger which adds a little more background and depth to the story. Outside of the game, you can dig around Nina’s computer, reading emails, looking at pictures, reading her blog, etc. This all adds to the immersion of the game allowing you to get into the mind of this young lady.\n\nWhilst the graphics aren’t really a main focal point in Cibele, I did find the art style extremely pleasing to look at, it has a very clean look, and the animations of everything in the game is near enough perfect.  On top of the really nice looking graphics, the game is fully voice acted, in the parts where you would expect it, so the voice chat, using something like TeamSpeak or Ventrilo, it really sounds like you are there with them as you listen. The cut scenes do have any sound effects or voice acting in though, I think this is to add to the effect of the story that things are often different between people when they meet in real life after coming together online. That’s how I took it anyway.\n\nThere isn’t any difficulty level here, you will finish the game, and it only takes about an hour to do, and that is with reading blogs, checking out emails etc. I don’t think there would be any replay ability since the story seems pretty linear, so I wouldn’t say it’s worth a second play through.\n\nI did notice a slight stutter/frame drop at times when playing, this appeared to happen when new enemies entered the screen, which I found strange given that my rig is able to handle much more taxing games than this. I was able to play on 1440p though, so all resolutions were tight and crisp.  Keyboard and mouse will be needed to play.\n\nTo sum up, Cibele is an interesting title, that can be picked up for £5,99, I for one think that is a fair price for what is on offer, and the high standard of production values that have gone into this game. Some of you may get a nostalgia hit with the story, whilst others may actually enjoy the gameplay of the game in Cibele, but I can certainly say it is worth the full marked up price for an hour’s enjoyment.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Cibele is so superficial, so excruciatingly ordinary and basic, yet so real in that manner; it ends up being naively beautiful. Wait a minute there, I will properly explain what I'm trying to say as the review progresses, I promise.\n\nIf we are to establish a definition, Cibele is the combination of a clicker game that serves as a placeholder for an MMORPG, and a collection of FMV scenes, telling the story of Nina and her online romance, Blake. The story is based on real life events, coming from internet personality, game designer and new generation punk poet Nina Freeman's experience. The game retells Nina's first love and sexual experience with a guy she meets in a MMORPG game, through some FMV scenes and a symbolic gameplay. We witness 3 separate scenes, observe ongoing events in Nina's life through her computer desktop - mainly centering Blake/Ichi - and call it an artistic contemplation when it comes to an end in an hour.\n\nWell... I must say that it was a neat idea, yet poorly executed both in mechanics and display, yet surprisingly beautiful with symbolisms and characteristic undertone. It wholly consists of 3 sections: exploring Nina's desktop for photos, poems, artwork etc., playing the clicker game that serves as a symbolic MMORPG - Valtameri and watching FMV scenes either at the start or end of each chapter. Let's take closer looks to each of these sections in game, shall we?\n\nTo be really blunt, Nina's desktop was the best part of the game for me. It is the real visage of a nerdy girl's private space, who's been having a hard time in her transition from a lonely teenager to a curious yet diffident woman. Bad poetry, clumsily scribbled fan art, old blog entries of teenage angst and selfies that scream for attention, yet ending up being timid and tedious are everywhere to be seen. Nina is no protagonist at all. She is a young, needy, shallow girl who yearns for some kind of attention or at least approval. She is real; she is there. She is the face of any inexperienced, self-conscious girl growing up in the selfie generation, with a yearning for being different. On that manner Nina herself is superficial, boring; yet unexpectedly real in being lost and insecure. Thus, she is the naivety of the superficial. She is possibly the new generation Emma Bovary.\n\nValtameri, the online game that Nina is hooked up with is basically a clicker game where you'll click on random monsters to progress the conversation between Nina and Blake. There is no real gameplay to it, neither anything you can actually affect. Cibele, Nina's game character is invulnerable and it doesn't serve more than being an avatar for the events unfolding. There is no actual game world for you to explore. The whole MMO section is more of a collection of symbolisms set to establish an undertone for the relationship between Nina and Blake. For example, during the part 2, Nina and Blake have a conversation about self-image and self-esteem as they fight a boss in the shape of a fragmented human visage in a crystal hall. As I said, the whole game world is only an artistic display. It is not a game itself. On that manner, art work is very simplistic, painted with peacefully harmonious colors to depict symbolic imageries.\n\nFinally, the FMV parts... well, those were the ones that I enjoyed the least. They are basically a collection of Nina in different kinds of underwear, taking erotic pictures to share with Blake... and an implicational scene based on Nina's first experience with clumsy, teenage attempt on sexuality. As I said before: it is so superficial, that it ends up being naive. More scenes with actual contemplative actions could be added in my opinion, but these parts are basically ending up being there as fan service for Nina.\n\nWhen all is said and done, Cibele is an interesting attempt to display a superficial happenstance through art and the reminiscence of a younger generation. There is certain amount of labor put into it, and I find myself unable to down vote it due to involuntary reality of it all. Would I really recommend it? Surely, if it's on a decent sale. With the current price, you may prefer passing it. Too bad that there is no "Meh" button with these reviews, so I'll be up voting it due to display being pinpoint.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 3","true","1.6"," 49 of 65 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","49","65","0","3"

I am a big supporter of games of all sorts of topics and ideas. The only problem is that I don't feel Cibele was well done.\n\nStarting with what I enjoyed - its autobiographical and about subjects rarely tackled maturely in games. I also  enjoyed that Nina put pictures, poems, etc to ground the game as a game about her.\n\nFor what I didn't like - I really hate the whole "is it a game?" debate. But I really dislike it when I have no agency in games. This game is entirely driven by grinding in a bad fake-mmo and listening to voice-overs. You get emails you can "Respond" to, but there is absolutely no choice, exploration, or agency anywhere.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the fake ♥♥♥♥♥♥me is very poorly done. Pathfinding barely works, there are a few animations you have to watch over and over, Ichi and monsters can walk off the path. It just makes the game unenjoyable.\n\nThe story also ends abruptly. Maybe that is a thematic decision, but narratively it really seems to just shut the game down. Aside from one statement you do not really get any resolution or explanation to the events.\n\nI also think Ichi's personality really rubs me the wrong way. He's really the kind of person I could not stand being around or listening to, so having to hear him talk for an hour was really grating. This is further compounded by the fact that the game crashed for me before the third cutscene was shown, so I had to listen through the mmo portion of the third act twice, which is easily the most annoying (for me).\n\nI definitely think you should check it out if you want a game about mmos and sex and online relationships, but know that the narrative may end abruptly. Also understand that the "game" portion of the game is very taxing and unengaging.\n","November 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 45 of 59 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","45","59","0","0"

Everything felt very real and I was thrust back into my younger years of roleplaying on forums and hiding away with the people I had crushes on in MMOs as if it was our sacred space. I had almost entirely forgotten some of those days.\nI mean sure, now that I'm older and more removed from that insecure teen mindset, some of that stuff embarrassed me because I /knew/ I was exactly like that and it was almost hard to face that head on. It's posting on xanga about those neopets friends you hung out with immediately after school. It's getting the courage to show those friends what you look like and not knowing what to say when they don't bag on you. It's doing the same stuff in maplestory and wondering if you actually learned anything from before. It's being a confused and misguided teen in the mid 2000s and wondering what the hell any of this means.\nIt didn't feel like sifting through a stranger's computer, it felt like looking through my own old harddrives and talking to my old friends. I put about an hour and a half into this, getting kinda sucked in to the experience and exploring everything I could. Honest to the point that you kinda cringe or squirm cos you know what's happening and just wanna pull both characters aside and just talk to them like a weird mom, I'd recommend this to anyone that drifted through internet love affairs. Learning about love makes you do some silly stuff. Here's to you, tiny me that didn't understand even half the things I do now.","December 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 51 of 75 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","51","75","2","0"

Adding up to the spice, the game's trailer features a cute half-naked girl taking selfies showing off her body and sending them to her secret mysterious lover. It all looks good - we love the theme. However, the game failed hard.\n\nFirst, plot is awful. The game is about a girl's crush towards a guy, but I see utterly no reason of her falling for him AT ALL. He is not cute - "skinny ghost" is a pretty accurate description; he is not polite or gentle - he has a trashy mouth like a 14-year old and full of shallow flirtations that I feel awkward listening to; and he is weird - his insecurity issues literally come from nowhere in the third chapter. Well thinking back now, his "I love you" isn't sincere or convincing to me either, so maybe he just backed up. With only a "I don't love you", not even the classic "it's not you it's me" talk. What a coward.\n\nSecond, gameplay is unbearable. The main body of the game is a poorly-made and super boring mini-game where the main characters fell in love. It's like a early-2k flash game. What you need to do is just click, wait, get stuck, click again. And for each fight, you need to do these over and over again for like 20 minutes while listening to two people awkwardly flirting. Aside from the mini game, you also get to explore the girl's desktop with some photos, chat histories and emails. That's about it.\n\nI really don't recommend this game - save the money and time.

It’s close to being a visual novel or movie, but interestingly enough has what resembles an MMORPG that the player interacts with and plays in. The game starts the player on the PC desktop of the protagonist Nina Freeman. From there you can read her blog files, see selfies, poetry drafts for her university courses or boot Valtameri, the aforementioned MMORPG.\n\n- Story - (spoiler-free)\nNina is a girl that is passionate about many things: anime, photography and gaming among them. Inevitably she is drawn to an online game where she becomes part of a sort of clan, led by a male user by the screenname of Ichi. Nina, under the username Cibele, interacts with the other users and her friends via IM. Voice-acted sound clips progress the plot while the player is destroying monsters online in Valtameri.\n\n- Visuals/Audio -\nThis game utilizes the modern minimalist art style coupled with soft, ambient synth music. While perhaps not the most original of styles, it is effective in giving the game a strong emotional charge.\n\n- So why the negative rating? –\nAs you can see by my playtime, I finished this game in just over an hour. I was by no means rushing. The base retail price is $8.99, which is a bit staggering for an hour-long commentary game. If it goes on sale for 90% off, get it. I got it in a Humble Bundle for $1, so I am not complaining by any means, but if games were priced by average hours of enjoyment, this one would be ~900% overpriced.\n\nThe story was wonderful and I really enjoyed it, but the ending is dissatisfying, feels somewhat rushed and sorta comes out of nowhere, though it is plausible I guess. All in all, it’s a great archetype for how a story game should be presented and if the developer were to make another piece I would strongly consider buying it.\n\n- Quick Note -\nThe game is recommended for mature audiences. It deals with topics such as sex and college party life. Some of the content is very suggestive, but nothing heavier than PG-13.\n\nNot Recommended\n- Recommended with Caution\nRecommended\nHighly Recommended\nRecommended as Essential","June 1","false","1.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

Casual observation suggests that our lives don't intersect. We care about different things, we operate in different ways, and we're moving in different directions.\n\nCibele made me doubt that dissimilarity: perhaps we're more alike than I thought. Perhaps far more alike.

I loved Life Is Strange and I would absolutely play a "Mass Effect; Love In A Time of War" dating sim.\n\nUnfortunately, this game doens't work for me. This is gonna get a bit spoilery.\n\nYay for passion projects.\nYay for taking games further and exploring what a game can be.\nYay for Ms. Freeman taking all these risks to make Cibele.\n\nUnfortunately, a game like this (which is really more like a slightly interactive movie, or Gone Home on rails) lives and dies on its writing and voice acting. It's HARD to write a story like this. It's hard to write a love story and get the sense of why a couple works, why you should root for them, and why they fall apart. I never got a real sense of the characters, and the writing does a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. The voice acting isn't very believable, and the actors themselves never quite seem to commit to the circumstances in which they live. I never felt compelled, and when the relationship predictably disintegrates at the end of the game, I didn't feel anything. And I really went into this game rooting for to succeed.\n\nHere's the real problem - it feels like Ms. Freeman really would've rather made a film, but needed to find a way to greatly reduce the budget costs of making a 90ish minute movie (which, even indie, can cost into the millions of dollars), so she laid VO over an MMO facsimile. This facsimile doesn't really feel like a game - you chase sprites, click them, and the game slowly auto kills them for you. I know you don't show up to a game like this for the game play, but the game play, like any other element of a piece of art, should serve the themes and story, and this MMO facsimile does not.\n\nMs. Freeman and her director clearly have great eyes for cinematography and photography - they really managed to create a realistic world for Nina to live in. Creatively, there are talents on display here. But the whole thing never really quite congeals into something that grabs you.\n\nAs a final note, the male love interest comes off as a real son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ by the third act (not even the end), when his intention to use Nina for sex becomes pretty clear. There isn't much to redeem him, but the game never really explores why Nina falls for him in the first place, why she agrees to sleep with him, and the fallout from his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ behavior.","December 11, 2015","false","1.2"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","36","53","0","0"

You probably already know whether you're into things like that.\n\nSecondly, yes, it is short, about the length of a full length motion picture. Other reviewers have commented that this title should be cheaper. You can rent an HD movie on certain streaming platforms for $3-6, so if you think about it that way, this title won't cost much more than that on sale. If you don't have qualms about giving a couple extra bucks to support indie devs who are creating experiences different from the norm, then I think you'll feel okay about paying full price for this title.\n\nThe story really hit home for me. I felt like the characters were people I could have known growing up. Actually, I hate to admit it, but I feel like I could have BEEN one of these characters. The long-distance internet relationships, awkward interactions, teenage blog posts, instant messaging 4 different friends at the same time with different moods in each conversation while voice chatting with someone else--the feelings were all very familiar.\n\nSome reviewers have said that the pseudo-MMO aspect isn't engaging enough gameplay-wise. Sure, it's no .hack, but that didn't detract from the experience for me, as it mainly served as a backdrop for the very real and very human interactions between the characters. Thinking of it in contrast to a visual novel rather than an MMO might make more sense.\n\nAll told, I recommend it. Your mileage may vary if you want more from a "game," and the value proposition may not be worth it for those who don't relate to the characters and situations presented, but if any of the situations I described above made you feel a tinge of nostalgia or regret, you might be as touched by this story as I was.","December 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

I've personally had very similar experiences.\n+ I found it to be very interesting to play as the perspective of the female in this game. It was a bit eye opening at how annoying it must be to constantly be flirted with by random jerks online who all seemingly want to sleep with you or get nude pics.\n+ Very realistic characters. I was actually thoroughly pleased when the guy had some anxiety issues, and doubts about buying a plane ticket and flying across country to meet the girl for the first time outside the game. To me this is a cautionary tale for girls and guys alike. It's far easier to talk to people online, on the phone, or through games, and when you meet someone in real life you may find that things don't work out as well....which is actually VERY common.\n+ Great dialogue, which was incredibly well written and felt very genuine. The flirting especially was very cringe-worthy at times, but it often is when starting relationships as the guy gives the girl a lot of corny yet flattering compliments.\n+ I may get some hate for this, but I give this game props for looking into the \"taboo\" that is sexting and trading pics. In online environments it\'s extremely common for relationships to begin by trading pics far before you ever meet someone in real life. I also give props to the developer who shared all of these pictures to the somewhat judgemental gaming community.\n+ It almost feels like you are a stalker as you browse through her computer each time looking at her pictures, reading her emails, and going through a large variety of other text documents, fanart, school work, and so on which allows you to really delve into this girl\'s personality and who she is.\n+ Visually the graphics in the game look great and filled with color.\n\n- I have mixed feelings about the ending. Not to spoil too much, the guy is a ♥♥♥♥, and the ending is a bit abrupt. I wish it would have shown a bit more emotion as to what happened after...and I really wanted to know how the girl felt. I mean just as an example, it could have lead to depression and self-harm.\n- Very short game, it took me about 50minutes or so to finish the game. If you choose to read through the extra content like the text logs, chat, poems, text documents, it's probably around 1.5 hours.","June 1","true","1.8"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","22","34","0","1"

I like this game. You probably won't.\n\nI have a hard time giving this game a review.\n\nDespite being a fan of Nina and the material she tries to cover in her work, I find myself thinking that this is not much of a game. The story is an interesting one, and I can see why this medium was chosen to convey it. The trouble is that the actual gameplay portions of the game are a point-and-click minigame that isn't interesting or engaging for the player. In practice, this section of the game serves as little more than a backdrop that occasionally demands action on my part; "the experiment requires that you continue."\n\nAll that said. I enjoyed my experience with the game. Will you?\n\nWell, this game speaks to a certain group of people. Did you spend a lot of time playing MMORPGs sometime between the ages of 16 and 23? If so, then you stand a fair chance of finding yourself connecting with the characters and possibly their situation. If you didn't have an interest in that style of game around those ages, then I'm not sure that the narrative will be able to grab you in a meaningful way.\n\nIf after reading this you aren't certain one way or the other about this game, buy it on sale.

If there was a message, it wasn’t for me.\n\nIn Cibele, you’re basically looking into someone else’s life with a magnifying glass. For me, it was like I hacked into someone’s Myspace profile. Intruding. Looking for every piece of information available with little reason why. I guess if you were interested in Nina before Cibele, here you go. But for me, I wasn’t even aware of her existence until the internet gaming press decided to praise this game like the gospel.\n\nAnyway, there was also this awkward online relationship being told in Cibele. A story that could have been summed up in a sentence based on the information handed to me. There should have been a lot more. Like, how did this relationship come about in the first place? How did Nina meet him? Who are these other people talking and their relationship to Nina? How did it develop over time? Why didn’t it work out? These sort of questions. Maybe some of Nina’s inner thoughts.\n\nBring me in deeper, give me more perspective into to this life of yours because playing this game right now just seems like I’m stepping my toe into a pool of water. In other words, it’s shallow. So those even for those looking for some sort of connection isn’t going to get that strong-- of a connection. There’s nothing to see here.\n\nThe game "Valtameri" isn’t that good of a game either. The character you play as often gets stuck whilst your buddy, is somehow allowed to go anywhere he wants, even in sections where you can’t go to, where the boss you “fight” often tends to be. So you are basically making an effort to slug through to the next act to get more shallow romance. If this is the magnum opus, the exmaple of romantic games that the internet gaming press seems to make it out to be, I don't want to play another one again.\n\nSo I would only recommend this to people who. A. Admire Nina Freeman B. Those who want a shallow reflection of their own lives being portrayed in a video game.\n\nEveryone else?

The main interface is that of her desktop. A bit of a homebody, she has a number of online friends mostly gained from the game she plays online. Which I think a lot of people can relate to in the modern world. The game shes plays from what I can surmise is a fairly dull and repetitive MMO; But that game is mostly a vehicle to deliver and give atmosphere to the conversations she has with her friends.\n\nI found myself surprisingly engaged with the conversations she was having. While simultaneously feeling VERY uncomfortable as if I had invaded someones privacy against their will; against MY will. Which I think is by design. I don't want to really say the degree to which these relationships go or how many there are but I think if you've heard anything about this game through the grapevine you can probably guess pretty accurately what happens. However, I think its pretty unique of way of telling this specific story.\n\nI find that these sorts of experimental kind of 'artsy fartsy' games usually overstay their welcome as in; The hook has penetrated, enraptured you and then made you wait to hear its secrets. But this one feels like it 'under'stays its welcome. I feel like it ends a bit abruptly.\n\nThe comparison to 'Her Story' is easy but accurate. In all honesty, this tells a different story about something else entirely. After playing both, I like Her Story overall a bit better but because Cibele made me feel uncomfortable that maybe hits a little closer to home than I'd like to admit and in ways that Her Story did not.

Most of the story you\'re in a game hack/slashing enemies. You actually get kind of into it -- however it aggrevates the crap out of you because of the horrible pathing and overall clunkiness of the gameplay. It\'s not the beef of the game - but it should still be enjoyable and effortless to play a little simple game while interacting with everything else happening.\n\n2. The game ends abruptly, however there\'s a line in the ending that makes you assume there might be more to the story. There isn\'t. While I\'m satisfied with the story, there could definately be a bit of a continuation or more of a look into how the protagonist deals with the ending.\n\nThe characters are real and relatable, even the friends you only interact with through IM. The UI is pleasant and tells a lot about the girl\'s personality. The acting is kind of awkward, but it works for the characters.\n\nIf you bought this in the Humble Bundle like I did - it\'s worth an hour or 2 of playthrough. Not worth the $10 though, considering the only part you actually play is so poorly executed.","June 1","false","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Quite a let down considering it was on the supposed 'Games Awards'. It's a great try but it is extremely under developed.\n\nThe game has potential. Started of very well but ended very abruptly and was just a very confusing ending rather than a cliffhanger with a meaning behind it. It wasn't even a cliffhanger, just more like a gentle rise with a steep decline.\n\nSorry developer, gotta try harder next time.","December 5, 2015","false","0.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blzzzrrttt/recommended/408120/","blzzzrrttt","blzzzrrttt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blzzzrrttt/","1666 products in account","A few things before I begin; I would describe my experience with this game as negative but it is my hope that Cibele will have a positive impact on the medium of video games. A review marked as 'negative' probably wouldn't help this game reach any kind of success, so for the sake of trying to be helpful I'll settle with the blue thumb. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone I didn't know personally or anyone at all really.\n\nI don't feel great recommending anything to anyone but I can confidently say that if you don't see any value in games as an artform then there's probably nothing here for you. If you do however, you might derive some enjoying in seeing what Cibele has to offer. Whether or not you'll walk away from it positively or negatively is unknown to me.\n\n-\n\nCibele follows the age old rule of three rather strictly;  there are three different sections of gameplay, the story is told in three different acts and the bosses go down after the third time you fight them.\n\nThe first of these is the virtual desktop of Nina, the protagonist. It's littered with folders filled with various pictures and documents of a personal nature. I often felt a sense of voyeurism, and sometimes dread, looking through Nina's files. The content isn't graphic or even scandalous. Quite the opposite actually. It's a mix of selfies, poetry, photography, chat logs and archives of old blog posts. Some might call it "cringy" but this isn't where my problems lie. My issues stem from those last two items, the chatlogs and blog posts. The awkward ramblings of a teenage girl resonate with me more than I'd like to assume. I'm not one to look back fondly on the things I've said, made or done. Seeing bits of myself and the way I used to think and express myself online in these files brought on a feeling that most would describe as disgust. I didn't like looking at them.\n\nThese do not need to be opened or looked at to progress but they provide a nice amount of context to the kind of person Nina is and was. These files also fill in the gaps between the time skips that occur throughout the story.\n\nThe second third is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥me-within-a-game you play called Valtameri. It's definitely the most "game-y" of the three parts of Cibele and, unfortunately, it isn't very good. But that's not the purpose of it. Valtameri is an almost insulting distillation of what ♥♥♥♥♥♥meplay eventually becomes, a means to socialize with other people. A virtual space to hangout in. Valtameri is a crude facsimile of one half of the MMO experience, actually playing the game. Its actually kind of hard to believe that anyone could enjoy actually playing this game due to it's lack of depth or substance.\n\nIt does convey its point rather effectively though. It's the method by which Nina and her object of desire, Blake, interact and speak to each other through. These portions mostly focus on the social aspect of MMOs as the true focus is not the game but the conversations being had, both text and actual voiced dialogue. It's an aspect of these kinds of games I'm turned off by. I played over 50 hours of TERA recently on the least populated server in an attempt to isolate myself from anyone else who might be playing. There was once a time when I embraced and enjoyed the social features of an MMO and the idle chatter in these portions felt oh so familiar. These are fond memories mind you, but I experienced them with people whose names I hardly remember. I don't really like thinking about these sorts of things.\n\nThe third and final side of Cibele are the FMV cutscenes. Most of them are short, interstitial videos that bridge the gap between acts but there are a couple of longer scenes that add to the story. They do a good enough job of establishing the mood and vibe in the moments following and preceding the acts. The quality is a bit... poor but I think they're shot and framed rather well.\n\nAt this point I hope I've made it clear that I didn't have a great time with Cibele. Most of this negativity is from my own personal experiences and how I view them now. Obviously your mileage may vary for a lot of the content but even in the case of the things Cibele does that you can look at objectively I have a hard time justifying them as anything other than decent at best.\n\nDespite my distaste for it, I can recognize and appreciate the risks it takes. The autobiographical nature of the story is something that is not often seen in games. When it is, it's usually in games that are available for free and distributed by more personal means. The fact that Cibele is something you can buy with actual money on a rather large distribution platform with such high visibility fills me with a bit of hope. A hope that games of such a personal nature can reach an audience and experience some modicum of success and a hope that it will eventually inspire someone to create something greater. I don't like this game very much but I'm very glad it exists.","January 4","true","1.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The controls were terrible (clicking around Nina's desktop was painfully slow, and Cibele would always get stuck). The game in the game was really poorly done, you just click and wait and click and wait (and coupled with the painfully slow mouse movement, it just dragged on). And the story felt really stiff and forced. I really wouldn't recommend this game. I feel like the writer has an interesting story to tell, it just wasn't executed well and maybe a game isn't the best medium for this, a short movie would have been better.","December 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/408120/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1503 products in account","Cibele is a very unusual indie game that focuses on online relationships and bringing them to the real world.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nPlease note: I rarely put a warning like this into my reviews, but this is something that you have to know when reading my review: this is not a game for everyone. You can see many reviews on Steam with contradictory opinions. This game does not offer what you would expect from a normal video game. Before buying the game, do yourself a favour and decide if this is your cup of tea.\nWhat is happening in the game:You are a 19 year old girl who is playing a video game called Valtameri on a daily basis. One there, you are chatting with a guy that becomes attracted to you (and you to him). As you get more and more involved with him, you want to meet him in person and start pushing your real life friends away from you.\n\nPros:    Story and Voice Acting | Despite the ending (see Cons), I have to say that I enjoyed Cibele's story quite a lot! Of course, it doesn't have the greatest budget and a ton of skilled writers behind it, but it still touches one's heart for a short while. The voice acting is more convincing that some people say it is - when the other guy says he loves you, his voice is not what you would call the most confident, but, as you reveal in the third act, his voice actually has good reasons to be that way. I'm not sure all people understood the point of the game (as said before, this game is not for everyone).\nIn-game Game | This is another thing a lot of people misunderstood - the game your are playing in Cibele is not supposed to be the main thing in the whole gameplay. It's merely an environment where Nina and Blake are communicating and opening to each other. That thing with moving around and killing monsters is built in so you would actually do something while listening to the story. I mean, do you want to stare at the same screen for one hour while the story is unfolding? I don't think so.\nThe Soundtrack | The soundtrack is pretty nice as well, it's not very intrusive and it adds a nice layer to the whole gameplay. You can also buy it as a DLC here.\nGraphics | The desktop, the pictures, the Valtameri game, they all look super nice. Recorded footage looks nice as well.\nDepth of the Gameplay | This is one of the games that has "optional" content. In each one of the acts, there is a different desktop with different folders, documents, e-mails and pictures. In other words, if you're interested to learn more about Nina's life, you can find more content on the desktop.\nCons:    Abrupt Ending | At the end of the game when things start to unfold, there is a sudden and unexpected twist that is at the same time the end of the game. I was expecting something more emotional or at least conclusive.\nGameplay Time vs. Price | For a bit over one hour of gameplay, I cannot say that $9 is an appropriate price. If you really feel like this is your kind of game, go for it, otherwise put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale.\nIn-game Desktop Problems | I have encountered a strange bug a few times across the gameplay: some desktop icons didn't work. However, when I restarted the game, those icons were working again but some others were not. This won't affect your gameplay a lot, though.\nOS Compatibility and Steam Integration | There is no Linux/SteamOS support. This title is also missing Achievements and Trading Cards.\nThe final verdict:I can definitely recommend Cibele, but be very careful when buying it. As you can see from many negative reviews on Steam, this game does not offer a standard video game experience rather than a story with some additional gameplay. I had a nice time playing it, although it was pretty short. I recommend the developer to add some additional content, maybe in a form of commentary, wallpaper pack or something else.\nIf you're looking for a different kind of experience and think you might like this game, give it a shot!\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","November 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 43 of 84 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","43","84","0","0"

If this doesn't spells short, I don't know what does :)\n\nIn any case, I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy the game as I though I would. I though I would find an experience not unlike Digital A love Story[scoutshonour.com] or Emily is Away[emilyisaway.com]. both of these free games are about "young love" and feature a similar "first person view" of the main character's desktop. they emotionally resonated a lot with me and I though Cibele would do the same.\n\nI was wrong. I instantly found Ichi unlikable. VERY unlikable. And the main character didn't sit well with me either. Something in their quirks and behaviour just put me off for the entirety of the experience.\n\nI didn't sympathise with their views. I didn't care what happened to them. At first I was hopeful it was going somewhere but the ending is... Well, it doesn't deliver.\n\nI thoroughly believe the "inspired by a true story" part, because only real life could fall so flat and be so boring in the end. (Sorry for the harsh words but, that's really how I feel)\n\nThere's no need to comment on the "gameplay": it's very bad and tedious, but it's not the point of the game. I still would have preferred something a bit more enjoyable. Or shorter. Because clicking boring adversaries in boring environnements (the second boss looked very good, nice design, by the way) waiting for the hidden trigger that will make the plot advance and the characters talk again was... not a good experience.\n\nOne last thing : I rolled my eyes at the end. Who quote themselves at the end of a work of fiction ? That really stuck out as unnecessary and weakly done.\n\nAll in all it breaks my heart to give a bad review to the game (especially since it's, like, my second review ever) but it failed where at least two other games  succeeded most masterfully, and for free (Digital and Emily). That was the biggest let down. I didn't think it was possible to fail with such an emotional potential.","June 2","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, I received Cibele as part of the narrative Humble Bundle, so I feel like it was worth it whatever segment of the price went to it in that context.\n\nI did, however, enjoy the story, even if I found the acting a little lacking at times. I especially enjoyed the look and feel of the MMORPG! I'm not sure whether it was my computer or intentionally designed that way, but certain parts of the boss fights were laggy, and that definitely upped the realism of it. :'D\n\nI'm aware that the story is purely about Nina and her first love with a guy she meets online, but I would have loved a little more focus on the periphary characters and the relationships Nina had with them and how her relationship with Blake had affected that. You get an idea of what's happening, but I would have just liked more, you know? Plus I feel like the game could have used a follow-up act, but that might just be me.\n\nOverall, I don't have negative feelings about Cibele--I enjoyed my time experiencing it--but I'm not sure I can recommend it at the Steam retail price based on what the product is itself; I don't think there's £6 worth of pay-off here.","June 2","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The 'Fully interactive desktop' that the game description touts is, in actuality, nothing more than completely banal text documents which reveal almost to no information about anything relative to the story.

She plays the role of her 19-year-old-self in Cibele, a Steam game based on a true story that unfolds across three mediums: click-based gameplay, audio conversations, and video intermissions.\n\nThe game aims to relive the moments of a first love, sparked between Nina (who goes by the online name of Cibele) and another player named Ichi. Players will dive into Nina’s life at the time, exploring her computer files, old photos, and interacting with Ichi through an in-game MMORPG called Valtameri, which is loosely based on Final Fantasy Online.\n\nThe game jumps between clicking through an interactive computer, audio conversations during bouts of Valtameri, and real-life video cutscenes (which is where the game garners its mature recommendation). Cibele cycles between all three mediums repetitively as the story unfolds throughout three seperate acts, which span several months in 2009. The mesh of mediums doesn’t always work, however, and we were left feeling that Cibele could have been a better story hadn’t tried to cross streams between separate video only, audio only, and click-based content, which each come into focus at separate times.\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent that Cibele is much less of a game than it is an interactive film, and its worst parts are when it forces players to attempt the in-game MMORPG, Valtameri. As Cibele plays with Ichi, the characters are expected to go and defeat a bunch of grind-based enemies to lure out a final boss, with players following the same template over all three acts that Cibele brings to the table.\n\nCibele is what poets would call confessional, focused on dreadfully intimate revelations and discussing the kinds of truths that rarely come up in polite conversation. One of the first things you have the opportunity to do is look at Nina’s selfies. Some of them are meant for public consumption. Some of them are definitely not. The rest of the game is made up of equally private ephemera: late-night online conversations, chat logs, unfinished blog posts. Together, they paint a personal portrait of their creator, her sexuality, and some of her most dearly held formative experiences.\n\nOne of the reasons why confessional storytelling is so rare in games might be because of the way it puts a lie to one of our most commonly held assumptions about players and the characters they control. We generally imagine that, when you play as someone, you are becoming them—adventuring as Lara Croft, saving the human race as the Master Chief, etc., etc. Confessional narratives shatter that illusion with experiences so specific and so tied to their creator that the distance between the player and the character is always present. When we see Freeman’s pictures and hear her voice, her personhood is inescapable. You may occupy her world—role-playing as her in Valtameri, sitting in her chair at her computer—but you never become her. Instead, you exist in a between space, both inside and outside, not her but not separate, either.\n\nThis is a game about that drive to connect, to see others and yourself clearly. It’s an experiment in how a creator might put themselves into a work and make a game that speaks honestly about their real life to the people who play it.

I heard about it because Nina worked for KillScreen, one of the best gaming publications out there right now, in my opinion. The concept is fascinating, brilliant even: through voice-over, you hear the story of a 19 year old girl meeting and falling for a guy in her MMO collective. It's some kinda crappy Ragnarok-type clone, and the VASTLY interesting part is their voice-over.\n\nThe real problem is that the game that you are forced to play to advance the story honestly isn't a game at all. It's just hundreds, thousands, of meaningless clicks. There's no way to lose, no choices to make, no weapons to change out, no HP or MP meters to watch, no variation in enemies, no varariation in level design, no variation in "bosses." You're forced to watch the same repetitive animations over and over with absolutely no impact on the outcome, except if you stop you'll hear a voiceover of "Where'd you go?" "Over here.". The only real "game" here is in noticing the different app icons on your screen and clicking on them, because checking an email or a picture-chat usually triggers the next voice-over. But you have to wait for them. Long... waits.\n\nTthe voice-over, at least for the girl character, is really good. The guy's voiceover is kinda more questionable, but maybe on purpose. It serves well enough. I think there could be a point to this story, if I can just make it through. It certainly feels personal, almost like an elaborate journal entry brought to life.\n\nAs for the app notifications that pop up to fill out more context in the story, they're okay, but nothing all that interesting. Browsing around Nina's computer files also adds a bit of context, and I appreciate it, but knowing that the only way to advance the story is by playing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "game" at the heart of it devalues them somewhat.\n\nAfter you defeat the "boss" of each level (which is only triggered after voiceovers and is no different from any other enemy except it has a long life bar) you're treated to a short video segment, which are really quite lovely and feel authentic.\n\nI'm not 100% sure where the story is going, so I'm going to trudge through and get to the end... I hope. I've heard it's only about 2 hours, which would be FINE, except the actual "playing" is kind of torturous. I've only made it through three "levels" and I'm disheartened because I'm positive the next level will be EXACTLY the same.\n\nIt would be more tolerable if it didn't take soooo dang long to trudge through, or at least offered a sliver of customization.\n\nIf you're interested in this game, I would actually recommend the (free, I think) Emily is Away. That game is a little heavier on nostalgia, but far more intuitive and charming, and actually offers real choices to the player.\n\nReally, I think this would be amazing if there was a real game here at all. I hope to update this review after I complete it, and maybe I'll be changing my recommendation. But it's hard, especially after playing a game like Undertale which not only tells a great story and subverts its medium of JRPGs, it's extremely fun to play. That's what's lacking here. I feel like this could be edited down into a short film and be far more effective, since there isn't a single game-like decisions to make that I've seen so far.","December 31, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

She plays the role of her 19-year-old-self in Cibele, a Steam game based on a true story that unfolds across three mediums: click-based gameplay, audio conversations, and video intermissions.\n\nThe game aims to relive the moments of a first love, sparked between Nina (who goes by the online name of Cibele) and another player named Ichi. Players will dive into Nina’s life at the time, exploring her computer files, old photos, and interacting with Ichi through an in-game MMORPG called Valtameri, which is loosely based on Final Fantasy Online.\n\nThe game jumps between clicking through an interactive computer, audio conversations during bouts of Valtameri, and real-life video cutscenes (which is where the game garners its mature recommendation). Cibele cycles between all three mediums repetitively as the story unfolds throughout three seperate acts, which span several months in 2009. The mesh of mediums doesn’t always work, however, and we were left feeling that Cibele could have been a better story hadn’t tried to cross streams between separate video only, audio only, and click-based content, which each come into focus at separate times.\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent that Cibele is much less of a game than it is an interactive film, and its worst parts are when it forces players to attempt the in-game MMORPG, Valtameri. As Cibele plays with Ichi, the characters are expected to go and defeat a bunch of grind-based enemies to lure out a final boss, with players following the same template over all three acts that Cibele brings to the table.\n\nCibele is what poets would call confessional, focused on dreadfully intimate revelations and discussing the kinds of truths that rarely come up in polite conversation. One of the first things you have the opportunity to do is look at Nina’s selfies. Some of them are meant for public consumption. Some of them are definitely not. The rest of the game is made up of equally private ephemera: late-night online conversations, chat logs, unfinished blog posts. Together, they paint a personal portrait of their creator, her sexuality, and some of her most dearly held formative experiences.\n\nOne of the reasons why confessional storytelling is so rare in games might be because of the way it puts a lie to one of our most commonly held assumptions about players and the characters they control. We generally imagine that, when you play as someone, you are becoming them—adventuring as Lara Croft, saving the human race as the Master Chief, etc., etc. Confessional narratives shatter that illusion with experiences so specific and so tied to their creator that the distance between the player and the character is always present. When we see Freeman’s pictures and hear her voice, her personhood is inescapable. You may occupy her world—role-playing as her in Valtameri, sitting in her chair at her computer—but you never become her. Instead, you exist in a between space, both inside and outside, not her but not separate, either.\n\nThis is a game about that drive to connect, to see others and yourself clearly. It’s an experiment in how a creator might put themselves into a work and make a game that speaks honestly about their real life to the people who play it. Through Freeman’s relationship with Ichi, it also illustrates how the distance between people shapes the way they understand each other, and how collapsing that distance can be a profound risk. It’s the same risk that permeates a project like Cibele, both in the creation and the playing. In sharing so much, with a friend or a lover or an audience, you give up just as much control. What if they don’t like what they see?\n\nMost of you may whine about the ending of the game, like I did, I admit, that there's no punchline,its like the arc is missing and left unaddressed. It feels like someone yelled, "Cut!" too soon.And this has become my favourite part of this visual novel right after i slept on it.

Everything's confusing and the hitboxes for the folders and stuff are still a mystery to me. I still don't know how to open a file/folder. The pictures inside are just small and you can't even enlarge it, so they just mean nothing to you, seeing as there's no real context of the photo and they feel like a mess of pixels.\nIt's time to start the game. First of all, the game looks ugly as hell, seriously ugly. Cibele, the avatar is in an MMO dungeon, but the pathfinding sucks and the gameplay is just grindy and boring. The enemies don't attack you. At the same time your raid partner has a character that can fly over obstacles and will teleport in a way, so he'll appear in front of you. I would love doing that, but no, I can't. The game also runs like ♥♥♥♥. I had a solid 15fps the whole way through, even though it is simple and it looks horrible. It's just a freaking mess. The optimization is so bad in the game that they even pretend that you need 4GB of RAM, even though games with similar caliber will run with 512MB - 1GB of RAM. But, this one thinks it's a special game.\nThe video parts. They are ridiculous. At one point in the game *SPOILERS* ~there's a sex scene~. But it's awkward as ♥♥♥♥ to watch. They have no chemistry and the cameraman just pervs at the woman, you can even see his shadow. It's ♥♥♥♥ing awful is what it is. Also, I need to mention how many upskirt shots there are. It's just creepy.\nThe voice acting is ok on the guy's part (can't even remember the name, that's how bad it was), but Cibele sounds so fake and thanks to that all I can think is that she's a spoiled little daddy's girl that needs to be validated every other minute and how she feels like a manipulative cow. The guy is a better voice actor, but still sounds like a massive brat, while saying "You talked to your friends?! LAME!" and ♥♥♥♥ like that.\nAnd now, the story. If the gameplay wasn't there to spread the story, then it'd be a 30 minute short movie. It's a realistic situation and I saw myself in the story a fair few times. The problem is that it's obvious that they never bothered to make the game they wanted. Instead of a gradual build you have to just watch a few instances of them chatting and they go from *small spoilers* Who dat - ♥♥♥♥♥, u cute - Mmm, wanna fuq!?.\n\nI received the game in the Narrative HB. It's still not worth it. Just give this one away. Those 48 minutes could've been spent elsewhere. The reason why I'm so angry is because it had so much potential. It could've been endlessly better, but the dev just went full on lazy and decided to wrap it up.\n\nOverall\n3/10","June 3","false","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now, at first glance, that may seem to mean that I count myself lucky to own this game. No. No. I don't. I really don't. It means that I'm glad I didn't actually pay for this game. I prefer to think of it as paying $5 for Read Only Memories and getting some games as a bonus. Outside of that bonus, we have this lump of ♥♥♥♥. Humble Bundle never feels like charity to me. Owning this game does.\n\nMoving on from the mean-spirited preamble to the real details, the "game" took about 50 minutes to finish. That's not a very long time, but during that period I almost quit playing so I could erase it forever, from both my computer and my mind. Twice. The characters are terrible. One is a socially awkward idiot, the other a socially awkward jackass, and they identify themselves as such almost instantly. What draws these two characters together, you ask? I don't know, seemingly nothing? Maybe? But for better or worse, and for no reason, they are drawn together. Definitely for worse. You can tell after about 10 minutes, the game practically screams it at you. Moving on to the gameplay, there are parts where you can explore the girl, Nina's, computer desktop. It's an interesting concept, it lets you look through her photos, homework assigntments, emails, stuff like that. Kind of Analogue: A Hate Story-ish if Analogue: A Hate Story sucked. Her photos are nothing special, but it tries to make up for that in quantity. It may just be me, but I don't care to read the homework assignments of others. That leaves the emails, and those could be interesting, but since she doesn't seem to do anything other than do homework, ignore her real friends, and play that MMO with that guy (we'll call him Craig, because I don't remember his real name, not memorable enough, the only reason I got "Nina" was because it says it in the description of the game), there's not much content in her emails. There are parts where you "play" the MMO that they play together. I have "play" in quotes because all you do is click an enemy, watch your character attempt to walk over there for a while because of the terrible movement mechanics, watch them autohit the enemy about 15 times while the enemy just stands perfectly still doing nothing, then repeat about 30 times until you kill the final boss. All that "gameplay" while listening to Nina and Craig being awkward. Fun times *sarcastic tone*. The dialogue is all just terrible, half of it is just awkward laughing, the other half is made up of actual, albeit awkward, words. The game clunks along at a slow pace, trying to build an actual plot, but crashes to rock bottom at the end. It goes from climax to credits in about a minute, just so abrupt, it was pretty funny, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Not that you should buy this game. No, just look up a video of it on YouTube or something\n\nWhen it ended I was left with this "Where do I go from here?" feeling. I decided to go take a shower to get the dirty feeling of having played this game off my skin, uninstall the game, then hide it from my Steam library. In closing. No! Bad! Bad game!

Feel free to consider me biased. As the game’s official description on steam puts it, “Cibele is a game about love, sex, and the internet. You play as a 19 year old girl who has become close with a young man she met in an online game.” The game consists of 3 chapters, all of which alternate between the protagonist’s desktop, the MMO she plays, and, finally, the live action sequences.\n\nThe desktop part is a neat, albeit at times an uncomfortably voyeuristic experience. You get to browse through Nina’s blogs, e-mails, poems, and random notes. As someone who is fascinated by people’s rooms/apartments and what they tell about a person who lives there, learning about a person from the contents of their desktop felt equally as cool to me.\n\nThe MMO portion is a rather simple point and click ordeal. I’ve seen people criticise the blandness of the in-game MMO’s gameplay, but I feel that is kind of the point. Cibele definitely invoked some MMO-related nostalgia for me. I don’t remember grinding being that much fun (and there was a lot of grinding) back when I played WoW 5-10 years ago. So in order to make it more bearable I would alt tab and look at Wowhead, IM people, browse forums etc etc etc, all the while playing WoW. I feel like Cibele captured that feeling perfectly. It’s not necessarily about the game itself, it’s about everything that happens around it. The experience of being a part of something felt much more important than the experience of killing random skeletons.\n\nI was a little cautious about the live action scenes at first, due to the fact that Nina Freeman, who plays herself, is not a professional actor. But these parts never outstay their welcome either. All of them are very brief and to the point. Even the last live action portion of the game, which has much more weight to it than the previous two, is executed quite well and never feels out of place in the context of a game.\n\nCibele is not a game for everyone, but that should be obvious from the game’s description as well as its trailer. I think that Nina Freeman and her Star Maid Games have created a special little gem of a game, which I’m sure that I will come back to sooner or later.

I adored Nina, I could identify completely with her character and the motions she went through falling for someone she's never met. Ofcourse she felt real and tangible, from the cute anime fan art to the debating which selfie to send. People are far too quick to throw these things into the categories 'vain' and 'empty-headed' when in reality thats what being a teenager is all about.\n\nThe story itself was cute and well structured, but the ending fizzled out before it felt as though it had even began. It was dissapointing to not find any resolve or explanation, it made sense but it also didn't offer anything to truly think about.\n\nThe gameplay is a whole other story, the sections of browsing Nina's PC where fun and did help pad out the story but the tedious yet beautiful MMO sections where insufferable. There's nothing worse than just having to aimlessly click in order to push forward a story. I felt slightly cheated as the screenshots seemed to offer a level of interactivity that the actual game didn't actually have. Your character is also terrible at following paths as you mindlessly try and click to attack an onscreen monster.\n\nI wouldnt reccomend this game to anyone but I would love to see Nina's future projects and take onboard what people have said, there is a lot of potential!\n","December 15, 2015","false","0.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The 'game' sequences are just there to provide a context for the voice chat, so the effect is something like a biographical short film or a kinetic visual novel. There are a few minor UI issues (e.g. pathfinding in the MMO sequences) but overall it hangs together really well. I found the story really interesting because it was so alien to my experience as an MMO-hating dude rapidly approaching 40. The kids these days with their internet romance and their 'lol', I dunno!

I'm a big fan of projects like Gone Home, Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable and similar games. That being said, I think Cibele crosses the line past game and more into film or something else entirely.\n\nThere really is almost no gameplay to speak of here at all. The game is split between time file surfing on Nina's desktop and playing the online game with Ichi. Each time you play the game, you click on enemies which kills them and eventually, a boss comes. Rinse and repeat a few times and the boss dies and you move to the next act. Even this small amount of gameplay was frustrating as the character often couldn't make her way around corners and I'd have to maneuver her to find more enemies to click on. It's a small gripe but considering that it is literally the entire game, it stands out quite a bit.\n\nThat's really not the reason to come to this game though, anyway. The focus is really on the storyline, an online first love between Nina and Ichi. While I'm positive that this will resonate with some folks, it just didn't with me. To go more into detail would inevitably spoil the experience but if you're older than about 18, the story goes exactly how you'd expect with the actors providing decent, if not stellar, performances.\n\nIt's hard to say more about this game. It's easily completeable within two hours (my playthrough lasted 89 minutes) so if the premise sounds really interesting and you're looking for a short experience, maybe this will be for you. Based on my experience though, I just can't justify a recommendation to most players.","January 15","false","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I have to scratch my head as to whether there are other games that dive into relationships this well, other than visual novels or the unintentionally hilarious Facade. Much like A Beginner's Guide, it's like a playable mockumentary where you're in a game within a game and like Her Story, it uses live action FMV and a computer desktop as the aesthetic. While playing the in-fiction MMO is not exactly thrilling and quite repetitive (maybe that's the point!), juggling between texts, messages, diaries, while clicking on an enemy intermittently replicates the feel of being social while playing real MMOs. The relationship itself is believable, which is thanks to this being quite autobiographical on Nina Freeman's part, where what's real and what's made up for recreation purposes gives it that voyerustic intimate vibe. It's just an hour or so long, and it's quite bittersweet overall so left an impact on my mind since I finished it.","December 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Or maybe it\'s just not for me. It\'s almost literally a girl\'s journal in interactive form, detailing the time a guy lied and tried to use her for a one night stand. So she made a game about it. Not that it\'s a bad story, just an unremarkable one. Tragically common. Horrifyingly predictable. It\'s quite unfortunate that this story exists. But it\'s also nothing to get really worked up over, unless you are the protagonist. And we\'re kept from \"being\" the protagonist of this game. Our actions, our words, our replies, all predetermined. Which is fine, but it pushes us away from feeling like Nina is an avatar. Instead, I felt much more like a Voyer. Peering through the personal files and pictures of a girl who accidentally forgot to log out of her computer when stepping away. It gave me the feeling like I was gonna be cought snooping through the private messages and photos. But what it lacks and quality it makes up for in sincerity. The dialogue is a little \"too\" natural. Using words like \"u\'r hawt\" instead of anything that\'ll wind up written in an angsty teenager\'s quote under their photo in the yearbook. But this genuine dialogue also makes it difficult to look at the relationship as understandable. Instead, it makes us pitty Nina for the horrible mistake we know she\'s going to make. It makes me view her as weak or unintelligent. Like a lamb that needs to be protected. As a result, feminists will hate this game simply because it paints our female protagonist as a damsel who cannot protect or control herself but instead rellies on men to be her confidence. This makes it a little hard to watch. Another thing to feel guilty for.\n\nTL:DR\nGame is real, too real. No well thought out dialogue, just internet banter. Story is predictable and nothing special. I really wish I had better things to say about this game. I hope Nina remakes this game in several years after learning to write narrative and dialogue a little better.

This is a story about life, and life is boring. And this is really boring way of telling a story that isn\'t in any way interesting or larger than life and even makes it lesser than life.\n\n\"Multiple short films offer an intimate glimpse into Nina\'s life.\"\nNot really. What we get are incoherent glimpses of, well, nothing. My friends and I made more coherent short films in junior high, but we knew better than to share them with the world. If the glimpses we get are intimate, then most status updates on Facebook are TMI.\n\n\"A richly illustrated and scored game world to explore called Valtameri, with multiple maps.\"\nWow. Where to start...\nThe pink corral-like map is sort of logical when it comes to where you character can move. The ... artsy(?) map is just a hodgepodge of things you can and can not walk on. The lava level looks like it should be easy to move around on, but the collision detection is very off, making your character start to walk in a completely other direction than the one you clicked.\nThe character AI is so bad, and not so bad it is good, bud so it is good and then gets bad again. Your character get stuck against walls trying to walk in whichever direction the AI thinks it should move to reach the enemy you clicked. The \"bosses\" oftenly goes out of reach, but they don\'t leave the screen until their health is dropped enough, so you can move to another place in the map and fight them there. Or you could just let Ichi fight them, as his character can walk through walls, and if he goes off screen he will re-appear from the other direction.\n\n\"A fully interactive desktop that changes over the course of the game, offering a glimpse into Nina\'s life outside of her online game.\"\nAs stated earlier this isn\'t made larger than life, it\'s life made more boring. How much does your desktop change over the course of a few months? Not much, I guess. And the changes between the \"acts\" are few, and they don\'t contribute to anything. You learn that Nina has virtually no life outside the game, and whatever info we get is confused and unimportant if not distracting from the \"story\".\n\nIf you want a better thing to do, then go to YouTube and watch the screaming goat version of the Game of Thrones theme.

If your the kind of player that doesn't like dig in don't play it. Cibele's acting is amateur but it's refreshing than the mainstream acting we see. For me the acting was more human than most movies that comes out these days. I could've done without some of the "sexy" pictures. Even if the actress looks pretty good it's kinda akward if someone walks in your room while you are watching some of the acting. So I would recommand you play this game alone.

The three dimensions we are all used to in gaming are transcended by this rarely accessed 4th dimension, something superphysical which touches us on a plane that cannot be quantified or examined fully through physical means.\n\nSo I'm clicking around and lo and behold I learn about Cibele in 4 dimensions:\n1: Cibele is hot. The pink hair and curves are righteous, shes bad. She plays video games, writes poetry, posesses a beautiful voice full of soul. Nina Freeman is simply beautiful, inside and out.\n2: Cibele is an especially bright and expressive member of her generation.\n3: Cibele has white people/first world problems. Basically her life is going so smoothly, she kind of has to insert sticks into the spokes of her tires in order to give it some texture and meaning.\n4: Like a lot of incredible women, Cibele's got a pet turd in her life: Ichi, this mildew ridden lump of a token male love interest.\n\nIts by far the best point and click adventure/storytelling game I have played in a long time. I also enjoyed Emily is Away, a similar game in a similar vein but the production values of Cibele blow it away. And to be fair, compared to the production values of say.... GTA V, Cibele is a pissant minigame played on Michael's iFruit.\n\nWhat I don't like about Cibele:\n1: Super short, I wish it lasted longer because I enjoyed playing this game. Please expand upon the concept and release Manic Pixie Dreamgirl Simulator 2017. However, I basically robbed the devs by acquiring this through Humble Bundle so if you get this on Humble Bundle you just made a very rewarding purchase. As much as I enjoy this game I couldn't really recommend spending more than $5 to buy this game. I am a frugal man, not some fat cat and I didn't acquire my current fortune of many lentils by spending $10 on games that only offer 1-2 hours of entertainment value.\n\n2: You spend most of your time in a "fake game within a game" but its kind of like a real game except it has incredibly shallow gameplay because its just a vehicle for carrying the story. There is a fake MMORPG section that you have to play to advance the game which offers gameplay so one dimensional and bug ridden that it does end up detracting from the over all polish and execution of the project. It's tolerable to get to the next bits of story and the little game IMS are a nice storytelling device.\n\n3: The ending feels rushed. There is a slow build most of the game and you get used to the subtleties but the end of the game doesn't match that flow and it's a bit jarring and clumsy kind of like the acting of Nina Freeman's boyfriend "Ichi". (Yeah thats a passive aggresive diss at the designers boyfriend who probably has never been ready for Nina's jelly).\n\n4: I didn't get to see Nina Freeman's boobs outside of their fabric prisons. I'll admit that during the long third "MMORPG Session" in fake game loserville, the only thing that kept me clicking forward through the third fake bosses giant life bar was the thought of cool game designing ideal woman nipples. Though she is generous, she doesn't give away the farm. Probably smart of her.\n\nI played this game for about an hour or so the first night after purchasing it. It got late and I needed to get to sleep to go to work but I didnt want to lose the feeling of the game so I just switched my monitor off and went to bed. Many hours later I come home from work and light up a joint and switch on my monitor to maybe play some Rocket League. My normal Rain Meter interface and Frank Miller's Wolverine covered wallpaper does not appear but there is a strange linux distro and a fanknockoff sailor moon background. I reach around to the back of my computer to check for a USB running a live OS. My cannabis is very potent and so is this games attention to detail so it took me about 30 seconds of noggin scratchins to alt tab and remember that I had purchased a manic pixie dream girl simulator the night before and left it running for most of a day. I immediately sat down and devoured the rest of Cibeles poignant four dimensional gameplay.\n\nStar Maid, make more games.","June 2","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/408120/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","308 products in account","Cibele is a hard game to describe and a harder one to review or recommend. It's not so much of a game than an interactive narrative experience. If you're looking for something like a role-playing game or a dating sim, you're going to be disappointed. If anything, this is more like an indie drama film with buttons. I guess the best way to understand it is to first understand where the developer is coming from. Nina Freeman is known mostly for making autobiographical vignette games. She's more focused on painting a portrait of the characters she portrays than a traditional "gaming" experience.\n\nThe game is about Nina, a college student who spends most of her time online playing an MMO called Valtameri. She goes on runs with her friend Blake, who goes by "Ichi" online. Their avatars (who adorably look like Samus from Metroid and Pearl from Steven Universe) grind against mobs until they defeat the boss of each map. During the experience, however, you are given an extremely intimate look into her life. You're allowed to browse her computer as she would, looking through her messages and personal photos. While you're online, you're treated to long voice chats with Blake, and you get to watch how their relationship develops.\n\nIt's really easy to see why this game has a hard time finding its audience. The "gameplay" is extremely limited; you don't really have a choice in any of the interaction you have with Blake. You kind of just watch and wait to see what happens. There isn't even really combat (maybe this is a nod to how boring MMOs can be). Clicking on an enemy auto-attacks it until it dies. The rest of the time, you're kind of just waiting for message replies to move the plot forward.\n\nI think most of the people who've played this game feel like she's taking a stance on what love is/should be. I've read many comments on how "it's her fault for trusting him" or that "she's stupid for falling in love" and other similar sentiments. I've even seen ideas that she's spreading some "Social Justice Warrior" or "feminist" propaganda, but I really doubt that's the idea here. I think this is just exactly what it shows on the surface: it's an honest retelling of Nina's first love and heartbreak. That's it. There's no heroes or villains, it's just two awkward people who've never been in relationships and have a go at it.\n\nIf I were to choose one thing I love about the game, it's the aesthetic design choices. Everything is drawn incredibly cute, and the photos and poems shared feel deeply personal. It's almost perverse how closely you're able to observe Nina's life, and honestly, it kind of made me feel uncomfortable, as if I was spying on her. The thing I hate most about it, though, is that it's both short and long. The entire playthrough was less than an hour, but felt tedious and slow-paced. There's not much to distract you while you're waiting for Nina and Blake's story to develop. Most of their performances are played through audio, so you're not getting much visual feedback other than clicking on little monsters or checking her messages. I doubt many people will want to play it more than once. It's a consumable experience that's heartfelt, but can't leave more of a lasting impression than a movie can. If you like it when games can be replayable over and over again, I'm not sure you'll get that kind of vibe from this.\n\nHonestly, though, I can't say that I don't like it. I can connect to it, and I can see why both of them made the kind of choices they did. I was an awkward guy growing up in high school, and most of the romantic interactions I had with other girls was through talking over the phone or online. I've made some of the same mistakes they did, and I don't think there's anything wrong with it. If you think she's trying to make herself look like a "special snowflake" or that she's "pretentious" or some other weird judgment, you're probably thinking too hard. She's just telling stories.\n\nTL; DR: it's not a game.","June 3","true","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When you're buying a narrative driven game, "game" is just a word to describe the interacions that connect your experience with the story the developer is trying to tell you. That piece of knowledge spares you from dissapointment and also helps you make the right choice.\n\nThere's no playing here. It's like living (spying) someone else's life for a couple of hours. You get to check Nina's computer, her mails and photos. You can also read her poems and check her website backups, her posts... All of that helps you understand this 19 year old girl. Then you click on the game's icon and click around making her avatar play the game as you get deeper in her story. Reading and replying her PM's in the game and checking what she's into as each chapter advances.\n\nThe story is as good as real life is. There's no romantic twist in real life, we're not playing a "Love Actually" game here, just teenage love at ii's highest. If you're playing Cibele right there are a lot of feelings involved, you should be able to get past pretty pictures and funny chatlogs.\n\nIt's also very short and it ends kind of abrutly. But hey! that's also how it really happened so, why lie about it when you make a game about a real life event?\n\nI liked it and love the genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nesseggman/recommended/408120/","nesseggman","Marchioness of Mustache","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nesseggman/","124 products in account","This is a linear visual novel in which you do not make choices that affect the story. It\'s simply a watch-until-the-end type of game. If you don\'t like that kind of game, or you\'re preoccupied about whether that fits your definition of \"game\" to enjoy the experience, this game is not for you.\n\nThis game doesn\'t do anything that I haven\'t seen done in other games. I like the use of live-action film being inserted; it\'s something that developers have stayed away from for a long time, but it\'s nice to see people trying it again. But live-action film games used to be a pretty big thing. And games with a \"look around on a computer\" theme are hardly new. So this isn\'t particularly an innovative game.\n\nBut it does feel like a unique experience. This game is about immersing you in the feeling of a young woman and her coming-of-age tale of first love. Nina is a nerd who feels a bit safer in the computer world, and seems to meet someone similar, and it evolves from there. Everything feels a little awkward, and a little forced -- but if you\'ve ever been in this situation, that\'s exactly how it is. I\'ve heard people actually communicate very much like the characters in the story.\n\nThe story is mostly discovered in a few different ways -- each chapter is broken into a few segments. You get a short film with live actors. You get a session of interacting with Nina\'s computer (probably most is optional -- I snooped as much as I could and ended with 75 minutes total game time btw) in which you can open her files and folders and look at her photos, read her poetry and blog posts, etc. Then you play in the MMO where most of the story takes place through listening to voice chat while you hack away at monsters. The \"gameplay\" in the MMO is just tediously clicking on mosnters and watching them die, all the while doing more important things like checking your private messages, emails, some kind of instagram-like app, and of course, listening to the voice chat. Pretty much like a real MMO.\n\nOverall, the story was predictable and generic. I pretty much guessed the entire story from the beginning (and I hadn\'t read any reviews, just watched part of the trailer before buying the Humble Bundle) and I\'m typically horrible at guessing even the most cliche stories. But I think rather than telling a unique story, this game was about feeling, and I think that\'s where it did well.\n\nThrough most of the game, I felt a little nervous and awkward and embarrassed. Not because the game was bad but because I honestly think that was the way I was supposed to feel playing the game. If you\'ve ever been in this situation like the characters in the game, that\'s exactly how it feels. Even though I thought Ichi was ugly and annoying, I felt somehow excited for Nina to get closer to him and see if she had any nude photos of him on her computer at the beginning of each chapter.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the game was the ending, and I think that\'s what especially ruins the game for  most people even if they were okay with it for most of the time. The ending felt very rushed and sudden. I mean, there wasn\'t much else left to even happen, so I can\'t really say how to improve it, but I felt like after all of the build-up, I didn\'t get a chance to really \'feel\' the ending because it happened too fast and without enough feeling and description involved.\n\nOverall, I think the game was a good effort with a critical flaw in the awkwardness of the ending. Other than that, the game accomplished what it was trying to do pretty well, and I thought it was well put together. The characters were believable to me, and Nina\'s old blogs looked pretty much exactly like mine from when I was in high school, too. And I was cringing at hers the same way I cringe at mine looking back. I think that\'s the intended experience here. Overall, these first brushes with love are awkward, cringe-inducing moments to think back on, but at the same time, you feel a strange fondness for them and still recognize the way they moved you and made you feel. I think this game captures the early half of that, and because I\'m easily moved, somewhat the latter part, but I think most people won\'t feel nearly as emotional or attached the characters as me.\n\nIt\'s hard to really recommend this game for a $9 price tag. Considering the effort the developer put into it, I understand the price tag. But as a consumer, you can get so much more value from many other games for less than $9. It\'s a bit of a shame, really. I think if you can get it for less, definitely go for it and try it out, especially if you like linear visual novels and raw slice-of-life type stuff that\'s more about sharing feelings than it is about telling a never-happens-in-real-life story.\n\nI wish I could choose a medium rating for the game. I think that this game doesn\'t deserve a thumbs down, but I think for $9 for a short game with a bad ending, it\'s hard to justify a thumbs up, too. Hopefully you will read the review and decide for yourself, rather than going by the thumb, and I\'ll give it a \"yes\" because I think the game deserves praise for its effort at least.","June 1","true","1.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Zing!\n\nCibele is a really short game (it took me right around 1h to finish it) about online relationships of its author. Narrative was also the mane focus for the developers, because the actual gameplay is really minimalistic and clunky, which technically is a bad thing but at the same time isn't a big deal since you only should be getting this if it's narrative seams interesting to you.\n\nI think it's also important to note that the story isn't by no means revolutionary or the best thing that has ever happened to gaming.

It ends very quickly - I understand that the story is based on true life events that happen to the main charecter Nina but, when you create something as a book, movie or a game, you have to embeleshment a little bit you know? I feel like the hole story wasn't properly explored and that's a shame because I trully belive that this game could be something really cool and unique if they tried to explore more the main story and put some thought into, like awesome artwork and a great soundtrack (I missed a tune when exploring desktop, that silence with just the clicking noises was kinda annoying).\n\nThe mmo they were playing is really BORING, oh my god, so boring and random... Most of the time you just read messages, and thats ok, I understand thats why that scene exists, it's part of the story  and it's to progress the narrative, it completes the hole story between the two, but I would apappreciate if it was just a looping video or something playing in the background while the player (me) is reading the messages. If it's supposed to actually play or interact with the actual game they are playing, once again, this should be properly explored, like the sensitivity of the mouse was really annoying too, too slow and got into my nerves I must say.\n\nDespite all that, I think I enjoyed play it but It's not worth 10$, I bought it in a bundle with 2 more games for 1$ and that's worth it, so if you find a bundle or smt like that go for it and give it a try!","June 3","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I do not recommend this game. On a chart of:\nWould not recommend\nRecommend with caution\nMight Recommend\nPlay it!\n\nI will state my points in two folds. One of the common people and one for the developers. If they care that is.\n\nFor the common folks. I got this through Humble bundle which are usually a great steal. That being said, I hate to be rude to developers but this game is not worth the amount they ask for. Allow me to expand upon this. 1.5 - 2 hours of "gameplay" is really just few clicks here and there with a well illustrated ♥♥♥♥♥♥meplay with very boring mechanics. There is lack of decision-making and most just a linear story. Yes I am aware most games possess this trait as well yet most games I have experienced often provide more then just a click and kill mechanic as well more indepth system that keeps you going. This game does not. If this had options to choose particular paths and had branching endings. I would reconsider stating the cost being worth it or not. Music was sub-par but not bad that one couldn't appreciate it.\n\nFor the developer. Please reconsider your approach to this concept of a game. This "game" barks to me as a proof of concept. While I felt like this was more of a PSA type of message. I wish the contents of the game didn't make me want to cringe in the inside. The male lead and the way he talked to the female lead. Ugh. Just utter disgust I felt inside. If this was your intention. Good job. You got a male player to feel what a female player might experience but dear lord. I literally shouted " NO sweetheart, stop thinking with your boobs!!"\nThe characters/leads were by no means interesting in any shape or form. While I understood that they were both "antisocial" or just awkward in general. They had nothing interesting that kept me wanting to relate to or immerse as. I'm sorry. But games for me for the most part, should be like many medium. It should tell me a compelling story, immersive world for me to explore in or picture in my head, and characters that I could love or hate. Here I just felt utter disappointment of lack of dimension of these characters besides how creepy the male lead made me feel.\n\nFor you developers, I wish you best of luck on your future projects.

I think there were opportunities to make it longer, fill in some of the story, especially near the end.  Of course, the feeling I had at the abrupt ending of the game is probably apropos to the way a young person in a relationship might feel at the sudden end of it; especially if the end wasn't mutual.\n\nWhat did I like about the game?  The atmosphere, the music.  I enjoyed reading the poetry and viewing the pictures.  I really enjoyed the back-story.  Of course, it made me realize that I'm easily old enough to be her father, so that was weird.  "Stay away from my daughter!"  So yeah, now I feel old.\n\nI played World of Warcraft for awhile, and the game-within-the-game in Cibele had the same "what the heck am I really doing here?" and "I'm paying WoW to waste hours of my time doing this over and over again?"  Like, the monsters get more challenging, you level up, nothing really changes.  At least Cibele, the game, had some depth to it. It was not just running around killing monsters.\n\nThe music was atmospheric, and I enjoyed the treatment of the various videos.  I couldn't tell if they had intentionally ran them through different lighting/filters to illicit different moods, or if the person shooting was an amateur, but the game is supposed to have an "amateur" feel to it.  Selfies, meeting for the first time, trying to keep on top of writing your blog, having friends upset with you for ignoring them and drafts of college papers.  None of this is professional.  But I don't think it's supposed to be.\n\nI liked how things swapped back and forth, and there was a good balance between interactive pieces like the game-within-a-game and the desktop, and the non-interactive "cut scene" videos.\n\nOverall, if I could say one thing about this game is that, even with me clicking on and responding to everything in the game - taking my time and exploring, it took me precisely 180 minutes (on the clock) to complete from start to finish. That's a short game.\n\nFor what I spent on the game - a little over $10 - I feel like maybe two and a half hours might have been worth it if...\n\n1) The game had achievements.  I'm an acheivement nut.  I prefer games that give them to me, even if I don't have to really do much to earn them. I think there would be a few places where you could earn them, though:\n\n* Just for buying/starting the game\n* Clicking 100/500/1000 times in the game-within-a-game\n* Making it all the way to the end\n* Clicking all the available files on the "computer"\n* Reading and/or responding to every incoming message\n\n2) I half expected the game to be longer. Like, maybe twice as long?  I did not feel closure at the end, but, as mentioned earlier, maybe I wasn't supposed to feel any?  Maybe a sequel, or an update to the existing game?  It's art, I know.  It is what it is, and maybe this is the way the game needs to end.  I can just make up an ending in my head anyway. Right?  Can't we all?\n\n3) I wanted to punch the guy at the end.  I'd already clicked a bunch in the game, why not add an arcade element to the end?  A cartoony version of his "ghost dude" face, "click to punch" until you get a KO.

That is clearly not enough for a whole lot of people, and I think it's a bit of a shame that people would be so critical of a smaller and more personal project where the game's creator is willing to (mostly) bare herself physically and emotionally to explore a space a lot of people who've spent lots of time meeting others through the internet and games probably ought to find resonant...

The details of that relationship aren't worth repeating here, but I will say this - we eventually decided to meet, and shortly thereafter everything came apart. We never spoke again.\n\nMaybe it's the curse of being an indoors kid, but I feel like a lot of my friends have had similar experiences. We grew up with helicopter parents and 24 hours scare news, surrounded by a world that seemed safer behind the murky shield of MySpace profile formatting and avatar vanity items. We weren't normal. We weren't cool. We lived small lives that were always under threat of attack from those who played sports or dated - hallmarks of an unnatainable normalcy that haunted us like 17th century poltergeists. We weren't and couldn't be like anyone else. And it hurt.\n\nThen you meet someone online. Someone like you. They play all the same games and watch all the same anime and get all the same references and for the first time you feel something that just begins to resemble that contentment you never really had. The game doesn't even matter. WoW, Gaia, FFO, Neopets - whatever it was you were probably good at it and never really sweated the encounters (if there were any). You weren't really even there for the game. You were there for the people, eventually the person. Maybe you even reached out. Maybe you decided that, if you only met, you could fill that gnawing emptiness with love. That you wouldn't be alone.\n\nBut we were young. We hurt each other because we didn't know we could. In the end the the crippling awkwardness and failure of those relationships will color our outlooks for the rest of our lives, because they meant so much more than we ever believed possible. The figures and screen names will fade with time, ghosts in an infernal machine.\n\nThat is the story of Cibele. A girl, a boy, the lives they lead and the game they play. It was me. It was Kat. It was everyone who ever stared into a computer screen and believed that love was some untamable primordia that really could conquer all, only to be crushed and left to learn from the things they had said and done. Played out through short film, a mini-RPG and teenage detritus, it is everything we used to be, and everything we are.\n\nAnd it will break your god damn heart.","November 3, 2015","true","0.9"," 70 of 142 people (49%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","49","70","142","7","3"

Too many emotions as well as personal things that, if it was my computer, I'd never want anyone to see.

That being said though, I liked it quite a bit.Its quite short (took me less than an hour to complete) and its inner game gameplay consists of clicking something and waiting.  However, the outside go game gameplay (that sounds weird but stick with me) in exploring Nina's desktop and looking at her life through her own eyes is an incredibly immersive and rewarding experience. Even smaller details, such as hearing the sound of Nina's mouse clicking when you click the mouse immerses you as her. I also have to give major props to Nina for putting her body so out there, as I can imagine the backlash she might receive for it. Another thing i have to commend is the dialogue and general VO. Its not the best or most hollywood-esque sounding lines in a game, far from that in fact. As someone with a long distance girlfriend, it was incredible to see how naturally and closely it resembled my own relationship, at least at the begginnig. It feels like two akward people falling in love while playing a game, as opposed to two actors reading lines. In that sense its more a Silent Hill 2 style of voice acting, minus the creepiness, as opposed to an Until Dawn approach. So I do like this game, but I know fully its not for everyone.

It's only £5 so not much to lose. Having played it, I don't feel it is worth the price. I want to like it because i've wanted FMV and Choice games to be successful since I played Sewer Shark on the Mega CD! I have played Emily is Away and found that to be excellent, but this is basically just a short film with a very frustrating 'game' played whilst you're talking. I understand the concept is they meet playing games, but why'd it have to be so very annoying? I think people in their teens and early twenties may appreciate the story more. When you turn 30 you forget all the mushy stuff and instead worry about pensions and mortgages. Maybe a version about transfering credit card balances and changing house insurance might be more suited to me.\n\nSo, If you're under 20, smile at kitten videos and don't remember MTV when it used to play Music AND this game drops below the price of a film rental (£2.99) then give it a go. It'll take you little more than an hour to complete and most of that will be spent playing the worst game ever (the game within this game - I cannot describe how awful it is). I find the script corny, but i'm thirty-six and therefore have no idea how the youth of today speak, maybe it's shockingly accurate. I just don't know. Emily is away is cool though. It's similar in a sense and it is free and the point of download. If you like it you can donate. So, yeah, go play Emily is away because its free and better. Play Cibele if you're under 20 - I don't understand the adult rating on this game - spend lots of time on Tumblr and want some video and talking in your game.","November 6, 2015","false","1.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

I figured out what would happen almost immediately, but when we eventually got to that point the game just... ends there.\n\nBecause of that, the story leaves me feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied - which I suppose is exactly the point, though it would have been nice to see a little more of what happened next, or even more detail as to what was going on in the timeline of the game itself, as connections are made and friendships become more intimate with very little being given to us between scenes to show it, even in the desktop sections.\n\nThe actual 'game' sections were very tedious to be honest and left me feeling cold.  The voice acting in them was enjoyable (at least for Nina, I'm pretty sure that Ichi wasn't meant to sound as creepy as he did) but even with the auto-attack mechanic the MMO-feel was lacking - the in-game messaging system being more of a 'click if you want' than adding anything beyond one or two sentences and irrelevant to the story.\n\nThe real meat in my opinion was in Nina's desktop sections and the cutscenes, which felt both intimate and disturbingly voyeuristic - it would have been nice if these sections had been expanded a bit to show off more of Nina's life so we could get to know her better as a person rather than just a body.\n\nUltimately I can't say that Cibele is a bad game, but I wouldn't call it a good one either.  It has some excellent moments that really get you to identify with Nina, but they are fleeting and never given the depth I wanted.\n\nIf you want an extremely short (the developers say 1.5 to 2 hours, but I finished it in just under 1 - and I took my time) visual novel where you just let things play out without having any decisions to make, you'll probably enjoy this.  If you want an in-depth game or something with choices, this isn't for you.\n\nI'm all for mature themes and Cibele gives it a good go, but there's not enough depth in the game to have Nina's insecurity and desires come through beyond a few moments (but when they do, they work well).\n\nSaying all that however, I give this a positive rating because games like this deserve to be seen and I want more of them to exist. Without support for these early attempts, we won't get the ones that come after, and I look forward to what Nina Freeman and Star Maid Games do next.\n\nUnfortunately I suspect that most people will be playing this for the scenes of Nina in her underwear.","November 23, 2015","true","1.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

At the same time that would be unfair given that it was a small budget/indie "artsy" game thats probably the first to tell the story and provide the experience of an actual online relationship forming and the awkward transition into reality that may or may not live up to expectations. For anyone that's been through this (I have) it will be a sentimental trip and hopefully not a painful one. The awkwardness of it all had me screaming "oh ffs is just so hard to admit you like each other?" haha\n\nAnyway.. the weakest part of it is the game within a game as other reviews have said. It is still ultimately a "symbolic representation" of MMO grinding and it's helpful to see it as that rather than a represnetation of the game they're actually supposed to be playing that got them so hooked. In that respect it is hard to envision anyone actually wanting to play it much less spend large portions of their life in there.\n\nAnyway, yes I recommend the game but more as a slightly more interactive visual novel than usual and overall I'm glad it was made. I got the game as a bundle but wouldn't have regretted spending anything less than $5 on it","June 2","true","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Clagnaught/recommended/408120/","Clagnaught","Clagnaught","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Clagnaught/","163 products in account","Cibele's strength is how it puts you in the protagonist's shoes through the game's desktop interface and its game within a game aspects. There are a few short FMV cutscenes which set the real world setting and tone (like showing Nina sitting in front of her computer, framing the game around the idea you are playing as the girl playing the game on her computer). For the bulk of the game, you interact with Nina's desktop and play a fictional MMORPG. You can browse old photos of Nina, look at her drawings, and read through her blogs, poems, chatlogs, and emails. In the actual MMORPG, you move an avatar around the screen (you don't actually cast spells or attack; this is done automatically), chat with your online friends, and listen to conversations between Nina and Blake. The core of the story, and the heart of Cibele overall, is the dynamic between Nina and Blake, two awkward people who end up having a relationship through an MMO.\n\nThere are some rough spots around the edges, like some of the FMV could have been shot a little better and the game Nina plays could have been more interesting, or at least easier to navigate the avatar around the game world (even though playing the game within the game isn't really the point of Cibele). That said, I really enjoyed the overall experience. Cibele feels like a passion project about a very specific type of experience. It isn't an elaborate or complex game. Instead Cibele is more focused about throwing itself out there. It's about capturing the intimacy of Nina's story.\n\nThe framing device, the pieces of information scattered throughout Nina's computer, and the intimate nature of Blake and Nina's conversations come together to tell a unique story that is enhanced by how the game is presented.","December 14, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My own gaming and online experiences are very different from the ones in Cibele, but I think that the abrupt end, the fact that it wasn't completely fleshed out and straightforward, and the discomfort of it mirror what a lot of my own experiences flirting online with friends and trying to navigate someone else's true feelings in a limited amount of time and in constrained environments. I do want more, and that's a good thing.

The reviews I read stated around 2 hours of playtime, it was around 90 minutes for me. If that's a deal breaker, read no further.\n\nThis is more akin to watching a slice-of-life film than playing a game. There are some diablo-esque combat in it, but it's mostly there to keep your fingers busy while waiting for chat replies. If you were a fan of Gone Home, this will probably appeal to you as well.\n\nThe story itself was enjoyable. You get several glimpses into the life of a young female gamer, with all the complexities and layers that entails. This isn't about a plot heavy story, its about story telling for the sake of illumination. We are shown scenes from this girls life, and then, abruptly, it is over. There is a short note at the end, but beyond that the viewer is left to draw their own conclusions.\n\nWhile I found this highly enjoyable, I definately felt there were several areas that were lacking (warning, possible spoilers ahead). First of all, I felt like not enough time was spent dealing with the character of Blake. Here is a person who is clearly suffering from some deep emotional and psychological issues, yet, it is mostly used to prolong the tension and buildup to the story's romantic plot. There was so much more room to develop this further, to really look into what effect this has had on the young man, and those around him.\n\nSecond, I felt like the music was...somehow off. It is overly dark and dramatic, and felt like it would be more at home in a suspensful horror film. I kept waiting for the plot twist to turn out that one of the two characters was a serial killer or something, but when the story ends on a quiet note, it feels very out of place.. It's certainly not a deal breaker, but I feel like the game could have been better served with something more mellow.","December 9, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't expect doing much, it is more of Visual novel kind.\nIt's damn short, I didn't felt it as a bad ending but I was really surprised it was so suddenly done.\n\nPS: Kinda fappable\n","December 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

VICE, Wired, and a few other blogs I follow had all given it glowing reviews. As a woman who loves video games, I get very excited when I see games written by women, and I gladly shelled out the eight-something dollars for the game. However, after playing it, I was left rather unimpressed. I got through the game in just under an hour, which was disappointing. (Though, perhaps I didn't spend enough time clicking around on Nina's 'desktop.) The premise of the game is interesting. Nina, a college student, falls in love with another player on an MMORPG, named Ichi. The game follows the romance and its eventual demise. I liked this premise, and how she decided to go about presenting it- it reminded me of myself when I was younger, with the selfies, anime wallpaper, and chat logs of my friends. The user can click around Nina's 'desktop', read her emails and look at her pictures- some of which are intimate tokens of affection. This is interesting but there is not enough information to give us backstory on Nina or Ichi, but is a nice touch. The game itself, where Nina + Ichi have their voice chats, is beautiful. The landscapes are lush and the textures are very pleasant. The 'combat' is simple- you just click on a monster to allow Nina's characeter to attack it. While aesthetically it's great, the story just isn't there- which is primiarly while I played it. It was a good, if light, story of first love. The music is beautiful and so is the art. I felt like this was a good attempt at a story game and I do apprecaite it, so if you can buy it I recommend you do. It's entertaining and visually, very nice- but you can skip it.","December 6, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some people in this world are jerks and you never get an explanation. It's just a crappy thing that happened but oh well, that's life. Try not to so naive next time. In a way I think the game got that message across.\n\nI was actually surprised that I was affected by the ending because I felt the main character, regardless of I judged her decisions. Maybe because I remember being stupid and cringey at that age when it came to guys. I feel this game achieved something no other game has before for me, which was let me slip into someone else's place to effictively. I felt I was seeing things no other person should see, that I was in this situation with Ichi, that I was having my heart messed around with. It was weird, but I'm glad I played it.

I would recommend it if you want to just be part of a story but I wouldn't read to many reviews on it because part of what makes the game good, much like a crush, is not knowing how it will pan out.\n\nPROS:\nI enjoyed being able to browse the desktop and read/reply to messages, it was just a fun design and one I really want to see more of this.\nNice addition of real life scenes along with game-play\nJust cool idea as a whole\n\nCONS:\nCould have expanded on the ending\nHissi level was way to difficult to navigate around and felt badly done","June 4","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Definitely, with a few asterisks. Even when there were a few times I was unsure what to do, I still finished the game in an hour. It was an enjoyable hour though. The story is well-told, though there are a few things that try to make the experience more rich that lead nowhere. It also has little in the way of actual "gameplay" though the entire experience is very interactive. If you enjoy short, extremely narrative focused games with a quite relaxed atmosphere and very realistic story, you'd probably enjoy Cibele. If you're looking for something with a lot of action and 30 hours of gameplay, you won't find it here.\n\n6.5/10","June 4","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of my favourite games are point and click adventure games, I like the idea of an interactive story with no real choices. I'm also a big fan of short games. I like playing through a game in one sitting, or a few more as well. I like a short well pollished story that I can enjoy once and then move onto the next thing. I don't like wasting my time.\n\nAll that in mind, this game ends way too early, and the gameplay get sin the way on enjoying the story. It woudl be better if there was either much less gameplay, or much better gameplay that din't feel liek a chore you had to get through to get to the next bit of plot. The plot really isn't worth it by the way. I got this in the Humble Narative Bundle, I was excited that it was short and I could just run through it but I think I would have prefered not to have played it. For anyone wondering whetehr there are twists in the story, or if it has a message it doesn't at all. It says based ona true story because this stuff literally happens all the time. The plot can literally be summed up in a couple of lines; a guy and a girl meet on an online game, they start swapping pictures and chatting, he says he doesn't want to date, they meet up and sleep together, he says he doesn't love her . How is that a worthwhile story to tell. If I paid any more than  I did for it I would be upset.","June 5","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game sounded like a good idea on paper, but in execution, fails miserably. Here is my review for Cibele by Nina Freeman.\nStory:\nNina Freeman meets someone named Blake online on an MMO, and over time, the two become closer and closer together, to the point of wanting to meet each other. The story slowly grew on me. I did like the growing attraction between the two.\nGraphics:\nTerrible. Looks like an early 90's point and click game. I've seen worse graphics, though.\nSounds:\nThe dialogue might be the best part of this game. It is excellently done and can even provide quite a few laughs. The sound effects sound dated for 2015.\nControls:\nThe controls are so bad I cannot even describe them. Play the game and see for yourself.\nReplay:\nNo replayability. The whole thing can be completed in less than 45 minutes. The first time I played this game, I beat it in 43 minutes.\nFinal Verdict:\n45 minutes of gameplay for 9 dollars? Are you kidding me? On top of all that, the game gives you a "This game never even happened" type of ending. Skip this game. I think I want a personal apology from Nina herself, and also a full refund of what I payed for this game. I've been playing video games for over 20 years, and this is the worst FMV game I have ever played so far.","April 18","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

The strong points are the thematic choices, the exposed nakedness of this insight into another person\'s stumbling steps into the world of relationships. However where it mainly falls flat is in it\'s lack of punchline to both the main story beats and the sub plots. It builds a great atmosphere and insight but then falls flat when it all comes to a rather sudden conclusion.\n\nIn the end I\'d still recommend this to anyone interested in unique takes on interactive story telling. This might not be the best shining example, but it\'s well worth the time just to experience and perhaps broaden your perspective on this specific emotional subject.\n\n2/5","May 31","true","1.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Cibele invites you to explore the perspective of the naive central protagonist (Nina) and her burgeoning online romance; with all the embarresment, awkwardness and uncertainty you might expect, cocurrent with typical (maybe satirical) MMO grinding.\n\nThere is very little player agency given you are emphatically put in someone elses position.  You get to know the proganist by having unfettered access to her computer files including photos, old poems, blog posts and chat posts.  The result is uncomfortably voyueristic, and the effective use of cut-scenes to deliniate between the 'real' and the 'virtual' adds to this.\n\nThe relationship between the real and the virtual worlds is a major theme as the 'virtual' is interrogated both as a space that facilitates genuine openness, sharing and connection, but also carefully cultivated representations and fantasy/projection.   The relationship itself and the love interest are open to interpretation from our limited perspective; we can chart how events unfold and transcribe what was said, but never really know their thought processes or intentions.  Just what they choose to show us.\n\n...And isn't that always the way?","November 5, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed it.","November 4, 2015","true","1.7"," 16 of 37 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","16","37","2","0"

After playing it, I find it weird that I wasn't drawn into it myself. Part of the reason I think it didn't fully connect with me was the game within the game. While listening to the characters voice chat players are tasked with playing a fake MMO. The gameplay in this MMO is terrible.\n\nIt's buggy, it's laggy (my machine is more than capable of a lagfree experience so I don't know where that came from), and it's uninspired. One could argue that it isn't too important if the gameplay is solid when the story is so lovingly told. I would argue that means the gameplay has to be even better. Tell me an inovative story (which they did for games), but also give some innovative gameplay.\n\nSimple things like polishing it up, making sure it runs properly would have done enough that I wouldn't be distracted by it (which sadly it took me out of the story). Maybe have Nina's character logout of the game after a fight with Blake? (something like in Depression Quest when agency was purposefully taken away from the player can be pretty impactful) That would require a slight restructuring of the story but still.\n\nAside from the fake MMO () gameplay it was good. I hope the developers use it as a learning experience and make something where all the aspects are as good as the story.\n\nA few side observations/suggestions:\n\n1. Why does a mouse click sound play at the desktop when my actual mouse makes a sound? Super nitpicky, that one\n\n2. Try to invest in a better camera for any future live action scenes and get a director (rent a camera/get a film student)\n\n3. The bosses in the MMO would often go out of bounds and pathfinding sucked, this made me frusterated which wasn't fun","November 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I was compelled by the small bit of info I heard about the story direction this game goes. After beating it in about 90 minutes I can say i was mildly satisfied with it overall. Not much here in terms of gameplay, although that's kind of the point. I enjoyed the story a lot early on and I think it did a great job overall conveying what a lot of relationships can be like here in the 21st century. The core gameplay is very basic and just has you pointing and clicking through a ficticious MMO while the two main characters interact over voice chat.  It doesn't sound like much but the dialogue kept me interested enough to want to see what would happen next. The ending wasn't terrific but this was a unique experience that I did enjoy and the main female protaganist (and game designer) deserves a lot of credit for opening herself up the way she did and sharing a very personal journey.

To first loves, and first losses. To yearning, to heartbreak, and to a young woman's first attempts at learning to love online.\n\nCibele is set in a world that is familiar to all of us-- a desktop, complete with an anime-esque magical girl background, chatlogs, downloads folders, files filled with old photos, and the glittering crystal icon of the title character's favorite MMO.\n\nPicking through these literal snapshots of autobiography (the game designer herself features in all of them) helps piece together the portrait of a very creative and emotionally vulnerable young woman.\n\nCibele/Nina, with her tremendous self doubt, is human and heartfelt. Her story is one that is uncomfortably familiar to many of us... Going online in search of the love and human companionship she craves, she grapples with inexperience, insecurity, and trying to love someone who does not want to be loved.\n\nThe ending is poignant and painfully real. Not everyone is as perfect as they seem. "I love you," unfortunately, is no guarantee.\n\nTHE VERDICT: Recommended for those who like a realistic love story, interactive emotional journeys, and lots of delectable Final Fantasy/MMO/Anime/Manga references.","November 4, 2015","true","2.5"," 17 of 40 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","17","40","0","0"

Lemme get that out there right away. The gameplay is merely a means to hold you up so that the voiceovers can do their work. That said, it simulates mmo grinding extremely well.\n\nThis is the short story of one person's experience in an online relationship, molding together themes from both first loves to young loves. It doesn't matter that it happens to take place online; these feelings are generally universal amongst most human beings, perhaps being unknown to the absolute fringe most antisocial.\n\nThis work seems specifically to be an interesting act of coping with what was obviously a rough period in her life. Or, as many people have experienced, an amazing period that ended in such a way that it made all that time completely horrible.\n\nIs this specific work relatable to everyone, though? No. Not everyone went through the same internet-specific relationships the author did. Many more have nowadays, and even more will in the near future, but someone looking for a video game won't find such a thing here. Those who did have such a relationship probably heard every line spoken or written in this game in their own life off-script, with just the names changed. Most of these lines are even universal to facetoface relationships.\n\nPoor things: the cinematography is somewhat lackluster. It's not bad for an amateur work, but each scene didn't seem to speak video-wise the same way the emotions were coming out audio-wise. I don't really review movies, though, so I guess I can't give good criticisms here.\n\nBlake's voice actor wasn't nearly as good as Nina's (Nina herself? I didn't check lmao) as delivering awkwardness. His lines felt just a bit forced when he is supposed to be a charismatic guild leader. Personal chats are always different, but the way he is presented and the way he acts seem to not synergize.\n\nAnd, of course, the gameplay being nonexistent.\n\nOverall, I related to this work, and therefore it was worth playing. Was it worth the gate cost? Probably not, but that doesn't bother me much.\n","November 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

I'd hardly even qualify it as a game with the exception of the basic point-n-click gameplay of the "online" game you're playing and talking to the other main character in the story with. This game is actually probably my least favorite part of the entire experience - the controls are clunky, the pathfinding is awful and there's no strategy to it at all. You're just clicking on an enemy, watching your characters attack it for a while, and then you repeat that about 100 times as the dialogue progresses.\n\nDespite the poor gameplay, it actually does capture the feeling of completely tuning out on the game you're playing and focusing on who you're talking to while playing. In Cibele you aren't really playing a character and you aren't making any kind of impact on the world, you're just watching the story play out and occasionally doing something like reading an email or looking at a photo which will trigger further conversation.\n\nThe pacing is kind of a mess. Each act has a big time-skip in between, and although you're supposed to assume that the 2 main characters have gotten closer as time has gone on, the conversation just kind of starts to lull around halfway through and they seem to almost repeat themselves at times.\n\n*Major spoilers ahead*\n\nAlthough I like the story overall, the time-skip and so much of this story seemingly being left out does not do it any favors. The first two acts seem like a relationship building up, but the 3rd act is odd. It starts off with a lot of very similar dialogue to the previous act, then suddenly things start to escalate, and then suddenly things don't work out and it's over. This game doesn't give you any time to process what you're learning about the characters, or to really even grow attached to any of them.\n\nI know I sound really critical about this game but there are some things I really liked. Browsing Nina's computer is surprisingly compelling and there's a lot of attention to detail about what you'll find on there - things are labelled by date and you can go look at her old blogs and website pages from when she was young, and as the story moves on you can learn about her by looking through her computer.\n\nThe dialogue between the two characters, particularly in the early parts of the game, is well-acted and sounds really natural for the most part. At times when I was spacing out in the boring gameplay sections listening to them talk, I felt like I was actually in a skype call with two people just listening to them talk. Even though some have criticized the dialogue for being strange and even creepy, I think for the most part, especially in act 2, it seems about right for two people falling for each other online. At least from my own experience (more on that in a bit.)\n\nLastly, the cutscenes are a nice, if not surreal touch. It almost makes me feel like I'm playing one of those old Sega CD games or something, where it's trying to be like an interactive movie or something.\n\nThis game did strike a bit of a personal chord with me, and maybe that's what made me want to keep playing it until the end (not that that takes very long anyway.) My first (and to date, only) relationship was one that started, lived, and ended online. We met through World of Warcraft and ended up being together for just a bit over 2 years before we drifted apart. A lot of the dialogue in the early parts of the game really reminded me of getting to know that girl as we mindlessly grinded away on the game together, and it became the background of what we were really focusing on together - getting to know each other, and seeing our feelings grow stronger over time.\n\n*Last spoilers ahead*\n\nThe ending is really a shame. Not because the relationship didn't work out - that stuff happens obviously. But it's just so.. abrupt. I sat there staring at the credits for a few seconds in disbelief. I couldn't believe it. The game really should have had at least one or two more acts to really tell the story, and it shouldn't have ended the way it did.\n\n\nI really had to think of if I wanted to recommend this game to others or not, but I think at the end of the day it does something unique and there is a lot of charm to it. If you've been in an online-only relationship, or one that started online, you might find this game interesting.","November 3, 2015","true","1.0"," 30 of 70 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","30","70","2","0"

If not, you will probably not find it as enjoyable.\n\nLet's get the obvious out of the way first: this isn't a game.  The "gameplay" of the MMO portion is terrible and token, and I believe it's designed that way -- the point is to zone out the actual game and focus on the various characters interacting with each other.  Any veteran MMO player can understand that feeling well.\n\nI've been in various online relationships before, and each act of this game reminded me a little of a different element of each of them.

You can read emails, view archived posts from her blog, and look at pictures. This all helps give a sense of the kind of person you're playing as, and I highly recommend exploring the desktop before launching the MMO every time you can. It helps give a sense of what's going on outside of Nina's conversations with her internet boyfriend. Some of it is cute, some of it is a bit sad.\n\nIn the MMO, you mostly talk to Ichi while mindlessly clicking away at enemies. The conversations are not terribly romantic considering the subject matter, but the awkward exchanges really ring true to me as someone who is also very introverted and has had an online relationship. There's also other players who will try to chat with you while you talk to Ichi, and you're free to engage or ignore them as you please.\n\nI hesitate to say much more for fear of spoilers. The things you've heard about how this game explores relationships in the digital age, that's all there. There's also a lot of almost cringe-inducingly nostalgic details sprinkled throughout that feel very true to life.

Nina Freeman invites us to remember what it's like to forge relationships online and in-person, experience love and heartbreak, and deal with the awkwardness of intertwining a real-world life and a virtual one. If you've been through a difficult and complex relationship of any kind, the game will strike a meaningful chord with you. It doesn't try to sugar-coat or even provide hope for the often harsh realities of relationships, while also not being so bleak so as to push you to not want relationships at all. It encourages you to go out and experience all the positive and negative emotions the world has to offer, and legitimizes that experiencing it through an online game is no less valid than experiencing it in person. This valuable experience is wrapped up in some wonderful art and music, and a clever and well-thought out interface. If you grew up on the internet in the early 2000's, you will find yourself in Cibele.","November 3, 2015","true","1.2"," 21 of 56 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","21","56","0","0"

I think they miss that both of these are completely intentional and very, very realistic. This is not an experience meant to be a fun, engaging game. It is meant to evoke feelings of youthful uncertainty, of unspoken longing for connection and love, for self-acceptance in a world where you can hide behind a screen. It is a digital snapshot of growing up. If that sounds boring to you, I highly encourage you to pass over this game.

It feels eerily personal and voyeuristic, like you are really looking through another person's life and personal thoughts and situations.\n\nYou progress through the story by playing through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. There isn't much to that game itself, just clicking mobs  and bosses until they die( aahahah, to be fair that does capture what you end up doing in many many mmos).  Nina goes on raids with Blake, while talking to him through voice chat , and that's where their relationship grows. You also can text with some of Nina's friends as well.\n\nAs you go on, the desktop will change and will have new texts, new photos , etc, that will reflect Nina's state of mind and relationships. You can see how her herself changes throughout, as well as her friends. The relation ship of Nina and Blake  also develops at a steady pace, starting from some slight flirts to more deep conversations and then even talks of a deeper relationship. The dialog feels quite realistic and natural (well, it ressonated with my awkward teenager years at least) The very personal point of views keeps the plot quite engaging, it really feels like looking into someone else's life, personality and fears.\n\nFor people who like narrative experiences like The Begginer's Guide, I definitely recommend it.","November 2, 2015","true","1.2"," 32 of 88 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","32","88","3","1"

But when a video game is used as an expression of the creator, it becomes an artistic experience.\n\nCibele is one of those experiences.  An autobiographical shortfilm/and mmo simulator, Cibele tells the emotional and intimate story of a college girl, named Nina, falling in love with a man she meets in an MMO.\n\nWhen starting the game up and perusing through personal files I felt voyeuristic and uncomfortable.  But, the narrative handed to me was eventually immersive, anxious to see what next development was unfolded became increasingly motivating, and I felt as if I was the girl herself.\n\nThe gameplay is boiled down to a computer simulator.  I looked at emails, went on websites and viewed personal photos.  Another icon, that looks similar to a Final Fantasy crystal is present. Clicking this icon throws you into a virtual MMO.  Inside the mmo you can respond to messages in a similar way you respond to text messages in the game Catherine, fight monsters and bosses (it felt like busywork by the first ten minutes I did it).  You have a voice chat fully voice acted by the young woman and the boy who she is playing the game with.  It’s very well done, and the art has a very colorful pastel look to it, even if the animations can seem a little sloppy.\n\nThe writing is realistic, but also poetic.  Nina Freeman’s English Literature degree really shines in this area.  While the voice acting may be hard to get used to at first, your suspension of immersion should be set into the characters footsteps in order to fully enjoy the story.\n\nWith an ending that’s very poignant, sad, and powerful.  Cibele is an enjoyable solid experience that will keep your attention for the meager hour it asks of your time.  Tiny details, like the whirring of the computer in the background just add to the overall enjoyment.  I felt frustrated with Cibeles story and gameplay, but I also felt rewarded for the moral I retained.\n\nYears from now the gaming medium may talk about Cibele and it’s uniqueness with how it presented storytelling, or it may not.  With either outcome, Nina has produced her passion, and she should be commended and congratulated for that.  With that conclusion, I recommend Cibele for people who are fascinated by relationships on the internet, or individuals who enjoy artistic interactive experiences.","November 2, 2015","true","1.3"," 95 of 234 people (41%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","41","95","234","20","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngsdd/recommended/408120/","fngsdd","fungusdude4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngsdd/","330 products in account","That was interesting. This is a game where you experience the online life of a nerdy 19 year-old girl, discovering romance, love, and sex. In the game, you can look through photos and text files on her desktop and you'll play her favorite MMO and listen to conversations between her and her crush. It's also quite short.\n\nIf that sounds interesting to you, you should probably just play it right now. As for my take...\n\nThe game was surprisingly jarring, though I don't mean that in a necessarily bad way. You really do feel like you're looking into the personal life of a teenage\young adult girl. I never lived that life, but I think I've come away with a better understanding of what life was like for someone like Nina. The game is separated into acts. The first part of each is browsing files on Nina's desktop. This did feel kind of voyeuristic, especially looking at the kinds of pictures that she'd taken of herself, though other files like poems and blog posts were generally more comfortable to read. There's a lot of text to take in at once. As one who's never been good at following TV and movies, this was a bit difficult, but ultimately rewarding. The real meat of the game is experienced in the sequences taking place within the world of the fictional MMO Valtameri, where you play as Nina's character, Cibele. There isn't a lot to the gameplay and it's thankfully never difficult or confusing, but it really just serves as a backdrop for the in-game voice chat between Nina and her crush, known as "ichi", as well as some live IM feeds. This is where the story plays out. At first, the talk feels kind of bland and stereotypical, but over time Nina and ichi open up and really develop an interesting relationship. It becomes quite an awkward saga, which perfectly fits these characters. Between acts, there are a few short live-action scenes showing what Nina does after each session.\n\nOverall, I found it to be a rather unique experience. It succeeded in telling a very personal story and putting you in the shoes of young Nina. It's well written, well acted, and well paced. It certainly delivers on the themes it promises and comes across as a fairly natural. A great way to spend a couple hours, especially if you enjoy narrative games.\n\nStill, I have some issues, though they're pretty minor. The desktop doesn't quite feel like a real desktop. Everything opens with a single click and you can't drag windows around. I think a couple UI additions could make the game's setting feel more genuine. While the in-game sequences are great, I feel like they could have been more fleshed out. The conversation is often rather superficial, though it's likely that this could be intentional and an accurate depiction of the relationship. The in-game sections can be a tad frustrating due to some questionable pathing, but it never really impedes progress or kills the pacing. The ending is kind of abrupt, but it's also pretty appropriate. Aside from that, I suppose some of the texts feel unnecessary and don't really do much for the overall experience. I guess I just wanted a bit more from the game, though that's not such a bad thing.\n\nI was quite enthralled with Cibele while it lasted. If you're the sort of person who likes artsy, weird, or otherwise non-traditional games, I would whole-heartedly recommend this. For anyone else, I'd urge you to give it a try if you find the subject matter or premise intriguing.","November 3, 2015","true","1.9"," 22 of 72 people (31%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","31","22","72","3","0"

Nina, the protagonist, is self-conscious and unsure.  She craves affirmation from Blake, her MMO boyfriend, but doesn't know how to handle it.  Blake shares these same insecurities.  He is a teenager afterall.  His compliments seem subtly sexist to (e.g. you're good for a girl) and he seems to have trouble valuing people (including himself) for their internal characteristics.\n\n<SPOILERS TO FOLLOW> When the characters do get together it hardly feels like a triumph.  As the game, and their relationship ends, it doesn't feel tragic.  You get released from an (at times) uncomfortably personal look at two young people's lives.  The characters themselves get released from a relationship that probably needed to end for their own growth.  <END SPOILERS>\n\nI can strongly recommend this game because of how honest it feels.  It's uncomfortable to play (for me at least).  The mid-western sensibilities I was raised with make me feel uncomfortable with such an intimate look into a stranger's personal life.  For me, playing through someone else's life like this was more trangressive than any gaming murder spree I've been a part of.\n\nI should mention I encountered a few minor bugs.  A couple chat logs wouldn't open for me and an MMO boss just disappeared for a couple minutes when I was supposed to be hitting it.  Don't let those stop you from playing this though.  The teenage awkwardness of this game gave me the most visceral sympathetic embarrassment I've experienced in a long time and I love the game for that.\n\nI give this game a 10/Teens.","November 2, 2015","true","2.2"," 35 of 105 people (33%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","33","35","105","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hakase/recommended/408120/","hakase","klava☼","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hakase/","989 products in account","I purchased this title, fully expecting it to be just another third-rate artsy-fartsy indie title. In some regards, that may not be off the mark, but it's only fair to speak objectively.\n\nThe title is very linear, and there isn't much in the way of decision-making. Progression in this game is established through the repetition of a very simple point-and-click MMORPG-esque game within the game, the completion of which sparks text and audio conversations to occur. Of course, the fact that it's simple goes hand-in-hand with the situation that's trying to be conveyed. While the "game" that you're playing is simple, repetitive, and boring, it's the interaction with other people that keeps you coming back.\n\nInserting yourself into this other person's perspective, with access to the poorly-sorted collection of poetry and photography, their private diary entries, their conversations - this is a very efficient means of immersing you as the player into the story to be told.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the title is very short. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, since the intense nature of the soundtrack and conversations versus the extremely repetitive "gameplay" would get exceedingly boring if you were forced to play for any longer.\n\nThe cinematography is pretty classic "film student project," but that subtly reinforces the idea that you're taking the perspective of a college student. Nobody's trying to win any Oscars, here. None of the characters do or say anything over the top, or cringe-worthy. Out of the entire hour that it took me from start to finish, there was only a single scene that felt awkward or out of place, and it was very close to the end.\n\nThe presentation of the interface and the art style of the "game" are engaging enough to keep you from growing tired of it. Again, extremely simplistic, but if it were any more complex, you wouldn't be able to keep an investment in the story that unfolds as you play. Clever.\n\nWould I recommend playing this title? Absolutely. While I don't feel the price point matches up with the length of the title, it's still a refreshing change of pace, with alternating hints of honey and melancholy.","November 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 25 of 91 people (27%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","27","25","91","7","0"

It's still a good narrative experience, if you're in to these types of games, but I wanted to know more about the aftermath of the game's finale. The abrupt ending left me wanting and unsatisfied, but I still recommend it to anyone looking for a more personal "visual novel" style game. There are gameplay elements, where you partake in the game's MMO world. This equates to nothing more than clicking enemies and giant bosses until they're dead, but all of the game's spoken dialogue takes place during these events while you click around in-game messages from other friends, picture updates, etc. I found it more engaging than just reading walls of text while viewing still images, though I also enjoyed its similar voyeuristic approach browsing files, pictures, poetry, and journal entries on Nina's desktop.\n\nThis one is a tough game to sell to someone uninterested in the narrative genre, but definitely worth checking out if you are. Even if you aren't, if you grew up spending your time alone in AOL chats, posting your heart out on LiveJournal, listening to your parents fight all the time, this could be your reminder that you're not alone.","December 18, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The use of 'found' objects to tell the story is fresh and provides a very personal-feeling insight into the semi-autobiographical story.

The more complex the online game was, the less players would be able to pay attention to the story being told. There a few times that the dialogue seems a bit too earnest and honest, but that is partially my older perspective looking at younger emotions.

You don't get to know the characters in any way outside of clicking on random .txt files on a fakedesktop telling you oh, this character likes Anime, FFX and the Matrix movies.\n\nThe dialogue consists to 50% only of "You're so cute", "No, i'm nat! [giggle]"  and the story plays out in such a predictable and boring way, if you've ever been in an actual relationship or at least watched a movie about one, you'll know where it is going 2 minutes in. Furthermore, the way the game treats some of the more problematic aspects of the relationship it depicts - by that i mean the long distance - i would even consider it downright insulting to the people who are in a long distance relationship, as the game depicts this as an absolute non-issue.\n\n"I want to see you"\n"but we live so far apart"\n"I'll just tell my mom i wanna visit my cousins and she'll buy me some flight tickets."\n"ok"\n\nAnd that is literally it.\n\nBut the worst thing is the pseudo-MMORPG gameplay.\nIt adds absolutely nothing. It's never picked up by the story outside of some sentence like "You da best gamer gurl", it never becomes a metaphor for their relationship like the puzzle segments in the game "Catherine" and it on itself is absolute ♥♥♥♥ to play as it only consists of clicking on an enemy one single time and waiting 30 seconds for it to die and repeating the process over and over again to fill a bar in the top right corner in order to trigger new dialogue between the characters. While doing so, it often goes down to 10FPS and seriously, not a single game in this world looking like this got any business to run at a worse framerate than Drakengard 3.\n\nOverall i don't consider this game to be worth your time or your money unless you're in a very heavy emo phase and are currentling listening to Linkin Park and Bullets for my Valentine thinking "SO DEEP MAN NOBODY UNDERSTANDS ME".\n\nIf you're really interested in a good videogame about relationships i'd suggest you to grab the aforementioned console game "Catherine" for 360 or PS3, as it does a very similar thing with quadrillion times better execution.","December 23, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s made for a subset of the gamer population. Just by looking at the game, you should be able to tell if this applies to you or not. In short, if you ever experienced some sort of online romance (especially in MMOs), this game was made for you.\n\nThat being said, it’s not much of a game. Most of the game is browsing her desktop, or playing the MMO. Perhaps “playing” is too strong a word. You just click on mobs a single time until they die from auto-attacks, then find another and rinse and repeat. The monotony isn’t overly bad as you have multiple in game conversations via text with your other in-game friends at the same time, all the while talking verbally to your love interest. The game is over before any of this should grate on your nerves.\n\nThrow in a few short live-action cut scenes, and that’s all there is to it. It took me just over 90 minutes to do everything this game has, including reading every word and browsing every file. To be fair, this is all advertised on the store page more or less, so the game is upfront in what it is and what it offers. I won’t fault it for that.\n\nWhat I will fault it for is some of the voice acting. It just didn’t have me convinced at all. Hearing her say “I love you” didn’t have me convinced at all. Wasn’t the best, but it could have been worse.\n\nAgain, this was made for certain people in mind. I know I can personally relate to it, and for that reason alone, I appreciate and like it. There was some self-reflection involved, since a few of the actions mirrored my own. So I can’t help but feel for her and relate more than I’d care to admit. Especially knowing it’s a true story.\n\nIf any of this is sounds interesting, I’d give it a try… but only when it’s on sale as it’s hard to justify that price point for such a short experience. Otherwise, this probably isn’t for you, and I’d give it a pass.","December 29, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, as awesome and awkward as the beginning was, the ending fell very flat. They could have taken it further, but (spoiler alert, but not really) the relationship ends just like that. No build up or anything. I suppose its best that way, it would be even more painful to relive the hard times, but that would be good for me, and others, in a way. Maybe I don't like it as much because it mirrored my feelings so perfectly, then changed and we had nothing in common anymore.

The use of 'found' objects to tell the story is fresh and provides a very personal-feeling insight into the semi-autobiographical story. Some review unfairly criticize the online game portion as too simplistic. That is a deliberate design choice and allows the player to be able to appreciate the messaging, media, and dialogue that occur while playing. The more complex the online game was, the less players would be able to pay attention to the story being told. There a few times that the dialogue seems a bit too earnest and honest, but that is partially my older perspective looking at younger emotions. It also seems to be a necessary device to keep the plot on track with the length of the game.\n\nTLDR: At $9 the game takes you on an emotional 1.5 hour ride.","December 22, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very much. I know a lot of people are disappointed that this game provides ZERO challenges or obstacles to overcome. This is very much just an interactive story. There is nothing you can do to sway the outcome or the "journey" to the end. That being said, I thought it was excellently done. It was a compelling story that I was able to relate to very heavily. The story and its interactivity is executed just right so that it pulls you into it. If you were ever a nerdy teenage girl that spent a lot of time gaming with strangers online, then chances are that you'll see a piece of yourself in this. The dialog and interactions aren't overacted and dramatic- they're mellow and realistic. Unfortunately, that and the game mechanics make this title very difficult to recommend. I can see only a very specific type of person thoroughly enjoying this, though I'm glad to say that I did. It only took me 1.6 hours to complete (and I explored and interacted with every clickable item in the game). It was like watching a movie- that being said, I believe that the game should only cost about as much as your average movi rental as opposed to $9.

It's still a good narrative experience, if you're in to these types of games, but I wanted to know more about the aftermath of the game's finale. The abrupt ending left me wanting and unsatisfied, but I still recommend it to anyone looking for a more personal "visual novel" style game. There are gameplay elements, where you partake in the game's MMO world. This equates to nothing more than clicking enemies and giant bosses until they're dead, but all of the game's spoken dialogue takes place during these events while you click around in-game messages from other friends, picture updates, etc. I found it more engaging than just reading walls of text while viewing still images, though I also enjoyed its similar voyeuristic approach browsing files, pictures, poetry, and journal entries on Nina's desktop.\n\nThis one is a tough game to sell to someone uninterested in the narrative genre, but definitely worth checking out if you are. Even if you aren't, if you grew up spending your time alone in AOL chats, posting your heart out on LiveJournal, listening to your parents fight all the time, this could be your reminder that you're not alone.","December 18, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But surrounding the story are authentic markers of the time: failed blogs, anime fandom, forums, and the intimacy of sharing photos with friends you'd never met.\n\nMy game was RuneScape, or Team Fortress 2. My homes were RuneScape Community and Couch Athletics. I had these conversations. I had those chats. Some of those online friends I met and still know today.\n\nI'm very glad this game exists.","December 22, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hacktor/recommended/408120/","Hacktor","Hektor Hernández","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hacktor/","1723 products in account","David Cage would be proud.\n\nA game about relationships so devoid of any believable human emotions or interactions, you'll make a ten times more emotional experience when asking a stranger where to find the next fastfoodchain.\n\nA more superficial look at relationships is virtually impossible. You don't get to know the characters in any way outside of clicking on random .txt files on a fakedesktop telling you oh, this character likes Anime, FFX and the Matrix movies.\n\nThe dialogue consists to 50% only of "You're so cute", "No, i'm nat! [giggle]"  and the story plays out in such a predictable and boring way, if you've ever been in an actual relationship or at least watched a movie about one, you'll know where it is going 2 minutes in. Furthermore, the way the game treats some of the more problematic aspects of the relationship it depicts - by that i mean the long distance - i would even consider it downright insulting to the people who are in a long distance relationship, as the game depicts this as an absolute non-issue.\n\n"I want to see you"\n"but we live so far apart"\n"I'll just tell my mom i wanna visit my cousins and she'll buy me some flight tickets."\n"ok"\n\nAnd that is literally it.\n\nBut the worst thing is the pseudo-MMORPG gameplay.\nIt adds absolutely nothing. It's never picked up by the story outside of some sentence like "You da best gamer gurl", it never becomes a metaphor for their relationship like the puzzle segments in the game "Catherine" and it on itself is absolute ♥♥♥♥ to play as it only consists of clicking on an enemy one single time and waiting 30 seconds for it to die and repeating the process over and over again to fill a bar in the top right corner in order to trigger new dialogue between the characters. While doing so, it often goes down to 10FPS and seriously, not a single game in this world looking like this got any business to run at a worse framerate than Drakengard 3.\n\nOverall i don't consider this game to be worth your time or your money unless you're in a very heavy emo phase and are currentling listening to Linkin Park and Bullets for my Valentine thinking "SO DEEP MAN NOBODY UNDERSTANDS ME".\n\nIf you're really interested in a good videogame about relationships i'd suggest you to grab the aforementioned console game "Catherine" for 360 or PS3, as it does a very similar thing with quadrillion times better execution.","December 23, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters don't sound like they're out of a Hollywood movie or a blockbuster game.  They aren't supposed to.  Instead, it sounds a lot like an actual voice chat; movie or game dialogue usually is very succinct and to-the-point, while Cibele's meanders much like real conversations.  Overall, the dialogue sounds pretty much like the awkward conversations I had when I was 19.\n- Likewise, the characters are not 100% likeable, but they aren't supposed to be.  I did kind of want to reach into the computer and slap some sense into Nina sometimes, but that's easy for me to say now; when I was 19, I was every bit as insecure and self-deprecating in real life as Nina and Blake are in Cibele.\n- And, yes, the story is pretty predictable.  If you read the description of the game, you'll probably think, "Oh, I know how that story ends," and you'll probably be right.  That said, I got a lot out of it seeing it from a third-party point of view.  It's one thing to know what'll probably happen; it's another to actually watch it happen without being one of the people involved.\n- Cibele is more of a visual novel than a game.  There is a gameplay element to it, and you can poke around a bit on Nina's computer to get glimpses into other parts of her life, but you should approach this more as a movie that you have to interact with rather than as a game where you make your own choices.\n- The pseudo-MMO is very simple and repetitive.  However, I think this is essential to the storytelling.  You don't want a complex game here, because that would distract from the story.  Also, when you play an MMO for a while, you get to the point where even a very involved game starts to feel a little repetitive and you can sort of do it on autopilot; the game-within-a-game captures that, where it feels a little grindy and you don't bat an eyelash at checking email and carrying on a conversation with the game being just sort of something you're doing in the background.  (That said, the pathfinding really does suck; it's the top thing I'd change about this game.)\n- The ending is a little abrupt.  I think it's supposed to be, though: You feel dumped at the end, a lot like Nina.  It isn't clear if Blake ever talks to Nina again, or if Nina stops playing Valtameri entirely afterward, and I don't think it matters; Cibele is a story about a relationship, and Cibele ends when the relationship ends.  Do I wish I had more insight into Nina's life after the end of the story?  Of course.  That's because I like the character, though, and would like to know more about her; not because I think knowing is essential to the story.\n\nThere is one significant negative about the game: the price.  It's a really short game for the money.  On the other hand, I think it's more fair to compare the price to that of a movie or a play rather than a computer game; when viewed in that light, it's a little more reasonable.  That said, the comparatively high cost is why I don't go to many movies or plays--I'd rather spend the money on a computer game that I can play a lot more of.  If you feel the same way, Cibele will be too expensive for you.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Cibele.  However, your expectations for this game will dramatically affect your perception of it.  Cibele asks you to have empathy for a character in a way that most games do not, and it requires you to infer a lot about the characters.  If you like indie art films, and you have had a long-distance "it's complicated" kind of relationship, you'll probably like Cibele.  Otherwise, you probably won't.","June 2","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seems pretty common, but this one is pretty well told.\n\nThe game is pretty immersive from the beginning and more and more progressing through the game aka the relation between the two characters, only thing that bothered me is the low fps (i dont know if it was on my end, the fact that playing on a 144hz monitor or something). The fact that you can browse the desktop of Nina to know a little bit more about her is cool.\n\nSome reviews says the end was predictable and i kinda dont agree with that, it was not THAT predictable to me.\n\nI would give it a 7/10. A bit short, i believe the game had potential in being longer, but i guess that wasn't the base idea of the author. I was interested about this game since his release, but the 9€ was not really worth it to me if you consider another game like "Her Story" which had more gametime while being cheaper, but getting Cibele in a Humble Bundle was pretty nice !","June 2","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OK? I guess? It's not really a game so much as a movie with some still shots and text you take in. The bulk of the game, when you're not looking at the pictures and such, is this in-game MMO where you play while this dude hits on you. However, there's no HP or levelling up or anything, so it's basically just a cookie clicker game with some occasionally very cringy dialogue.\n\nI don't want to say too much as the game's so plot-driven, but the guy the main character falls for is so unlikable, she has this pointless relationship and then the game just suddenly ends. So the girl wastes a lot of her time on some jerk, gets used and then there's absolutely no closure. Maybe that's the point? The girl is definitely cute in a nerdy way, which might seem like a pointless or shallow thing to bring up but really, a lot of this game is looking at selfies she took so if for some reason you really don't like how she looks, you've been warned.\n\nI dunno, there's a certain interesting element of voyeurism to the early half of the game (the first 15 minutes!) where you're poking through her things, getting to know who she is and was, and how she got to this point in her life. But a lot of this game is playing the MMO and listening to the whiny dude and neither of them are interesting or likable. If you got it in a bundle or as a gift, I'd say sure, play it, it's too short to really be a big regret. But I wouldn't spend $10 on it, so that's why I gotta give this the thumbs down.","June 2","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel the writing in general was really dissapointing. There are good elements to this game, it tries to explore complex issues about body image and teenage sexuality. But it stumbles largely because of the characters. I don't want to judge some one's personal life (i.e. if the entire narrative is real life) but Blake just comes across as unlikeable and Nina comes across as a little too naive for her age.\n\nThe game inside the game is a real chore. I like walking simulators and other games that have no fail states (like Journey) so that is not my problem, but the amount of interactivity on offer is miniscule and it is only there to push the poorly written dialogues forward. And the visuals are kind of meh..\n\nI honestly hope the creator gives this another go.

At first I was expecting a novela/thriller kind of story but I didn\'t expected to be an autobiographical real life simulator(literally) presented as an interactive game. The story itself it\'s very ordinary and common \"playing\"(or pretend like you do) as a 19 year old teen addicted to an online game, but it\'s what makes this game particular and interesting.\n\nThe presentation of Cibele is alright, the computer content it seemed legit to me, although I encountered some visual problems with the levels on the online game(third level). The soundtrack was okay and I liked the acting.\n\nMainly, needs more interactivity to give the player more capacity of action and more immersion, it just lacks of it. The game focuses on it\'s story events but although it was predictable(what makes the game boring  for a lot of people) it\'s not storytelling, it\'s a real world story and life can be predictable sometimes.\nThe game lets you discover some aspects  and interactions of the main character\'s life but it doesn\'t serve you at the game so this feature it\'s made(I think) for those who apreciate the small details at games and for good presentation purposes ,Cibele doesn\'t have any puzzles or challenges.\n\nThe mechanics inside the online game are very basic and alright(at some points) and one of the main problems here, in my opinion, is the \"combat system\". I mean I can understand that it\'s a game with basic mechanics but I think this part could be a lot more improved and it would be acceptable but it\'s how it is, very repetitive and dull. You can\'t take any damage either, what makes the combat pointless. It made me think how this pair of teens were spending time here and not on a chat website.\n\nI had a dilemma whether recommend Cibele or not because it\'s not a polished game, but I\'ve seen some effort putt into this game. Besides ,the topic itself it\'s a very common problem nowadays, a lot of naive/young/adult people give a lot of trust to strangers on the internet and many are badly affected by this. So in conclussion try it, it\'s a peculiar life simulator that shows some relatable aspects and details about life making it a good experience, but it could have been better executed and more playable.","June 1","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters don't sound like they're out of a Hollywood movie or a blockbuster game.  They aren't supposed to.  Instead, it sounds a lot like an actual voice chat; movie or game dialogue usually is very succinct and to-the-point, while Cibele's meanders much like real conversations.  Overall, the dialogue sounds pretty much like the awkward conversations I had when I was 19.\n- Likewise, the characters are not 100% likeable, but they aren't supposed to be.  I did kind of want to reach into the computer and slap some sense into Nina sometimes, but that's easy for me to say now; when I was 19, I was every bit as insecure and self-deprecating in real life as Nina and Blake are in Cibele.\n- And, yes, the story is pretty predictable.  If you read the description of the game, you'll probably think, "Oh, I know how that story ends," and you'll probably be right.  That said, I got a lot out of it seeing it from a third-party point of view.  It's one thing to know what'll probably happen; it's another to actually watch it happen without being one of the people involved.\n- Cibele is more of a visual novel than a game.  There is a gameplay element to it, and you can poke around a bit on Nina's computer to get glimpses into other parts of her life, but you should approach this more as a movie that you have to interact with rather than as a game where you make your own choices.\n- The pseudo-MMO is very simple and repetitive.  However, I think this is essential to the storytelling.  You don't want a complex game here, because that would distract from the story.  Also, when you play an MMO for a while, you get to the point where even a very involved game starts to feel a little repetitive and you can sort of do it on autopilot; the game-within-a-game captures that, where it feels a little grindy and you don't bat an eyelash at checking email and carrying on a conversation with the game being just sort of something you're doing in the background.  (That said, the pathfinding really does suck; it's the top thing I'd change about this game.)\n- The ending is a little abrupt.  I think it's supposed to be, though: You feel dumped at the end, a lot like Nina.  It isn't clear if Blake ever talks to Nina again, or if Nina stops playing Valtameri entirely afterward, and I don't think it matters; Cibele is a story about a relationship, and Cibele ends when the relationship ends.  Do I wish I had more insight into Nina's life after the end of the story?  Of course.  That's because I like the character, though, and would like to know more about her; not because I think knowing is essential to the story.\n\nThere is one significant negative about the game: the price.  It's a really short game for the money.  On the other hand, I think it's more fair to compare the price to that of a movie or a play rather than a computer game; when viewed in that light, it's a little more reasonable.  That said, the comparatively high cost is why I don't go to many movies or plays--I'd rather spend the money on a computer game that I can play a lot more of.  If you feel the same way, Cibele will be too expensive for you.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Cibele.  However, your expectations for this game will dramatically affect your perception of it.  Cibele asks you to have empathy for a character in a way that most games do not, and it requires you to infer a lot about the characters.  If you like indie art films, and you have had a long-distance "it's complicated" kind of relationship, you'll probably like Cibele.  Otherwise, you probably won't.","June 2","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OK? I guess? It's not really a game so much as a movie with some still shots and text you take in. The bulk of the game, when you're not looking at the pictures and such, is this in-game MMO where you play while this dude hits on you. However, there's no HP or levelling up or anything, so it's basically just a cookie clicker game with some occasionally very cringy dialogue.\n\nI don't want to say too much as the game's so plot-driven, but the guy the main character falls for is so unlikable, she has this pointless relationship and then the game just suddenly ends. So the girl wastes a lot of her time on some jerk, gets used and then there's absolutely no closure. Maybe that's the point? The girl is definitely cute in a nerdy way, which might seem like a pointless or shallow thing to bring up but really, a lot of this game is looking at selfies she took so if for some reason you really don't like how she looks, you've been warned.\n\nI dunno, there's a certain interesting element of voyeurism to the early half of the game (the first 15 minutes!) where you're poking through her things, getting to know who she is and was, and how she got to this point in her life. But a lot of this game is playing the MMO and listening to the whiny dude and neither of them are interesting or likable. If you got it in a bundle or as a gift, I'd say sure, play it, it's too short to really be a big regret. But I wouldn't spend $10 on it, so that's why I gotta give this the thumbs down.","June 2","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it seems that adding a boring, repetitive, 'click to kill the enemy' game within the game, in addition to voice acting, often creepy dialogue, and short live-action cutscenes, has made this game a whole lot worse. Both protagonists are ultimately unlikeable and I found myself cringing at the amount of 'flirting' goes on between them. This feels like a gullible child's first internet 'love' (which is what it is based on), yet I'm powerless to do anything about it; I can't stop Nina despite already knowing exactly how this is going to play out. I noticed that IGN is quoted to have said 'The most authentic, romantic game I've ever played' which is just laughable; there is no romance, all this game contains is creepy flirting and an abrupt ending.

That's pretty much the experience this game provides.\n\nI appreciate that this game is likely deeply personal for the dev, and I think it has a lot of potential, but something just fell short in the execution of this story. It failed to communicate any real depth or purpose. I don’t know if I’m just an unromantic cynic, but the “love interest” is immediately unlikeable, and I struggled to empathise with him, or the protagonist for wanting to regularly speak to him. Both characters were so annoyingly insecure in constantly seeking the other’s validation that I had to force myself to finish it ("I'm not hot, you are!" "No, you are!" ad nauseam). I suppose this is a story of naiveté, and as such maybe I shouldn’t be so harsh, but it was difficult to engage with any of the characters, and they were really the focal point of the game.\n\nProps to the interesting unpolished style and an attempt (albeit a somewhat vapid attempt) at featuring the experience of being a female gamer in an online community. I should also note that the acting, while certainly amateur, felt very genuine, and added to the overall experience.\n\nI wish I could recommend it, but it just isn't developed enough as a narrative or as a game for me to suggest anyone pay for it.

I thought the premise had some promise. I knew there was likely to be some kind of twist towards the end, probably that the guy was a catfish or something (I won't say here whether there was or not just in case anyone actually cares).\n\nI love narrative games. I loved Gone Home to bits and recommended it to everyone I knew. But this?\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThis has about the same amount of gameplay as Gone Home, but it feels like much less, and not just because it's only half the length. Half the game is spent clicking through files on this girls desktop, and the other half is spent playing a game that feels like someone tried to recreate Diablo in Adobe Flash as their first programming project. And it controls really badly. How they managed to muck up the simple act of clicking I'll never know - it lags like hell and just makes everything really frustrating. There is no depth to the game within the game whatsoever. Enemies cannot hurt you. There is no loot or customizability. You just click. Click on enemies. When the boss appears click on it. You don't even have to click more than once. Just give it a tap and you'll kill it 'till it's dead. There are no powerups, experience points, or special attacks. Just clicking.\n\nSTORY:\n\nThis is apparently based on an experience the writer (and lead actress) actually had. The problem is that it isn't an interesting experience. It's something that happens all the time and honestly wasn't even made that special by it happening online. The ending is disappointing. The acting is stilted and unconvincing, and the writing is mediocre at best.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nA genuine 0/10. It's not offensively bad, it simply has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and is a complete waste of time. It's only an hour long at most (I spent ~70 minutes because I used up some time complaining to a friend about it) and not a single minute of that hour is worthwhile.\n\nDon't buy this game. If you get it in a bundle, don't redeem it. If you're given it as a gift, don't accept it. If somehow it ends up in your library, don't download it.

Most of the story is dispensed through dialogue between Nina and Ichi, and their conversations are boring. When you get right down to it, the story is basically girl and boy fall in love with eachother online, they meet up IRL and have sex, and then boy does not love girl anymore. That's pretty much it.\n\nMentioned previously the gameplay is pretty bland and boring. It consists mostly of clicking on enemies and watching your character auto-attack them, and pretty much this gameplay only serves as a way to slowly dispense story over the course of the game.\n\nThe worst part about this Cibele though is that it would work much better as a 30 minute or so short film instead of a 70 minute video game experience. But even if it was a short film, it wouldn't fix that the story is boring and is happening to unlikeable characters.

At first I was expecting a novela/thriller kind of story but I didn\'t expected to be an autobiographical real life simulator(literally) presented as an interactive game. The story itself it\'s very ordinary and common \"playing\"(or pretend like you do) as a 19 year old teen addicted to an online game, but it\'s what makes this game particular and interesting.\n\nThe presentation of Cibele is alright, the computer content it seemed legit to me, although I encountered some visual problems with the levels on the online game(third level). The soundtrack was okay and I liked the acting.\n\nMainly, needs more interactivity to give the player more capacity of action and more immersion, it just lacks of it. The game focuses on it\'s story events but although it was predictable(what makes the game boring  for a lot of people) it\'s not storytelling, it\'s a real world story and life can be predictable sometimes.\nThe game lets you discover some aspects  and interactions of the main character\'s life but it doesn\'t serve you at the game so this feature it\'s made(I think) for those who apreciate the small details at games and for good presentation purposes ,Cibele doesn\'t have any puzzles or challenges.\n\nThe mechanics inside the online game are very basic and alright(at some points) and one of the main problems here, in my opinion, is the \"combat system\". I mean I can understand that it\'s a game with basic mechanics but I think this part could be a lot more improved and it would be acceptable but it\'s how it is, very repetitive and dull. You can\'t take any damage either, what makes the combat pointless. It made me think how this pair of teens were spending time here and not on a chat website.\n\nI had a dilemma whether recommend Cibele or not because it\'s not a polished game, but I\'ve seen some effort putt into this game. Besides ,the topic itself it\'s a very common problem nowadays, a lot of naive/young/adult people give a lot of trust to strangers on the internet and many are badly affected by this. So in conclussion try it, it\'s a peculiar life simulator that shows some relatable aspects and details about life making it a good experience, but it could have been better executed and more playable.","June 1","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It must take a great deal of effort to manage to pull one off, and I hate to bash those efforts, however I have to be honest...\n\nI saw the trailer of the game and was immediately intrigued by the game's prospects - considering that I had gone through a somewhat similar (but at the same time very much different) experience myself.\n\n[Concept]\n\nAs you start the game you are presented with the computer's desktop from which you can navigate around some of your files and ultimately open up the game within which the story mostly revolves. As soon as you enter the game, you get a call request from Ichi. From there on you play together and the story (and their relationship) progresses from thereon.\n\nThe recipe is pretty much the same: you are presented with the desktop, you optionally check some files, play the game in order to get the story going, you get a small cutscene and the game fast-forwards a bit and the story repeats itself. You are presented with the desktop...\n\n[Programming]\n\nIf memory serves me right, the programming was done by a single person, however I don't think that this is an excuse for how unpleasant the end-result was. Starting off with the OS, you would instantly feel better that you don't really use that in real life. Clicking on directories and pictures opens them up in new tabs all over the screen. There is no consistency as to where these windows open - and you cannot drag the windows around. So you can easily end up with windows over each other or elsewhere. You cannot navigate from one photo to the other without opening the file with a click, closing it and moving on the next one. A lot of unnecessary mouse movement and clicking for a relatively simple task. If you decide to open up all the files at once and then going through them you may end up with the images not opening up (a cap on the maximum number of open windows or bug?) or sometimes downright impossible since windows may show up over the directory.\n\nThese are just some minor annoyances with what presents itself as on OS. However it gets much worse when you 'play' the game itself. All you have to do is move around, attack random targets (and get Ichi to help you) until the boss appears. You land a couple of hits on it, it disappears, and you repeat the cycle until eventually you defeat it. This could have worked out Ok, but in my opinion it was really dragging and annoying. I am aware the that the 'game' itself isn't the main aspect of the game, but that doesn't really excuse. I have played Dear Esther, and for a game in which all you do is walk, I thought it was an amazing experience (even though it got its fair share of hate from others). The character movement is clumsy, the terrain is ragged and can lead to unpleasant collisions and the AI is just horrible. Ichi can defeat the game's terrain and move around in places which I cannot. Ichi also sometimes just runs off the screen and later reappears near you. The attack animations are mind-numbingly repetetive that even simply clicking to attack the enemies feels like a chore. When I finally get the boss to appear, given how fed up I would have already been at this point, I just click as fast as I can possibly can to attack it. However clicking rapidly slows down the game and mouse movement (I don't think this is intentional) and most of the time the character just moves around to the cursor position instead of attacking the boss. All in all, I'm not even sure I was really dealing damage to the boss or if it was set to just self-destruct on its own. That is how pointless I felt to the game (...not to mention Ichi's positive remarks about how well you play the game... it made me feel like I wanted to hit myself).\n\n[Graphics]\n\nMoving on... I don't really think I can complain here. The game doesn't really focus on visual effects or such, but presents aesthetically pleasing graphics. The 'game' is actually really beautiful for an abstract form of game genre. The desktop itself is also relatively well laid out. I think two minor aspects that could have used more polish would be the menu buttons and how the subtitles appear on top of the game.\n\n[Audio]\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm wrong here but I can only recall one song being present. Regardless, the main theme song was pretty haunting and an excellent choice for the game in my opinion.\n\n[Story]\n\nThis is where I still struggle. On one hand it presents a life and love experience through online games and user interaction - which is what the game really presents itself as being about. A little bonus would be that through the files scattered on the desktop, you can get some backstory about the character. The mail and chat messages seem as compulsory to get the story going forward, and are very distracting from playing the 'game'. The story starts off well in my opinion but then as the game fast-forwards and the whole tone of the game changes you end up feeling like you missed out on something important which has really changed the relationship atmosphere.  When the characters finally met up IRL , the cutscene was way too dry, acted out and bereft of any emotions, which is really an anti-climax considering that the players have been investing their time just for the narrative and emotional attachment with the characters in the game.\n\nAll in all, considering the points mentioned above, it felt like the game set out to share a life experience but somehow got lost along the way. In the end you end up 'playing' a game which is both repetitive and boring just to get the story moving. You are then presented with a developing relationship that starts off fine and then ends up being too superficial and surreal, while near the end the user is left wondering why  Ichi became so distant and avoidant, and what you might have missed out on during the time. I understand how people sometimes become avoidant when present with stressful situations (such as travelling and commitment),  but it really feels as if the player missed out. I honestly cannot recommend this game.\n\n@Nina - if you are reading this, I'm sorry for leaving a negative review. Thank you for sharing your experience with us, and if any of it is true and based on your real life, then I suppose I'm also sorry for what you've been through. Note that I am not bashing the experience itself, but rather how it has been presented to others. I still congratulate you for the efforts you've put into this and the little bonus info (found on the desktop files) about Cibele / you.","June 4","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ending only left more questions, specifically "Where is the rest of the game?"\n\nWhile admirable for someone's obvious first attempt at making a game, it really is much ado about nothing.  The story, minimal at best, is pieced together by a boring series of clicks and extremely poor controls.  This would be fine if the story was engaging.  After the sudden ending however (seriously, you can beat this in less than 10 minutes), you'll discover this plot was anything but.\n\nI don't want to attack the game too viciously as this is obviously a personal project and a deeply personal story, as minute and simplistic as it is.  In that regard, this seems more like a self-reflective piece for the author of the game, covering a clearly important part of her life.  While relatable, it just falls flat.  To me, it feels like she planned for more, but got tired of programming and designing halfway through.\n\nMy only respite is that this came with a Humble Bundle.

It's an experience, a story, a short (~1 hour), poignant, and unflinchingly intimate one. It's young love and sex in the internet age: kids making mistakes together, learning about themselves and each other. Exploring Nina's computer -- seeing her photos, reading her conversations and emails and poetry -- is like seeing someone naked; not in a sexual way, but stripped bare, essentially human. Hearing her talk to Ichi, sensing the mixture of hesitation and eagerness on both sides of their conversation, knowing what will come and how it will affect the girl whose shoes you've stepped into...it's an experience unlike any other I've had in gaming. I remembered what it meant to be like to be young and in love like that, willing to forego everything else in pursuit of that one person, and felt a little hint of that long-ago glow -- along with a little embarrassment and wistfulness.\n\nSo, for a straight review: it's not a game. Don't look for gameplay. But as a story -- a very raw and intimate one -- I thought my hour with Cibele was one well-spent.

It is much more a short movie (played it through in less than an hour) offering you a tiny bit of interaction.\n\nThe story itself is about a young woman who met - and eventually fell in love with - a "handsome boy" she is playing with all the time. As the story progresses they find out they feel attracted to each other.

All this might still offer an interesting experience.\nMain problem with this story is... there is none! All that happens is very linear.

Probably many people (not only those who share the high interaction with other players in online MMORPO games) know this conflict.\nBut sadly the story fails in a broader "discussion" of this issue. This is most obvious when the story actually ends the moment it just begins. When the boy finally took the chance to visit the protagonist, they meet the first time outside the game. It leads to the predictable conflict that was prepared the scene before. So there was no big surprise. But this should be the moment when the story starts - not their end.\nThe movie does not offer any solution, nor does it show the conflict from another point of view. There is no progress for the progtagonists. Neither in overcoming their shared conflict (of not being together) nor in how to deal with being hurt by someone important for you (the first love).\nSo when the game ends, it leaves all this to you. This is pretty unsatisfying. Not because it would make you think. No, this would be actually a great effect. But more, because it does not give you any new input. You might know this problem by yourself or not. And when the ending credits are shown, you merely know that there are other people who share your type of memories.\nIs that necessarily a bad thing? Not at all. But it doesn't offer you much more than this.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The game also shares some nice moments. The voice acting is okay, gives you some authentic emotional moments. The art style is also somehow interesting (even though not amazingly great).\n\nSo, if you are up to watch a short movie where you have to make some clicks in order to continue an authentic story about first love with a sad ending, this might be an hour of gameplay for you.\nIf you expect a real interactive story, or would be frustrated playing a story which ends where it actually just began, better don't buy the game.","June 5","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To me, I've really only seen the story line that it immediately was given.  I didn't delve deep into the poems and websites that the game offered, but I skimmed over them to get to know a little about our character.\nThe game play... was repetitive.  It was a MMO style where you click on monsters and kill them.  To me, that isn't my cup of tea.  I was glad that the story didn't last a super long time.\nIn the end, I do like the game, but it’s not a 9 dollar game.  I only got this game because it was in a Humble Bundle pack.  For the price, I certainly do not recommend this game.  I can get enough of this storyline from my Facebook Page.\n","June 5","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt the emotions that were being felt, and I'm sure a ton of people can relate to this kind of story. I am incredibly impressed with Nina for creating and acting in this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you like a narrative-heavy experience. Very short game.","June 5","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/projectmeow/recommended/408120/","projectmeow","Project Meow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/projectmeow/","55 products in account","This game seems to capture the mind of 12 to 14 year olds.  The silly poetry, the incessant self-conciousness, the immaturity, the pink here there and everywhere.  But the protagonist is 19, which sets the tone at odds with the characters.\n\nI found this story and the dialogue to be cringe-worthy, though not unbelievable given the vapidity of young people. I suppose looking back we can all see our younger selves and think "What in god's name did you do and say that for? What kind of unknowing, unseeing child are you?"\n\nThe characters struck me as such: Adult children.  Perhaps the game is a statement on such things.  I'm not sure, all I know is this game barely held my attention and I am fortunate to have gotten it on the Humble Bundle like many others.\n\nPerhaps the writer would be better off writing for a film rather than a video game.  If the writer's age is hinted at in the game, there is plenty of time to grow, improve, and re-focus.","June 5","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He promptly ditches her after they meet up in real life, and that's the end.\n\nThe MMO's gameplay is choppy, and Cibele's character doesn't move around very well. Other than that, the story is mildly interesting, and the acting is okay.\n\nIt was worth the .33 cents it ended up costing after buying it in a 1 dollar humble bundle.","June 6","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
