Since alpha, I had strived to get better and better. Sure the game was laggy and all, but the game still had a pretty high skill cap, and on a high level the combat was pretty different from something like Warband because of the dodges and specials. It was also much simpler than War of the Roses. I haven't played in a while, but since alpha the game has been intolerably laggy in half the games I have played, but instead of fixing this, the developers added more and more DLC and whatnot. I also believe that the competitive scene and the community in general is more or less dead by now, and there won't be any more updates to this completely unpolished game. The game had potential in the alpha, and I had a lot of fun with it, but now it's definitely not worth the price.","October 30, 2014","false","308.9"," 114 of 125 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","114","125","0","1"

So after more than a year playing this game I decided to exercise my rights of writing a review.\nDo NOT under any circumstances buy this game. Not even in a sale. It's completely broken. Oh boy where to start and where to finish with this game... The netcode is even worse than what it was during early Alpha/Beta stages or the released version for that matter. It's pretty much unplayable in this state today, with players "teleporting" even with low or average pings, due to bad netcoding. Ghost hits are still present in this game completely removing the "skill factor" and replacing it with something like a "luck factor" due to the the bad netcoding resulting in a lagfest. So many map glitches still present... You can even feint an attack and the opponent would get damaged out of nowhere...\nThis is just bad, I don't want to continue writing such a negative review for a game I loved during early Alpha/Beta stages but they left us, unfortunately, with no choice. If you think the released version of WotV was bad, just take a look at the game at its current state. Basically the only thing they got right after so many patches are the shields. But that's about it, the rest of the game is broken.","December 22, 2014","false","924.4"," 129 of 149 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","129","149","4","10"

You have to say it exemplifies Fatshark's ineptitude at making a game that is even slightly polished. Frankly, it is an utter embarrassment in that regard.\n\nORIGINAL:\nHaving played the first installment of the 'War of' games for over 1500 hours one might be inclined to call me a fan of the style of game Fatshark had created and I was hugely enthusiatic about the next chapter in what could be a blossoming franchise.\n\nHowever,  the game has failed miserably in delivering an improved performance and gaming experience on the previous game. This is a watered down version of War of the Roses, but by no means does that make it easy. Hitboxes are non-existent as the game is all about movement of you body postion rather than skill/precision of aiming your weapon and feinting attacks. Consequently if you get average FPS (like me) then you need to steer well clear of this title as smoothness is imperative.\n\nFIghting mechanics seemed to have had a huge overhaul in WotV, which isn't necessarily a good thing. There are 3 ways to attack (when in melee combat) instead of the 4 in WotR and there are perks that can give you 'autoblock' for one specific direction, taking the total number of ways to concentrate on to 2. You also have the ability to carry out special attacks, which if connect give insta-kills (or so I believe). Thanks to the above the game provides no real satisfaction when killing an opponent (during melee), as you don't feel like it materialized through your in-game education or skill progression, but rather came about thanks to the hack and slash elements of the game. Don't get me wrong, there is skill in EVERY game, but it isn't a skill that inspires you to learn more, want more and basically....play more.\n\nRanged wise the game has got similarities to WotR and there wasn't a desperate need for change, as the ranged system was smooth and worked well. It was satisfying and still is, with the addition of throwing weapons like axes etc it has added another string to it's bow, so to speak, so all in all ranged is pretty good.\n\nIn addition to the new implementations on the ranged side of things, customization has also been given a boost. Though so far I haven't seen anywhere near the weapon count of WotR, having said that it is in beta and will almost certainly be getting more content as the game develops. Nevertheless customizing the look of your character is still good. Capes, beards and helmets are all included as is the look of you clothes...I think.\n\nGraphically the game is still pretty nice, I am not sure if it is as good as the previous game, but that is something YOU should make your mind up on. Although let it be said it certainly isn't bad!\n\nThere are issues with server drop outs and total game crashes, which one would hope to see ironed out when the final product is released. However I wouldn't hold your breath as these issues are a known problem on WotR and have so far been overlooked in every patch release.\n\nIn all honesty on a personal note I was hoping for a re-skin of War of the Roses with maybe a few new features chucked in, whilst seeing some of the bugs and glitches addressed. Unfortunately that was not the case, and instead of getting a very in depth, hand to hand combat game like it's predecessor, we were provided with a competitor to Chivalry for the people who have an ephemeral attention span, want a quick fix and nothing more. It does have some new features which are nice, but the core of the game is just poo.\n\nFor the discerning consumer out there, do youself a favour and give War of the Roses a try (and give it some time) or, if you want a quick fix go for Chivalry, but don't waste your hard earned cash on this sloppy execution of a game. For people wanting and expecting War of the Roses part 2, forget it, it is a completely different game. For those wanting a Chivalry emulator, snap this puppy up and spam until your hearts content.\n\nIn conclusion, a thoroughly disappointing game. Essentially it is all geared towards a fast paced, hack and slash game rather than the slower, more realistic fighting we came to love (and loathe) on WotR. Given time I am sure that improvements will be made, but addressing the core fighting mechanics is essential and unfortunately that is not going to happen.\n\n3/10","February 2, 2014","false","354.8"," 390 of 515 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","390","515","0","25"

DO NOT BUY, WASTE OF MONEY.\n\nReal Review: This used to be my favorite game. I bought the base version back in October of 2013 and eventually wound up buying both the $30 and (now defunct) $120 upgrade. I was the first NA player to hit rank 60 and was ranked 5th in the list of earned exp upon the game's full release. This is a little bit of my War of the Vikings pedigree and I'm presenting it to you to prove that, when it comes to this game, I know what I'm talking about. I also like to brag.\n\nThroughout this game's history it's had  many ups and downs. Unfortunately, there has never been as much of a down down as this current down. Its almost as though the last developer to work on this game had some sort of down... syndrome. Now while that little bit of sodium might make it sound like I'm some bitter oldtimer who's sh!tposting about the direction the game is headed in, please believe me when I say that I'm not. I've enjoyed a solid 975 of the 983 hours I've spent playing  this game - I've gotten my money's worth. The unfortunate thing about this game is that if you buy it today, you will  not  have the same experience that I did.\n\nTo illustrate why this is, I've created a very simple pros and cons list. While this list would have been massively different before the game's original dev team left in late 2014, the work of WotVs  most recent developer  has left the game in this very unfortunate state.\n\nPros:\nnone\n\nMajor Cons:\nterrible hit detection (and the game is massively reliant upon hit detection)\nfrequent in-game crashes\ndead player base (haven't seen more than 30 online in FOREVER, usually 0-10 online)\nno single-player\nslated for no further development\n\nMinor Cons:\nstartup crashes (I've had to relaunch 8 or 9 times on multiple occasions)\nterrible design choices (my opinion, arguable)\nNorth Korean forum moderation (dissenting threads locked, terrible design choices militantly defended)\n\n\nNow after reading that you might be thinking "if this really is the current state of the game, why is it still being sold?" And to that question, I have no answer. From a moral perspective, this game should  not be for sale. If you really, truly love viking stuff you might be able to squeeze out a grand total of 5 hours of enjoyment from this piping hot pile of garbage. After that I promise you that every time you launch this game you'll feel the deep, deep shame that can only come from watching the type of porn that has to be viewed through a proxy server. The type of shame that makes you think "why am I doing this - why am I alive?"\n\nI just can not stress to you how much this game sucks.","May 10","false","982.9"," 72 of 79 people (91%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","91","72","79","15","2"

It has some great charms and some VERY satisfying combat from time to time, but it face plants in so many areas that make it impossible to enjoy either of those. You will find: spawning issues, indecipherable hit boxes, striped down customization, infuriating bugs, a few balance issues , and an overall feeling of a lack of polish. All that is especially irritating for those coming off of War of the Roses and wondering where everything went.\n\nAnd it’s a shame too, because War  of the Vikings is a game I genuinely WANT to be good. The potential is all there, I can almost see myself having a great time, but its cut off at the knees by large list of things that could have easily been prevented. It feels like a game that needs a few more months of dev. time, even after letting players PAY to test play it. The lower $25 price point is not enough to justify that kind of letdown, and that is what it is, a letdown.\n","April 19, 2014","false","10.0"," 138 of 179 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","138","179","0","2"

I sent Paradox message asking for current game statement since we had not heard from them awhile... then i got sad news back...\n\nhttp://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?803911-Statement-regarding-the-War-franchise\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStatement regarding the War franchise\nGreetings community!\n\nWe are writing you today to inform you what is happening with the War franchise, most importantly War of the Vikings but also its predecessor War of the Roses. This announcement has been some time in the making and has been no easy conclusion, yet we aim to be as transparent as possible. So, with no further ado, here is what is happening.\nWe are stopping sales of the Valhalla edition - effective immediately\nAll Valhalla owners will receive a large selection of Paradox Interactive's games on steam (added directly to their steam libraries), estimated value circa $800 as compensation. This will appear within a few days\nValhalla owners will also keep their Valhalla privileges - nothing will change here\nWar of the Vikings will see two patches to increase stability and solve major issues - after this we will cease patching and have no plans to support the game further through updates/fixes\nServers will continue to stay active until further notice\nWar of the Roses will see no further development\nWhy are we doing this? To put it simple and straight forward; We've looked at this from every single angle (that's why it's taken time for us to come to this conclusion) over and over and we just can't find a way where we can keep developing the games without operating at a loss. War of the Vikings did not live up to our expectations and we could not find a reasonable scenario where we could bring it up to par quality wise.\n\nWe have chosen to patch Vikings in order to bring it to a better state, so that current players can continue to enjoy what we have today with increased stability.\n\nSincerely,\nThe War Team\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI can understand its not cool to have a productive team working on a dead title... but there are so much you should have done before... is it like you guys are making a game without thinking or having the funding for a period of time after launch.. Patching and making your game baby shine!\n\nMake the game F2P and add some cosmetics like beards etc. or maps or DLC stuff , seems like this game has alot of servers running. Its cool as H... when playing with friends so i dont get it, but that is why you are publishers and im not im sure ! Its really sad seeing this leave and hate that its called dead :(.\n\nI think i will not support anymore of your Games from now on, i feel like this is a trending strategy.. seeing it more and more.\n\nNext time, have your baby and feed it with content and care for it! dont tuckle it in a blanket with 2 patches and throw it in the bin and act like we "wallet" dont understand whats going on ! Peace\n\n\n\nMspaint Out","October 7, 2014","true","59.6"," 42 of 61 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","42","61","0","4"

The only major upside to this game over its predecessor is that Vikings is not horribly imbalanced due to a series of progressively more destructive patches by the ever so responsive developers.  Though not as casual as Chivalry, Vikings displays how great game mechanics can be essentially ruined in order to appeal to a more general audience of casual gamers.  Hopefully, as this pattern continues we'll see an increased push for hardcoar game developers to make the move to mobile platforms.  After all, because casual games sell far better than any niche PC game, they are obviously better, rite?","May 2, 2014","false","73.6"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","28","38","0","0"

Fast-paced and combat intensive. Although sometimes laggy and player with high ping are a little troublesome but everything is alright and playable. I had fun.

Then you died because of hit from nowhere. This is common. You will also meet people teleporting or move like phantom. These problems exist almost in everyone who still play this game (no more than 50 every day). You won't meet player easily since most server are ghost server.

Now I can run the game with all textures on high and antialising at 60 fps or more. Shadows must be disabled as well as the cloth effects (physics).\n\n//////////////////////////\n\nGeneral description:\n- It isn't the same as WoTR. Some people prefer one, some people prefer the other one. This is more dynamic, and fast paced game with less variables and easier handling.\n- Hard at start if you have not played M&B or WoTR but either way is a challenging game.\n- Smaller maps than WoTR to increase game speed, but usually with more ways to flank the enemy.\n- Beautiful art, graphics and music.\n\nCons:\n- Unbalance with some weapons. Some day one, some day another. And some spammeable and lammer game mechanics can annoy you sometimes as in the majority of games.\n- Bad servers (Multiplay) and ATM you can only rent them, so you cannot make a dedicated server in your own machine.\n- Lag related issues. The ping is fine in Europe but as I said, the bad server performance is ruining the game. (I have to say that this may not be directly the fault of the developers of WOTV)\n- Game performance is worse than before. For me, of course. Now I have to run the game in 'low' settings except the textures to achieve 35-65 FPS. (My specs in top).\n- Gameplay bugs. The shields don't work perfectly, some crappy animations, etc.\n\nPros:\n- The game will be supported for a long time. Solving issues, balancing, adding a lot of content, etc.\n- Good customization level and options, and this will increase with time.\n- The game can be really enjoyable regardless of winning or losing, etc. but you have to take your time to master the playstyle. So be patient if someone instakill you every time, or if you can't hit/parry anybody.\n(That is fine, you will be good in less time than in WoTR. It is easier to play for newcomers, but still hard to master).\n- External anticheat system. This was a very great thing.\n- You can sprint :D\n- Cosmetics only. The item's stats are equal in a sword that costs 320 coins to another that costs 30000. That allow new players to play in the same conditions as a veteran. It just will look ugliest or more beautiful.\n\nConclusions:\n\nIf you don't have patience, this may not be your game. Neither if you expect be the king  in your first match.\n\nIf you can deal with some bugs, lammers and archers (I won't lie you, sometimes is an arrow fest) you will have good moments.\n\nI approve this game, it could be better but i'm sure it will get better. It's just a matter of time.\n\n////////////////////////////////////  VERY OLD  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nGreat game in BETA stage. I think it's a logic evolution of its predecessor (War of the Roses).\nThe combat speed has been increased and the animations are much more smooth and realistic. The learning curve is long, its a hard and kinda frustrating game at the begining. (If you come from WoTR the learning curve will be much more soft).\n\nFAQ: It's the same as WoTR? - No, it isn't. The evolution is really tangible; improved graphics, physics, animations, (for now) balance. New weapons, fight styles, attacks, habilities and game mechanics.\n\nIn my opinion it is less difficult to play than WoTR and more satisfactory. For now, all the weapons are pretty well balanced, you can win a fight with all of them, really the acquired skill and teamplay are your best friends.\n\nPros in beta stage:\n- Really enjoyable and funny. (For now without xp and customizing system)\n- In my case without performance issues since the alpha stage. (GTX 470)\n- The developers are there listening and answering to the players.\n- When you win a close battle is really satisfactory.\n\nCons in beta stage:\n- Third party anti-cheat system isn't enabled yet so there are a lot of speedhackers.\n(It will be applied in a few weeks).\n- Due to the pre-release stage, the difficulty, and the "casual" players that has only played a few minutes, the servers are usually not full, and in Europe is difficult to play passed 2:00 a.m.\n- few little maps and game modes for now, a little repetitive.\n\nCya and sorry for my english!","December 28, 2013","true","354.9"," 114 of 199 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","114","199","0","4"

While authentic in its setting and certainly in the right place with its concept, execution in War of the Vikings isn't on point yet to become enjoyable. With disjointed character animations and imprecise flailing, no matter how careful the input, the finesse it wants to achieve for melee driven combat and that which it allows with awkward positioning patterns are not on the same wavelength yet. It's not in any sense irreparable, but so far this is a game that only veterans will pick up, wrestle through to handle and subsequently crush any new blood that may have an inkling towards it; creating an aversion where it should promote a community.\n\n"It's not the position in which you stand, but the direction that you face."\n\nEDIT: Since this review, the game has seen numerous patches between 5GB and 13GB.

Their are many different strategies and everyone will find their favorite be it sword, axe, archer etc. I do not have any other experience to compare it to as i have not played Chivalry or others. I have received my moneys worth and if they can expand this into pirates, and other eras like Greeks, Romans etc will give it added life. Give it a shot, I just love the show Vikings and the historical aspects of it. I gave it a try when it was free for a weekend and you can join right in and play. It will take you a few hours or more to get things down but believe me slaughtering your opponent or taking down 2 or 3 solo is a thrill. You also will get a little tense, and aches and pains from the stress of combat.

If Fatshark would make this into a single player game this would be INCREDIBLE! It would sink Mount and Blade and leave others in its genre in the dust. However, I find the multiplayer experience to be miserable and few in choice as far as map and or game style. Almost no one plays this anymore and those who do run about exploiting the many unbalanced special attacks and weapons in game. The same goes for War of the Roses which, in my opinion once more, is a far more thought through gaming experience. Fatshark, you guys are genius for bringing the battlefield feel to the ancient fields of England. But, without the singleplayer rpg element to give your amazing fighting engine any real purpose but to "teabag" players I can't and won't play these anymore. I'm a decent player besieged by frustration. Please give this engine and set of mechanics a deeper world to play in.","August 17, 2015","false","30.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Read on! This is an alpha and full release review.\n\nI wouldn't go near this game until it has been released fully.\nStill keen? Expect 5gig+ patches every two weeks or monthly. I have downloaded over 20gig of patches in the last 8 weeks for stuff all changes, with that sort of patch volume I'd expect big changes or more content, neither were apparent. When you ask the devs whats up with the huge patches you will have the question removed from the forum, truly awesome work devs.\nThe player base is tiny, being an Oceanic gamer it is even smaller, not even remotely worth it.\nMy opinion; stick with War of roses, do not give these guys a dime until the finished product is out, they don't deserve it.\nFYI; take note of when the positive reviews for this game happened, very few people are happy with the state of play in 2014.\n\nPOST FULL VERSION LAUNCH.\nThe game is still garbage, the devs continue to push out 5gig patches every couple of weeks to add one or two swords or tweak a class. The game is a joke, the balance is getting worse, the combat clunkier, the range combat is a waste of time. The devs could care less about finishing as they could about adding more DLC for kids to buy. How you can release DLC less than a month after an official launch and not give to preaccess and alpha is disgusting and should tell you all you need to know about these devs and what they think of the consumer.\n\nWar of Roses was/ is a better game; armor, range, better levels, mounted combat. Its just better (yes even with its current balance).\nWar of vikings; waste of money, the devs should of kept working on roses, this is the same game with different textures, a clunkier-crappier combat system and none of the above mentioned features.

Being a Paradox fan I was very happy when I found out that they have decided to make a game with Vikings. Having played War of the Roses I have to admit that the experience is far worse than I have expected. The weapons, life bar and stamina are creating difficulties to newer players as two hits, or even one can prove fatal. You find that you remain without stamina quite often whilst you wonder how your foe manages to strike so many times...the worst though is the defence mechanics. The shield or sword/axe parry has a 'limited' function as you cannot defend yourself too much as the stamina bar gowes down really fast and it doesn't cover too much of an area.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that whilst in War of the Roses you earn a decent amount of money with which you can upgrade and customize yourself in War of the Vikings you have to put some money becasue after a match you'll find that you haven't earned even for a new weapon.\n\nLastly, I am very disappointed about the fact that I have to close down certain features of my antivirus and start Steam on Administrator mod if I want to play it as the AntiCheat fails to start and I believe that is why many of the servers are now empty (far too many errors and bugs).","May 8","false","17.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awaketoolong/recommended/234530/","awaketoolong","AwakeTooLong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awaketoolong/","104 products in account","I've been a big fan of Paradox, and the games that they have taken part in, since Mount and Blade. And one of the things that I've enjoyed most is the continued evolution of deep, intricate combat systems that truly reward the player for knowing where to strike at opponent (observing armored vs. less armored locations on the body, head shots, etc.), cultivating the skill to aim for those locations with various weapon systems, and all the while providing a solid parry/attack system.\n\nAs a fan, I felt that I owed it to the company to reign in my initial reactions and not say anything terribly negative about the game until its release. Indeed, among my friends, I even suggested that they might enjoy the game. It was beta, after all, and certain to offer a great deal of improvements.\n\nThe game has been released now though, and I can't help but to express some disappointment.\n\nLet me first give the positive bits though.\n\nThe game offers a fun exchange of quick, hack and slash violence. There is some skill involved in learning to properly parry incoming attacks and, well, anyone considering such a game will almost certainly enjoy reveling and shouting out a taunt that heals yourself while you stand amid a heap of your enemy's writhing corpses.  This, and other similar scenarios, are certainly rewarding.\n\nBut that is about where the rewards end.\n\nThe complexity of Paradox and Fat Shark's War of the Roses has largely been discarded in favor of faster pacing and more arcade-like play that departs somewhat from the "skill-based" combat that is advertised in this franchise. Worse yet, the technical problems within War of the Roses were ignored, if not intensified, and allowed to continue to be a problem within War of the Vikings.\n\nIn War of the Vikings, armor is all but meaningless, with the "Champion"  classes offering only a slight increase to the number of times you can be hit (in comparison to the two other classes of "Warrior" and "Skirmisher")  whereas in War of the Roses armor could entirely ward off enemy blows unless they struck weak spots in that armor's design.\n\nWeapons too have been simplified. Whereas War of the Roses offered dozens of options, each with some variation in speed, damage, reach, armor penetration, etc., War of the Vikings instead offers you a two handed axe, a sword, a spear, a one handed axe, throwing spears, throwing axes, throwing knives, a hunting bow, and a long bow.\n\nThat is it.\n\nAfter extended periods of play you do unlock coins that you may use to purchase variations of these weapons, but insofar as I understand, these variations are purely aesthetic. There is no variation in their performance - they just look cool. Similarly, through advancing in level and gaining coins, you may also unlock different color schemes for your clothing, or acquire capes, or paint new designs on your shields.  By comparison, painting your shield was something you did at any level you desired in War of the Roses - unlocking a new shield with new stats that impacted how you played was something you could be rewarded with through play.\n\nBeyond this over-simplification of play, I also find that lag - though much improved since alpha and beta play - has more of an impact on play than in near any other multiplayer game I have ever played. In most games, latency will impact the player who is lagging most severely. Sometimes other players may see them skip or whatever, but usually it doesn't impact them horribly.  In War of the Vikings, if another player is lagging, the fallout seems to result in more global rammifications.  Players near another player with high ping, or lag, will also skip about or "teleport". Their weapon reaches become unpredictably long or short, attacks will impact before/after it appears they should, and your own attacks may pass right through them. In a game that is purely multiplayer, this is entirely unacceptable. Smooth play resulting from good servers and good coding should be a priority.\n\nAll of these were problems, to a lesser extent, in the previous game in the franchise. It is disappointing to see that these technical problems, along with various stability issues, have been ignored if not intensified.\n\nMy overall impression is that the developers of War of the Vikings paid far too much attention to the critics who had compared their previous title, War of the Roses, to Chivalry.\n\nInstead of listening to their fans and providing us with a complex combat system and richly rewarding level progression system, we have been given a watered down, arcade-like game desperately seeking to capture the faster and more brutal play of another franchise. And, even in this, it fails, offering nothing of the visceral immersion, gore, and savage ragdoll physics that made Chivalry what it was.\n\nHad I not purchased the game in Alpha, I may well not have bought the game seeing what it is today. $25 is too much, I feel, for what they have provided. And I certainly find it laughable that they are charging $175.00 for a special edition that offers so little - as of now, it means that you save $5.00 on DLC, which consists entirely of a digital novel based on a game, based on a time period.  Personally? I'll pay five bucks for a book that has actually been published.\n","April 20, 2014","false","132.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Combat is fast, graphics are nice, and it is damn satisfying to murder an enemy player with an axe. That being said it has a long road ahead of itself in order to deliver a worthy end result.\n\nIn its current state the game plays well enough. Random crashes, disconnects, and the trouble with actually swinging your weapon the direction you want make this game frustrating on a higher level of play. There are some hit detection issues along with several simple "wtf" moments where lag will have your weapon/arrows go straight through an enemy player. These issues have NOT stopped me from putting 20 hours into the game though.\n\nIf this game was going for 5-10 dollars I could recommend this game.

But then, they decided, lets limit that fun. Warriors cannot sprint without putting their weapon on their backs, for some reason, this was implemented, i am assuming to stop people from sprinting into combat swinging? but that couldn't be it, because that would add so much fun to the game.\nBut, probably the worst decision that was made, was to add an energy bar, i guess it is to stop people from swinging a lot, but that's what people wanted from this game, they wanted that fast paced action packed feeling, only to be greeted with absurdly unrealistic limitations. I want to have to block 15-20 swings in a 10 second fight, i want that thrill, that rush, the feeling one might expect from being a viking. But instead we are given a slow game, that makes it feel like we are all terribly hung over warriors, decades past our prime swinging heavy sticks, losing our breath after just a bare few swings. gone are the days warriors trained to endure i guess.\n\nI just feel massively let down by this game, i thought it was going to be what war of the roses almost was before it was drenched in honey, making combat slow and boring. Although, the game might have changed? i haven't really been able to play it to test since a few months after it came out, considering how no one plays the game anymore. Its all a massive shame, i had high hopes, now i guess all i can do is wait for mount and blade 2, and hope they don't destroy that too, by catering to the slow of block.\n\ndid the designers just not want to do new weapons? power strike was awesome, if a 2nd is made, and they keep the energy bar, lets hope they make it so that it only gets drained by sprinting and power strike, its too short a bar, and recovers too slowly for it to be used for everything.","May 17, 2015","false","7.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's the ultimate shallow of an arcade-ish game.\n\nThe game looks very nice, but that is it. There are 'perks' that don't really do anything, a skilled player can dominate whole game playing as any class. Compared to War of the Roses, the armor and weapons, types and the quality of the armor/weapons actually meant something, while War of the Vikings is just a cash grab.\n\n- All items are cosmetic, they do not add anything, the whole grind is just for you to open cosmetic crap that has no value.\n- Not to mention that all servers are dominated by IG clan, who go around ruining all the fun when they please.\n- Game had numerous bugs, crash issues, laggy lags and ultimate BS that could never possibly happen (we're talking about stuff defying physical laws etc.)\n\nBut the biggest blow surely was the debacle of 'Valhalla' edition. As we know, nowadays people have very low customer conscience, they do not respect the money they have, so a lot of people just decided it was okay to blow around 160€ on an edition that promised BS. They blew 160€ on stuff like 'instant unlock' or items and bunch of 'rare items' that made other people jealous until they were forced by their weak will to buy this edition.\n\nThe game edition also promised 'all future content unlocked' but how are you supposed to know if the actual worth of the released content will ever, and I mean ever, match the total of money you paid for the supposed 'future content'?\n\nTL:DR this game is an expensive, shallow, buggy, laggy, arcadish rip-off of a non-gaming abortion experiment made by inexperienced man-children from Fatshark (fat as in they have fat pockets from all the money), because Paradox needed another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cash grab.

Most glaring issue right now is the random lock-ups that last 2-3 seconds every 10 minutes or so.  You are also de-synced from the server for a few additional seconds afterwards.  More than likely you will be dead by the time the game resyncs.  The spawning system also needs work.  The game tries to spawn you right next to a fight which occasionally results in you getting instantly hacked down by a sea of enemies or vice-versa when an enemy spawns in the midst of your team.  You can't pick where you want to spawn either.  On top of this there are still Crash to Desktop issues.  In fact, I'm writing this review now after just having a random CTD in the middle of match for the umpteenth time.\nAlthough this game is supposed to a spiritual successor to War of the Vikings, a lot of good features were removed.  No execution animations, no armor choices, no attack styles (ie swing faster but less damage), no bleeding/burning, no difference in piercing, blunt, slashing damage, etc etc etc\n\nHopefully these issues will be fixed with in time.

Blocking sucks as well especially with shield - when it comes to axes it seems to be not so bugged.. however when it comes to 2h axed. Oh man it just gets past you shield no sense blocking.

I could complain about issues of this game but i do not want to waste anymore time on this ultimate fail product. As for pros game can be fun for like 1 minute for every hour and is about vikings. I was giving this game several chances to step up to have at least bereable mechanics and gameplay. It failed me every time. I do not recommend playing. Just save yourself time and money.

Is historical credibility is appalling, the game mechanics perform badly, it is not an approachable game for a newcomer or casual player, and there is no good motivation to continue playing it.\n\nFull review:\n\nAlthough it might first appear as an historical title, War of the Vikings fails miserably in this regard. Weapons include 15th century daggers, 16th century pikes, and so on, but miss out on many period weapons (such as seaxes, after which the Saxons were named!). Armour is worse, with horned helmets, feathered headgear and armours from the middle-east. There are no historical battle sites and maps are simply generic locations... including epic towering monastaries or Skyrim-esque glaciers. And the in-game warriors can do lots of other non-historical things, all the way from running around impaled with multiple javelins through to techno-dancing. Although there is no obligation for developers to stick to fact, the flights of fantasy in this game really detracts from the historical immersion.\n\nBut War of the Vikings does not make up for it with game play. The mechanics are random in places, with weapons simply passing through without damage, or you can often do more damage with the haft of the axe than the head of it. Server glitches and crashes are common place, even on sparsely-populated servers. This level of unreliability (even on ping-limited servers, using good computers with good connections) is extremely frustrating. Even the graphics, which are okay, are really demanding on even good computer systems. You really need a first-class Internet connection and top-notch machine with a superb frame rate to even contemplate this title.\n\nFrom the perspective of someone who has never played other hand-to-hand combat games, the learning curve on War of the Vikings is brutal. There is scant documentation (only a single splash screen showing the key presses) and a woefully inadequate tutorial. There is no single-player game to train you up nor are there any matched-skill servers. The community comprises mostly elite veterans and you can expect to spend a lot of time staring at the spawn-in screen.  While there are some exceptions, I have found a disproportinate level of arrogance and contempt in games. Even the so-called "friendly clans" take delight in abusing inexperienced players.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, there is no motivation to play. The weapons/armour are all equal in combat value. This is okay in terms of balance, but for a modest amount of playtime, you can get any loadout and perks. Thus upgrades are not an incentive to play. The ability to purchase expensive-looking clothes and capes might appeal to some, but it is not a huge motivation to persevere with being cut down time after time. The Steam achievements totally lack imagination and are mostly way beyond the reach of the average player, who just wants to recreate the Viking/Saxon battle experience.\n\nAlthough there are some nice touches (for example the use of Old English/Icelandic for the voices and a wonderful soundtrack), this game is frustrating and quickly becomes tedious. Out of a love of this era of history, I have stuck with it and have trained hard at it, but it remains demoralising and uninspiring. This is a pity because the idea has potential. But as it stands at present, it is simply not worth the effort.","June 28, 2014","false","272.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's hard, the mechanics take some getting used to and it takes hours and hours to get to a point where you can confidently head out on to the battlefield, but that is what drew me so deep into the heart of the game.\n\nI am glad I hopped in so early in the development, because I came into this as an absolute beginner. I've never played Mount & Blade, I've never played War of the Roses. It was a completely new system of combat and holy ♥♥♥♥ did it kick my ♥♥♥. I was next to useless for at least 10 hours. It was frustrating... I would run into a group of guys and get hacked to death over and over, they were so much better than me... but I kept with it.\n\nEarly on, the game had no reviving system, no way to heal teammates, it was just barebones fighting and it was chaotic. Having no one to coordinate with, it's really easy to get overwhelmed by opponents. Any fool with an two handed axe can kill you if he can get a good swing in. Death is waiting behind every rock, every corner and you can't escape it. You had to learn to put up a fight.\n\nThe game is much more finely tuned after many patches and fixes along the way, but it still has it's share of bugs and glitches. Most times I find that the team markers (blue/green or red highlights) don't work as intended. It can be quite easy to mistake an ally without a highlight for an untagged enemy and you are going to pay for it with -XP based on damage dealt.  Team kills are a common occurance, as should be expected in a close quarters brawl with axes and swords flailing about wildly. That's where practice comes in.\n\nThe way weapons work in this game is brilliant, in my opinion. All purchasable weapons are nothing more than just skins, meaning that anyone with the basic rusty longsword is just as effective as someone with an expensive sword. This forces a set and controlled balance to the combat. I am not talking 100% balance here... I just mean that you know everyone else is just as dangerous as you. Technically. Proper positioning and footwork play a huge factor in winning a fight.\n\nWhile some aspects are balanced, some things are not quite there yet... Ask anyone playing right now, the Two-Handed axe and heavy armour are the most common sight in-game. Anyone good enough can one shot your head clean off and just continue to steam roll through hordes of enemies, lopping heads like weed whacker in a field of dandelions. It can be incredibly discouraging for new players to join a server with veteran players.\n\nA skilled player understands the mechanics to a point where all they have to do is watch for animation clues and they will be able to parry, block, or dodge just about anything. A new player will most likely be slaughtered while paired against a skilled player, but not always. One mistake is all it takes for either side to gain an edge. That being said, most new players, after finding the F key is a special attack that generally kills, will spam the hell out that move, along with dodge attacks. This is not a good idea and while it may score you some satisfying kills, it's a good way to get yourself killed while you are stuck in the animations of the special.\n\nThe thing about this game is that it is punishing. Most players don't want to invest the time to acquire the skills required in this game to be any good at all. You have to push through the relentless deaths, either by enemies or allies alike, you can't let the game make you give up. Don't come into it thinking you are going to be hot ♥♥♥♥ right from the get go and then start raging when you die. No one wants to hear you complain endlessly in game about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the mechanics are, only because you don't understand them. Yes. Shields are hard to use and they do need to work on that. Yes, parry delay is a thing and it frustrates the hell out of everyone even sort of competetive. It is a frustration generating, rage inducing, all-out brawl and nothing is going to change that, you just have to learn to hold your own and work together with the team. That is what brings me back, battle after battle.\n\nSo, If you are like me and really enjoy a good competetive challenge, you're not afraid to put a little effort in learning the mechanics and are looking for a game with a generally supportive community, I would pick up a copy and try it out for myself. No review is going to convey to you how a game really feels, you have to experience it for yourself.","April 23, 2014","true","020.0"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Though I can't really recommend this game now, it may turn into something rather entertaining.  Pretty much the easiest way to get damage and kills is by playing archer(so lots of archers), plus the maps are set as such that there are only a few paths to follow.  Meaning you have to run these corridors of arrow-y death, no flanking allowed.  Oh there might be a secret back path, but there's usually only 1 and it's not secret.  Plus the random peeps with mega-scores and extra-zip in their step.  Maps are small.  Combat is rather floaty with no weight to it.  A two hander swings about the same as a one hander which has about the same feel as a javelin.  Visually it is nice.\n\nThere are other games out there of this genre and they are all quite similar, so why would you play more than one?  This game needs to be something special to stand out, and currently, it just isn't.","December 6, 2013","false","0.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

It would seem that different swings would have different hitboxes.  Swinging left-right hits a wider arc than up-down, right?  Well, no.  It appears that all of your melee attacks only strike directly in front of you.  Also, they have a height component.  Regardless of the animation, your attack hitboxes aren't a very large rectangle.\n\nNow, either related to the poor attack hitboxes, or just buggy hit detection, or just bad lag compensation, I've literally clipped INSIDE of people and been unable to hit them with melee.  Then moments later, swing at someone as they sprinted away and got them three steps out.  I've blocked and had attacks blocked by a shield from directly behind.\n\nI couldn't even play half an hour before I finally gave up in frustration.

When I bought it back in alpha it was incredibly fun, well balanced, and compelling. I poured hours into the game and became one of the best players. For a while I thought that this game had a real future and the potential for serious competitive play...because the skill curve was so high.\n\nIt saddens me...quite sincerely...to see that the game has failed. The concept was beautiful and amazingly fun. I wish it had been better...but alas, it was not to be.\n\nThe developers made a few changes before the game went into beta and it changed the game's feelilng. I think it was to appeal to a wider audience...but they made it 'easier'. It's hard to describe. If you couple this with their growing latency problems (ping was a huge factor), and the fact that they refused to listen to the community about balance crippled the game. I recall making a suggestion, seeing it implemented, and then having it taken away because of people whining.\n\nThe problem that doomed the game from the start is that for a certain niche of players, it was amazing. In fact...it was stunning. The problem was that the skill curve was very high and most new players were destroyed over and over until they quit (or until the developers decided to change things).\n\nBy the time the game was released, it was essentially waiting for the nail in the coffin. The community, realizing that the game was not turning out like they wanted, abandoned it. I stopped playing...and the rest of my clan, the best clan in the game, left. We never really played again.\n\nSuch is the story of War of the Vikings. A game with great promise marred by broken mechanics and bad netcode. I wish there was a way to go back in time and revert the game ot the alpha. If that was the case, I would return and play again...but I know it won't happen.\n\nMy advice. Don't bother. The game has died.","November 20, 2013","false","154.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Loved War of the Roses but they just couldnt copy paste the combat system from that game, which is the main flaw of the game. The game isnt even well optimized i experiance low framerate everywhere, on low graphics, wotr looked just as good and i had no problems with that game. But back to the faulty combat, there are few good things in it like the special attacks and evade, but rest of it is just garbage version of wotr. Blocking is too slow, weapons dont break, hitboxes are out of the window and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t revival and ability ♥♥♥♥ im definetly gonna whine about. firstly blocking was amazing in wotr it was fast and it was responsive, now you have barely enough time to block incoming attacks. Weapons need to be able to break, i dont get why they traded this away, it was fun it added depth. And this is my most major thing about this whole thing... the hitboxes, wotr had accurate hitboxes, you could block a swing by moving the hitbox in front of the attack, that was amazing, shields seem to have lost their blocking power also since you cant just move the shield in the path of the possible atacks... no the shield needs to take the direct attack to stop it, what a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. then there are the reviving... i dont get why people wanna make games where injuries heal in a flash. And then there is also the abilities im gonna briefly mention, get rid of the chaser and just bring back tackle.

I played a good long while in the beta and was at first, quite impressed with what they had.  However, I was expecting...well, more at release.\n\nYes, there are bugs and hit detection issues, those are all true but I can push past that.  What I couldn't look past were the very, very weak game modes that ended up hurting any excitement I might have had while playing.  There's just...nothing worth fighting for in this game.\n\nEssentially, there are two modes; team death match and a sort of "invasion" which requires the teams to push for territories.  In the end though, the second mode never ends in anything but which team made it the furthest before time runs out.\n\nI mean, I have issues with Chivalry because its very unbalanced, but I'm sorry I would still rather play that than this.  Hell, go play War of the Roses instead of this because over all, its just not that fun.\n\nWhich is frustrating because the combat, give or take some issues, is actually fast and aggressive.   Had there been dismemberment added, I would have loved it even more.\n\nAlas, the great combat just isn't enough to carry this game.  Which is very, very sad indeed.  If I had my way, I would take THIS combat and put it in the backdrop of Chivalry, which would essentially give me the ideal melee focused combat game I've always wanted.\n\nAs of now though, I just can't recommend this game.  I sincerely wish Fatshark the best of luck but I do not see how they expect us to swim in so shallow a pond.","May 18, 2014","false","13.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Seems those are rare.\nI think most of the negative reviews come from people who played War of the Roses (previous game), I haven't played it tho, to be completely honest I didn't even know it existed before playing War of the Vikings, so my view on it might be different because of that.\nI really enjoyed this game, played quite a bit and to me it's a pretty cool solid medieval combat game. I think the berserker patch ruined it a little bit tho. Berserkers seem off, seem like they are kind of those uninvited guests that everyone has to deal with because their mechanics are really different from the core challenge and mechanics of the game. Still is a solid pick in my humblest opinion.\n\nI haven't played War of the Roses so take this with a grain of salt, but from what I've seen and read, if you come from that game this is apparently a downgrade and simplified version which you probably wont like.\nIgnoring that fact tho and seeing it as a standalone tittle, this is pretty fun! Plus if you like the whole Viking nord aesthetic and feel, for sure!\nAlso bear in mind that the community is for the most part dead at this point sadly. Haven't played it in a while, but it already was the case, there is still a couple full-ish servers most of the time, but don't expect a large community.","June 19, 2015","true","119.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I hsve played this and war of the roses now WOTR I have 30 some odd hours playing only because I got a rig that could run it properly a year after it was out and at that point it was f2p and no one wanted it cause it was that bad taht you couldn't give it away. War of the Vikings problems start off small but the grow exponentially. In the beta fase a lot of people got random crashes and got randomly sent back to the main menu with no reason, I still get this I figure others still do to. My blood eagle armour customisations got turned off with the most reasent update an accident I'm sure but no respectible game maker ♥♥♥♥s simple ♥♥♥♥ like that up. Sheilds don't work if you are hell bent on getting this game no matter how many bad reviews it gets do not use a shield any weapon can go around it or just plain through it. Some thrown weapons have not been set up properly so you will die to an axe going a foot above your head as long as the handle nicks your helmet. Ping has no effect in this game because the multiplay servers have so much lag (as long as they are not player owned , only the ones owned by fatshark have lag 24/7. My guess is they don't pay matnece or some thing and just wants to ♥♥♥♥ fatshark back.) on servers  where my ping is 50 or lower the game will still lag if you think it is my rig please send me a message and I'll send you my details so you can see just how shity multiply is a host and how shity this game is. All in all do not buy this game it is nothing but a waste wait until it goes F2P like WOTR. Also my play time may seem low to make these kinds of observations but after 30 plus crashes 20 plus faids to main menu and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of hiting caps-loack and having update pop ups send me into window mode(if I missed mentioning this hitting caps or num lock will send you into window mode and you have to go back into the video settings to turn it back also if a update for java or flash comes up it will do the same. This will also turn the screen black for a few seconds and most likely get you killed.)

Laggy servers and an incredible amount of bugs make this game barely playable.\n\nGiven that you use a shield, somebody is going to hack your ankles to the death. Parries also work ~75% of the time. Hit trading is very common, which also makes countering a special attack frustrating.\n\nWeapons are barely balanced. The whole combat system revolves around two players running in circles until the game somehow allows the other player bypass the enemy's parry.\n\nCustomization and coin prices are but a joke. An average "full length" game would yield ~300 coins, while equipping a single custom class in ONE faction could cost more than 20,000 coins, depending on the items you choose.\n\nGame modes are also lackluster. There is the classic TDM; Conquest (with only one way to progress, meaning any kind of strategy is unimaginable), Arena (two teams against each other in rounds, the team with most wins out of a selected number of rounds wins), Pitched Battle (TDM, where you don't respawn - think Counter-Strike, except the wait is longer. and therefore frustrating).\n\nThe game has beautiful graphics - with outrageous system requirements. I play on i7-2630QM, GTX 460M, 4 GB RAM, which, I agree, is nowhere near a solid gaming PC. But I have to play on lowest settings possible with a resolution of 1280x720, which, in all honesty, make the game look like crap, while getting 25 FPS is an occasion to celebrate. Needless to say, FPS is very important in a game such as this - it's all about quick reflexes.\n\nMap and level design is OK, as I said, the sceneries are beautiful and tactics-wise, level design provides a solid ground for leading your team.\n\nI recommend everyone try War of the Roses, the "predecessor" to WotV. It's free, the combat system is much, much more elaborated and customization is "over the top", compared to WotV.","May 11, 2014","false","194.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xmetallica21/recommended/234530/","xmetallica21","DrowningCripple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xmetallica21/","48 products in account","Let me start off with a little information of the game. This is you're classic style hand to hand combat game, which you do not see very many of in the first place, and usually when you do many people get it wrong and turns out like crap.\n\nNow then lets speak of War of the Vikings, it can suprisingly be a very fun game, that is if you are fairly good at it, which actually takes alot longer then you would expect before you get used to the controls, unless you have played War of the Roses. The graphics are great and the maps are well created for that time period. The weapons are what you would expect from the viking culture from, 1h 2h axes, shields, swords such as the Famous Ulfberht, and throwing weapons and bows. And alot of this plays well with a somewhat balanced system of playability.\n\nNow yes I have said that it so far is a good game, but let me give you a few reasons as to why this game is not "yet" worth the $25 price tag that in my opinion is far overpriced. Now i am unsure as to if this game is still alpha beta or is actually released yet because it basically states the game is finished, but has plenty more content to come. And my reason being is because the Game plays like an Alpha.\n\nNow the reason being is a whole variety of different reasons. As soon as you start the game up it looks great plays nice, but you enter a match and thats where it begins. It stars with the lack luster detection system which in Any game that is a full on Melee game hand to hand combat that is THE most important aspect of the game but clearly not in this one you can swing throw weapons directly at someone and sometimes not even hit that person. Now this could be due to the horrible ping problem with servers and other players who have terrible internet, but also a fault on the develpers side as why they do not region lock players to specific servers, players from australia playing on an american server with a 200+ ping destroy people and the fact being because their lag gives them kills.\n\nNow for customization. The worst possible customization in any game I have seen by far next to GTA 5 online. Sure you get a couple heads to choose from, a ton of weapons to choose from, 3 different classes, o and did I mention a Cape, wow amazing isen't it, sure there are alot of different combinations to choose from, some great glorious viking beards, but why does this suck? Because there are no stats on any weapons, every single item you choose has absolutly no description of what the damage or the speed or anythin, this basically leaves every player in the dark as to what the weapons can even do as you can clearly see that some are more powerful then others. An overpowered 2h axe, special skills that can 1h kill and cannot be deflected even when the person is hit before using it, o and forgot that they can be used as many times as possible without stamina being reduced to nothing. Don't forget the inevitible dodge attacker who is sometimes easy, but with a person who has mastered that can kill 3-5 people at any given time. Bowman riddle the game, which everyone hates, you have 2-5 people shooting arrows at you, you will not come out alive, especially a 2h axeman who is trying to move up on them can't due so because of the limited availiblity of objects to move from, to even come close to a guy with a bow, and if you do you're health is so low that he will 1h you with a sword.\n\nYou Die when falling in water, Throwing axes dont kill with a headshot, neither do knives, sheilds take 10 hits before you can even break them, but can be destroyed with one special attack which is hard to land in the first place.\n\nAnd the worst possible thing in this game is the spawn, this game has by far the worst spawn system of any game made in history, Cod has a better spawn system then this game, and that really is saying something. The idea of spawning people next to other players who are surrounded by multiple people is just insane, not even that but you spawn next to people who spawn on the other team right behind you. It is unbelieveable, I have never seen anything like it.\n\nThis game could be so so so much better, they really need to enhance, the stability of the game, add more features, change the spawn, More classes, more perks, weapon stats, and more of an idea of how long things can last such as sheilds, make this game more realistic, weapons break from parrying, sweep attacks, or kicks, more beards, bigger more fuller beards, new maps. This game is stale, needs more customization and better system of fighting. I would not recommend this game at the current pricetag, worth around $10-15 at best.\n","May 8, 2014","false","55.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Oh, there's also the now prerequisite XP system for hitting your enemies, killing them, and finishing them off (by just attacking them when they're on the ground and have a “Finish” label over them) that's stuck its greasy hands in every multiplayer game known to man.\n\nI did appreciate though that the characters in this game actually seem to know how to use weapons and swing them at a more reasonable speed than Chivalry's who all have their arms trapped in a state of perpetual slow-motion. But there are no commands for vertical or horizontal swings or thrusts so you can't even pretend there is some variety in the combat for a few minutes before realizing all you're supposed to do is run backwards and forwards while swinging.\n\nSo ultimately what we have in this game is a more streamlined and dumbed-down Chivalry that kept all of the things that make Chivalry crap. But there's vikings. So it has that going for it.\n\nI'm off to play Blade Of Darkness instead.","December 7, 2013","false","0.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The game has been given different dynamics in how to fight like the addition of dodge attacks, sprinting, and high risk, high reward special attacks.\n\nThis game has a steep learning curve, but really separates the great players from the average. All the weapons have their strength and weakenesses compared with the other weapons. A really good addition is that classes are given different traits and abilities that make and define them as truly unique. People seem to carry on about poor net coding and lag. To be honest, lag barely occurs any more unless you have high ping (which obviously happens anyway).\n\nNot to mention, the game looks fantastic and the scenery and attention to detail is veryu good. Warriors yell out taunts and battle cries as they clash with the enemy, or yell out warnings if archers are shooting at them. You can customize your warrior to become a beautiful champion of war, and create shields that will cause your hearth and hold to swell with pride!\n\nWonderful game...Get it!","October 4, 2014","true","438.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

These hideous players are also very persistent with playing War of the Vikings as if this is the only game they have. Therefore, no high level of decency should be expected.\n\nFinal Remarks:\nAt the time of writing this review, for some strange reason War of the Vikings is incredibly unstable right after official release (beta was smooth) and the developers are incapable of bringing out hotfixes to address game-breaking issues within a month. The game is on a par with the worst game launches in history due to the serious technical issues aforementioned in cons. Paradox and Fatshark did a great job disappointing their fan base once again.

You have been warned. I wanted to give this game another chance, but there are only a few ppl playing. This game is DEAD. Buy Chivalry instead\n\n\nWorst game I have ever played. Buggy as hell. Dont buy this game.\n\n- poor performance/optimization on some maps (i7 3770k @4.00Ghz, R9-280X, 8 GB Ram) on monastry and the ice map less than 30 fps.\n- every single map favours archers, if the enemy team has +2 archers you lost, because they have unlimited ammo and can spam while you have to fight off enemy melee players.\n- 2 handed axes are the best weapon, you can easily hit around the shield even though you block in the swings direction\n- spears and enemy players can hit you through a shield when they´re up in your face (cliping through the shield)\n- double handed special-attacks don´t 1 shot every time, they clip through the enemy dealing no damage. same with any normal attackPing ~30\n- hit registration is buggy as hell. for example, you hit a guy in the head with a javelin, you can see it stuck in his head yet it   deals no damage, or they do 42 dmg even though its a guaranteed 1 hit kill. or enemy does a special attack, he hits the  ground 2m away from me, what happens I die. again im only playing on ~30 ping servers.\n- only 4 gamemodes wtf? it gets boring after about 10 hours\n- only a few maps, and they´re very similar\n\n+ interesting setting\n+ great vareity of weaponry\n+ great looking maps level of detail is great, yet they´re quite repetitive\n+ player models look great\n\nConclusion: If you want to play this game every now and then go ahead buy it. if you plan on playing it regulary dont buy it, there are better alternatives like Chivarly. its not worth the money. developer responding in a rude way on constructive bug reporting via email.","June 8, 2014","false","21.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So I'm going to rewrite this review entirely. I'll start off with a "TL;DR" summary to give a quick impression and then go on a few paragraphs explaining in detail the game, its current condition, and compare it to another game with a similar combat system, Mount & Blade: Warband, which I will refer to simply as "Warband."\n\nTL;DR Summary: I can not recommend this game. While the combat system is fantastic and something I would recommend to anyone familiar with Warband I feel the negatives undermine the fighting interaction between players far too greatly. Though it touts itself as such this game is no longer capable of delivering a skill-based melee combat experience. If you seek a skill-based melee combat experience that's very fun in a duel setting, and still very good in a multiplayer melee, then stick with Warband if you don't already have that.\n\nTL;DR Points:\n*+Good, skill-based melee combat system.\n*+Rewarding parry system promotes exciting parry/riposte exchanges like in Warband and War of the Roses.\n+Solid graphics.\n+Good voice acting.\n+Delightful soundtrack (I personally love it.)\n+Strong feel to combat, visual and audio feedback gives the impression of making an impression.\n*+Hitboxed shields deflect attacks that come into actual, genuine contact with them.\n-Good points marked with * rendered null by the very unacceptably poor netcode and lag issues.\n-Taking hits through parries.\n-Landing hits that do no damage.\n-Taking hits that look like they should have missed.\n-The inherent frustration of one's skill being made to mean nothing.\n-Utter lack of a playerbase (50-something players at peak as of this posting) in a multiplayer only game, a crippling issue which seems to particularly affect North American players.\n-Class and mechanic design (berserker class, instant-kill special attacks which intentionally cannot be parried) conflict with the skill base of the game and are frustrating to deal with.\n-Strictly multiplayer; nothing to do but find a multiplayer server for online gameplay.\n-The combination of strictly multiplayer and potentially nobody to play with due to very, very low player count warrants an additional negative mention.\n\nOverall: 1/10 If you buy this game, you won't really be getting a game since you won't have many players (or sometimes none at all) to play with. If you do, I doubt you may find an enjoyable experience.\n\n\nWar of the Vikings is a game I have enjoyed in its alpha and beta stage and, strangely, only in its alpha and beta stage. Why, might you ask? I could go over the strengths of the game, and indeed I do terribly want to, but at the same time I do not think it would be appropriate for a review because they are simply no longer there. First issue,\n\nThe Netcode:\n\nThe game made a recent shift in netcode but there are still problems which serve to cripple the element of skill and satisfaction in gameplay. Because of the significant presence of lag between player and server it's not at all uncommon to take damage through your defence, a "parry" put up in the same direction as an incoming attack before it hits, and for attacks that appear to have landed with graphic results to produce no damage at all. Other players may also appear to shift around as the netcode simply can't keep up, interfering with a player's ability to keep track of where their opponent really is as they teleport. The unpredictable nature of server-side lag combined with things happening when it looked like they shouldn't succeeds in delivering a frustrating experience should the player seek for their skilled input to matter.\n\nYou may not understand how important it is for things to be translated from client to server and to the rest of the clients as smoothly and accurately as possible until you see what happens when this isn't the case. If you are not familiar with the defensive mechanic of parrying an enemy attack (in this game and in Warband) then it has to be done before the strike lands (quickly) and in the correct direction to intercept the attack (accurately.) In Warband a successful parry can occur milliseconds before the player takes a hit. Every millisecond in an engagement is important and if the game can't be that accurate then player skill will be marginalized as hits are taken through parries that have been up for up to half a second. 500 milliseconds out of a swing that takes only 600 or 800 to land. Warband, however, succeeded in making this work. War of the Vikings failed and it counts significantly against it.\n\nThe Player Count:\n\nIf you don't live in Europe don't even try. I can scarcely find any North American servers and the game can go plenty of days without ever seeing one. There's a mere 50 players left and almost all of them go to EU servers. For a game that is strictly multiplayer I have no one to play with and that's a very strong reason to pass this one up.\n\nThe Mechanics:\n\nI first need to explain the skill demanded by this game. Players must be able to use footwork to narrowly avoid the reach of their enemy's weapons, reaction time to parry an incoming attack, and accuracy to input the correct direction of parry to intercept the attack. Because you can do damage through a parry by simply holding an attack for a full charge there's little reason to try to be good at parrying, a skill which is central to the parry/riposte play which much of the community embraces and associates with games like this. Without parry/riposte there's nothing terribly unique about it other than its vikings theme. A class type available to the player, known as the berserker, is also a frustrating opponent to deal with. Because the berserker can swing without delay even if his attack has been parried, something that is difficult to do, the player must parry a string of attacks successfully before he may counter-attack. This also serves to further undermine the parry/riposte skill that could have made this game stand out and was indeed why many of its players decided to buy the game. With that gone we no longer have the experience we paid for and if you're looking for the Warband combat experience in a shiny, multiplayer-centric setting then know you, too, will be disappointed.\n\nIn conclusion, I confess myself terribly disappointed and can not give this game a recommendation to anyone, whatever gameplay experience they may be looking for. On a personal note I want to say that I used to love this game. It flowed in its alpha and everything worked as would be expected. This was the game I was going to play for a long, long time.","June 5, 2014","false","174.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lacks some depth, squads not really that useful. Game was in EA for months and still riddled with performance and stability bugs. Crashing, random pauses, poor performance at times.\n\nFeels like a good start to a game but does not seem complete yet. I recommend waiting for some of the issues to be addressed.\n\nThe game is faster paced than war of the roses which should appeal to a larger audience. A lot of the insta kills are pretty cool to watch. It's similar to WotR but overall a different game and shouldn't be directly compared with it.\n\nPerk system seems rather pointless. Not very many to choose from. A few cool ones...and the rest useless or unappealing. Could also use more classes to customize with.\n\nShield paint is pretty cool and allows for a unique character to stand out on the battlefield. All weapons and item unlocks are only cosmetic, no strength and weaknesses to different weapons within the same class.\n\nTeam death match spawns are pretty close ensuring a lot of action...but many times a little to close resulting in a lot of "cheap" kills. Call of Duty style.\n\nConquest is definately my favorite mode. Though at times a match can degenerate into a TDM feel where people stop going for the objective and just fight around it or chase an enemy all around.\n\nArena is basically a pitched battle, just in a tiny map. Not a fan at all of this game type. Once you die your out for the round. A team needs to win the best of x amount of rounds to win the match.\n\nPitched battle is the same game mode only with normal size maps. If you prefer this style of match I highly prefer it to arena.\n\nThe game has potential to be more than a TDM killing spree, but needs a little more goal oriented purpose to matches. An element to encourage a little more stratedgy and keep replayability.\n\nThe combat system over all works pretty smoothly. The hit boxes seem pretty accurate. The sword and shield work well. The 2H axe needs a little work on the annimation and deals damage with the handle of the weapon sometimes. The spear needs animation work as it's completely imposible to visually see a swing in progress. You have the attack direction indicators but there is almost no animation to it. The bows are fun to use, but get very old to be shot with. Might be a little strong at this point as far as how often you can shoot.\n\nHopefully we get to see the fixes that need to be made and some much needed depth to the game.\n\n6 out of 10.","April 29, 2014","false","223.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

This game however did my heritage no favors, if you are going to compare this game to chivalry then dont even look at it. The combat contol is unfortunately very poor and though it does succeed in many areas if a game falls short on what its based on then its just a flop for me.\n\nI do not like the following:\n-Swing Direction Control\n-Blocking Direction Control\n-Charge Up Swing\nWhich is what makes this game frustrating to me. Many of times I attempt to block or attack with a specific direction and if you move your mouse less than an inch in the right direction you could be attacking or blocking with the opposite direction and being that you also move your ENTIRE camera with the mouse it makes manuvering and blocking or attacking at the same time a damned challenge in its self. Charging up your attacks is just useless to me because I rarely use it in a fight and all it ever does is give me something more to pay attention too. Many of times I end up completely missing because of this which in turn gets me killed, fun, but thats just my playstyle ive seen other players use it.\n\nWhat I do like about this game:\n-♥♥♥♥ing vikings man!\n-The combat is challenging and the unlock system is very fair\n-There are significant punishments for TK'ing and Team Damage\n-Working as a team and aiding your allies helps both of you which promotes team playing\n-Customization is actually quite diverse (Weapons, Classes, Perks)\n\nThough it has many great traits I wouldnt recommend it to people who get mildly frustrated with a game because this one will do just that. This is based off a ratio of okay games and bad games (Personal). There aren't any "good" games here for me and I rarely seem to be making any significant contribution to my team or my score and progress.\n\nTL;DR: Combat Controls suck, everything else is crystal","April 22, 2014","false","7.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game is exceptionally deep in terms of combat, involving a variety of weapons and angles of attack, and having mechanics that stress immediate reaction to an opponent's movement- instakills are common (which does make learning the game somewhat difficult). This game's atmosphere, though, is what sets it apart from other combat simulation games. Set in old Britain in a war between the Saxons and Vikings, the aesthetic design and overall feel of the game are very genuine. However, a notable vice for this game is in technical issues and latency. Problems can occur such as the game not starting, and in such an action-reaction environment, it can be difficult to fight with 150-300 ping, which is not uncommon. I would recommend this game to people both interested in combat games and old European history, but for those not interested in the historical aspect, there are other games that may be more enjoyable.\n\nPros:\nWell-developed combat system\nExceptional environment/atmosphere\n\nCons:\nTechnical issues/latency\nNotable learning curve\n\nOverall rating: 70/100","January 4, 2015","true","46.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you want fast-paced hack&slash action like in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, go play that game more. Combat isnt nearly as fast-paced in WotV, but still fun, highly competative, and if you're a competative spirit you'll love the challenge it brings. Combat and tactics in this game is something to Master. Buy it, but not at full retail price - Its still just a game you hop on once in a while to get your berserk on. 4/5 stars for this game in its category....Once they get their incredibly annoying stuttering bug fixed for high resolutions.","May 9, 2014","true","161.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The only complaint I have is that there isnt enought costomization of your classes as I would have liked. Never the less, War of the Vikings is a fun game with excellent combat. A word of warning: the game does have a small player base, so it can be hard to find more than a couple servers going at one time.

For an example of how the sword play should feel take a look at kingdoms rise which uses a system so simular to war of the vikings i could sware its the exact same, with button presses and mouse swipes to enable directional attacks and blocks the important difference is that Kingdoms rise is smooth and flowing. this results not only in a system, that, like war of the vikings requires you to pay close attention but draws you into a truely immersive combat. war of the vikings is so slow and inaqurate that it often feels like you are in a turn baised combat when in one on one scenarios, as well as being amazeingly inaccurate. the only thing i can say in favor of the combat is that archery was very well done.","February 12, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

You can master it in a few days of play, whereas Roses takes months to master. The graphics are ugly and dumpy, and the voiceovers are annoying. Everything feels cliched and arcadey. They seem to have self-consciously crafted a Chivalry clone, with influences from Roses and Warband.\n\nThey removed an entire attack direction (only 3 are left) and added unblockable power attacks. I've heard they actually considered an auto-block feature as well. The game is incredibly dumbed down. If Roses had been released as a sequel to this game instead of the other way around, no one would have batted an eye.\n\nFatShark has added in a huge parry delay, so your blocks will only work about 60% of the time. Lag makes the game unplayable for competitive play if your ping is higher than 90. So, good luck fighting folks on the opposite coast, let alone players from Europe.\n\nOne nice thing: the arena mode is fast-paced and fun.\n\nVery poor.

If i'd buy it somewhere like gamestop i would just give it back and take my money back.\n\nIts basically War of the Roses with less content and new skins. Customization cant even stand near the one from WotR. Maps are good, but youll face enemies that looks the same over and over and over again. Less weapons to choose, less armours etc. I know historcally it MAY be correct... but its a game...\n\nOh, and if you imagine yourself going into battle dualwielding like in chivalry... guess what? Nope, wont get it here. Also, fighting system is mess, tutorial wont teach you anything, and even if, expect situations, when youll be in range of swing, and your weapon will just go trough the enemy without doing him any harm. And second after that his swing with shorter weapon than yours will kill you.\n\nGraphics are good... but if you have a pc that is a little bit above the minimal system reqs. You will have to play it on LOWEST settings, or else youu watch a slideshow. And even if you somehow make it run smoothly, game will still freezez every few minutes for couple of seconds. Cause.... you now... thats why. I can run Witcher 2 on maximum quality on my laptop, also BF3 runs on high, War thunder on ultra.... and here i needed to turn everything off to just play the game for 2-3 minutes, before my laptop vents started acting like Boeing 747 turbine engines...\n\nFinisher system from WoTR is out, and i think its a good decision, because you could have ridiculous moments back then, when your enemy were repedetely stabbing you in the skull, or was chopping your head off... and was interrupted in a split of second before animation end. And he had to start it again, wasting his and yours time, and also could be killed during this.\nAlso, stabbing atack is out. Dont know why, its kinda stupid imo.\n\nThe price... 24 euro for something that looks... just like DLC for WotR... with LESS CONTENT. ITs simpler, its smaller... its simply... worse. Dont repeat my bad and wait for some sells. Or dont buy it at all, and switch to M&B: Warband with some mods. And price of Valhalla edition is just a joke, trying to get the gamers money. Future content? Game was on early acces and you can still go to forum and read bug reports that havent been repaired since. I dont think any future content is worth additional 120e, considering the fact, that first theyll have to patch the whole thing, because now, in my opinion its not worth of playing, and probably wont be untill major patches... so something like.... months? Few months at least.","April 23, 2014","false","8.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Shame I didn’t see that archer perched on the hill beside me. One arrow through the skull later and I was seeing the glorious gates of the Norse afterlife personally. By Odin it was worth it though.\n\nPrepare to cackle maniacally as you land throwing axes square in enemies faces, cry tears of regret as you accidentally kill yet another teammate that got in your way, and yell Norse battle cries as you flail your weapon madly at anyone dumb enough to get close to you. War of the Vikings is a Third Person Arena combat game that lets you take control of the Norse or Saxons as they clout each other to death with sharp weapons over the various locales of 18th Century England.\n\n\n\nThe game features varying levels of detail and graphical settings, while the low end gives you a basic look to aid performance, when turned up the visuals can be quite stunning. The rural countryside’s and built up towns are all very beautiful to behold if you can ignore all the bloodstains and angry men stabbing each other. In particular water effects have a satisfying sunlight reflection to them when the settings are high enough and all of it adds to the atmosphere. Each of the soldiers you play as are designed very well, the two factions have distinctly different appearances. To top it off the game is accompanied by a full instrumental soundtrack which is reflective of the game’s time era. The drums, strings, and wind instruments are just great to listen to and the war music really helps get the bloodlust flowing during a large skirmishes.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay consists entirely of multiplayer online matches. When you join a game you are able to pick to be a Norse or a Saxon. The game offers a variety of gametypes with deathmatch and arena being the primary two. Deathmatch is as it sounds, two teams kill each other, respawning each time they die until one reaches a set amount of kills. Arena on the other hand lets the two team spawn and duke it out with each death being permanent. Once either team is wiped out, the points are awarded to the surviving one, and a new round then begins and winning team over the set rounds, will be the overall winner. There are other game modes that built on these two formulas, but at its core these are the main types you’ll find.\n\nFatshark boast a fully skill driven combat system for War of the Vikings. Combat utilises the mouse in full, forcing you to not only time your swings for maximum damage, but also consider which direction you swing from, defenders need to position and block correctly to avoid being hit from attacks. It only takes 1 to 4 swings to take down an opponent depending on the power of each swing, so it is in the best interest of the player to adopt a tactical play style and avoid taking damage. Attacks will be interrupted by hits too, so don’t expect to run in with an axe and crush everything through the pain.\n\n\n\nThe game clearly draws inspiration from the Call of Duty franchise. In some ways the inspiration is subtle, some others not so much. The biggest way is the class system. Assuming you don’t purchase any extra content (see below) the game starts you with 1 basic class. As you get kills you rank up, you unlock new classes with each rank and after a few ranks you’ll gain the ability to customise your own class, using in game money to purchase weapons for use. Once you get past this initial barrier the freedom is greater and having your own style of play helps you enjoy the experience furthermore.\n\nAs the game features no singleplayer mode the narrative is told entirely through the multiplayer battles. While no specific story is thrown in your face, the aesthetics and the voice over’s give you a feel for what you’re here to do. The game has various voice over’s where Saxons, or Vikings respectively call out to you as you play, updating you when the tide of battle falls from your favour or vice versa. When you lose a match you’re met with a relevant response from your invisible allies, equally when you achieve victory you are praised for your skill and it all adds to the immersion. The simplicity of the goal you’re set (kill the enemy) combined with the subtle voice-overs from you and your allies are surprisingly good at drawing the player in.\n\n\n\nAt time of writing I have clocked over 9 hours of play time within War of the Vikings. The multiplayer focus means that battles can always go differently, with enough maps of different sizes to vary up the gameplay feel. You can get a large amount of replay value alone from this, and with different game types to take your fancy you can mix it up and get continuous enjoyment for hours upon end. The developers Fatshark have mentioned that further content will be released down the line so this could bring even more replay value to an already great game.\n\nIn summary War of the Vikings is very good, but not without its negatives. The combat is challenging and it’s fun to duke out with other players. However, it can be frustrating when the skill difference between you and a foe is very high. It can feel like all players are better than you at times, which is demoralising. Once you get into the swing of the game it can be hugely entertaining, so long as you can stay physically connected to the game. Poor connection can make the game largely impossible to play. Combat is all about timing and coordination, both of which are hard to execute when your opponent is blinking all over the screen like a Mage with no cool down.\n\n\n\nSome servers will even boot you if your ping is not consistently high enough, which is very annoying. Those that enjoy arena combat and deathmatch games will feel right at home, but for those with a penchant for less confrontational games will likely not enjoy themselves due to the entirely PvP nature of the game. For what it is though, War of the Vikings is a very well executed game. There’s a lot of enjoyment to be had if you can break past that initial struggle and break into the customisation and weapons.\n\nWar of the Vikings is available right now on Steam for £18.99. You can purchase/upgrade to the Blood Eagle Edition at £26.99 and it will come with an art book, soundtrack, special items and more. If that isn’t enough either, you can purchase/upgrade to the Valhalla Edition at £134.99 which will grant you all of the previous items, some extra in-game content, plus all current and future items free to purchase once the correct level is unlocked.\n\n“SEE YOU IN VALHALLA BROTHER!”\n\nFor more game news, reviews, and videos visit http://www.push-start.co.uk/","May 20, 2014","true","26.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

For an example of how the sword play should feel take a look at kingdoms rise which uses a system so simular to war of the vikings i could sware its the exact same, with button presses and mouse swipes to enable directional attacks and blocks the important difference is that Kingdoms rise is smooth and flowing. this results not only in a system, that, like war of the vikings requires you to pay close attention but draws you into a truely immersive combat. war of the vikings is so slow and inaqurate that it often feels like you are in a turn baised combat when in one on one scenarios, as well as being amazeingly inaccurate. the only thing i can say in favor of the combat is that archery was very well done.","February 12, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

This game plays similarly to the previous paradox titles, albeit with a little bit more silliness thrown in, which I enjoy. This game employs finishing moves, which people spam ad nauseum, to mostly not good results, numerous projectiles, not much in the way of armor,  and it is regularly updated with new content and fixes. The graphics really are pretty good, better looking than..... well it's hard to compare this to something else, but you won't be dissapointed in that department. Like other paradox titles this game uses the mouse movement swing mechanic, which is difficult to nail down, or completely unnecessary if you opt for the Berserker add on, for berserkers anyway, but after this you will come to enjoy the feedback and tightness of this system. I would recommend this to anyone who is a bit burned out on the endless FPS turn outs year after year, but still wants the satisfaction of respawning and dying, but truly living a good life and crushing your enemies.","June 25, 2014","true","35.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Since the alpha, I thought that the combat was, and still is, amazing, that the game looked great, and that the customization was heading in the right track, and it still is. So many people complain about how this game is dumbed down from WotR, and how shields are useless, and how archers are too overpowered. For starters, no, the game is not dumbed down, it is just a much faster paced game than WotR. So does that make it instantly bad? Absolutely not. And for those that say shields are useless, really? To those who say that: you are just mad that there is now a way to hit someone when they have a shield up, something you could not do in WotR. It is true, in WotR you were invincible with a shield until it broke (which took a while), and now there is a way to bypass the shield in this game. Does that make this game awful? Absolutely not. And now people are saying archers are overpowered? That is such a lie. You mean a fully charged shot can take away a lot of health? Just like a fully charged swing can? People are griping for the sake of griping.\n\nThe game is addictive, bottom line. Ever since early access I have been playing this game and falling in love with it. When I see people mindlessly complain how this game is not exactly like Warband or WotR I just want to hit them. This game is not Warband nor WotR, it is War of the god damn Vikings, and I would be lying if I said I do not have a lot of fun with this game. But is the game perfect? Of course not, no game is. At times the game gets a little choppy, but enough to make me want to throw my computer and spout obscenities? Not even close. As for the customization, it lacks when compared to WotR. But do you remember the customization in WotR when it first came out? I do, and it was not what it was today. So just be patient, because there will obviously be more options for customization later on.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? You better believe I do. Would I spend $25 on it? No, but I also would not spend that much on any game (I am cheap like that). If you see it for less than $20, get it. It is just such a fun game and I always look forward to playing more.","April 27, 2014","true","23.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

I'm sorry to say, but I cannot recommend this game. You can see I'v played about nine hours of it, I played it when it was in beta, and it was broken then. Back in beta, hit detection, shields, and two handed weapons were broken. I thought since it was a beta, I would give it time, then the Shield maiden and Bezerker DLC rolled around, I didn't buy any of those DLC's but somehow I have the Shieldmaidens anyway.\n\nLet's start with what I like about this game.\n\n-Good and unique atmosphere, sound effects and music makes you think you're actually playing a Mid-eval Viking game.\n-I do like class customization...But not enough here.\n-I do like the tackle mechanics and the 'heavy attack'.\n-I like the writing and stories behind every piece of armor and weapons.\n-I do like the music and I like the Saxon voice actor, serious and grim.\n\n\nWell, now that it's out of beta and now that I'm done with what I like...Playing it for a little bit It's worse then it was. Lag is horrible, the game is nearly dead, and whatever servers you do find are in other countries (I'm in the U.S and the only good server I could find was a Moscow one). Lag is horrible because you'll see people walking in a straight line with their weapons reared back, you swing at them, and then you're instantly on the ground dead. Hit detection is a joke because when you swing at someone, it doesn't even register. Shields don't even work either, I'l have the shield pointed RIGHT at someone and they can still go right through.\n\nTwo handed axes still swing bloody fast, just as fast as a one handed axe and do more damage. Don't even get me started on the Bezerkers...Not only do they have a 'cheat death' function to stay up after hitting 0 HP, they can go right through your blocks and shields too, and they swing like no tommorow, I even hit them while they were in Frenzy mode and they still would not die.\n\nOverall, this game is broken, and dead. War of the Roses was and still is a very good game, at least it's partially free now. The devs of this game had the NERVE to add a cash shop to buy the utter lack of unique customization in this game, intentionally making the 'coin' gain slow.

But, I found joy in the game, took me about half an hour to get used to the fighting, how to hit and dodge etc, but after that it went kind of smooth. There are a few times were you really want to toss your keyboard through the screen, etc. when you use your execution ability with a twohanded axe, but they're too close to be hit, or that it misses by an inch. I also like the diversity of classes, so no matter what suits your style best, you can pretty much find it. However, since I am only here in the free weekend, and haven't actually bought the game, I don't think I can modify the classes yet.\n\nI personally liked the graphics, the gameplay overall was a nice experience, I however tend to get a faint headache when I am sprinting, due to the poor wobbley effect with the screen. Don't play it in a dark room as it just makes it all worse.\n\nI think that is all I have for now, I will return if I stumble across anything more. Have a great night. :)\n\nEdit: I have randomly been kicked out of the game, but that might aswell be because my video drivers weren't up to date. I would recommend you downloading the game over night and trying it in the free period, as that really is the best way to tell if you like it.","December 6, 2013","true","11.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grindcorethrall/recommended/234530/","grindcorethrall","GrindcoreTHRALL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grindcorethrall/","121 products in account","Have you ever wished there was a pvp game with modern day graphics and combat/design like gothic, mount and blade, or die by the sword? War of the Vikings is very reminiscent of these innovative games. Firstly in WotV, you are dropped into beautifully and maserfully done levels ranging from glaciers, caves, hilly villages, to  village cement tunnel trenches. The game wouldn't be complete without these gorgeous environments but it doesn't stop there.\n\nAimed to be created with historically accurate settings, weapons,  garbs/armor, and combat style, War of the Vikings will immerse you deeply. I have have been playing war of the roses since its beta and war of the vikings since the alpha early access too. Its always held a special place in my heart for multiple reasons. The combat is visceral, you can feel your sword cleave through people like a  butcher knife into a slab of meat. Place your hits well and you will be rewarded with a clean decapitation. Hitting a skilled opponent is no small accomplishment. The blocking system, although sometimes inconsistent, allows you to practically parry and deflect all attacks, if done skillfully. Aside from amazing fighting mechanics, graphics, and the best maps I have ever seen, war of the vikings offers swag as well as perks and a customization system.\n\nThe developers have simplified balancing by creating prestigious versions of each crude but equally efficient base weapon. Along with having swaggier versions of some of the more prestigious looking weapons, they come with a bio for the hero they belonged to or the era the weapon was famous for. The base weapons are offered for considerably lower prices to even out the playing field and make the game balance simple yet still customizable and the avatars personable to their owner. There are three classes, multiple perks which create multiple ways to play such as an archer, axeman, javelin hurler, backstabbing rogue, and much more. Theres enough swagger to drain thousands of hours of your time and keep you craving more inscribed finely crafted shiney pieces of loot.\n\nMultiple game modes allow for basic team death match and more hardcore play with single life rounds as well as multiple others like conquest(territories). The game modes all have different feels and different meta tactics while using different parts of the environment for mini arenas amongst a gorgeous sandbox. Battle on a bridge to dominate the territory at the other end, or brawl for 15 mins straight until 125 kills in a sandy beach cave. Each mode takes advantage of the map layout and size.\n\nThe Devs definitely treated their previous fans well by giving them a 10% discount on the game as well as making them available with the discount in 4 packs. My friends and I all went in on this together and none of us regret it. The final product is well worth every dollar and even more. I thank the devs, Fat Shark, for making such an amazing game without slapping an expensive price tag on it.  Although the game has a steap learning curve and can be furstrating when getting crushed over and over by skilled opponents or bad spawns : (, I guarantee you will enjoy it and find extreme satisfaction once you learn the ropes. One of my favorite games and series of all time! 9.5/10. I will be looking forward to more from this developer and if they keep this kind of model and quality I will be a repeat customer and loyal supporter for decades to come!","April 17, 2014","true","70.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Horrux/recommended/234530/","Horrux","Horus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Horrux/","700 products in account","Below is my review of the Alpha.\n\nHere is my review of the final game: The combat is fast-paced, and the hit detection seems overall pretty good. However, and herein lies my major gripe with this game, all the customization is cosmetic only. Let me explain.\n\nIn War of the Roses, you could choose a heavier or lighter armor, and a weapon that had different characteristics: more range but slower, faster but less damaging, etc. The number of possible variations was incredible. In this game, there are many different weapons but they all have the same stats. All the 1h Swords are the same, except cosmetically, same thing with 1h axes, or 2h weapons.\n\nThis makes the whole idea of unlocking new things to try new combinations an asinine one, for it will only give you different LOOKS but will not offer you the challenge (and JOY!) of mastering a new custom class. It is the same stuff all over again.\n\nSure, the game is more balanced for it, but it is also much less interesting. Just wait for the anti-cheat on Roses to be implemented, it is a much, much better game IMO.\n\nBut then again, for just $15.00 this game might be worth a try if you think you can live with the bore of nothing new, ever.  EDIT: I just realized it is $25.00... For that price, stay away unless you are a die-hard fan of anything Viking or Saxon.\n\nBut for that reason, I will not recommend it as a purchase. Do so at your own risk, as this game is infinitely inferior to War of the Roses.\n\n=====\n\nWriting a review of the Alpha: this game looks to be as good as War of the Roses was, or could be, if it weren't for the legion of cheaters swarming the servers and ruining the fun for everyone. Because it is made by the same developers on a similar engine, I would be cautious about purchasing it, as if the developers do not address the cheating very specifically with this game, you can expect legions of cheaters as soon as the game launches, making it unplayable, or at least, unenjoyable.\n\nFor now at least, I'm giving it a cautious thumb up.","November 25, 2013","false","7.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

If you're into the whole viking thing you'll be blown away by the whole experience.\n\nThere's a lot to appreciate here. The sound and visual environments are beautiful, the objective-based level structure is nice (albeit revolves around the usual capturing waypoints).  You can lose yourself for a bit in the character customization section, choosing weapons and perks to accompany fighting style.\n\nIt just feels so superb.\n\nI feel awful for having one criticism - mainly because it's a core mechanic - but here I go:  the melee attack system. Blocking and archery both work very well, perfect even. The attack (click-n-swipe-mouse-direction similar to the one used in War of the Roses) just feels like a painful injustice to the rest of this game, I feel like i'm putting up with it for the sake of enjoying the rest of the game.\n\nIf they just completely axed (excuse the pun) this attack mechanic and went for something more natural (perhaps use a similar attack mechanic to Chivalry, which just works so well), I could see myself having exponentially more fun.\n\nEitherway, great piece of work so far, well done to everyone who's working on this - really look forward to playing more.","October 4, 2014","true","1.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But the player base most likely to play WOTV was the WOTR crowd, and things like handgonnes, cavalry, crossbows, and new melee weapons were what kept people interested. Removing all that variety for a sequel was a flawed concept.","September 29, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

The spawn system can be ♥♥♥♥ sometimes too for example you can spawn right in front/behind enemies and you'll be insta killed and the makers of this game released this in February and are still patching the ♥♥♥♥ out of this beautifully leaking faucet. TIP: if you're above 10 people on a small map get out of their unless  you like a bit of a scramble :P.\n\nGood: The game works alot more fluid than WOTR you have a few classes to choose from if you just bought the game and don't have the DLC classes (I got them for free because I have a special edition version) If you have norse or anglo heritage you'll like the style and the art in the game, and it will take a lot of time to get used to even I as a rank 45 have ♥♥♥♥ days where I lose to a rank 11 user but if you have played WOTR you'll get the jist just not the speed. Lastly it's a recomended game if you have patience if you are easy to quit and just criticize because you're not winning you can ♥♥♥♥ off this is not the game for you then. 8/10 :D\n\n\n","July 9, 2014","true","510.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It simply allows everyone to deal damage despite being close-combat focus class before you even reach them. If anything, berzerkers should actually be the only class that would allow throwing weapons.\n-No point for a secondary sword; in WoTR your weapons were able to break, in here, your weapon never breaks so you can just block infinitely, the point of a secondary weapon as a close-combat weapon is neutered, being replaced by the throwing weapons.\n-Bad netcode for blocking; in WoTR this was also the issue, but it was more acceptable as blocking was done faster and was more vivid, allowing for a high skill ceiling and a well-fledged fend and spin and everything combat which entirely based about skill, concentration and blocking well. In here, blocking becomes fairly obsolete in fast encounters, not working most of the time. Not to mention that blocking a berzerker is either impossible, or useless as they can just keep attacking you over and over again.\n-Last Stand for berzerkers; this is the bane of 1v1 combat, and even otherwise. Unless you deal a insta kill, that guy has more than 100 hp.\n-No more hilt; WoTR had a nice hilt system, where the polearms (here, particularly axes since the game has about 5 different weapons to bloody choose from) could hit with the wood instead of the weapon itself, essentially not dealing any damage, in here, as long as it's in your range, you hit it.\n-Poor perk system; perks are very poor in comparison, I would've expected something like bandage faster, rise up after being revived faster, being able to block special attacks (that would be useful), and maybe more than just 2 bloody perk slots in general. Once more, something which was done very well by WoTR.\n-All classes pretty much have the same armor level, a champion seems to have the same armor as anyone else.\n-No armor mechanics; WoTR had armor mechanics where you can hit someone and not penetrate their armor, given the lack of (any) armor customization, the devs decided to simply make anything go through anything.\n-DLC classes; are you ♥♥♥♥ing serious?\n\nThis game is a massive pile of ♥♥♥♥. In it's own right, if you are to take it apart for a new player who never played such a game before, it's a enjoyable massive pile of ♥♥♥♥. But at the same time it's a heavily dumbed down WoTR. If anyone was to choose between this and WoTR, WoTR would be the way to go.\nThe only good the game excels in is combat impact: It does feel a lot better to hit someone in here than in WoTR.

Unless you deal a insta kill, that guy has more than 100 hp.\n-No more hilt; WoTR had a nice hilt system, where the polearms (here, particularly axes since the game has about 5 different weapons to bloody choose from) could hit with the wood instead of the weapon itself, essentially not dealing any damage, in here, as long as it's in your range, you hit it.\n-Poor perk system; perks are very poor in comparison, I would've expected something like bandage faster, rise up after being revived faster, being able to block special attacks (that would be useful), and maybe more than just 2 bloody perk slots in general. Once more, something which was done very well by WoTR.\n-All classes pretty much have the same armor level, a champion seems to have the same armor as anyone else.\n-No armor mechanics; WoTR had armor mechanics where you can hit someone and not penetrate their armor, given the lack of (any) armor customization, the devs decided to simply make anything go through anything.\n-DLC classes; are you ♥♥♥♥ing serious?\n\nThis game is a massive pile of ♥♥♥♥. In it's own right, if you are to take it apart for a new player who never played such a game before, it's a enjoyable massive pile of ♥♥♥♥. But at the same time it's a heavily dumbed down WoTR. If anyone was to choose between this and WoTR, WoTR would be the way to go.\nThe only good the game excels in is combat impact: It does feel a lot better to hit someone in here than in WoTR. But that does not cut it at all since it's purely cosmetic.","July 1, 2014","false","27.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They made shields buggy with passive blocking, they nerfed archery very hard and parrying is broken.

Despite what many people will have you believe, this game is amazing. It features awesome swordfighting mechanics and has a very impressive graphical style. The many bad reviews here are just like many of the bad reviews given to Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Those reviews are usually given by people who don't know how to play the game. Once you learn the mechanics, and use parrying (I recomend starting with the shield) correctly, you will be amazed by how much fun you can have. But, as expected from an "Early Access" game, this is far from finished, and it does struggle with a few annoying bugs that needs to be fixed, although those are not major game-breaking ones. The game is still in beta, and the developers have promised the players more features and far better mechanics that are more solid. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone, especially if you enjoyed Chivalry: Medieval Warfare and/or War Of The Roses. The game is cheaper now then what it will be at its final release in early 2014, so hurry up and buy!

This is Call of Duty meets Medieval Times in a good way. A squeal of sorts to War of the Roses and similar to Chivalry and the multilayer portion of Mount and Blade.\nThe game is third person and boasts a progression system of weapons and armour. Most of the upgrades are cosmetic but different types of weapons and perks can also be unlocked as you earn gold, which acts like spendable xp, at the end of each match. The game boasts different classes the default being three, but quickly unlocked is the ability to choose your own load-out of weapons and perks. Teams are always Vikings vs Saxons, but the only difference between the two sides gameplay wise is their different appearance and vocalizations. Matches support up to 32 players but most servers limit player count to 24 which is a more comfortable fit for the map sizes.\nIn comparison to War of the Roses the game still has that extra mile of historical authenticity for all the history buffs out there (one of the end game unlockables for the Vikings is an Uthbert Swortd!)  The game looks considerably prettier ditching the washed out look for a brighter and more colourful appearance, and the detail on the armour and weapons is impressive. The biggest casualty in features from War of the Roses is mounts which is a bit of a shame but does fit the time period especially given the lack of lances. The familiar mouse driven swinging and blocking is back but overall has been streamlined to the games benefit. For example, the stab attack and block action has been removed but this only makes the game simpler and lowers the learning curve a bit for new players. Furthermore the bow is mercifully much easier to aim compared to War of the Roses with arrows dipping much less below the cross-hair over distance. Special attacks with the 'F' key on the other hand are new and very based on what weapon is equipped. While powerful if missed they can leave you dangerously open for a brief time after for a counter so you must be careful not to over employ them and wait for the right moment.\nThe sounds and music of the game is top notch. On the other hand despite an extensive beta at this time there are still few bugs lingering about, such as spawning too near enemies, but they are rare enough to not pose too much of an issue. Meanwhile there is a fairly basic game-mode variety but a healthy number of maps featuring a number of gorgeous locations with for example Saxon towns to crumbled stone ruins in an autumn forest acting as the backdrop. The combat is satisfyingly brutal with occasional decapitations and blood effects and feels visceral as opposed to floaty such as combat in the Elder Scrolls games for instance. The swing of your two handed axe looks and feels satisfyingly heavy upon striking the chainmail of your foe.\nKeep in mind the game is only a multilayer offering, but if you like first person shooters like Titanfall or Call of Duty and the idea of s third person medieval setting this game might appeal to you. Similarly if you don't like those afore mentioned fps' this games different take of hand to hand combat might tickle your fancy. Bear in mind the game has a difficulty similar to those fps' however.\nIf you have an itch to play out some realistic medieval skirmishes, and don't a bit of learning curve if you haven’t played this style of game before, this game is worth the $25 asking price.\nGrab a horn of mead, say a prayer to Odin, and charge into the fray. 8.0/10 (Great)","April 23, 2014","true","10.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Peg","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197979323636/","83 products in account","Finally, a competitive 3rd-person melee game that starts getting it "right". Not to be mistaken for a revolution, War of the Vikings is a natural evolution from predecessors such as War of the Roses and Mount & Blade.\n\nWhile the character and landscape artwork is fairly realistic and accurate for the historical period, and the game never ventures into silliness, it succeeds best in that it doesn't take itself too seriously. For example, gameplay-related graphics take precedence, and are garish and impossible to ignore: teammates are ALWAYS highlighted in a bright blue halo, even through walls and at the far ends of the map, so you always know where they are, and squadmates in green; player names are always visible above the avatars' heads; revive and execute marks are large and impossible to miss. This makes for a player's game that doesn't compromise fun for realism.\n\nThe gameplay is fast-paced; however, this is a game where swinging at the wrong time is much worse than waiting. Unlike its competitors, who often leave a slain player with a feeling of randomness, combat feels especially deliberate: one whiff and you leave yourself very open for an attack.\n\nPerhaps the most welcome feature of all are the mechanics to force players to confront each other and fight. While sprinting is very fast, you cannot attack while doing it, and any hit that makes contact with you will knock you down for several seconds; if an enemy ever gets a look at your back while you are sprinting away from them, all they have to do is press E to "tackle" you and again knock you down for several seconds. When not sprinting, walking speed is much lower than most games, which means that movements have to be deliberate, and that you cannot simply run past a waiting foe. Oh, and did I forget to mention that every player in the game has some form of ranged weapon available to them in case they face an unwilling enemy?\n\nAll of this is great, since the melee combat is the best yet. Striking a balance between frenzious and strategic, the combat is (for once) deep enough to justify fighting for fighting's sake. Since walking speed is slow enough, one has to be careful not to put oneself in a position where one can easily be surrounded and overwhelmed. Weapon hit detection is improved over War of the Roses, and gone are the poorly implemented "armor" features: if you hit someone, they will bleed for it. Likewise, special attacks that are extremely useful in some situations (and suicide in most) along with dodge-attacks and kicks rounds out a wide variety of melee approaches.\n\nGone are the multi-second execution and revival animations that made you pincushions for the overpowered archers of War of the Roses. Indeed, archery is relatively underpowered (and difficult) in War of the Vikings due to low-damage arrows, exaggerated ballistics, and prevalance of large shields; however, those who are the very top of skill in this area play a priceless support role. Otherwise, you will find that a relatively small portion of the team elects to play primarily as one. Other than the possibility of specializing in archery, however, the battleground is especially egalitarian, with most players having a similar chance in a fight--no "Rock, Paper, Scissors" effect, here.\n\nReviving a fallen teammate (2 second timer), protecting them from missiles as they rise to their feet (about 8 seconds) with your shield, then advancing with them to surround your aggressors provides an awesome experience that is hard to replicate in a world of supersonic hollow points and fragmentation grenades. Executing a fallen enemy so they may not be revived is as simple as hitting them once or twice more. Despite the ease at which enemies can be executed, revives are still a very common occurrence, prompted by very brightly-marked indicators and generous experience bonuses.\n\nA unique aspect of War of the Vikings compared to most multiplayer competitive games these days is that there is no rebounding health: health can only be recovered by bandaging for a vulnerable six seconds, or for those aggressive players, dispatching enemies particularly messily imparts a short-term "adrenaline" regeneration effect.\n\nExpect a learning curve if you have never played a competitive melee game. For those interested in a challenge, however, War of the Vikings is a perfect specimen to see what the genre is all about; for those who are veterans, take the best parts of the melee games you've played and put them together in the best way you can think of, and you'll get War of the Vikings.\n\n\nBest Features:\n-- very clear game graphics (teammate names/locations, revive/execute symbols), so you always know what's going on and what you can do to help\n-- precise hit detection\n-- gameplay mechanics that force face-to-face fights. Ranged combat is subdued in effectiveness.\n-- emphasis on clean, fast action--no fancy armor rules or long respawn walks\n-- melee combat that feels more deliberate than random, even while remaining fast\n-- battle modes all work well with good pacing (arena, TDM, conquest)\n-- teamplay in revival, shield protection and slow-enough movement to surround/outmanouver\n-- egalitarian combat ability regardless of loadout","December 9, 2013","true","62.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","2"

Then i bought War of the Vikings pretty much out of the blue and for the first few hours i couldn´t really get into it as well but the solid presentation, graphics, animations, music and great audio in general kept me coming back. I am now still only 12 hours in but yeah, it clicked. I am getting a hang of the gameplay and i really start to enjoy this game a lot. If you haven´t played M&B or War of the Roses before or even -like me- switched back from console to PC, be prepared for a steep learning curve and a lot of failing battles...but if you stick with it you WILL get better obviously. It might take a little longer to get a feeling for the game than with some other games - but it´s worth your time because when you finally get a hang of it, the game starts to reveal it´s true beauty.

It has good fighting physics. The best part is that they update it more than i thought they would. There is now a shield painter uploaded, which is one of the best parts for a creative mind. It allows you to have 4 layer, each with different things to put on your shield. i have been hooked on this game for weeks. the newest update added much dfferent types of weapons and lots of weapons of each type! my favourite is the one-handed sword for it's fast use and good parry. There are new maps and much more now. If you are thinking of getting this game, why think just buy it and you woun't regret it!! (check your computer settings such as graphichs card, Ram, and processor and see if you can handle the game before you buy it else you will just get mad)\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt has now been quite a while of playing this game. It was honestly better in the older stages. Now i just get kicked and crashed near enough every match/ round. It is a pain and it has been so long. It is not been fixed. I advise anyone to buy it once these bugs and glitches are gone. else you will be really annoyed because of the crashing and kicking.","March 8, 2014","true","221.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitechetta1227/recommended/234530/","whitechetta1227","bothan007","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitechetta1227/","142 products in account","First off, let me just say this game is INSANELY fun.  The sound effects are fantastic, a javelin going through your skull makes such a satisfying crunch even you enjoy your own death.  It has a nice method of giving you control over your melee, instead of random side swings and such.  Maps are all good, though it seems it rotates around 4 a lot more often than any others.  Each weapon has a nice feel to it to make it unique, and the amount of cosmetic options for your character is great, shield painting mode makes me feel like I am creating my own house sigil.\nHOWEVER there are a few things that irk me about the game, that I feel need to be addressed, and if any of these would REALLY bug you, maybe reconsider until they are fixed.\n\nSPAWNING: It is something that should no be that hard to manage, but I cannot describe how annoying it is to spawn, and a half second later to have an enemy soldier spawn right behind you and hack you to pieces.  Or to spawn mid-battle right in someones swing arc, literally making a half second life and just tacking on to the K/D spread and a free point for the other team (or minus a point if it was a teammates arc).\n\nBALANCE: Still fun and playable with all weapons, but from the time I have played is seems the dominating players ALWAYS use 2H axes, and spears are utterly useless.  yes, the fact that a 2H does more damage makes sense, but it seems that not having a shield is not enough of a disadvantage when using one.  Make it so all weapons have their own advantages and disadvantages to make them all useable and viable.\n\nDOWNED ENEMIES: 80% of the time when you deplete and enemies health they are not dead, they are "downed".  This means they cannot move, and are kneeling or lying on the ground waiting to respawn or for a teammate to help them up.   While more interesting for the person who has been hurt, they can hope a friendly comes by and heals them.  However it is annoying when you down someone and an archer snipes in and steals your kill while you deal with another enemy.  A simple fix to this is an easy rearrange to the point system, when player 1 downs an enemy, and player 2 kills him, the kill points should be split between the players rather than all of them going to player 2.\n\n*The next one doesn't NEED to be fixed but could cause frustration for some*\n\nFRIENDLY DAMAGE: In the week I have had this game, I have caused more friendly damage, and taken more friendly damage than in every other multiplayer game I have ever played combined.  Since it is close quarters combat, it makes sense, a stray sword swing, a player running into my arrow arc, it is going to happen.  From what I have seen so far the community has accepted it, I have never seen anger or yelling over friendly damage, and there is no booting as far as I can tell.  However it is very frustrating when I make a nice quick 4 kill streak without taking any damage, and someone comes in and tries to kill my downed enemies and decapitates me in the process.  Some are more mindful of their surroundings than others.","April 20, 2014","true","20.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

There might be a bit of issue with controls but it really depends on exact person playing - some people struggle, some fit from start.

Combat flows perfectly; the pace is brutal, the mechanics are polished, and the battlefield just feels so much more impressive.\nWar of the Vikings actually adds some noteworthy mechanics to the FPS genre, which revolutionise melee combat from the old warband slasher. Here you can dodge strikes, crouch and raise your shield, throw weapons and see them boucing off hard surfaces, shield blocking is actually difficult, and you can hear your friendlies chatter when something happens around you. You can even spin with your one-handed axe in hand and sever your opponents head.\nVery recommended at this point, for any warband or medieval FPSlasher fans.","December 9, 2013","true","122.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of Viking related things, so that made it even more fun. There is a steep learning curve and the skill gap is obvious so be warned, this isn't some multiplayer Skyrim. Once you do learn the combat it's really rewarding taking out more experienced players. What I would like to see is either a boost in coins gained, or a price cut on the items.

It was extremely satisfying to start a newbie peon and slowly but surely understand the game mechanics and finally pose a threat to other players.

This game is pretty unique. It deviates from the standard Mount and Blade/War of the Roses combat, but its still similar enough that experience from either of those games will be helpful. You swing the weapons by moving your mouse in one of three directions (no thrusting in this one :P ) while simulataneously left-clicking. You hold the click to charge the power of your swing. (you can also just click and release which willl do a weaker swing) All the rest of combat comes from being able to time attacks and judge the distance between you and your enemy. It is a game that takes awhile to get used to, but if you enjoy the mechanics it's alot of fun to play. I have probably 500 something hours between this game, War of the Roses, and the Mount and Blade franchise, so I really like the combat stlye. This game isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I love what's there. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes action games, and wants a challenging, brutal experience.","April 12, 2014","true","98.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

At least you are able to get back into fight with revival system, also it is tons more realistic. I mean, come on Chivilary, one hit to the arm and it is chopped off with excessive blood... Kinda gets boring after while with having that done to you. Another point is that, yes it may take time to be able to successfully kill someone and make it out alive, but once learnt how to it is the most rewarding feeling. Furthermore after playing a bit on the game you tend to get good relations with certain people (and its always fun to gang up on unsuspecting archers >:3)\n\nOne downer on the subject is that there isn't a lot of Aussie servers that run though you just have to get on at the right time to access one. However I still fervently believe that this is an extremely good game. Rating it 9/10 (just for the lack of aussie servers).\n\nFor Odin...For Valhalla!!","July 1, 2014","true","80.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

What makes this more fun than Chivalry for instance? All the customizations you can unlock and the array of well balanced and beautiful maps you battle on. It's a lot more personal since there are thousands of combinations you can use to design your sheild and the clothes of your Viking and Saxon warriors.

Still has some crashing issues, and spots of lag. The game plays faster than even Chivalry-MW.\nI liked it enough that I put 15 hours into it on my first weekend (Sat-Sun) or about 1/2 of what I spent playing WoTR already.\nRoses was, and still is a solid game but both of these play completely different.\n\nWhere Roses was slower and more about well placed attacks and well timed blocks, Vikings is a faster. Its more focused on mobility and avoiding blows instead of blocking them. It still has its small issues, but its a pretty sold game.\nThe visuals are amazing, the battle sounds are also pretty good. Music (when it plays) is very fitting to the game and really adds to the "feel" when you play.\n\nSo far the game is lacking on character customization options compared to roses, but much better than Chivalry. Only helmets and color patterns for armor at this point, shield paint editor is neat. Not a lot of weapon models as of this point.\n\nOne thing I really liked about the game, all 1 handed swords are the same, they have the same stats, that goes for 1 handed axes and other weapons. This should make the game easier to balance and it means that even if you have been playing for a long time, new payers still have access to the exact same weapons as you.\nEvery two handed axe has the same stats, but you can choose what you want that axe to look like.\nShould prevent people from having a "best" weapon that new players don't have access too.\n\nArchery is basically the same as WoTR, but now we have thrown weapons, Javelin, axes, daggers as well.\nUnlike Roses, in Vikings  you don't have what I would consider "heavy" armor, as in you wont be turning any blades even with the heavy armor class (champion) like you could do with plate in Roses.\n\nIf they can get the crashing issues (once in 15 hours here) fixed, and pick up some players at launch, balance the 2handed axe and the shield  (at the time of posting 3-10-14) we should have a very solid game on our hands.\n\nI spent for the blood eagle edition, and fully feel that I will have enough hours into the game to receive my "moneys worth".\n\n8/10. Not prefect, above average game. Far better than Chivalry IMO.","March 10, 2014","true","51.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However! I do own Chivalry(similar mechanis).\n\nSummary: I think the game is fun. It's also quite pacey/quick compared to, say, Chivarly.\nI've found there is a lot less chatting on the game. Why? Because people are constantly busy. On Chivarly, the speed is much slower so there's a lot of BS chatting, which is an indication that people are not really engaged.\n\nIf you've never played a similar-typed game, then this is a good place to start.\nThere are not too many maps, but this is still being added, month by month.\n\nThere's also a good mix between being independent and dependent on teamwork. You can play roles in your match, depending upon your preferences of the moment.\n\nI'd wait for a steam sale. To get this game under 10 dollars/euros is not a bad deal.\n8/10.","December 8, 2013","true","5.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You can pick between 5 different categories of weapons, from bows to two handed axes. Unfortunately, there seems to be absolutely no way to tell if there's any difference between different weapons of the same class without buying them and playing with them. As far as I can tell, weapons are just for show, while the damage is roughly the same. And the weapon selection is very small. It boils down to the same weapon with different tiers, with the higher ones being more pretty.\n\nBut of course, no one really pays any attention to that as you are decapitated in one fell stroke by a two-handed axe, because, oh that's right, you're forced into one of three classes, with their own abilities. There is no armor selection from what I can tell, and armor is irrelevant to gameplay, since you can be decapitated in  one hit whether you're wearing the heavy mail of the Champion or the cloth of the Skirmisher.\n\nWith the release date around the corner, I don't see any indication that any more customization is going to be added in, especially for armor.\n\nSome nice features are included, such as dodging, and sprinting, and some throwing weapons that can be ridiculous at times. But they drown in the sea of axe murderers all wearing the same three things.","April 7, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Players that have also played the Mount&Blade series have an advantage as the combat controls are very similar and different from most other melee combat systems. Yet feels dynamic and perhaps a bit more realistic than combat in similar multiplayers like Chivalry.\nThe maps are very nice looking and have a detailed layout but more variety is badly needed and probably forthcoming in the final release.\nSpawning points could be a bit better protected on some maps to prevent "death on arrival"\nOverall I highly recomend it.","December 8, 2013","true","7.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was fortunate to download it during its free access weekend on Steam, this weekend. I've generally enjoyed myself as I was familiair with the IP from games such as Medieval: Chivarly, War of Roses and smaller spin-offs. Due to the games status, the current build is very glitchy and can have you upset at times. Your swing may miss or your block might not block! However, we live in a time where we purchase our product before it's even complete, so we can't expect anything different. Despite its technical flaws, the game is gorgeous and if you have the build for it I recommend you crank up the settings, you'll want to experience it.\n\nThe game isn't out yet so I won't give you my full review. I will definitely encourage fans of Medieval to purchase now before it comes up so save your wallet a tad bit (it will thank you). In its current stage you've got the ability to use classes, a wide variety of weapons/skill-sets and yeah - games simply fun to play. Have fun and enjoy!","December 7, 2013","true","1.5"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Unlike many fps, this is not a reflex game. indeed it took me a while to slow down and plan out assaults.  The best team ALWAYS wins so teamwork is really emphasised.\n\nThe thing I like best, given a bunch of new players, a 2 on 1 is not always a deathsentence like so many other games.  Indeed, I saw a guy beat 4 other players who had poor teamwork.  He was a wizard with his axe, but it was fun to play.\n\nOne final bit of praise...archery is thrilling! there is arrow drop and you have to lead the targets, so much to consider.  A single arrow, indeed two or even three might not be fatal, but a head shot isn't auto death either...you have to take into account your pull.

Where to start with this awesome game.....\n\n\nThis is the sword fighting game that we have all been hoping for on Steam. It's fast, it's vicious, and it's diverse. There are probably around 30+ weapons in this game to use. Narrowed down the weapon choices are: one handed sword, one handed axe, two handed axe, spear, bow, throwing weapons, and probably a lot more that I forgot about or are going to be added like two handed swords. Now, in each one of these weapon catigories there is probably around 5 to 10 individual different weapons in there to use. Beyond that, there's armor customization, shield customization, beard customization, and armor pattern customization. I haven't even gotten to the combat yet!\n\nIf you're hesitating to get this game because it's dubbed the sequal of war of the roses, and war of the roses was bad. Slap yourself, now, with a fish. It's been vastly improved. You can charge up a weapon to do more damage, but you have to time it correctly to do more damage, or wait too long and you do less. Blocking and fighting use the same movements, you move your mouse and left click to swing in a certain direction, left = left swing, right= right swing, up = overhead swing. The same can be said for blocking just correspond with the direction it's coming from. Shields are also in no way overpowered, they can be easily bypassed by swinging for the legs or head. You may think this is boring, but each weapon gets a special attack to mix it up a little more and do more damage at the cost of if you miss it'll take a moment to be able to recover. Did I also mention there's a perk system? The perk system is fairly balanced like the rest of the game, it's just small things, like killing an enemy can refund 25% health, and if you're chasing a sprinting enemy you move 25% faster. Oh yeah, are you annoyed by enemies that just turn tail and run? In this game you can chase after them and tackle them from behind, and give them some well deserved slashes to the face while they try to stand back up. Another thing, bows are not overpowered either, they at most do around 60 damage, but they're a pain to aim and shoot and you're kinda dead if an enemy wanders close with a sword because you can't block or shoot the bow very quickly to kill them.\n\nAll in all, this is a beyond perfect game, I would recommend it to anyone that wants to experience great feeling medieval-like combat. I probably have missed some other good stuff in this review to give you some surprises if you do get the game :D\nI promise on my honor, that there's no groundbreaking bug, or experience ruining hackers. So please! Join in on the amazing game that is War of the Vikings!\n\n","March 13, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

This is a lot more of a hack and slash kind of fighting game. Yes, you can try to parry and dodge but you won't gain much by doing so. This game unfortunately feels like a dumbed-down version of War of the Roses, where the fastest person wins and actually trying to play well by parrying and blocking does very little to help you.\n\nThe combat is based around choosing one of three character classes, the Warrior (jack of all trades), the Champion (melee) and the Skirmisher (ranged). Each class gets its own armor which cannot be changed, and a few different customization options. The combat works a little differently than in War of the Roses, as this time there are only three directions for melee attacks; Up, left and right. There are also special attacks unique to each class of weapon which will instantly kill an opponent. You'd think that these attacks would be hard to pull off, but you'd be wrong. It is incredibly easy to score instant kills with the special attacks (which are mostly unblockable by the way), which only serves to make the combat feel even less about skill and more about who can score the first hit. All attacks will also do quite a bit of damage, so you are able to kill in around 3 very fast hits usually, making combat very fast paced and dangerous, There is no room for slower, more calculated duels in this game, and basically the best way to play is to just swing blindly at opponents or try to hit them with an instakill special attack.\n\nIf you want to play as a ranged fighter this is one area where the game does play quite well, as there is some skill involved in scoring successful shots with a bow or throwing weapons, and this can make ranged combat quite fun.\n\nThe weapon customization in this game is quite well done as there are a lot of different weapon designs to choose from. However, all the weapons within a class will all have exactly the same stats no matter which weapon you pick, the only differences are cosmetic ones. The character customization I feel is somewhat lacking. You can choose a few different helmet designs, and give your character a beard or cloak, but that's about it. You canot change your armor as it is set when you choose one of the three character classes.\n\nAlso, all customization options require coins to unlock, with most also having a level requirement. Coins are gained through your actions on the battlefield, similar to experience. It takes quite a while to earn a good few coins and items tend to be quite expensive, so gaining the coins you need to, say, give your character a new beard, can feel like quite a grind.\n\nAll in all I wouldn't recommend this game as it does just feel like a dumbed-down version of War of the Roses, with less satisfying combat mechanics and less customization. It can be quite entertaining under some circumstances, but in my opinion, is not worth your time or money.\n\n4/10","April 18, 2014","false","21.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I recommend it if you have an interest in pre-medieval British history, as the aesthetic is pretty well done, even if it's not that realistic playing.\n\nShields are atrocious though and should never be used for anything but blocking arrows until they give them a much needed boost.

I wish I were wrong.\nWotR was crap, lets be honest, Ive played it just because it looked nice and was "something new". WotV, which is offered like a whole new game, should be a work on mistakes. Should be, but dont look like one actually.\n\nupdate: There was a patch after Ive posted this. For good I hope. Just info:\nSwings cant be interrupted. I think fatshark invented that to prevent 1h-spam. Bad idea. Less penalties and make parrying>=attacking, add something like M&B chamberblocking, micro-stuns from blocks/parryies with little penalties to swing-rate and something like block-decharging system to make difference in block efficiency on its timing.

The music (If there is a way to purchase the soundtrack sign me up), the combat, the style, everything fills me with joy. I know it is a long shot but if you can figure out a way to integrate a story line or campaign could honestly say my gamer dream has come true. I have a deep love for Norse mythology and its people. My family heritage is traces back to Scandinavian vikings. My ancestors were explorers and fighters all the way up to their immigration to america and I have always loved and respected my heritage.\n\nI am a loyal follower of the gods and I pay tribute to them every morning and every night. Obviously the old ways are gone but to me the pride just to know my bloodline descends from the vikings. This game deserves more exposure and I will do my part to get all my friends in on this experience. I will follow this game till its final release. I have purchased the standard edition to test the waters but after hours of gameplay I will be getting the Valhalla edition now.","October 21, 2013","true","122.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

Total Class 3 1-2 are different skills and armor that reduces damage in % no matter what weapon to beat .\n2. From the whole set of skills available only useful 2-3.\n3. Weapons unlike War of rose it can not improve. have the choice of 4 for each type of which only one normal and one a top that is expensive. The type of weapon does not does not affect the penetration of armor .\n4. Since unlike War of rose no matter what part of the weapons you get all the fights are reduced to stupid spam. Special - hitting wretchedly get them is not so easy as many kickbacks lead to death .\n5. Customization of your character at the moment is wretched . Armor does not change weapon not improve . Skills on a little influence . In addition that allows you to automatically select the direction of the block that just kills selection system side lock .\nOf Pius can be noted more realistic embroidered blocks and improved graphics .\nI think that the game is not currently worth the money really buy ray War of rose.\nLet the game is still in early access but the official release will change little .\n\nПоиграв в это можно сказать что War of rose намного лучше.\n1. Всего 3 класса которые отличны 1-2 навыками и броней которая понижает вред в % и не важно каким оружием бить.\n2. Из всего набора навыков доступных полезны только 2-3.\n3. Оружие в отличии от War of rose его нельзя улучшать. Есть на выбор по 4 на каждый тип из которых только 1 нормальное и 1 топовое которое стоит дорого. Также тип оружия не как не влияет на пробивание доспеха.\n4. Так как в отличии от War of rose неважно какой частью оружия ты попал все бои сводятся к тупому спаму. Спец-удары убоги попасть ими не так просто а долгие откаты приводят к смерти.\n5. Кастомизация персонажа на данный момент убога. Броню не поменять оружие не улучшить. Навыки мало на что влияют. Не считая того который позволяет автоматически выбирать направления блока что просто убивает систему выбора стороны блокировки.\nИз пюсов можно отметить только более реалистичные блоки шитом и улучшенную графику .\nСчитаю что игра на данный момент не стоит своих денег уж луче купить War of rose.\nПусть игра еще в раннем доступе но официальный выход мало что изменит.\n\n","February 11, 2014","false","13.5"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","0"
