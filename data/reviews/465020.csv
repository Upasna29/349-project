With decent controls and lots of ship customization options, this is a great game to have.  I recommend this game to those that are interested.\n\nThe game plays like a standard shoot-em-up, move around and shoot.  What differs is that this game has skill slots where you get to use different abilities at the cost of cooldowns.  There are 9 slots as of now and as you play the game you may unlock more and equip them.\n\nThere is a campaign, which has missions you need to complete.  It is not all linear though, you are free to complete as many side missions as you want which consists of "defeat X number of enemies" and at the end you can earn money, ship parts, or xp.\n\nThe other differences are the enemy encounters, you don't fight hordes of enemies, there will be  a much smaller amount like 1-5 depending on the enemy ship type.  Battles feel more "tactical", as in you have to dodge enemy attacks, counter attack, and defend.  This gives a feeling of accomplishment and that you earned your victory.\n\n\nThere is also ship customization which I feel is the bread and butter of this game, it is fantastic.  As you play the game you find ship parts that you can use to build and customize your own ship.  You can make it look like anything you want to.  Ship parts also have randomized stats on them that can either boost your damage, defense, or others, this gives the game a lot of replayablity.\n\n\nA gripe I have is the current movement system.  It is a bit "Jerky" and doesn't feel to smooth.  But this is minor and is subject to change in future updates.\n\nFrom a hours to price ratio, you will definietly get your money's worth, or at least break even.  Enjoyable game with loot and ship customizing, can't really go wrong.  I hope this review was helpful.","May 2","true","3.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Upgrading your ship's modules and weapons has enough depth to serve the greater purpose of the game without being overwrought or limiting. In fact, major credit to the developers for allowing the player to downgrade a previously upgraded weapon and assign the upgrade points to a different weapon at no penalty. This flexibility really encourages the player to try various play styles and strategies mission to mission, which really keeps things fresh.\n\nAs for the main course, the shooting is satisfying, the controls are sublime, and the enemies are nicely varied in both attack and defense. Visually, the user interface and menus are well done and easy to navigate. While the in-game graphics may lack a lot of flash, the minimalist kind of look works well here in spite of the abundance of brown. Overall, I have really enjoyed my early play time with Sector Six and I envision spending quite a bit more with it, especially if the replay value is as good as I think it will be.","May 3","true","68.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Part of beta and I love this game. GO ZUURIX!!!\n\nReal review:\n\nI love the style of this game and the thought of it.  Can be quite limited when you have weapon excess randomly appearing. Annoys you when going into battles. I love this game and i have been part of the beta during the last week of preparation to the steam store. If i could buy the game , i would. There are some faults to the game but Zuurix already knows my problems and im sure that they will be fixed. Hope to see Co-op soon, i would love to play with my friends. They're not sure on buying it but with my gameplays, im sure of it. GO ZUURIX!\n\nHere are my first 3 videos on Sector Six.

It has its issues but it can make up for them with the fast and enjoying gameplay. I was a beta tester and the game had its few bugs but hopefully on May 2nd when it comes out all of those will be resolved.  The latest update that I have resived had fixed most of the bugs. (Gameplay) In sector six you are a ship fighting other ships pritty much but theres more to the story than that. The game is so large that iv had Sector Six for Near 2 weeks and iv still not finished it. The levels are long and require a bit of of time to get used to them. If you dont prepare your self you will die. (ShipBuilding) Sector Six has an amazing ship building engine. I am a dev my self and have never seen a Gamemaker Studios game with a Building Engine like that.  You can build huge ships and small ships with loads of weapons. (Enemys) Theres loads of differnt types of enemys. from little buggeres to huge ♥♥♥ Laser Burning, Missile Firing, Massive Stations.\n(Performance)Sector six is an amazing game but peformance can ruin a game, luckly sector six runs well on your average pc. The software used to make Sector Six is Gamemaker studios. Its an easy software to use but it leans more towards cpu than graphics cards. On my Terrible pc test I used a old pc I found in a scrap Yard (Im not joking). It ran on windows vista and had a intel pentium 1.84 ghz prossesor and 2Gb of onboard ram. The game ran Well with a few frame rate drops. But one thing stood out, The Cpu usage. the terrible pc used 89.4 percent of the cpu so I would not open any other applications or you could have a big frame rate drop. On my IMac 2011 core I5 21.5 Inch running windows 10 it Ran flawless with 29.7% Cpu usage and on my costom pc it ran 21.6% of the cpu. Sector Six only takes on average 132 Mbs of ram So its good for low ram users.\n\nThis was a review from the whole FusionTurtle Team. Hope to see the next Game zurrix my old friend. As a fellow dev I wish you all the luck on your next game","May 3","true","1.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I can skip missons by avoiding the ships\n\nConclusion\nSaying all this things I am sure the dev will fix most of this issue soon,and all the cons are not really game-changing and for $10 this game is amazing with the very unqiue gameplay that you can not find anywhere else this game will be a very soul-ful experience in addition to the constant updates from the dev this game will be amazing (it alerdy is) trust me I saw this game before beta and it was good then BUT IT HAS IMRPOVED ALOT FROM THEN i cant wait for the updates for this game!!! its just getting better, for $10-7 Your getting a game that you can play for more then 40hours which is just amazing because most movies cost $12 and give you only 1-3 hours of entertainment!!!! I was close to recommending this game but I would wait just a little bit for zuurix to get dem updates XD but get this game now everyone and start playing !!!","May 3","true","0.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It was then, and still remains great. The highlight in my mind is the customizable ships. The story is a bit interesting as well. Its addictive, but the only problem I have is that the leveling up sees to take forever.
