Brawlhalla is one of the latest and greatest in the development of tools to achieve these noble ends.\n\nThe game delivers a 2D Super Smash Brothers-esque experience to the PC, enabling you to beat up people by means not necessarily limited to beating up your keyboard and suicide bombing that would make Osama Bin Laden proud.\n\nBrawlhalla offers a rich array of characters. You can pick from the following eight-fingered legends:\n\n-A sentient suit of armor powered by Iranian weapons-grade Plutonium,\n-Cowman the Unbroken,\n-Super Mohawk Obama,\n-A Norse man with a small sword and big bear balls,\n-Cuauhtémoc’s snake charming love child born from his affair with Queen Isabella,\n-Diesel-powered Mad Max,\n-The infamous Burgundian Baguette Burglar of Bordeaux,\n-Asgard’s mini golfing and pole vaulting champion extraordinaire,\n-A spooky scary skeleton,\n-A demonic mosh pit ninja,\n-The guy who formed the United Kingdom by subjugating Scotland and Ireland with nothing but his beard,\n-The girl who made Britannia rule the waves and the sky with lots of steam,\n-A cyclops alien Crip from Planet Ferguson (contrary to developer propaganda, Roldakk-9 was actually the city of Ferguson, Missouri),\n-A wolf-riding elven Greenpeace activist,\n-The gun-toting, law-enforcing cowgirl who inspired Chuck Norris to become a Texas Ranger,\n-G.N.A.S.H. Genocidal Neolithic Abominable Smashing Homosapien,\n-A heroine from a hi-tech cyberpunk future who is surprisingly adept with a primitive spear,\n-A homeless guy from down the alleyway who acquired a sword and a pirate hat,\n-A savage anthropomorphic tiger who drove the British out of India. Gandhi promptly took all the credit.\n-A teleporting samurai who materializes wooden planks out of thin air,\nAnd the lastest addition,\nThe vampire-hunting daughter of Scarlet and Lucien who whips people with bungee cords.\n\nIn your quest to savagely beat up your friends as well as strangers, you will have a variety of signature moves and weapons at your disposal. These include:\n\n-The Helicopter,\n-The Upside-Down Helicopter,\n-The Black Lives Matter Hammer,\n-A little Birdy,\n-Mini golfing with a Battle Axe,\n-Storm Surge from Hurricane Katrina,\n-A Tractor Beam,\n-Roundhouse Kicks,\n-Old-Fashioned Uppercuts,\n-Jousting,\n-The Dust Bowl,\n-Hiawatha Snake Magics,\n-Slow-Motion Gunplay,\n-Pretending to play a xylophone in midair on someone’s face with a pair of pistols,\n-The Broadside Cannon Barrage,\n-The Incredibly Versatile Human Torpedo,\n-The Baguette Butcher,\n-Using a massive hammer as a pooper scooper,\n-Spikey Balls,\n-and Land Mines.\n\nOverall, after sustained play, your friends will go down in flames and your keyboard will go up in smoke. Therefore, Brawlhalla provides a satisfying experience.\n\nFor the price of free, it is outright foolhardy to skip out on this game.","January 23","true","222.4"," 122 of 139 people (88%) found this review helpful 125 people found this review funny","88","122","139","125","8"

OH, they just dropped out of the sky! And it's on! Cowman picked up an axe. It's like I always say FRED, never trust a cow with an axe.\nTED: When have you said that?\nFRED: And there's the Spaceman, whoa! He just grabbed a spear! Watch out, aliens. This astronaut is ♥♥♥♥♥♥!\nTED: It's a ROBOT! What about his machine-like body looks like an astronaut to you?\nFRED: OH, cowman just slapped astro-sparta in the face with his axe, but he's up.

I can't compliment the good aspects of this ENOUGH.\nLets see why.\n\n-Fun friendly multiplayer action.\n-Great for both Casual and Competitive players\n-Absolutely F2P, you don't have to pay a dime in this game to have the same equality as everyone else.\n-Developers are always on the spot when it comes to issues.\n-Every legend is unique and is of equal match, depending on your playstyle.\n-Skins in the game add for some character individuality, but they are not required.\n-Colors, Exp gain, Legends to unlock as you fight your way through the world of Brawlhalla\n-Satisfaction of either winning or learning from matches.\n-The weapons are well balanced, (even if most people say otherwise, of course it's difficult to make everything perfect)\n-The Game's Open-Beta tag, does not at all mean it plays like a poorly constructed "in development" game.\n-Friendly Community who has provided both myself and other members a very satisfying experience.\n\n\nI can't love this game enough, or give enough good things about it to tell people how great Brawlhalla is. BMG, you did it right, you sly dogs. :)\n\n\nThere might be some of you that come from the Smash Bros community, and let me tell you this. This is not Smash Bros. This is not Project M-halla. This is none of that. Brawlhalla is a fighting arena, where players can have fun playing the fame, or take it to a more technical, competitive edge. Don't downgrade this game just because it's light and bouncy, and not overly technical like Smash. That's unfair to rank these two games under the same umbrella. I came from Melee background, and I find this JUST as enjoyable as I would any other game in any other format.\n\n\n\nREVIEW UPDATE:\nThere are still always ongoing changes and improvements to this game. A recent update proves that BMG openly listens to the community and takes the suggestions sent to them.\n\nA lot of people coming from the smash community were upset that there was no fast fall mechanic. That was recently changed to accomodate the faster paced players. This doesn't not have a large impact on the game, but atleast enough to provide more creative variables. No you can't just speed hop all over the place, but you wont run into issues with players always being able to read you.\n\n\n\n\nBest of luck, and welcome to Brawlhalla!","November 3, 2015","true","870.3"," 65 of 76 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","65","76","6","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RestNowMusic/recommended/291550/","RestNowMusic","Rest Now","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RestNowMusic/","312 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This review is no longer being updated, as I do not play Brawlhalla as often as I once did. However, it is still a great game and I reccommend it 100%\n\nWell, let's talk about Brawlhalla for a sec, shall we?\n\nAt first glance it would seem as though it's a PC game going for the style of Smash Bros. On the 10th or so glance, it seems as though it's a PC game going for the style of Smash Bros. But with a few twists that keep it mostly seperate.\n\nFirst of all is the weapon system. I personally LOVE this mechanic. You start off with your weak melee attacks until you pick up a weapon, displayed on-screen as a generic sprite. When that happens, you get a non-generic weapon. Each character has a combination of two weapons that they can recieve. There's guns, spears, hammers, 1 sword, 2 swords, and a rocket lance. That's right, a rocket lance. Though each weapon is not exclusive to their characters, each character has 2 exclusive moves (1 per weapon) that they can use. Each weapon is VERY nicely balanced, and I'll talk more about that later.\n\nThere are also items you can pick up, though variety is sparce. There are spiky balls called Mace-Balls, which you throw at enemies. There are land mines, which you can either throw at your opponent(s) or at the walls and floors. Finally, there are plain ol' bombs that will make you stare in disbelief as you fly off into your doom after some ♥♥♥♥ throws one at you.\n\nOnline play. I'm a little... eh about the quality of the online play at the moment. On one hand, it's incredible to wreck people online and tell them "gg" before having all of them ragequit, (Seriously, check out my Brawlhalla screenshots, I have that one in there somewhere) there is a lot of lag sometimes. On one hand, some matches can be as smooth as offline play, on the other hand some can involve unforseen game mehanics such as teleportation and death by "I swear that guy was on the other side of the map .01 seconds ago". Despite this, the developers have stated repeatedly they are constantly working on improving online play. They have had multiple lag fix patches already and more are to come. So, that'll make the game even better.\n\nOffline play is so fun. There's a tournament mode where you play against CPUs to be the ultimate champion. The CPUs are pretty easy themselves, but the challenge lies in not getting killed while gathering many kills to get a high score. There is a star rating out of 5 you get at the end, with 5 being pretty difficult to acheive (SPOILER: There's a practically impossible rating to get that's above 5 stars... No more hints as to what it is) Also, there's local play where you can play with up to four people using controllers, and one person can use the keyboard or keyboard-mouse. No LAN unfortunately. The last thing is training mode. I won't go too much into detail with this, but imagine Smash Bros' training mode + damage per hit shown, visible hitboxes, and hitstun visibility.\n\nThe balance. Outstanding. Though this could also be a statement as to the lack of variety, you could almost press random in a tournament match and come out the victor with anyone you got. Of course, it's not perfect. But unlike some other games, which have tier lists from SS all the way down to F or even G, Brawlhalla's tier list is more like an SS to A. EDIT:]/b] There have been some updates since I wrote this review. There have been several balance changes which have wrecked the balance. First Gnash was broken, and was all you would see on Ranked 1v1. Then they patched that, but in the process broke hatorri who is now far beyond any character in ranking. This slightly lowers my rating from what it was. Edit: This game has frequent patches. It's in a good spot right now I'd say :)\n\nWait, did I say "tournament match"? Yes, Brawlhalla has a competitive community that even now, in closed beta, is over 100 erm, times have changed. Make that 50,000+ strong. This is when the game isn't publicly available, and there's over 100 50,000+ people participating in competitive play. Think about that for a moment. Sure the game has been given away in many places already, but still. As I write this even, I am procrastinating much needed sleep for a Brawlhalla tournament tommorow.\n\nPROS:-Great brawler in the style of Smash Bros\n-Good offline mode\n-Has an online mode\n-Near impeccable balance\n-Growing competitive community\n\nCONS:-Online mode can be VERY laggy at times\n-I can't beat Raidhyn\n-No LAN play\n-A little empty (Probably just a closed beta problem)\n-Many characters are kind of similar\n\nNot sure if PRO or CON:-Very limited variety on items\n-Similar enough to Smash Bros to almost be called a ripoff. Not quite though.\n\n\nOVERALL VERDICT:9/10 game, for being in beta.\nIf this was the finished product, I'd give it an 7.5 or 8/10.\nVery much reccomend this, as it's free to play. I've gotten REALLY into it.\n\nTLDR: Brawlhalla is a great game and it's free. You like brawlers you'll love Brawlhalla. Play it.","January 31, 2015","true","328.7"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","49","53","9","0"

In almost all ranks there is little to no difference in success with legends, all that matters is skill and practice. And even in the higher ranks where balance makes more of a difference, it's still completely possible to do well with any legend.\n\nSure the community isn't that great on the lower ranks, and spamming can get really annoying, but after you get past silver theres a huge improvement. Spamming doesn't get you to diamond, and if you try you will get stopped in your tracks in gold. The community outside of bronze, like on reddit or twitch, is really great and not very toxic. Most people are just nice people that would love helping out new people or just talk about the game. If you're looking to improve, you can just head over to twitch and observe, or ask for help.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is that there is no pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hidden inside. You can unlock every character without spending a cent, and theres a new free legend rotaion every week. Daily quests help people rake in more cash, and if you want you can spend money to get some cool bling to show off like skins or taunts, which have no effect to the gameplay whatsoever.\n\nBMG is a great company and puts a lot of love into the game, and you can really tell. Every week they have a stream where they show off things in development, and another one where they just play with viewers. There are raffles in both where you can win community colors, which is a color palette that is only obtainable through giveaways (again, no effect on the game). They really do listen to the community, and they hang out at the subreddit a lot and read most of the posts there.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's super fast-paced and fun, even if you don't even know what you're doing. There are a couple different game types, and you can have up to 8 players in one game for complete chaos. You can either join with a friend and play 2v2 ranked, or go alone in 1v1. It's a little floaty, but there's nothing really wrong with that. You can jump around all the time or stay on the ground, whatever you want. There are light and heavy attacks for both ground and air, so neither one has a distinct advantage. As I said before, this game is actually extremely balanced, and in pretty much anything below diamond, everything is 99% balanced.\n\nSo in short yes I would reccomend this game.","February 14","true","392.8"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","50","57","5","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/291550/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n-Disclaimer- This preview was written during Early Access. Brawlhalla is subject to change.\n\nBrawlhalla is a dream come true for some gamers. Fans of Smash Bros have always had to turn to a console to sate their chaotic filled tendencies. Brawlhalla finally brings things to the PC/Mac and makes it readily available to everybody. The combat is fantastic, music well done, each character feels defined. It offers multiple game modes, couch co-op, single player and possibly more on the horizon. Brawlhalla seems like indeed something that did come from the heavens and is here to answer all your prayers. However, like most things that are too good to be true, there is something going on underneath the surface. Perhaps a venus flytrap of gaming if you will, showing you its tasty gaming nectar and then eating you whole. What am I talking about? Let's go on a little journey.\n\nThe core of the gameplay is exactly what you want it to be. 4 player brawling action is brought to you with a multitude of character choices. Now unlike that "other" game, these characters aren't perhaps as well known. Matter of fact if you asked me their names, I couldn't tell you. There is the robot guy, ninja girl, alien dude, minotaur man, pirate guy. You get the idea. It's not that these characters are not unique, matter of fact they each look very different and are very well animated. Just for the most part it really isn't that big a deal when you break things down.\n\nEach character comes with a set of two weapons and different statistical choices, ranging from strength, defense, and speed. Now each weapon itself has a certain power set, the rocket lance can blast you forward, the guns obviously have a ranged aspect to them, the hammer is slow but powerful etc. Characters share these items, the only thing that changes is the style in which the power-attacks are presented. While aesthetically this works, your character choice really doesn't change all too much when it comes to combat. I was just as good with ninja girl/sword then I was with pirate/sword. There are some attacks that are very different and then there are some that are exactly the same. The fact the characters are all more or less the same doesn't take away from the game too much. The combat is still fast, reactive, and fun. Just keep in mind the weapon sets are more important then the character flavor itself. Predicting what your enemies bring to table also is difficult because the ability to change your stats, this adds and takes away a little bit from the tactical nature of the Brawl style game.\n\nFrom there we launch into the levels and chaos ensues. The levels themselves are designed fairly well but nothing too exciting, mostly platforms in different positions. One level did feature moving platforms. I felt the levels need a dose of personality, hazards, traps, something to make them stylized and make them feel like as much of a character as the one you choose. Everything does blend well, the characters feel like they fit with the levels art style and everything flows well with the combat. The game controls easily, but it is probably is preferential to play with a controller, luckily the game does feature full controller support/rebindable keys.\n\nDetails of the game are fairly well polished as well. Music is high paced and decent, matching the style and themes of the game, although it is nothing too memorable. Thankfully it doesn't get repetitive. Sound effects are perfect and add that oomph you want when something explodes or when you crack someone really hard. Game modes are varied, although there isn't a story mode yet. You have a tournament mode, online, and even some in-game mini-games. This I liked quite a bit and would love to see it expanded upon. The options menu is a tiny bit lacking at this current moment in development but hopefully that will change.\n\nSo everything sounds great right? I would agree with you. Brawlhalla is a well done, action packed, competent game on Early Access. Lacking in bugs and online multiplayer is working well.(If you're US based.) Here is the catch, this is closed beta. Meaning that this game is eventually going to open up to everybody. Which means that Brawlhalla will be Free to play.(FTP) Which means one terrible and dreadful thing exists in the underbelly of this game. Microtransactions.\n\nMallhalla as its known, is the shop where you can buy all sorts of digital goodies. Now let me say I am not against Microtransactions. IF they are done right. I understand developing a game is not cheap and that there are bills to be paid and families to be fed. I am perfectly fine with everything on sale in the shop as well, all of it is cosmetic. Where Mallhalla begins to scare me is the huge gap between Taunts and Redeem Code. That could easily be filled with Characters, Weapons, and Levels. Which means you could be barred from using a new weapon set or new level, new character etc. There are plenty of ways that could all go sideways. Suddenly this goes from a fun brawl game, to pay me money to play with this toy. That might not be the case at all but it's something that should be kept in mind.\n\nThe prices of the micro-transactions themselves are also a bit wonky, if you ask me. Mammoth coins cost anywhere from $2.99 for 60 to $49.99 for 1000. With skins costing on average 140 coins that places the actual retail price at a whooping $7.00. That is quite a bit for a skin.(Although this isn't unusual in FTP games) While prices are not final and may change, this is still a scary example of things that are in the game right now. Start throwing in new characters and new weapon sets. Which undoubtedly will be higher priced then skins, suddenly this is a very expensive game.\n\nNow the developer has mentioned there will be an in-game currency that can purchase the items in the shop. Those have yet to be implemented at this point in development.\n\nBrawlhalla is a promising game, one that I hope doesn't fall prey to greed or bad decisions. It is not a clone of its inspiration and competition. Deviating in some features/mechanics that are for better or worse, Brawlhalla captures that one magic element, fun filled chaos. Giving you massive amounts of replay and letting you play with your friends. The game has a bright future, long as that mico-transaction element is handled carefully and they listen to their community.\n\nI will keep a watchful eye on Brawlhalla as development continues and it moves into open beta. More servers are added to expand the multiplayer. There are still many things that can be improved upon and hopefully those prices change a little bit. The little Smash player inside of me is optimistic, I hope he doesn't get knocked out of the board in one smash.","June 24, 2015","true","3.5"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","41","45","0","4"

From the art style to the gameplay, everything just feels...perfect. Lots of people call this "Smash Bros. for the PC", but it's really not that similar. Each character has two weapons, which some other characters have access to as well. Each weapon has a set of light attacks, which is the same for any character who has the weapon. The "signature" moves for each weapon, however, are unique to that character. With the weapon mechanic, one character has three different movesets they could be using at any given time (weapon 1, weapon 2, and unarmed). The community is pretty amazing; the only time you find any toxic players are the lower ranks of Ranked 1v1. Everywhere else (i.e. higher ranks and Reddit), the people are simply amazing. The dev team constantly listens to the community and quickly responds to and acts on ideas the community have put forth.

The weapon system however isn't flawless and although I like the idea of a character having 2 optional weapons they all function the same besides three special moves that resemble smash attacks from smash bros, you have up/neutral, forward and downwards which is about the only differences between characters besides choice of weapon. Overall though, this game is a lot of fun to play and if you do need a smash alternative to play with friends out of either not wanting to emulate smash and play through netplay or just not owning a Wii U/3DS this game is definitely worth getting.","December 1, 2015","true","22.0"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","34","37","0","0"

However, it has taken out a lot of the things that made Smash so difficult to learn in recent years and what is left is an elegant game that is easy to understand but hard to master.\n\nGood Movement: The first thing to notice is how accurate and precise the movement is. The movement in other games of this style is often very floaty, making it hard to position your character correctly. In Brawlhalla the movement is 1:1 and easy to predict.\n\nSimple Controls: The controls are mercifully simple: weak attack, heavy attack, jump, throw item, and dodge (and taunt). The key difference between Brawlhalla and other games of this type is the weapon system. When unarmed every character has the same moves, but when you pick up a weapon powerup you will get one of two weapons (randomly). These weapons are set per character, and the light attacks are the same for every character.\n\nThere are combos, but they are limited to strings of three attacks at the absolute most. This places more of an emphasis on positioning and correct skill usage - though to be fair, there are a few difficult combos that are essential to very high level play.\n\nInteresting Weapon System: The differences between characters come down to three "signature" moves per weapon, and different stat configurations (armor, speed, etc.). While this probably sounds like a negative, what this means is that it is very easy to reach a point where you can play almost any character, because all you need to do is master the basic attacks of each weapon and then test out a character's six signature moves. Even better, the signature moves often function in similar ways: no direction + signature is usually an anti air, for example.\n\nElegant Item System: Apart from the weapons, there are exactly four items. The bomb detonates on contact, the landmine sticks to a surface and will blow up when a player approaches, and the spike ball is a projectile that is reusable and does a high amount of knockback. There is also a horn, which can be blown to summon a fireball and carry in a weapon for you, or it can be thrown as a projectile.\n\nAll four of these items can be caught out of mid air if your timing is good, and most of them can be used to set up elaborate traps or combos; bounce the bomb against the ground and then kick your opponent into it as it arcs downward.\n\nGreat Training Mode: If you do want to grind out hours in training mode, this game offers you lots of data. You can see the hitboxes of any move, and even slow down and replay each frame of a move to see where the hitboxes and hurtboxes are at any given point. There is the standard combo and damage counter as well.\n\nRecommended to Those With Smash Fatigue: All of this is to say that this is a simplified game in all of the best ways. Sticking to a small set of items and reducing the control barrier makes Brawlhalla a joy to play and improve at. The complexity comes from learning how its design elements interact, more so than grinding out hours in training mode.\n\nThis recommendation is really for people who are not a fan of the increasing complexity of Smash Bros. Fans of that series may be reading this and thinking that all of my positives sound like negatives. If that sounds like you, try it out anyway, it's free.\n\nLastly, I want to say that the way the developers interact with the community is great. Their patch notes are delivered with good explanations for why they made each change, and they take both game feel and win ratio into account when balancing characters. They update weekly, or nearly weekly, the servers are usually good, and new characters come out regularly.","March 5","true","171.1"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","40","50","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/291550/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat is up everyone I hope you are having a wonderful day. Early access is always a risky gamble but here’s one where the risk is literally almost free. We’re tuning into a 1v1 ranked match in Brawlhalla and we’ll kick started it with that.\n\nSo far I will recommend this game. However, I do not suggest you buy any additional items at this time unless you are willing to try and be part of what could be the next big "super smash" on steam. ***This game has improved since it's inception*** and has added some major updates to refine and introduce new features. As the big giant blue sign says though, the game is early access.\n\nIn short, Brawlhalla is melee with the giant exception most of the battles can be fought in the air and some crazy and odd combos can be strung together. Also, here is a cool feature off the bat : the loading screen to play another online game let's you battle it out with AI's while waiting. Unlike Super Smash Bros. : Melee specifically, the game doesn't have a "fast" feel to the game play. Rather, the game is smoothed out and requires proper timing (and the right button) to deliver an effective blow. The game is played generally in the air but the ground attack specials provide for more than enough umph and entertainment. The challenge to out whit your opponents seems equal at almost all odds. Some players will choose to take a precautious route while others will be willing to sacrifice themselves for a win.\n\nBrawlhalla mimics in it's corridors super smash. It is because it seems as the first reference to come to mind. On the other hand, it isn't as I feel the strategies are really diverse and open to the player. There are character limitations and powers in both games but changing and throwing weapons distinguishes brawlhalla. Getting knocked off the map has become avoidable with all characters. When you think you're dead or when you have no chance, it seems playing fields are almost even all the time. The edge of the map is a different game entirely here from smash. Think of kicking a soccer ball versus a golf ball. Being able to slide on the edges opens up a new dynamic (and possibilities) for both players. It seems as those who simply wait to strike at vulnerable times seem to win the most.\n\nThe game is persistent in it's work to differentiate itself from smash. Is this a good thing or bad thing you may be asking yourself? It's neither really, until the game is done then a full judgment can be made. The scoring system seems to play the odds of K/D ratio's while the HUD display simply shows it's awesomeness in the top right (although I wish that awesomeness was a tad bit bigger in sprite size)! It's tough sometimes keeping up with the fights, but the camera does a pretty good job of keeping you right where the action is. In other words, the zoom is definitely on the right track. Multiple game types make this game phenomenal. I can jump online with friends and play a free for all or play some two player ranked. It's actually pretty nice to see considering it's in the state it's in.\n\nThere are weapon drops in the game which resembles smash, but unlike smash, you're allowed to throw away your main weapon at any time. There aren’t random weapons like smash but there is some variety. The weapon-drop will drop and can be picked up within a certain time by anyone. Each character is given two weapons consistent of axes, guns, spears, swords and not limited to javelins. In this sense, some characters have preferred fighting choices and when unlocked, can change their fighting stances (which can modify stats slightly but limited to local game modes only at the moment). Items are a nice addition to the game, and do not feel as though they tilt the odds. The longer the player holds the button down, the more umph goes behind the shot. Items include a spike ball, a bomb, a mine, and my favorite, the horn. The horn creates a line of fire across the screen and even delivers another weapon to the position you blew it from. I have to admit that this style of weaponry is actually nice. It's breath of fresh air as it's something new. If you get tired of using this, try using this instead. Don't like this, go back to the other thing.\n\nGraphics resemble those of Castle Storm but there is nothing wrong with that. The art style is nice and again, sets itself apart from smash. Sounds are good, but I would like to see a variance. Make a sword sound like a sword (even when thrown), and make a javelin sound different than a sword when it bounces off the ground. Stages didn't sit well with me at first, but they do change over time. I felt as though they were a bit small, I still do but I can see why they are the size they are. I would suggest adding some levels that are larger and try to stay away from creating every level about the same size. I do like the physical changes that go on in the map, again another + for being different from smash. If you really want to get creative, maybe add certain objects that can explode, upgrade, or slow down players in certain spots (and maybe make them usable every minute or so).\n\n\n\n****MAY 2016 update\n\nEverything is in good shape but the servers may deter you from playing long (or at all sometimes). More servers are on the way but I've noticed some players have gotten pretty frustrated and simply quit (including myself)! Nothing worse than ranking down or losing when your character jumps (frame rates) to their death. Hopefully this gets fixed asap and updates keep coming. Game play is literally feeling in good shape and would maybe even like to see more mini-games? 4v4 local? Anything is welcomed as there is certainly no shortage on skins. I would also like to see the in-game coins be put to some kind of use in the future. Right now, everything seems dependant on Mammoth Coins. Mind you, these are only artificial changes not game re-structuring ones. I wouldn't mind seeing some more maps added in the future as well. They've been adding characters every so often but no new topography! I'm excited to see what the final-release will have in store.\n\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 7.5/10 ***updated as June 2016\n\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	B	Overall 	B\n\nThe devs are actually really good at hearing out the community.

There are quite a few characters and at first glance they all appear relatively the same, until you start using them. The other game I would say Brawlhalla lends inspiration from is Soul Calibur. Routinely, (in SSB style), weapon pickups appear throughout the battlefield.\n\nEach character can use one of two weapons and the weapon you get upon picking up the weapon drop is one of those two. Within that mechanic, each character utilizes each weapon in a slightly different way, resulting in some very stylisticly different fighters. You can also of course duke it out with your fists as well. It's always fun to throw your enemy for a loop by throwing your weapon at them then rushing in and giving them a haymaker to the face.\n\nThe game is still in beta and there are very few 'miscellaneous' items on the battlefield, tho it's hard to say what will come as more content is added to the game (just the other day they added another new fighter) but at the moment the combat feels very solid and fair (maps are also quite simple, though there are many variations). I'm going to be giving this game a lot of attention, and several fellows of mine have organized a small tournament for which I am eagerly training up for. This game is awesome.","February 4","true","83.5"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","38","47","6","3"

It's simple, but it's so smooth and fast, and it's great fun.

My advice: don't play while you're tired, it really affects your skill and you might get beat to lower rank very quickly.\nSome people say there are too few moves. I disagree: with the current number of skills you can execute sick combos and create your play style with each character. As I said, I'm in Gold tier and I cannot do some moves that seem pretty basic, yet still I win a lot. Also, some characters are easier to play, some are harder - but if you learn to play hard ones, you'll rock.\n\nPros:\n+ elastic gameplay, you can choose if you wanna play casually or hardcore\n+ large number of characters to play; each character has its style and you must learn how to play them or against them.\n+ really nice graphics - I set background from one map as a wallpaper on my corporate laptop ;D\n+ Large community, there is always somebody to play\n\nCons:\n- Balance issues - as you're mid Silver, you will hate Hattori. She is simply OP and takes a lot of defeats to learn how to fight against her. Get a few matches playing Hattori to check what are her attacks, strong and weak spots etc. Other characters have their issues too.\n- Rude community - at least in my opinion. People can be nice and thankful for a great match, but most of them are kids who get angry while losing and they either DC (one free win, so it isn't that bad ;)) or call you a spammer, noob or worse, no matter if they win or lose. It's a motherf**king game for God's sake, you're supposed to have fun with it. If you don't then why you play it? One dude wished me to die quickly - enjoy your report, mate!\n- Too few ranked modes, imho.\n- Creating a couch party game is a pain in the ♥♥♥... I tried to play with my friend on one PC and we didn't manage to establish a game. I know that there is a way, but how to do it? I really wish to screw my friends while they're sitting next to me.\n\nAnyway, if you want a good arcade game to spend some time with and practice your manual skills, the choice is simple.

And I mean anybody. Its the same genre as super smash brothers, but with such different gameplay that anybody that calls it a "smash clone" is simply put, wrong. I came from an entirely different type of game -- first person shooters -- and still climbed the ladder up to 1st in the world. If that doesn't tell you that anyone can succeed in Brawlhalla, then I don't know what can. But that's not all that this game has going for it. Not at all.\n\nLet's start out with the developer team. Blue Mammoth Games really needs to be prasied. Why? Well, they respond to community feedback in massive ways, whether it is complains about things in the game, or suggestions for things to be added into the game, the devs give their feedback and ACTUALLY DO WHAT SEEMS RIGHT FOR THE GAME, rather than just trying to make a profit or whatever. This game is NOT pay to win, and it will never be, because the developer team is smart. So smart in fact, that they are very active on social media, whether its from the subreddit (go check it out if you haven't, its amazing), twitter, the steam fourms, or whatever else, which is CRUCIAL in this day and age. They also run a developer stream every Tuesday to show off upcoming features or new characters in the work, and they also give out beta keys and in-game skins at set times. They are also actively adding features into the game, with, as the trailer said, an ever-expanding roster, new gamemodes, etc.\n\nNext, the gameplay. This game runs like a flaming knife on butter; which it to say, smoothly. The gameplay is flawless, the mechanics are beautiful, and most importantly, it FEELS GOOD. Just to let you know, my main game was Team Fortress 2, where i put about 2000 hours into the game. After I installed Brawlhalla, I forgot how to use a mouse.\n\nSpeaking of mice; the control schemes. You can play this game with successfully with ANY of the control schemes they have (full keyboard, keyboard and mouse, controllers, etc.), and they are actively adding more and more compatibility for your external devices. Don't have support for your fight stick? Email the devs, they will add it. Have some input lag with your controller? Email the devs, they will fix it. Like I said before, the devs are AMAZING.\n\nFinally, I'll talk about the community. Never before have I found a community like this. They are NICE, CARING, HELPFUL. If that doesn't sound like a community you want to be in, then let me elaborate. Suppose there is a new player asking for help in the game. BOOM, somebody comments on their post with paragraphs of advice, while also branching out, telling the new player to add them on steam so they can teach them firsthand.\n\nAnother huge part of the community is the Twitch aspect of it. There are many popular Brawlhalla streamers, and most of them are some of the best players in the world, so you can both watch top level gameplay, learn from the best, and have intruiging talks with people in the chat room. If you are interested in watching this game on twitch, just go to the Brawlhalla game directory and stop by! A handful of streamers were given some beta keys by the developers, so people that don't have the game can drop in, get a copy, and play with the streamer! There is even a clan based on people that go into Brawlhalla streams and start up some talks :)\n\n\nSo that's it. Brawlhalla. The best game I have ever played.","June 13, 2015","true","112.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","17","17","4","3"

There's so many things I want to say about this game but I will keep it to a minimum. First of all, it's one of my favorite games. I love Super Smash Bros, but I gotta say that I enjoy this more because of the combat system and the variety of weapons, as well as the selection of stats that the player can choose from for EACH character. Second, the moments that I've made with my friends are priceless. I've laughed harder at things that have happened in this game than anything. It's amazing to watch how dumb your friends can be and see how they can be tryhards at making cool plays. Third, it's free. FREE. So go get your beta key from the great developers who actually care about the feedback of the players of this game, right now, because you're wasting time reading this and not playing Brawlhalla.\n10/10","July 1, 2015","true","179.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","17","18","5","1"

However if you're seeking any real competitive element akin to Nintendo's Smash series then you will be sorely disappointed. I'm speaking from the perspective of a Platinum ranked 1v1 Ember player. This game's high end gameplay is filled with button mashing spam, if you are not throwing out a hitbox or a dodge at any given time then you are not playing correctly. Why? This is due to the fact that moves in this game have little to no startup frames or end-of-move lag. Someone spamming sword neutrals in the air and on the ground for example leaves about 5 frames of vulnerability that require you to breach the range of there swords and also touch them with the hitbox of your move lest they just spam out their neutral again and catch you.\n\nThe skill element just isn't there, good competitive fighting games are built on the premise of reading your opponents moves and then punishing them. I can call out reads on my opponent all day but this is the only fighting game where reading your opponent doesn't allow you to punish them. A heavy attack of hattori for instance will cover a huge radius with it's hitbox, leave her in the air behind said hitbox and then have nearly no end frame lag. The only way to punish this is move is to literally pre-emptively dodge through the attack, pre-emptive because their is no start-up lag on this huge heavy attack. In this scenario you are forced to dodge frame towards the opponent and simply get hit if he just stands still and does any other move instead.\n\nThere must be a counter to this obvious inbalance? Yes there is, it comes in the form of throwing your weapon. Throwing your weapon will hitstun the opponent and allow you to re-equip and attack the opponent within the same frame. Due to the fact that there is no priority, deflection or parry systems in this game it ends up devolving into who can throw their weapon the most. An excellent read followed up by a perfectively timed smash is all made pointless when the enemy throws their weapon at you at the last second with no punishment available for such an audacious and should-be-punishable move. I could go on forever about the games combat flaws but honestly for a free to play game it is good fun but very shallow. I don't recommend taking this game seriously as a competitive fighter as you will disappointed with the shallow button mashing, weapon throwing facade it turns into at high levels of play.","January 2","false","70.1"," 139 of 233 people (60%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","60","139","233","19","17"

Updates in (parentheses)*\nBrawlhalla is pretty much a smash bro's for the PC, except with a few twists.\n\nHere's a Quick Look video I did so you expierence for yourself what this game is like. I've got a summary below for those of you who just like the short and dirty summary. I won't judge. (Please note that throwing weapons is nowhere near as effective now, resulting in longer brawls and less chaotic deaths)\n\nhttp://youtu.be/-RJhu-8S4co\n\nThe basic concept of this game is to knock your opponents off the stage the most to win a match. There's no health bars to be seen, and only two basic attack buttons, light and heavy. The heavy attack being what you'll need to use if you wanna send your oppenents rocketing off the screen. Now while you can choose to fight with your bare fists, you can also use the few weapons that constantly get scattered throughout the match. Each weapon you pick up gives you a new moveset to fight with exception for some one-time-use ones like the battlehorn, mines, bombs, and spikeball. And that's pretty much all I can say about the mechanics of the game besides you can dodge, too.\n\nHowever, as simple as it may be, it's still a blast to play over and over again, even better when you have friends over who you can banter with and taunt. It's just satisfying to send enemies bouncing off walls to their demise, even more so when you bounce your weapons/bombs off walls and hit them when they least expected it. I also like when you're waiting a short while for a match to begin, you get matched up with some bots so you're not waiting around and doing nothing.\n\nBut let's get some of the negatives out of the way.\n\nNow I know this is early access, so I'm willing to excuse most of these things I'm about to list:\n*If you plan to play online, be prepared for terrible lag and characters warping all around the screen. It also isn't fun when you see your weapon connect with an opponent, but it phases through them like a ghost. (Also the online scene is pretty much dead at this point. Not many people playing)\n*Although there are 4(5 now) different characters currently, they don't play any differently. While it may be balanced, I'd like some variety. (This has been changed somewhat in the new patch. Characters have different stats and some unique moves depending on what you're using)\n*There is currently only 1 stage and 1 mode you can play, which is a straight deathmatch. Now don't get me wrong, the mode and stage are solid, but at least one more map and maybe a team dealthmatch should've been thrown in as well. (There's a new 1v1 match currently, but if you're single player, you have to do a weird thing by turning off bots, which really leaves one left to fight and allows you to play it. You should just be allowed to click a bot to turn it off or have a stage select.)\n*The game is super short currently and there isn't much to do/unlock. I've only played for an hour currently and have already seen everything this game has to offer. While this game has great replay value, I'm certain this might turn a few people away for the price this is currently listed at.\n*Unfortunately, there is also a lack of unique weapons, too. There's a hammer, sword, lance, and a gun, not including the throwing weapons. While the reskinned weapons they have in there may look like they do something different, they don't, so this limits the amount of diversity and mayhem that can happen on screen.\n\nBut hey, even after all that, why do I still recommend this game? Because it's still fun. And if you're willing to overlook just the lack of content it suffers from currently, I'm sure it'll grow into something better. And if the price tag is the issue, this will become free to play in the future, so you can wait until then to get it. It'll probably have more content by then, too.\n\nSo to sum it up, this is a solid game that can grow into something much bigger. The local multiplayer is fantastic right now, and if you can stand the lag or maybe get lucky, you may find the online multiplayer fun as well. So if you can look past some the of negatives I listed, you're gonna find yourself having a great time with this game.\n\n(I'll try to keep this review up to date, so when major updates start rolling out, please feel free to yell at me to give another look at this game.)","April 30, 2014","true","2.9"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","32","45","0","3"

The worst controls can make you get nervous and stressed out.\n\nGood physics No bugs while brawling, dynamic punches and perfectly fit animations.\n\nConstant updates and new legends the game is getting updated constantly, not to mention there're new legends approaching, so if you haven't found your perfect legend yet, you'll do soon. You wont be limited to the same old characters and that's a good thing(probably this is the same thing is updates but yeah whatever I thought I had to mention this)\n\nMany different gamemodes from which you can choose to play Well, being limited to one gamemode is not cool, and this game really offers you:Free for all, timing, snowball and many many more. Once you think yourself fit, you can just go to ranked and build yourself up, improving your skills, level and the  legend itself.\n\nLore I like that the lore is implemented inside the game, that's something I enjoy and I did read them, yet I think there could've been some other details mentioned, but since that's not what the game's about it's cool.\n\nCons\n\nMamooth Coins They're not after all a bad feature, it's good having "pay to earn cash" values, but still restricting everything to them is not cool either. The only thing you can use the normal coins are:legends, everything else is restricted to Mamooth coins, you can't buy skins you can't buy other weapon skins and you'll ever be restricted to the simple legends, therefore can't access the outfits you dream of. Maybe creating a price of a few outfits with coins(for sure way way more expensive) so you technically have to play like a lot of time to get that one skin.\n\n2 vs 2 Ranked Matches It's okay if you like matches where you can hit your own team mates which makes the game way more competetive, but hey this can be turned into a stress and arguments, I most of the time get  nervous while killing my own team, so I just quit. If there would be an ability to choose between enabling and disabling friendly fire, that would be awesome(2 type of 2 vs 2 matches) I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes or anything else, I've wrote this using my phone(Hell of a time) and I'm also rushing, nor is my english a top notch level but hey, that's what I could provide as of now.\n\nHave fun, I hope you find this review helpful!","April 8","true","24.8"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","28","38","2","5"

At the moment i find the settings for both graphics and audio below minimal. Things like resolution settings and audio sliders are missing. Fullscreen or window is there but you need resolution options for it to really help. In a fighting game i really want to change the difficulty of the NPC's as i improve in the game but that option is also missing. The menu is easy to navigate with greyed out buttons for not yet available content.\n\nControls:\nThere is full controller support for a fighting game i would love to be able to rebind it but can't. Keyboard and mouse support which is rebindable. Everything feels responsive though fighters feel better with controller. Icons for buttons change ingame depending on what device you use.\n\nIngame:\nArcade mode is in the form of tournaments against NPC's though with the missing difficulty option it's more of a tutorial mode. The real tutorial mode is also there and you get a 1v1 unlimited battle. The gameplay is satisfying and animations do not disappoint. I feel that the wide and expanding character roster uses mostly similar moves except for the super moves depending on the weapon. Items drop in the battle in the form of spike balls, bombs, explosive diggy bombs? and swords. When grabbing a sword you randomly get one of your characters weapons like dual pistols, spears, katana's or claws. There is a powered lance with which depending on the character you can perform moves like shooting out a steam blast or do a big dash forward. Overall i would like to see more item and weapon variety since the character roster doesn't lack. Characters all look unique and there is a good gender balance.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThis is where the game shines! Brawlhalla has a very functional matchmaking online multiplayer mode and something that PC games lack so greatly, local co-op. When entering online matchmaking you go into a pre-fight to practise while players are being matched. I was able to get into a match literally 1 second after getting out of the loading screen. It is not possible to see what country a player is from though you do see their names. Lag was very minimal to non existant, however you can't see the latency you or others are having. Steam says there is cross-platform multiplayer but i am not aware of releases other than PC and Mac.\n\nAchievements:\nNo steam achievements available yet.\n\nDLC:\nNone known yet.\n\nConclusion:\nBrawlhalla is a satisfying brawler with lots of unique characters and weapons. The game shines in it's very functional multiplayer. I read somewhere that it would be F2P which would be awesome if not let's wait on that price.","November 22, 2014","true","64.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Take the original review with a grain of salt, I guess:\n\nIf you're a fan of Smash Bros and those games appeal to you because of the craziness the games allow, you will probably enjoy this game. If, however, you have any interest in playing games at more than a strictly casual level (maybe you still have friendly competition with your friends but you also have a drive to really get better at a game on an objective level), I wager you'll enjoy Brawlhalla a lot less. A number of other negative reviews have touched on some of the game's issues but I'd like to expand on those and explain why such issues are as potentially negative as they're being said to be.\n\nI've long wanted wanted an alternative to Smash Bros titles, an alternive whose developers have a good understanding of  what makes a game like this fun to play, who understand balance, character diversity, spectatorability, etc., but unfortunately I do not feel that Brawlhalla is that game. Here are the main reasons, mechanically speaking, why I feel this way:\n\n- The game has very floaty movement, and as such, going from air to ground is a very slow process. Each character has three jumps, and each jump gives you several, long seconds of airtime; as others have correctly noted, it feels like you're on the moon. This means that if your opponent gets sent off stage but doesn't die, unless they screw something up horribly, they will make it back to the stage and there's not a whole lot you can do about it. You move slowly in the air so it's hard to position yourself to setup for edge guarding, and on top of that, if you hit an opponent who is offstage, they get one of their jumps back. If you're going to make a game with the objective of knocking your opponent off the stage, why make it so difficult to actually do that?\n\n- On top of being slow in the air, characters are also slow on the ground. Characters appear to have different "stats" but even the fastest of the characters run quite slowly. This means that if you try to approach an opponent on the ground, because of your lack of speed, they have plenty of time to react to what you're doing, and you can't do much to stop that because your movement options are limited to: trying to turning around (which takes a really long time to do mid-run, aka not practical), jumping (putting you in the air and in a more vulnerable position), or dodging (which isn't particularly effective because it's really the only option in terms of staying on the ground, so it's very easy to adapt to). The microgame of approaching an opponent and creating an opportunity to attack is thus pretty shallow.\n\n- Getting hit by attacks only stuns you for a very short period of time, meaning that combos (or strings, if you prefer) a la Smash Bros (some of them more than others) are more or less impossible. If you hit an opponent, they are either sent too far away for you to attack them again, or they recover from being hit so quickly that they can hit you right back if you try to attack again. If your attacks aren't going to lead into any combos, then, why would you bother ever hitting someone with an attack that's not going to kill them? A lack of combos makes the game less exciting to watch and to play, and removes a lot of potential depth that you see in other fighting games (some of the Smash Bros titles included). I'm not asking for anything over-the-top like combos in Marvel vs Capcom 3, but it sure would be nice to be able to hit my opponent more than once every 10 seconds. The game mechanics make it difficult to actually track your opponent down and hit them, and even if you get the hit, the situation resets and you're back to trying to figure out another way to get close enough to hit them without them hitting you right back.\n\nIn the Smash Bros games, combos/strings often involve quick thinking and smooth transitions between ground and air to make use of the most of your moveset to keep the combo going. The mechanics of Brawlhalla make this essentially impossible to do.\n\n- Character variety seems very slim. Each character appears to have the same basic attacks, with the only real variety being their appearance, and which two main "items" or weapons the character is capable of picking up. The character select screen lists stats for each character (looks like strength, speed, defense, etc.), but it wasn't enough for me to really tell the difference between any of them. Pick up any Smash Bros game and you can immediately tell the difference between playing as Bowser and playing as Captain Falcon, because everything about them is completely different (speed, air control, weight and gravity, not to mention all of their moves). Brawlhalla lacks that variety.\n\n- This is perhaps a bit more subjective, but the controls felt relatively unintuitive to me. The button layout etc. seemed just fine really, but it didn't seem clear how attacks and directions worked together. In Smash Bros, everyone has a tilt attack in all directions, a smash attack in all directions, a special attack in all directions including neutral, and an aerial attack in all directions including neutral. I'm not suggesting each character needs to have that many attacks, but it didn't seem clear to me what combination of direction and attack button corresponded to which attacks. In Brawlhalla, performing a weak attack in the air with a sword hits upwards if you're not holding a direction, instead of hitting in front of you or generally just "around" you as one might think a "neutral" attack would do. Same thing applies to ground attacks. Doing an attack that hits upwards with a spear requires you to hit down and attack simultaneously, which seems counterintuitive.\n\n- Others have mentioned it too, and obviously this will depend quite a bit from person to person, but I'm not a fan of the graphics or even the music, unfortunately. The graphics do look like a Flash game from Newgrounds, as someone mentioned, and as a result characters look more like "dolls" with a bunch of different parts stitched together rather than characters whose movements look natural. The music is ok I suppose, but none of what I heard was anything I would want to listen to outside of the game (or even really in the game), which is a shame.\n\n\n\nAll that said, I understand the intent of the developers may not have been to create a competitively-sound game. But even if the game meets what they've set out to do, for me, it seems they've tried to create a game where things are "easy" (low gravity means getting back to the stage should be easy, many attacks are inherently multi-hit, "combo" attacks) and the fun of the game suffers. It is entirely possible to create a game with good competitive aspects while still making it appeal to a more casual audience. Wavedashing, l-canceling, glide tossing, RAR-ing, etc. in Smash Bros games do not make those games any less able to be enjoyed by casual gamers, and I hope the developers of Brawlhalla rethink some of their design decisions moving forward with the game.","May 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 156 of 265 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","156","265","10","21"

It is very quick and easy to find or create a game . For those interested in more intense play an elo based ranked game mode is provided allowing people to take part in ranked 1v1 or 2v2 games. A large problem with this game is that, being a fast pace brawling game which requires quick reactions and fast movement, you need low latency to be able to do well. If you are someone who has trouble with connection whilst playing online you might not have too much fun playing this game.\n\nLooking at reviews other people have made, most negative comments seem to be aimed at the play style of a lot of players, rather than the game its self. I would agree that playing against these players can be an annoying, however the play style in question that most these people are complaining about can be beaten fairly easily with practice. With lack of this practice I mentioned some people have formed opinions that the game is not very balaced, I am very much in disagreement of this. Any legend can be played at any skill level if the player is good enough, and that is what I would consider good balace.\nOh, and the community is terrible. But then that is no reason to not recommend a free to play game is it.\n\nAnyway, to sum up this review. This game is a lot of fun, free and a very small download.

No, there's no shame in being one of those people, and yes, it'll probably satisfy that itch.\n\nBrawlhalla is a fighting game, although you probably know that already. The combat is fast-paced, the movesets are varied (for most of the game), and it's easy enough to pick up and play. (A friend of mine was able to beat me after only a few matches.)\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic for Brawlhalla as opposed to, say, your favorite Smash game is that everyone starts out with the same, somewhat limited moveset. The focus of the game is weapons - which vary movesets completely and completely change a character's dynamic. Each character has two weapons to keep variety. The weapons feel effectively balaned, although a few characters have somewhat powerful moves. (A good example of that is Cassidy's hammer, down-strong.) The other items are only usable with no weapon, which gives unarmed combat efficient as well.\n\nThe other aspects apart from the fights themselves are bare-bones. There's a training mode where you can use any character (as oppposed to the ones in the weekly rotation), a "tournament" mode, and a shop. The shop carries mostly cosmetic items, with permanent unlocks for the characters also available (which unlocks use outside of the rotation). Only the fighters and some color schemes (unlocked after playing a certain fighter a lot) are available with the regular currency - the others require Mammoth Coins, which translates into real money. A pack of all the characters at once is also avialable - which also contains unrelased fighters.\n\nThe game is still in beta, so there are a few things that aren't finished. However, what is here is superb. I  highly reccommend it for fans of Smash, or imitations thereof. ...Now that I think of it, this game is very Smash-like, but I thoroughy enjoyed it nonetheless.","December 12, 2015","true","38.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Back in the day I used to love versing my friend on Super Smash Bros Melee on their GameCube, and because of those memories, I really love this game. First of all, let's go over the positives. That may seem backwards, but it'll lead up to my major gripe with this game.\n\nPositives:\nReally responsive gameplay on keyboard: I myself play with the Mouse and Keyboard set up. I feel like I'm always hitting what I should and missing what I should, the developers have done an awesome job with this, even though I live in Australia and we need to play on SE Asian matchmaking.\n\nCool characters: I myself love playing a plethora of different characters such as Bodvar, Teros, Asuri, Orion and Lucien, and the lore that the devs put into the little world they've created really sucks me in. I love reading their lore when I'm waiting for friends to launch the game (which launches surprisingly fast), or if I'm just not playing at that moment.\n\nAwesome Lore: I know I touched on the lore when it came to the above positive, but I believed I had more to say about it. I simply love the lore, and the little tidbits they have around the character's main lore show how they relate to other characters and also what they did before arriving in Valhalla.\n\nAnd now, the:\n\nNegatives:\n\nReally, the only negative I can find is the spammability of the characters. Keep in mind, at the time of this review I have only 10 hours, so don't take my opinion like it's law, but that's my major gripe. Whenever I go up against a Hattori in my current 1v1 or even 2v2 ELOs (Both Bronze as of 16/11/2015), she seems to spam her Directional Heavy (Left/Right Rightclick/Rightbumper/K/X) every time I come close, so whenever I'm playing a character like, say, Teros, who's Heavy attacks need to be timed down to the split second, I feel at a disadvantage, and it always seems that way aswell, as whenever I believe I'm close to getting my Player Elo back to Silver, I get dropped down by a button mashing Hattori.\n\nThat's the positives and negatives I've found with this game in my 10 hours of gameplay, they've done a very good job for a F2P game.\n\nAnd the moment you've all been waiting for, the  TL:DR VERSION!\n\nAll in all, the game is pretty polished in a lot of the major areas, but there is also that, in my opinion, too-small gap of player skill. There's skilled players in the low to high elos and Not-So-Skilled spammers in the even higher elos. That being my major and only problem. Either way, I can totally recommend this to fans of Super Smash Bros and other Fighting Action Platformers.","November 15, 2015","true","24.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","3"

It borrows just enough from the Smash Bros series to feel familiar but implements a few larger, new ideas to give the game more depth than its influences. The competitve players should be happy to hear that most of the balances made to the game are based around 1v1 matches with 4 player FFA being a sort of party brawler mode. I can't recommend this game enough, especially if you are the type of person who is looking to get a Smash Bros fix away from a Nintendo console. Be warned though, you might not want to go back.","August 7, 2015","true","72.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","1"

Brawlhalla is one of the latest and greatest in the development of tools to achieve these noble ends.\n\nThe game delivers a 2D Super Smash Brothers-esque experience to the PC, enabling you to beat up people by means not necessarily limited to beating up your keyboard and suicide bombing that would make Osama Bin Laden proud.\n\nBrawlhalla offers a rich array of characters. You can pick from the following eight-fingered legends:\n\n-A sentient suit of armor powered by Iranian weapons-grade Plutonium,\n-Cowman the Unbroken,\n-Super Mohawk Obama,\n-A Norse man with a small sword and big bear balls,\n-Cuauhtémoc’s snake charming love child born from his affair with Queen Isabella,\n-Diesel-powered Mad Max,\n-The infamous Burgundian Baguette Burglar of Bordeaux,\n-Asgard’s mini golfing and pole vaulting champion extraordinaire,\n-A spooky scary skeleton,\n-A demonic mosh pit ninja,\n-The guy who formed the United Kingdom by subjugating Scotland and Ireland with nothing but his beard,\n-The girl who made Britannia rule the waves and the sky with lots of steam,\n-A cyclops alien Crip from Planet Ferguson (contrary to developer propaganda, Roldakk-9 was actually the city of Ferguson, Missouri),\n-A wolf-riding elven Greenpeace activist,\n-The gun-toting, law-enforcing cowgirl who inspired Chuck Norris to become a Texas Ranger,\n-G.N.A.S.H. Genocidal Neolithic Abominable Smashing Homosapien,\n-A heroine from a hi-tech cyberpunk future who is surprisingly adept with a primitive spear,\n-A homeless guy from down the alleyway who acquired a sword and a pirate hat,\n-A davage anthropomorphic tiger who drove the British out of India. Gandhi promptly took all the credit.\nAnd the lastest addition,\n-A teleporting samurai who materializes wooden planks out of thin air.\n\nIn your quest to savagely beat up your friends as well as strangers, you will have a variety of signature moves and weapons at your disposal. These include:\n\n-The Helicopter,\n-The Upside-Down Helicopter,\n-The Black Lives Matter Hammer,\n-A little Birdy,\n-Mini golfing with a Battle Axe,\n-Storm Surge from Hurricane Katrina,\n-A Tractor Beam,\n-Roundhouse Kicks,\n-Old-Fashioned Uppercuts,\n-Jousting,\n-The Dust Bowl,\n-Hiawatha Snake Magics,\n-Slow-Motion Gunplay,\n-Pretending to play a xylophone in midair on someone’s face with a pair of pistols,\n-The Broadside Cannon Barrage,\n-The Incredibly Versatile Human Torpedo,\n-The Baguette Butcher,\n-Using a massive hammer as a pooper scooper,\n-Spiky Balls,\n-and Land Mines.\n\nOverall, after sustained play, your friends will go down in flames and your keyboard will go up in smoke. Therefore, Brawlhalla provides a satisfying experience.\n\nFor the price of free, it is outright foolhardy to skip out on this game."\n\nAGAIN CREDITS GO TO\n\n:: sirgoodnes ::\n\nwell done and i hope everyone gets to playing the best 2d brawler EVER!!!!","February 23","true","89.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","14","15","11","1"

Brawl Simulator 2015. Well, for PC at least.\nThis is one AMAZING game, one AMAZING BETA! It can only get better. It is basically Super Smash Bros. Remixed. I know that everyone will now think this is a crappy knock off title, as everyone did with Terraria, but it really isn't. For a start, it is alot more contested, meaning CPU's CAN win games. Getting a KO is different too. Instead of knocking your opponent off the map, you need to SMASH them until they are out of returning range. Therefore getting kills really feels like an achievement everytime you do it. The score system has been kept simple, and understandable. 3 lives, once all 3 of your lives are gone, you are removed. In this case, simple is better. A wide variety of unique and enthusiastic characters for you to explore, each with different advantages and disadvantages to the game. The display is beautiful, you couldn't ask for much more with respect to the boldness and brightness of the colour schemes. It really makes the game vibrant. Your attacks are different for each character. You get a quick attack and a heavy attack, obviously quick attacks are less powerful than heavy attacks but can be pulled off to get an enemy away from you in desperate times. There are alot of gamemodes too, and enough people to play full length matches. But seriously, this game is only in BETA, and has the credentials of a full released title. It's a beta I'm finally proud to be part of, because as it stands, this game has full potential to expand and make it's way to new platforms. I'd seriosuly recommend getting over to the BrawlHalla website and signing up for this.\nFor a Beta Rating, I give it a 10/10 ALL DAY.\nFor a full game, I'd give it a 9.5/10. That's only because there is currently 1 beta server. However when it's out of Early Access more will be added. So it could easily get a 10 rating from me.","April 9, 2015","true","19.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","4"

Clone.  But that's not a con, and if anything I like that about it.  It has its own style of play added to it and it's enough to differientiate it from Smash.  It's certainly more fast-paced than Smash, and you can have consider more airtime with jumps and dodges.  This brings a new dimension to the game, in my opinion.\n\nThe art style is pretty great, and the attacks are very stylistic.

Even if you haven't played much fighting games before or didn't like other fighting games, give this a try. It's free after all.\n\nScore: 10/10 Highly Recommended\n\n*UPDATE*: Now that the Brawlhalla rankings have been reset the leaderboard have become much more diverse and while smurf accounts still exist they are not much of a problem anymore. The community is getting there and the servers are being improved every patch. Now there's no reason not to try Brawlhalla if you like fighting games!","August 26, 2015","true","231.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

Buying ALL the (mainly cosmetic) things will be costly.

While the underlying concept is identical to that of Smash games, Brawlhalla has its own set of unique mechanics that make the game what it is. It has such a fluid combo system, and at high levels, followig up an attack or landing a combo can be very mechanically demanding, giving Brawlhalla an extremely high skill cap. The game is similar to Smash in that both are so unique in ways that can't be verbally explained. For those wishing to pick up another 2D fighter and play it at a competitive level, I'd absolutely recommend trying Brawlhalla.","May 3","true","332.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemonDragonMaster/recommended/291550/","DemonDragonMaster","DemonDragonMaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemonDragonMaster/","494 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBrawlhalla is a 2D brawler game, emulating the stlye of Super Smash Bros but adds it's own little spin and feel to the genre like, having a weapon system that modifies your characters attacks. Each character being able to wield one of two weapons that randomly drop in the map, but at the cost of not being able to grab anything else like mines, spiked balls and other items. The characters have their own stats and are pretty much the same moveset wise, unless when they have their weapons equipped then the get a unique neutral smash attack.\n\nNow in beta, with added characters and music tracks, the game itself is more enjoyable. Smoother animations, more weapons, diversity in the cast, the weapons and the soundtrack and now a "market" ala LoL (League of Legends) with minor things, like skins and taunts, but not essencial. With no hint of Pay2Win in the horizon the future is a bright one for Brawlhalla.\n\nThough not everything is positive, the Arcade mode is basically tournament mode but with bots and no difficulty choice, the online mode is a bit scarce ( I have yet to fight online, no idea if it's due to my timezone or if nobody plays the online ), and making everyone have the same moveset, except when they have weapons which ONLY grants them one move that distinguishes them from the rest, is a bit lack luster but does make skill a much bigger factor in winning a match and not if a character is top tier or not.\n\nIn conclusion, Brawlhalla is a very good F2P 2D Brawler that has the potencial to become a great game, it's colourful cast and maps are great and wonderfull soundtrack make it pop out in the mixt of brawlers who want to be like Smash Bros and add nothing new to the genre. I'd recommend anyone who likes 2D Brawlers to give this game a whirl, by buying the founders pack, and keep their eyes open for the updates that the dev team is pushing out.\n\n*For the Devs*\nKeep it up guys!

I recommend that you check out the controls because it doesnt have a introduction but again its not a issue because the controls are pretty basic one button = one command.\n\nWhen it comes to the connectivity it usually depends on the persons internet capabillity and speed because while i didnt have any lag issues i have noticed that my opponent just stands there and suddenly react.

I went into Brawlhalla loving the art style but doubting I'd get much enjoyment out of it, since I'm terrible at fighting games, and it seems to be most compared to Super Smash Bros., whichI've never really gotten into.  WRONG. The four hours I have played? Those are pretty much all in a row, I can't put this game down.\n\nGameplay is hectic, action-packed, and exciting- but not so fast that you completely lose track of what's going on in the madness. It's still paced so that you can use some strategy and anticipation to line up some awesome kills.\n\nThe game, when launched, will be completely free. The only thing that is in the cash shop is 100% cosmetic items with no impact on your strength in-game. Character skins, taunt animations, etc. The developers are incredibly friendly, intelligent, and receptive. Probably the most communicative devs I've ever had the pleasure of testing for (and I've done a *lot* of betas).\n\nI can't recommend this game enough- buy a founders pack to get in immediately or head to their website to sign up to possibly be selected for a closed beta key. I don't think you'll regret it.\n\nHere's some gameplay of a great come-from-behind-and-win-in-sudden-death victory, ignore the text in the middle of the screen- just so you get an idea of the gameplay.

You select legends to fight, each with a different pair of weapons (these being Spear, Sword, Gun and Axe) and stances (which determine a legend's Strength/Dexterity/Defence/Speed) and which can be unlocked as you level them up in-game. The game also features a ranked mode (1v1 and 2v2) with an Elo rating and the game is free-to-play with no pay-to-win mechanics. The Gold you gain in battle and by leveling, you can use in buying legends (since legends are free in weekly rotations). While there is a very rare chance of lag occuring (which the developers acknowledge), the game has a lot of fun moments. The game has no chat or microphone system, except in the end of the game for the "gg" messages, and why would you want something like that?. The developers update the game often and I am happy of how it looks like.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun, (un)competitive game to play solo or with friends or looking to waste some time, without a doubt, get this.","December 20, 2015","true","49.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Don't expect worldwide servers for everyone, although accessibility for many non-American brawlers may be a bit wonky, time will prove to come into your favor.\n\nTo support bullet two, the mechanics are also updated regularly, which leads to unfavorable reactions. What do you expect? As stated the game is not complete, it's early access.\n\nNow here's why I recommend this game:\n\n1. Great fun\n\nEach day I've played this game and each day I've enjoyed it. It's a fun brawler you can play for an hour each day and never get tired of because you never know what will happen. I can be fighting one guy and be destroyed to bits by a bomb or fight a newbie and absolute wreck him. It's all unexpected, fustrating sure, but fun! A game that's made me laugh and shout many times!\n\n2. Competitive\n\nAs stated it's fun to fight different players in the ranked matches or better yet fight friends in your own lobbies. This game provides a competitive environment similar to Super Smash Bros. I've literally wanted to destroy my computer right infront of me from mind boggling events that's occured to me.\n\n3. First of its kind\n\nThere's not many brawlers in the market on PC and that's understandable. The idea of a brawler on a PC sounds silly as a brawler is usually more targetted to consoles with couch gameplay. Brawlhalla decided to take this oppurtunity to create a game not seen much around the internet and thus it's a fresh, new game to play if you haven't gotten into brawlers in the past.\n\n10/10 recommend, will continue to blow my foes away with bombs!\n\n\n\n","June 23, 2015","true","133.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","11"

So far, I love this game (and its still just beta). The game is not EXACTLY like Smash Bros, but probably most similar you will find on here.

However, while Brawhalla may look like Smash brothers and has some of the same mechanics, it's just different enough to not be a clone in my book;for better or for worse.\n\nBrawlhalla is a 4 player online/local multi-player indie game that is basically smash brothers boiled down to it's most basic components(beta is beta). Do damage to others to get them in the yellow or red, then kock them off the stage for a point. One with the most points at the end wins.\n\nFrom a graphical and design standpoint, the game is very good looking. The fighters in game gush personality everywhere, they are all very colorful and well animated. There's something for everybody, anything from a one eyed alien to a cyberpunk gunner. If I have one issue with the graphics is that the stages are a little sparse on the activity. Maybe a few birds here and there, a unicorn in the backround, Thor backhanding Loki; soemthing to add a little more flavor to the stages.\n\nNext up is sound; it's pretty good and sets the mood for every battle fairly well. Sound effect could use a little bit more fine tuning as punches and kicks sound like I'm hitting a bag of rice sometimes or full plate wearing characters do not make an audible clang when I slam them into the ground, little things like that.\n\nNext up, controls and options (and netcode, I'll get to that in a moment). The options menu, needs work. A couple of sound sliders and a fullscreen on/off is not a good menu to work with. The game defualts to your desktop resolution, but switching it to windowed soemtiems makes the entire game vanish to a  small window in the bottom corner (Mostly on widescreen setups). Controls are fine for the most part, though I have two minor issues with them; no gamepad rebindable buttons or an attack cancel; the latter of which can cripple a heavy character.\n\nAs for the gameplay; I feel there are a few issues that need ironed out. Firstly the game seems to have 3 weight classes; though only 2 seemed to be implemented correctly. An example is in order. All the fast characters in game have low defense and all the high defense characters are really slow moving. Those 2 modles are almostr balanced correctly; the slower oens are harder to knock off the stage and the faster ones are harder to hit (though I say the slower oens need to be harder to knock off by a small bit).\n\nThen you have the middle stat range characters like the viking or armoed knight. Bother seem to fall into soem kinda medium catagory but both function as if they are heavy. On the flip side you have couple other 'mediums' that act more like light characters. It's as if they passes some kind of arbitary stat line that turns them from one class to another. This is kind of a minor issue , but could be irone dout a bit.\n\nI also found a few minor balance issues, mainly the rocket/steam powered giant lance. Not only can you use it as a 4th jump, but the hit arc on the front side is massive and the recovery time after such an attack is a bit too small. It's not too much a bane for the lighter fighters, but is absolutely lethal for the heavier combatants.\n\nI would also liek to see a bit more variation in each character, maybe a bit more personality behind some special atatcks they have at a later date. Although this is a personal preference as mechanically the combat is(mostly) sound and such a thing could ruin that balance.\n\nLastly I find the jumping to be a little on the predictable side; meaning edge camping could be a potential issues in the future.\n\nHowever, even with the minor issues the game has (Such as folks having connection issues in places like North Dakota...sucks to be you guy) It's stil a blast to play. With so few good brawling games on pc, let alone one with local AND online multiplayer I can't not recommend this game. Most of what is does is mechanically sound and it's still in beta, meaning it can only get better.\n\nOne more thing, the game is friggin free. Yeah, you heard me FREE. You can sign up for beta on the games forum for a steam key and most likely get one. If you like the game, theres cosmetic stuff you can buy or just buy a founders pack for 10$ or so and get a bunch of stuff at discount.\n\nI whole heartedly recommend youze mugs at least try the game. Worst case the only thing you wasted was time.\n\nVideo review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04EFR1GzJhQ","March 9, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Because it's Smash Bros.\n\nHonestly, nothing really "pops" about this game. The 2D asthetics means things get lost in the cluster. But the biggest problem is probably the lack of animation frames.\n\nI know it's hand drawn, but everything feels jerky. There's so much jerkiness with every hitbox because there's so few frames of animation. In Smash Brothers, there are techniques that stand out because they abuse the way the game normally flows. Making a character spin around without any animation and glide forward stands out and makes the crowd cheer. In Brawlhalla, that's basically the norm for any form of movement.\n\nMost hand-drawn games look beautiful, so this is a big stumbling block right out of the gate. If this game has any competitive techniques, I am sure they all relate to abusing the weird momentum and lack of frames on so many attacks. That's just going to create a huge skill parity between all players and won't be casual at all.\n\nI'm recommending it just because it's fun with friends. I'm sure the online will be an unfun, uber-glitchy hell.\n","November 14, 2014","true","0.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

(Lucien FTW). Once you do that I reccomend going staright into an online FFA just so you can understand the look and feel of your main. I don't reccomend playing ranked until you know all the moves of your main by heart.\nOnce you do start playing ranked however, get ready to lose because its going to happen.....a lot.

Ever since the first iteration of Super Smash Brothers on Nintendo 64, I've been hoping and waiting for a PC version with online support. Now my personal Brawlhalla is finally here and it looks smashing already. Since this game is in early access right now, access is limited but I had no trouble getting in within a few hours of signing up. If you're interested in this game, definitely go and sign up for the closed beta right now.\n\nGameplay:\nIt is time to Brawl on PC! Since everyone and their dog has probably already played a version of Smash Brothers, you'll find this game easy to pick up and play right away, Hit an enemy enough times so that your next stronger move sends them flying off the arena, taunt with a nice pose, repeat. The familiar mechanics are all there in a very similar way. Light attacks, smash attacks, a distinct move set for every weapon and an unarmed moveset for when you have none. While in the air you also have access to a triple juimp (because double jump was apparently too mainstream). The dodge move is much more powerful than in this game's ancestor: You can dodge in EVERY direction, even up, down or diagonally. In the air as well. OP much? Not at all, since everyone can use it.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are okay. Not great, but far from bad. Some animations could use some more fluidity and the artstyle isn't really distinct enough to be memorable, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy what there is already. The health bar isn't really informative yet, unlike the % number in Smash Brothers you'll only get a colored indicator that lets you know about how far you'll knock back the enemy.\n\nSound:\nWhile the sound design is nothing to write home about - it really isn't memorable and lacks impact - the music is FANTASTIC. You'll get the soundtrack stuck in your head even after the first match and find yourself humming along as early as the second. Here's hoping the sounds will get a bit crunchier as development progresses.\n\nFree to Play aspects:\nFrom what is there so far, it looks like cash shop purchases are cosmetic only. If this stays this way, I will gladly drop a few dollars here and there just to get the saltiest taunts and sexiest skins. As of right now there doesn't seem to be a way to earn currency by playing.\n\nEarly Access Notes;\nFor an early access release, this game is remarkably solid already. There's a nice variety in characters, average variety in weapons and a few usable items already. Stages are alright so far, those that exist are pretty distinct from each other. Netcode is okay, though the servers lump everyone together at the moment, as it seems, so expect some teleporting enemies every now and then.\n\nFor now, I can thoroughly recommend this game to everyone who likes Smash Brothers or fighting games in general. It is that good. Not just a clone or cash-in on the "I want Smash for PC!" audience but an actual possible contender-in-the-making for the genre throne. We'll see how this changes as development progresses, I'll keep updating this review as patches come in.","February 20, 2015","true","210.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thugles/recommended/291550/","Thugles","Thugles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thugles/","92 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is still on release, but it's... awesome now, if you know what I mean.\n\nYou pick one Legend and go fight on an 2D arena. Each Legend has two of the six total weapons available, and each Legend has a unique special move with each of that two weapons. Then you brawl till the time ends or that's only one stantiding. You can use your weapons, throw them to cause damage and "delay" the opponent, you can dodge, and there are the items that spaws in the map: bombs, sticky mines, a thornball, and even a nord berrante that summon a running valkyrie.\n\nIt may be a little hard to "get the way" of this game, however it only takes a few matches for you to understand the basic mechanics.\n\nIt's super fun to play with friends(4 players maximum), and others can spectate in real-time while you play. If none of your friends are online, you can play single player in quick matches or Tournament, a competition of 3 rounds featuring you against 3 bots each time. There is a "MISSIONS" button that is unavailable, so I'm sure we'll have more single player options in th future. For now, one flaw is that the bots get very easy when you get the grasp of the game(although they're not "super dumb", they're just easier than a average player)\n\nYou can buy skins for your characters(with real money), and each skin comes with unique skins for its weapons. You can also buy skins for the weapons itself and taunts, and this is the only time you'll spend money in the game after you get it. No pay to win, no "oh I'm a millionaire so i'll be super stronga" sh!ts.\n\nIt also pops up super rapido when you start it on Steam; no introducing loading screen, no developer logo, just WELCOME! TO BRAWLHALLA!\n\nSo here's my general opinions:\n\n-Very fun;\n-You have 13 Legends that you can choose. Although there is only 6 weapons(and each Legend has 2), each Legend has somewhat unique abilities, varying from: left mouse buttom, right mouse buttom, right mouse button + directional, right mouse button in the air + up directional...\n-You can play with your friends (up to 4, free for all or teams) and even ranked matches. The online is still buggy sometimes, but just SOMETIMES;\n-It can be really "addictive" when you learn how to play, because you have many characters and we'll propably going to have more;\n-Once you got the game, the only thing you pay for is character/weapon skins and taunts, it's not pay to win - real money do not give gaming advantages;\n-Music is very nice - speaking for myself, I like the soundtrack a lot;\n-Some bugs here and there that may come up occasionally, but you'll find them very rarely;","March 5, 2015","true","39.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

In Brawlhalla you have a set of 2 weapons for each character, you can pick up these weapon holograms(thats what I think they are) around the map and they give you one of your 2 weapons. You can throw these weapons for many reason, damage your opponent(not much), prevent them from recovering, ect.\n\nAs of now there are 3 modes, online, custom match, ranked 1v1.\n\nOnline - You go into a FFA with 4 people, the one that gets the most points win\n\nCustom Match - In this mode you can do almost anything in the other modes with more. You can have bots, you can also do FFA, BrawlBall, BombsketBall, and Stock Mode. This mode is usually where you just invite friends and play with each other.\n\nRanked  1v1- Where most of the action takes place, you do 1v1s, of course, and you get ranked on how many games you win and there are 5 divisions. Tin, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. You can get into the top 100 hundread and it will show you're on the top 100 in-game.\n\nThat's the base of the game but there so much more like characters and their signatures, maps, stratgies, ect.\n\nI recommend this game, just remember, don't get salty :)","June 25, 2015","true","049.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The "Welcome to Brawlhalla!" intro engraved its way into my psyche. Soon after it came out, I was lucky enough to get the game for free as a beta tester, andI couldn't be more excited. I recited the intro and immediately went into 1v1 ranked matches, ready to enjoy the game.\n\nREAL REVIEW BEGINS HERE:\n\nThis is a Super Smash Bros. esc. game with tight controls and an EXTREMELY competitive environment. As recent as the release date of this game was, players have already began to practice their favorite legend and invent new metas to keep up with the rest of the community (which is entirely necessary due to the influx of new players.) Some people may argue that the legends (characters) are too similar. While this may be a valid point, all legends have very different play styles. Special attacks are diverse even when performed by two different legends wielding the same weapon.\n\nOnce you've learned all of the basic tactics and general gameplay, you have to get yourself used to an entirely new segmant of the game that isn't as prominant in other Super Smash Bros. exc. games, aerial combat. While legends cannot fly, they get three jumps, and a special attack on top of that. That, coupled with the ability to dodge midair, gives way to a large, aerial segmant of gameplay that makes Brawlhalla much dynamic.\n\nI've begun to ramble so I'll wrap this up. In summary, Brawlhalla is a game that should be bought and enjoyed, regardless of it being on sale or not.

In Brawlhalla you have a set of 2 weapons for each character, you can pick up these weapon holograms(thats what I think they are) around the map and they give you one of your 2 weapons. You can throw these weapons for many reason, damage your opponent(not much), prevent them from recovering, ect.\n\nAs of now there are 3 modes, online, custom match, ranked 1v1.\n\nOnline - You go into a FFA with 4 people, the one that gets the most points win\n\nCustom Match - In this mode you can do almost anything in the other modes with more. You can have bots, you can also do FFA, BrawlBall, BombsketBall, and Stock Mode. This mode is usually where you just invite friends and play with each other.\n\nRanked  1v1- Where most of the action takes place, you do 1v1s, of course, and you get ranked on how many games you win and there are 5 divisions. Tin, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. You can get into the top 100 hundread and it will show you're on the top 100 in-game.\n\nThat's the base of the game but there so much more like characters and their signatures, maps, stratgies, ect.\n\nI recommend this game, just remember, don't get salty :)","June 25, 2015","true","049.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

My "Nope" comment just came out of frustration and a lack of time to acutally create a legitimate review.\n\nBrawlhalla is a very fun game. A very laid back action game that you can have a great time with while playing with your friends. I was given somewhere near 50 or so beta codes to give out, I gave all of them away before open beta. I made sure all of my friends and even my enemies had them (but I told the latter to go to ranked). It really is a great party game that has online and local play. Awesome.\n\nNow let's get down to competitve play.There are some key weapons that need to be touched on before I can consider this a true fighting game. Speaking of true, welcome to the basis of competitive play in this game. True combos. Every weapon in this game has some sort of true combo a.k.a a combo that is guaranteed or inescapable. While that in itself is fine, the simplicity of getting these combos makes the game incredibly easy and it makes spam less punishable.\n\nSpeaking of punishes, holy lord the dodging in this game. Ever since they changed the way that dodges work in this game, hitting attacks seems almost inconsistent. I'm not sure if I am personally not able to adapt or if some weird frame stuff is happening.\n\nTwo weapons in this game stand above all others. The rocket lance and the katars.\nThe rocket lance has great option coverage, great movement, true combos, you name it. This weapon is just beyond all others and in the hands of a good player, it is practically unbeatable.\nThe katars on the other hand are a very, for lack of a better term, "noob" weapon. It has very basic combos and strong aerial game. This weapon is not broken, but it is strong.\nEvery other weapon in the game is pretty balanced, all with there own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nOnce these things are fixed, I think the game will be very well rounded. I do not think this game will approach the levels of other fighting games, but it can at least be balanced.\n\nWhile this is not necessarily justification for people taking my word on the subject, I am a top 100 ranked 2v2 player and a top 300 ranked 1v1 player. Maybe not the best of the best, but I hope it helps you to understand my experience with this game. I really don't want to make it seem like I am the most well informed on this game, because I am not, but at the very least I am experienced.\n\nThanks for the free game Blue Mammoth!\n\n\n[Edit] After playing this new patch, the game feels clunky. The controls tend to not respond as quickly as they did before. Also fast falling is an unnecessary addition to the game that I think makes this game's intense floating even more annoying. Also the absolute BIGGEST problem with the game is that they will not add online Brawlball. They have other game modes that are fun and relaxed that see no light to online play. Not even necessarily a ranked Brawlball, just a casual queue and that would make this game 100x better.\n\n[2nd Edit] It seems like there is a pattern to these patches, because after playing the Diana patch the game feels incredibly more clunky. It seems like after dodging, there is an extended recovery time before you can use any move. I'm not sure if it's intentional or even my imagination, but this is a big problem when in all levels of play dodging is an essential part of the game. Still no Brawlball queue, the closest thing we have for that are public lobbies. The rollback within the game has become a VERY large problem and I don't see myself playing this game as often unless that is fixed. With 200+ hours in the game and being a platinum level player before the reset, this game seems to have a horrible amount of spam and other cheesy ways of play every patch. Really becoming more of a chore to play this game than actually enjoying it.\n\n[3rd Edit] The combat in this game has become a sequence of attacking then dodging. Rinse repeat. Hitboxes and hurtboxes still are bothersome because of how they move and the shape of them. Cannot recommend this game at anything other than a very casual level.","November 15, 2015","true","265.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","6"

Casual play is nice, but nothing special.\nCompetitive play is different. If you play this game as often as someone like me or possibly more, then you will realize just how bad this game is. Usually you end up facing the same legends over and over again, creating a lack of variety. Also, the light and aerial attacks is shared between weapons, so if characters have the same weapons, they only have three different moves. This creates a lack of distinction between characters and repetitive gameplay. There is almost no variety between characters, as even most heavy attacks are just copy/pasted from other legends. This is my personal opinion although some may not agree: the weapon throwing mechanic is terrible. As you climb the rankings into gold and platinum, you will see more and more people only throwing weapons at you in order to start combos or stun you for a heavy attack. It ends up just being not fun to gift these people, making the game more boring, as you can never seem to get close to these people. Sure, a well times air dodge could work, but the weapon spawn rate is so fast that they can immediately take a weapon and punish the dodge. It does seem creative and sets brawlhalla apart from other fighting games, but ultimately adds to the redundancy of the fighting.\nBrawlhalla is a casual game and should not be played for a long time. If you play a lot and climb high, then you will see how bland and boring the game becomes. Now I only play this game as a way to pass the time, like old people play solitaire. That is how boring the game has become for me.\nAnother huge problem is the community. Higher ranked people are nice and will actually try to help you, but in ranks like gold and silver, almost everyone is a jerk. When you lose, they'll brag and spam a phrase to make fun of you, even if they only beat you by a little. If you win, they'll call you out for spamming or just complain and say you got lucky. It makes for an overall toxic community with players staring out. Brawlhalla is a free game though, so perhaps I should not harshly criticize it. It can be fun for a few hours at most, but the core concepts of the game make for bland, repetitive and clunky gameplay, and the community will just make you mad.","May 12","false","169.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

The learning curve is gentle, which is nice... we all can enjoy a casual game every now and then. The game seems more heavily focused on the items rather than creating a specific moveset for every character. Of course, a game this early in development can and will change dramatically. But I do enjoy setting up mines and then using a hammer to knock an enemy straight into one. Also, the bots are pushovers. Online play, while a bit laggy, is surprisingly very entertaining. I'd like a post-game chat feature, though. Anyways, keep up the good work, Blue Mammoth Games! This game has incredible potential and I have a feeling that the developers will create something amazing out of it.","May 3, 2014","true","2.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

You can play a character, perhaps lose, and think "I need to get better." Switch character. Let's use Teros as just one example, though there are more (Hattori is another). You play another game using Teros, undoubtedly win, and think "Wow, I'm great at this game!"  You are utterly mistaken. Sure, you may have actually been better than the opponent. It's obviously possible. But what is more likely is that you have just experienced the complete and utter failure of what's called game balancing. Here is a link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(game_design)\n\nThis is experienced when you absolutely play better than your opponent, no doubt about it, but *still* somehow lose. Even the other player knows that you played better. Everybody knows. But you still lost.\n\nI've seen a dev say that all characters have around 50% win/lose rates. These numbers are completely irrelevant and do not have any impact on actual playing, as you will find out when you play.\n\nPlayers who play certain characters may have to try harder than their opponent, not because their opponent is better, but simply because their opponent is using a character that is extremely easy to play\n\n2v2s are obviously the most fun, such is playing with friends, though there is one INDESCRIBABLY enraging tactic that players often use: the two opponents stand about 10-15 centimeters (give or take, depending on your screen size) horizontally away from each other, and use the neutral light sig to infuriatingly bat you between themselves with absolutely NO effort expenditure, completely draining you of life in LITERALLY under 3 seconds. That is NOT an exaggeration. This is most commonly done with swords and spears. It is an UTTERLY DESPICABLE tactic that should absolutely be made harder to execute, or better yet, completely removed. Unfortunately the devs are more focused on pumping out skins and characters rather than fixing issues, though this is unsurprising.\n\nThis being said, however, I still recommend this game. Not too infrequently there are games that are enjoyable. When I do enjoy playing, the pleasure and gratification of this game comes at the cost of disregarding the annoyingly prominent fact that a large portion of it is unbalanced.","May 27","true","195.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","8","12","4","0"

Spiking is basically a competitive term for hitting a player and making them forcefully fall to the ground. The Training Mode is awesome and having bots have names is a really smart and creative move. Example, say a fighter's name was "SHMEBULOCK". If it was a bot it would be "SHMEBUBOT". That was really creative. Also there is a Smash Brothers like mode where you can brawl with 4 people at a time. Awesome right? Another really cool addition to this game is the weapons.

I've been playing quite a lot of it since then and it's only grown on me more and more. On first impression the look and feel of the game is strange but once you get a bit of dirt under your nails it sticks with you. What looks like copy paste character design is balanced hit/hurtboxes so that nobody has an advantage due to size. What seems like a smash clone actually plays very much like its own game with its own rules. This is a deceptive title and I love it.\n\nThe devs for this game are also EXTREMELY lovely people, they constantly update it (about once a week) with balance changes, and patches. Alongside this, for a free to play game with a character unlocking mechanic via in game currency, it doesn't feel like it'll take a year to unlock a character, it'll take maybe a few hours, and you can get several unlocked within a week without spending a cent of actual money.\n\nThis is the best f2p experience I've had in ages, and one of the most stable experiences overall I've gotten to enjoy.

On one hand I don't experience any lag and I enjoy the game, on the other I get tons of lag and feel like punching my screen. Bad doesn't even begin to describe how poor the gameplay gets when there is lag, sometimes on your screen you may hit persons with items but then 2 seconds later that's not what happened according to the server and other times you may be standing still and you suddenly fall off the map and there are even times where everyone starts running off the map and dying on your screen. Some minor gripes I also have are how much users with swords and katars can spam attacks and the size of spears' hitboxes being to large.\nDon't be discouraged by these minor issues though the game is really fun and has a good community\n\nTL;DR - Game is fun when there isn't lag, virtually unplayable with it. Some stuff should get nerfed.\n\nPS. - When you see all legends as free you only get one of them and not all like I wrongly assumed when I started playing","September 21, 2015","true","164.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

You have timed mode, and stock mode. (we dont talk about bombsketball and brawlball)\nIt's a fine game, quick download, and the one feature that makes me reccomend this game, is you can join your friend's private match using the friends menu in the main menu, and *DRUM ROLL PLEASE*\nUP TO 8 , yes 8 PLAYER PRIVATE MATCHES! (The lag is barely noticeable.)\nThe only thing I could request about this game is a level builder, but I don't expect there to be one any time soon. As for preexisting maps, they are all beautifully textured and have great background music.\nAll in all, there really is no reason to try out this game.

The choice between weapons, and the more balanced items compared to the Smash Bros. games adds a new layer of adaptability to gameplay, and, even if free-for-all may be imbalanced by the items, 1v1 gameplay is a very technical, skill-based and well-balanced affair, which is very enjoyable to delve into and master.\nOf course, if there's one gripe I have, it's that mysteriously, I find myself the victim of crippling lag which doesn't occur in other games, for some reason, at seemingly arbitrary times.\nRegardless, many people won't experience this lag, and Brawlhalla has a lot of competitive, technical, and most importantly FUN gameplay to offer to those who are willing to just try.\nI'm a little bit sad that I lost my ranked streak to lag, but the game is fun, and it's in early access, and I'm glad to support it.","December 18, 2015","true","36.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EFungster/recommended/291550/","EFungster","Ryu (Orig. Acc)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EFungster/","54 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWell, let's talk about Brawlhalla for a sec, shall we?\n\nAt first glance it would seem as though it's a PC game going for the style of Smash Bros. On the 10th or so glance, it seems as though it's a PC game going for the style of Smash Bros. But with a few twists that keep it mostly seperate.\n\nFirst of all is the weapon system. I personally LOVE this mechanic. You start off with your weak melee attacks until you pick up a weapon, displayed on-screen as a generic sprite. When that happens, you get a non-generic weapon. Each character has a combination of two weapons that they can recieve. There's guns, spears, hammers, 1 sword, 2 swords, and a rocket lance. That's right, a rocket lance. Though each weapon is not exclusive to their characters, each character has 2 exclusive moves (1 per weapon) that they can use. Each weapon is VERY nicely balanced, and I'll talk more about that later.\n\nThere are also items you can pick up, though variety is sparce. There are spiky balls called Mace-Balls, which you throw at enemies. There are land mines, which you can either throw at your opponent(s) or at the walls and floors. Finally, there are plain ol' bombs that will make you stare in disbelief as you fly off into your doom after some ♥♥♥♥ throws one at you.\n\nOnline play. I'm a little... eh about the quality of the online play at the moment. On one hand, it's incredible to wreck people online and tell them "gg" before having all of them ragequit, (Seriously, check out my Brawlhalla screenshots, I have that one in there somewhere) there is a lot of lag sometimes. On one hand, some matches can be as smooth as offline play, on the other hand some can involve unforseen game mehanics such as teleportation and death by "I swear that guy was on the other side of the map .01 seconds ago".

While the game does have multiple similar mechanics to the Smash Bros. games, there are a good deal of differences. Brawlhalla is 2D, it has a much smaller character roster, who's character are unlockable and rotation. There are a variety of modes including local game modes and ranked game modes! Good news if you are already excited to play. The game itself is going to be free to play when it releases and is going into open beta soon!\n\nBrawlhalla has a few things I dont like about it as well, im not just here to talk up the game I want to tell you about some of the cons the I have found in the game. At this moment the fighters dont feel very unique, they all have a similar profile and with the exception of a small handful of fighters the majority feel very similar. There also is not a very large selection of items at the moment, two types of explosives and a few weapons from what I have seen (the weapon pickup is determined by what character you use, different characters get different weapons from the pickup), side note there is also a spike ball that can be thrown.   Content wise I feel like Brawlhalla does not have much yet.\n\nThe game has a few more noticeable cons for me, I feel like the servers are not stable enough yet for competitive play, ill often see people complain of lag after fights, or even see people lag out of the map and suicide! Even with all these early game shenanigans I still see the potential in Brawlhalla, and I definitely recommend it to smash fans or anyone looking to try it out. There might not be enough content in the game for you yet, so you can get bored pretty fast, but im interested in seeing where this game goes!","November 1, 2015","true","22.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Acc)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EFungster/","54 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWell, let's talk about Brawlhalla for a sec, shall we?\n\nAt first glance it would seem as though it's a PC game going for the style of Smash Bros. On the 10th or so glance, it seems as though it's a PC game going for the style of Smash Bros. But with a few twists that keep it mostly seperate.\n\nFirst of all is the weapon system. I personally LOVE this mechanic. You start off with your weak melee attacks until you pick up a weapon, displayed on-screen as a generic sprite. When that happens, you get a non-generic weapon. Each character has a combination of two weapons that they can recieve. There's guns, spears, hammers, 1 sword, 2 swords, and a rocket lance. That's right, a rocket lance. Though each weapon is not exclusive to their characters, each character has 2 exclusive moves (1 per weapon) that they can use. Each weapon is VERY nicely balanced, and I'll talk more about that later.\n\nThere are also items you can pick up, though variety is sparce. There are spiky balls called Mace-Balls, which you throw at enemies. There are land mines, which you can either throw at your opponent(s) or at the walls and floors. Finally, there are plain ol' bombs that will make you stare in disbelief as you fly off into your doom after some ♥♥♥♥ throws one at you.\n\nOnline play. I'm a little... eh about the quality of the online play at the moment. On one hand, it's incredible to wreck people online and tell them "gg" before having all of them ragequit, (Seriously, check out my Brawlhalla screenshots, I have that one in there somewhere) there is a lot of lag sometimes. On one hand, some matches can be as smooth as offline play, on the other hand some can involve unforseen game mehanics such as teleportation and death by "I swear that guy was on the other side of the map .01 seconds ago". Despite this, the developers have stated repeatedly they are constantly working on improving online play. They have had multiple lag fix patches already and more are to come. So, that'll make the game even better.\n\nOffline play is so fun. There's a tournament mode where you play against CPUs to be the ultimate champion. The CPUs are pretty easy themselves, but the challenge lies in not getting killed while gathering many kills to get a high score. There is a star rating out of 5 you get at the end, with 5 being pretty difficult to acheive (SPOILER: There's a practically impossible rating to get that's above 5 stars... No more hints as to what it is) Also, there's local play where you can play with up to four people using controllers, and one person can use the keyboard or keyboard-mouse. No LAN unfortunately. The last thing is training mode. I won't go too much into detail with this, but imagine Smash Bros' training mode + damage per hit shown, visible hitboxes, and hitstun visibility.\n\nThe balance. Outstanding. Though this could also be a statement as to the lack of variety, you could almost press random in a tournament match and come out the victor with anyone you got. Of course, it's not perfect. But unlike some other games, which have tier lists from SS all the way down to F or even G, Brawlhalla's tier list is more like an SS to A.\n\nWait, did I say "tournament match"?

But unlike some other games, which have tier lists from SS all the way down to F or even G, Brawlhalla's tier list is more like an SS to A.\n\nWait, did I say "tournament match"? Yes, Brawlhalla has a competitive community that even now, in closed beta, is over 100 strong. This is when the game isn't publicly available, and there's over 100 people participating in competitive play. Think about that for a moment. As I write this even, I am procrastinating much needed sleep for a Brawlhalla tournament tommorow.\n\nPROS:\n-Great brawler in the style of Smash Bros\n-Good offline mode\n-Has an online mode\n-Near impeccable balance\n-Growing competitive community\n\nCONS:\n-Online mode can be VERY laggy at times\n-I can't beat Raidhyn\n-No LAN play\n-I can't come close to beating Raidhyn\n-A little empty (Probably just a closed beta problem)\n-I have to fight Raidhyn in a tournament tommorow\n-Many characters are kind of similar\n\nNot sure if PRO or CON:\n-Very limited variety on items\n-Similar enough to Smash Bros to almost be called a ripoff. Not quite though.\n-Raidhyn is a very very good competitive player. Think Ken (the Smash Bros Marth player) in his prime. (I may or may not be biased because I can't beat him.)\n\nOVERALL VERDICT:\n9.5/10 game, for being in beta.\nIf this was the finished product, I'd give it an 8 or 8.5/10.\nVery much reccomend this, as it's free to play. I've gotten REALLY into it.\n\nTLDR: Brawlhalla is a great game and it's free. You like brawlers you'll love Brawlhalla. Play it.","February 12, 2015","true","36.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I was pretty psyched about this game when I first heard about it, as I was looking for a "smash bros" type of game for PC. It ended up not being so similar, but awesome in it's own style. I hopped into ranked almost immediately and had a blast having intense battles with other players. I aspired to climb the ladder with the goal being platinum, so I checked out some tutorial videos on youtube and learned some combos.\n\nThe creators keep pumping out new content every month and keep improving the game every way they can. The dev's are really active within the community, always asking for players opinions on things so that they can provide what the people want. They have also just announced a $50,000 + world championship in Atlanta in the fall, which is amazing!\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, can be very competitive, and just keeps getting better. 10/10","March 3","true","147.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It makes me flipping furious. It makes me want to tear my eyes out of their sockets and (providing the house is empty) scream the most vile curse I can dig up from the depths of my mind at the top of my voice. But every time I lose that close game, every time they read my heavy attack with a perfect dodge or a well spaced counter, I know that there is for sure a skill gap between me and that other player.\n\nIt's tangible.\n\nBeing able to see another player who you are THAT close to beating makes you want to improve because you can just go into the replays, watch what they do, compare it to what you do, and if you are REALLY lucky, get them to train with you (yes of course post-game chats make way for cancer but they also make space for amazing opportunities to improve).\n\nI have only 44 hours, but already thanks to the good part of the community found a way to create a mindset of constant improvement. That's when I see people with hundreds of hours of practice, and feel every single hour of play time that they've had, all the matchups that I haven't even begun to consider, and how they mercilessy slaughter you with hours of additional skill.

Early Access.\n\nGameplay\nThere are so far 13 characters ('Legends') to choose from, and various skins to acquire. Each character has different damage, attack speed, defense and run speeds. As such characters do feel different -- some are tanky, some are pure glass cannons. At the moment all characters are available to play, this will soon switch to a free rotation with permanent unlocks.\n\nOn top of individual stats each can equip 2 types weapons (swords, spears, hammers, pistols). Although the weapons are largely the same no matter who wields them (except the looks) each character has a unique special move per weapon type. Then there are mines, bombs, spiky balls to spice up the match.\n\nIn terms of movement you can chain up to 3 jumps, dodge, and wall-jump. Nothing fancy, but the 3 jumps do a lot to ensure you stay on the arena. Look at the screenies -- the arenas are tiny, a few small platforms or a single larger one, few walls to bounce back off. And in a typical smash bros fashion with each damage stage you're sent flying with greater speeds.\n\nSo far I had problems connecting to online matches though, couldn't even look for a game because I "lost connection to server" every time I tried. I don't know if it's just general server issues or what.\n\nMonetisation\nAkin to mobas of the day Brawlhalla monetises skins (character, weapon), taunts, and unlocking characters (with a free rotation). The currency is Mammoth Coints, which currently come at about $1 per 20.\n\nCharacter skins cost $4.5, $7, or $10 depending on the 'leet factor' of the skin and include 2 weapon skins exclusive to the character.\nWeapon skins are $2 or $3 each.\nTaunts are $3 or $6 each.\nunlocking characters is not yet available..","January 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

I understand this is Early Access, but this is strictly a PvP game. And when a PvP only game has matchmaking this poor it's very difficult for me to recommend it. When you queue up for 1v1 or 2v2 Ranked, whatever system is currently in place does not seem to factor in your MMR. I currently am placed at 130 MMR at the time of this review, and my partner was 120 and we got paired against PEOPLE ON THE TOP 5 WORLDWIDE. This is not a one time occurrence, unless you are playing during peak hours the matchmaking could give a ♥♥♥♥ less about placing you with people in your skill range. One game I get people who suicide 2/3 of their stock, and the next I get paired with people in the top 5. It's wildly inconsistent and just seems to be a product of lazy development. I am aware this community is small, but I've played games with much smaller communities and have never seen a system this terrible, it waits a total of 30-60seconds before just placing you with anybody regardless of MMR.\n\ninb4 obligatory "get good" response: Brawlhalla is a game where you can very quickly 0-100 someone given proper knowledge and timing, so pairing against two players who have mastered these mechanics is a really awful learning environment and just discourages me from even wanting to put the time in.","April 14","false","168.8"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","30","56","6","8"

However, in the interest of progression, I have a few suggestions for development of the game. Now, I'm not an expert or anything, but just consider this the thoughts of a seasoned gamer. First off, I would like too see more work put in to customizing all the characters' movesets, making each one feel more unique. Secondly, the overall movement feels a bit off. Not bad, per se, just off. A brawler needs to be a bit more fast-paced than this one is. The gravity could stand to be a bit more forceful, and a slight increase in character speed couldn't hurt, either. And finally, the maps. Now, I know this is still early access, but a little more variation would be nice. As a suggestion, what about opening map development to steam users, and a ranking system to make the better built maps show up more frequently? All in all, this is a good start, but needs some more love before it will have the kind of replay value that Smash Bros. does. I like this game, and hope the developers read this review.","February 14, 2015","true","52.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

And the similarities are quite seen. But Brawlhalla manages to distinguish itself with its interesting weapon mechanic and quirky characters.\n\nSo far, battles are fun. The moves could maybe be a little more diverse, and feel a little more deliberate: sometimes, I would attack in a direction, but it wouldn't go exactly as I intended it to, or it would all be a general aerial attack instead of an aerial attack in a specific direction. Still, it's pretty cool for a beta.\n\nOnline play was bad since there's only a specific server located halfway around the world to me so the lag I experience is so intense. It's so bad that when I press a button, my character doesn't even move.\n\nStill, I can't really demerit a game for something like that. I just hope they create more servers in the future so that everyone internationally can battle each other.\n\nIn all, a pretty great looking game so far.

The main difference is looks and the weapons they can get. Controls handle well, although only 3 of the 4 possible directions have unique attacks (up, side, down, no movement), and the one that's a duplicate varies depending on if you're in the air or not and which attack button you're using. The high amount of jumps fighters have mean that a great deal of combat takes place in the air and that killing someone is very difficult.\n\nIt's fun to play with others, but the only single player mode is incredibly easy and non-configurable - a series of three 4-character matches.","January 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Thats what I let pass cause its so early on.\n\nBy the way if you want to play me in SM4SH 3DS Send me a message. >:]","February 27, 2015","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're looking to play old school Smash, it's close but not an exact clone by any means. This is a good thing! Don't worry. It does have the same combat style to sate your Nintendo cravings, but comes with some interesting changes. Without grapple's and with cool mechanics like wall jumping, weapons, and a charge + aim mechanic for thrown items (or weapons) it has a good feel. The movements feel smooth and reactive, and rarely do I feel like I can't control my character. When I attack each move feels appropriately powerful and the feeling of being over-powered is well countered with the real threat of other players, all while not feeling too splashy/twitchy/spammy/gimmicked combat.\n\nWhat surprised me most was that you can throw money at the dev's all you want, but you won't be winning more matches. However, characters ARE locked behind a pay wall (not including the very reasonably sized roster of cycling free playable characters called Legends), but you can simply save in-game currency to get the characters you want. In-game currency accrues somewhat slowly and the cost is somewhat high, so don’t expect to own all the characters after a day’s play but a new character for every few hours of play feels fair for the penny pinchers like me. That said, tossing $20 for all current and future characters is honestly not unreasonable, and frankly I could see even myself buying it. (TO BE CLEAR: if you don't want to pay any money, you won't suffer for it in matches!)\n\nAs is, in beta, I would say it's one of the better game's I've played in recent memory and definitely worth your time. Active dev's and progressing this game further is icing on my Brawlhalla cake.","September 27, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then this game is DEFINETLY for you.\n\nFor starts, I feel like a kid again. This is EXACTLY like Super Smash, but not with Nintendo characters. Instead, they have amazing new characters that really only are able to do a ton of damage if they are able to snag a weapon (that happens very often). Most characters I have played are easy, if you are starting, play with the coolest looking weekly rotation guy and you will love them.\n\nPros:\n\nFUN\n\nEasy to play\n\nGreat community\n\nNot to hard to get coins\n\nNo "op" legends\n\nGreat format\n\nLooks just like Super Smash, but a little different\n\n1v1 Ranked and 2v2 Ranked\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nAfter the end of a battle, sometimes it glitches out when you hit continue and doesnt show your experience'\n\nNot many people play this at the moment\n\nSome legends cost a little too much money and would take about a weeks worth of gameplay to get them\n\nAll in all, this game is a 9/10. The only thing I would add in this would be more weapons, maybe some more unique abilities, and definetly more game modes. There are only 3 (Ranked, Online, and Solo). One final addition would be more legends, but I understand the game is very new, so I wouldnt really count that yet.

No one particular section will give you an overwhelming advantage/disadvantage due to the super floaty aerial system. (See cons for the flip side)\n-stage appearances aren't overly complicated, so you are less likely to lose track of characters (theres a con to this)\n-the controls and mechanics of the game are very easy for beginners to pick up and very familiar to those of us who have played smash brothers series.\n-music is decent. At least good enough to where you don't feel the need to mute your sound.\n\ncon:\n-although the aerial system compliments the simplistic stage designs, it's precisely this mechanic that makes combat momentum very sluggish.\n-Concerning combat, considering this game goes out of it's way to mimic smash in as many ways as possible, it lacks quite a few attack variations. Having no difference in movement speeds also contributes to this factor.\n-Another issue with combat and the lack of attack variations is the fact that the attacks you unleash in regards to directional input make little to no sense. (ex. Directional attacks don't match most cases. Push down to attack, you'll actually jump up and do something completely different. Something you'd expect from pushing up or maybe even jumping and pushing sideways. If the game had that many attack options that is.)\n-Legends although they appear unique, often just turn out to be little more than different skins of other Legends.\n- A glaring problem: For the legends who are unique, the characters you have to unlock or pay for are incredibly unbalanced compared to your starter characters. Their weapon related attacks having much larger and longer lasting hitboxes and often are 2 or 3x as effective. Some attacks from these particular Legend weapons I would go as far to say they auto combo. Once you intitiate the attack, the game does all the work for you. Hits a person multiple times, launches them into a dangerous position, then finishes the attack off with a spike.\n\nTo sum this up. Fun and addicting game, best played with friends and not competitively due to lazy combat system and unbalanced characters.\n\n\n-Edit: Characters available to be used appear to be changed weekly maybe? So in the end, every character needs to be unlocked for daily use. In regards to balance without going into specifics. Some characters are just plain overpowered when it comes to their particular weapons and attacks. As a result, the most casual of players can win by hitting a single button repeatedly.","November 10, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
