"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jatan11t/recommended/364890/","jatan11t","GAR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jatan11t/","4334 products in account","Honestly, I think the people giving positive reviews for this game have vested interest in the game or something.  Most of them sound very forced and don't give any substantial reason as to why the game is good, other than "it's fun" or "the devs are nice."  The game simply isn't very good.  It just seems like a game that you'd find on any free flash game website - but far rougher around the edges.  For example, there's actually no end to the levels (I had to read the other negative reviews to figure this out) - when you get all the way to the right side of the level, there's just an invisible wall that prevents you from moving any further.  In the Streets of Peril level, on the far right side, you actually get stuck in a small area on the dirt because the game prevents you from jumping for some reason.  In the arcade levels?  You just instantly die when you go too far.  The entire game has just such low production quality - and it definitely seems like one of those "first try" game efforts that might have come out of a project course in high school.\n\nTo be frank, I don't think this game should have been released on Steam.  It would never have passed the quality controls of previous years.\n\n","July 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","52","58","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hemmingjay/recommended/364890/","hemmingjay","Hemmingjay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hemmingjay/","1433 products in account","EDITED REVIEW AFTER 6 MONTHS:\n\nI am changing this review because the game and the developer have both shown a lot of improvement. First let me say that the developer is human and it's not an easy job. Gamers are quick to espouse their opinions and rarely offer the same degree of politeness expected in person. It can be very hard to hear harsh criticism from strangers when you have shown the bravery to share your art with the world at large and sometimes hurt feelings can lead you to make rash decisions. In this case the developer has matured and taken the criticisms to heart. He has stopped censoring opinions and put a lot of hard work into his game. It shows and it is appreciated. I now support this developer and look forward to his future work. I would also like to apologize if I offended Jake from Statefarm at any stage of the process.\n\nWARNING: Another developer who deletes negative criticism posts and bans users for them. Avoid this game and developer at all costs. The User CashPanda and myself have both had forum posts with negative, but constructive criticism deleted as well as being banned with the following message "You have been permanently banned from all The Lost Battalion: All Out Warfare discussions.\nYou were banned by a The Lost Battalion: All Out Warfare developer.\nReason: "Toxic behavior""  There is NO ROOM on Steam for developers like this.\n\nI am having trouble recommending this game for any reason. I am a huge supporter of indie games and can usually find a redeeming idea or element of execution, but here I have no hope. The whole game is less functional and rewarding than ANY game you will find on the free flash game websites like Armor Games, etc. This game is merely a series of static screens consisting of one length scroll right, one left with endless waves of stupid enemies that come along. There is no point other than try to beat your score. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's wonky and unpredictable. Jump up and down a few times and you will randomly ending up in "the mud" and instantly die. Walk to the right and you might end up in the mud and instantly die. It's incredibly bad at this point and while I do believe in cutting low priced games some slack, I would tell my friends to stay away even if it was free. This is a course in how NOT to develop games. This team seems to have failed to develop a concept or design document even though they have been working on this for "8 months". I do not have any interest in being mean or hurting the feelings of this team but this type of production has no place on Steam. It is damaging to the overall quality of the platform when an aimless team sells something that an average newcomer could make himself in 5-7 days with Game Maker. Developer, please consider taking your game down from the store until you have a concept. This is in response to the only post on the forum at this time which is from you asking us from gameplay ideas. This is NOT how to make games. I wish you better luck in the future, please study our industry a bit and learn the steps to making a game that is going to be enjoyed and appreciated by others if not a commercial success.","April 24, 2015","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","19"

But it's definitely not worth buying and downloading. The graphics and gameplay are more reminiscent of online flash games than anything you'd find on the Steam store. Terribly simple and easily boring.","April 22","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get one mode which is "arcade mode" from when you "used to play at the malls with an arcade." You get only 3 heros and 5 horrible battle cards.\nIn gameplay, you just survive infinate amounts of waves with enemies you can't touch, but just shoot at them. If you touch them, you'll recieve massive amounts of damage. One thing that definately annoyed me; they can shoot you through walls and you can't.\nOh yeah, I forgot to mention, when you rush at a slope or ramp, you get ♥♥♥♥ing launched over the screen (the maps are always super small) and you can barely jump.\nThe graphics are cartoonish (if you can even call it that) and it's a 2D side-scroller. Oh yeah, this game also costs $1.30. Not worth it for a game like this.\n5.3/10, "I'm gonna blow yor damn heads off."","May 6","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its arcadey. Kind of hard because you get swarmed but whatever. It is pretty fun, i'd reccomend getting it on sale however. Sometimes shots feel like they should have hit, and enemies bullets go through cover and trenches. I feel that eother changing the spawn rate, or making it so cover and such does something could make this game a lot better.\n\nThat being said, for the price (I believe it said $1 canadian), it isnt bad, and is actually quite funny, and well made.","May 7","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
