But it is definitely showing its age and I'm not averse to trying something new. On the face of it, Hacker Evolution Duality looks to be an excellent successor to that beloved classic. But first appearances are frequently misleading.\n\nHacker is not a game; it is a collection of dull and fiddly mini-games. While it has an excellent presentation, the gameplay itself is nothing more than pushing a button at the right time; an uninteresting race against the clock that you need to repeat dozens of times in each mission. It looks great - it has the appearance of Hollywood hacking nailed - but it quickly degenerates into uninteresting repetitiveness. And just to make things even less fun, the controls were stiff and unresponsive; just the thing for a game that demands quick reflexes. Despite its stylish gloss, the game fails to engage on almost every other levels and ultimately is not particularly fun.","November 27, 2013","false","1.3"," 186 of 199 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","186","199","4","0"

So when I heard that there was going to be a sequel, I jumped at the chance to purchase it!\n\nHowever, this game has little to recommend it, and doesn't much resemble the original at all.  The original made you feel like an actual hacker, typing commands into a console.  This game is a GUI based point-and-click.  You don't get the feel of being a hacker that you might expect from the title.\n\nNot only that, but the gameplay is boring, and a lot of the tools at your disposal are arbitrarily difficult to use, and the time limit placed on you just makes things stressful and not fun when the tools take almost as long or longer than the time allotted to you.

It is really bad.\n\nFirst of all it starts on my second display which is my TV, took a while to realize it.\n\nSecond, there is a bug where you can't read messages (gives some file not found error), apparently the dev knows about this since Jan or Feb or something and it still isn't fixed. There's a dude that posted some workaround with converting mp3 files to ogg and changing some text files around to make it work, this way you can actually read mission objectives.\n\nThe game it is kind of crap, it is not very intuitive what you need to do, in fact in the tutorial the AI hacked me down to 0 firewall and 0 integrity and I had no idea what would I need to do to counter it. Don't be mistaken by the name the game has nothing to do with actual hacking or IT skills, it's just a theme, so it's not about me not knowing what a computer is (I do, working since 15 years in IT).\n\nI know now it's a rather old game and it's not a big financial loss to try it, but if I knew what I know now I wouldn't have paid even 1 euro for it.

Well, i've gained zero knowledge thanks to the gods, and uselessness of this product. To explain myself politely, this is not a game, but a mental warfare without the cold trace of fun.\nThe music itself doesn't match with my style, some electronic stuff, tastes are so different between peoples, so i can't rate it but acceptable enough. The game itself lacks of game elements, we have 7 "maps" total, (which are nothing more but a desktop-like picture with a few dots named as servers) there are some crazy time limited memory games and thats all. You have to count down numbers in a box from 63 to 0 while enemy servers attacking you (rofl), and there is another component of the game which is totally the same...\nI was in hope for a patch which adds some more features/maps or something to the game, but no, everything remained the same. Even the Vsync bug, which makes the HUD buttons disappear after each match, because the game have no graphics options and you have to mess with your own video card to play the game. There are random crashes and i've also lost my profile with my savegames and achievement progresses because for some reason, no idea how.\nAnd what is the most surprising, perhaps the price, you still have to pay 20€ for this headache after years!\nIf i truly regret wasting money on a product, well this is it. The honest price shall be around 0,5€, so try to find something else about this genre, go away and don't look back, avoid to get robbed. I don't like to downvote games, because it is basically a waste of time, but this must be serve as warning to all, to forget this game.

It was in no way realistic compared to actual hacking, but it was fun and made you feel like a movie hacker. The levels were fun and the story was usually ok.\n\nThis... thing, is just atrocious. My friend boght it to me for my birthday and I had to apologise to her for wasting her money. The interface is ugly, and there is no strategy to the levels. Bouncing makes no logical sense and all the player input relies on "click server x on the map. Click the hacking button repeat".\n\nInitially the game gives you an illusion of a fair challenge by introducing "AI servers" that are supposed to look for you and perform hostile actions. Neat concept only if you EVER initiate any kind of hostile action against them they completely ♥♥♥♥ you. Why?\n\nbecause it doesn't matter you bounced through multiple servers to get to them, they know EXACTLY where you are. Thus removing any semblance of strategy.\n\n\n\nThis game is a waste of money, not worth 20$. Not worth 4$. Hell do yourself a favor and don't even play it for free.

If you don't like the original, then you won't like any of the sequels.\n\nI'm not gong to put the developers down because, quite frank, its a solid game that is well thought out and really indepth. I'd rather play this then a bug action-packed fast paced game, its just this isn't my type of game.  :-/","May 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Deinstalled this embarrassing attempt to realease a 'nerdy game' after only 20 minutes.\n\nSeriously, I have no problem with games that won't suprise you with the newest ultra-high-engine-graphic-and-more-stuff, you know what I mean, because I'm rating the action of the game more weighted then it's graphichal occur.\nBut this game has nothing from both, not a real action which will fascinate you and will keep you playing the game nor a good appearance on the graphical side. The music could increase your enthusiasm of this game when you know the genre acid, you will find some fine fake-TB-303 basslines but the remaining arrangement will hurt your ears and the increasing enthusiasm will drop down nearly to it's previous level. When I clicked on 'Exit' the game freezed and Windows showed up two error messages, the first one is the 'Hacker Evolution Duality has stopped working' and the second one was 'This program has compatibility issues'.

Not difficult, just hard.  Not challenging in a flexible, puzzle-solving way... it's just a big useless heavy hunk of rock with a nice paint job.\n\nThe point and click interface (with keyboard shortcuts) is fast and fluid.  The visuals are clean and simple and I quite like them.  Sadly, the gameplay is downright awful.  You have 30 minutes to complete most scenarios, but hostile AI will rip you apart well before that.  In many cases that means you have to move fast and cross the finish line just before the attacks crash you.  There is no way to deter or foil enemy AI in this game... your firewall, trace, etc. mean nothing to them.  It's just a constant damage-over-time effect once triggered.  This ruins the game.  The fun part is exploring the servers, messing with switches and log files, and finding hidden backend servers to bounce off of.  But you are given zero time to explore and no method of outsmarting the enemy other than shutting them down entirely, which is often detrimental to your efforts.  MIssions are about trial and error finding the set path to complete objectives.  After several attempts you will then simply do everything you need to as fast as you can to beat the AIs.  There is nothing clever in this game.  It's a hacker game with tunnel vision.\n\n$20 is the current regular price.  I paid less than a dollar and feel ripped off.  It feels like a cell phone app.  It has no scope.  It has no depth.  It's just blah in a pretty wrapper to entice you.","January 30","false","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ich habe es auch nur durch Zufall, weil ich mir Random Keys für Stea gekauft hab und dann dieser Mist bei rauskam. Das Tutorial ist so schlecht, dass man keine Ahnung hat was man machen muss. Dann steht auch noch Doppelklick bzw. die Maustasten für verschiedene Befehle, d.h. es ist abnormal kompliziert. Zudem hat es leider nichts mit Hacks zu tun, da man einfach nur Dinge anklickt und dann auf andre Sachen klickt und am Ende richtet man einen Satelliten aus indem man wartet bis er sich richtig gedreht hat und im richtigen Moment klickt. Irgendwie sehr einfach gestaltet da man nahezu keine Möglichkeiten hat, gleichzeitig aber auch sehr schwer weil eben diese wenigen Möglichkeiten einfach nur extrem schwer gehalten sind. Ich empfehle jedem der sich nicht Stundenlang mit einer schlecht geschriebenen englischen Einleitung bzw. einem Tutorial bei dem jeder Sinn von Grammatik fehlt, rumschlagen will, das Geld zu sparen und sich z.B. ein Eis zu kaufen. Wenn ich überlege was ich mit diesem Euro alles hätte tun können, kommt mir doch direkt mein Abendessen hoch. Und genau so wie mein verdautes Mahl, ist diese Game auch... Ungenießbar, rausgeschmissenes Geld und vor allem: es brennt einem in den Augen. Vor allem in denen von der Kanalreinigung.

As you take on big multi-national corporations and enemy AI servers in a bid to achieve the tasks doled out to you by your mysterious employers.\n\nThe hacker sim genre isn’t crowded with titles and is often completely overlooked by gamers, so it’s always good to see new titles entering the fold. But Hacker Evolution Duality throws such a ridiculous learning curve into the fray that anyone looking for an entertaining introduction to the genre may want to consider a RTFM approach to this title. The manual itself helpfully gives you step by step instructions for completing the first two levels, and delves slightly deeper into the game mechanics than the tutorial levels do. In some respects it’s quite nice to encounter a game that has a real challenge to it and doesn’t take your hand and gently lead you through the levels until it’s absolutely sure you can manage on your own. But again for those looking to dip their toes into the hacker sim genre, you may want to consider Uplink as an alternative starting point.\n\nHacker Evolution Duality image\n\nThe game has you performing a variety of typical hacker objectives such as downloading files, transferring money or switching off local CCTV cameras. You start by having to hack into a system through a variety of means; DOS and EMP attacks can help weaken a servers defences before you break through the firewall or try and falsify voice or retina recognition security protocols. Once you have control over a server, you can then create bounded links to improve your CPU strength which in turn allows you to hack into more powerful servers. As well as a focused single player campaign there are “open world” scenarios to play through which involve a pitched battle against multiple AI servers who are all after the same objective.\n\nAll of this makes for an entertaining game that is fun to play. But sadly that fun is sucked out by some pretty significant balancing issues. Levels that must be completed within a deadline are compounded by enemy servers that will constantly bombard you with attacks the moment they become hostile. After your sever has suffered enough damage it will disappear off the map and you’re back to the very beginning of the level again.\n\nI found these two factors to be so constraining that it was very difficult to think strategically about what I was going to do next, or what I was supposed to be doing even. The pressures applied to you during the levels mean that you can spend nearly 20 minutes of gameplay trying one avenue of attack before being beaten and then spending another 20 minutes experimenting with a different type of strategy. It generates a level of real-time confusion and chaos that perfectly captures the immediacy of real life cyber crime, but unfortunately makes the game very unforgiving and quite frustrating.\n\nHacker Evolution Duality image\n\nThe controls are slick and responsive if a little buggy at times, generally there is a good flow to the controls and again, reading the manual will greatly aid the speed in which you are able to carry out your list of attacks and commands. Performing these commands requires more speed than skill however. In the case of the DOS and voice recognition attacks, you simply have to set the slider bars to the matching values on screen. The game will helpfully lock these in place once you have set the correct value, so you are spared the painful task of tweaking your mouse movements down to a fine degree.\n\nSpeaking of commands there is a very nice console feature that gives you the ability to run some basic Linux commands. But this feature is sadly deprecated in the main game and is instead the prime focus on the game’s DLC: Inception, which is simply a port of the missions from the original Hacker Evolution game. Given the difficulty that I experienced playing through Hacker Evolution Duality, you’d think it odd that I’d complain about not having an array of Linux commands to deal with. But the lack of console commands as a gameplay feature means that the game feels slightly less realistic and immersive as a result.\n\nHacker Evolution Duality image\n\nI found the graphics strangely counter-productive to the overall feel of the game however. The original Hacker Evolution title featured a mottled tan colour overlay that I felt worked quite well in creating the vibe and feel of a low-fidelity hacking system. Similarly Introversion Software’s Uplink has a bright blue overly that also suits the tone and mood of the hacking gameplay as a concept. Hacker Evolution Duality is bright, crisp, clean and delivers an advanced and modern overlay through which to conduct your activities. It’s good in that the palette never becomes tiring to look at, but at the same time it is incredibly flat and lacking in atmosphere or style. This is partly rectified in the Inception DLC which adds a fuzzy orange-brown tone to the background world map. But the clean UI modules persist.\n\nThe music is somewhat over enthusiastic, providing buzzing electronic riffs that feel as though they’ve just been wrenched from a late 90s action game on the PS1. Much like the graphics, the score is too clean and clinical despite their best efforts. That said it’s well within your power to dial the volume down and select some more choice tracks from your own collection whilst you hack (which is exactly what I did, Lorn and Starkey work particularly well with this title).\n\nIn an age where gamers repeatedly complain about games being too easy, it’s difficult to berate such a title for having a tough and unforgiving time bounded restraints, as well as a lack of care and consideration to genre newbies. Hacker Evolution Duality cobbles together an interesting selection of hacking tools to put at your disposal, but a clinical approach to gameplay and graphics counteracts the fun you’ll have in the hacking landscape.\n\n7/10\n","May 11, 2014","true","3.8"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

Based on the successful Hacker Evolution game series, it has been completely redesigned to offer an impressive and new gaming experience.\n\nHacker Evolution Duality starts in the early days of Brian Spencer when he was nothing more than a brilliant programmer. It than fast forwards to the future, where he has to stop an Artificial Intelligence he has created, unknowingly and take back control of a giant company he once used to own.\n\nYou have to hack into computers using various tools, from a basic firewall cracker, to sophisticated voice print authentication systems. Steal money to finance your objectives, buy hardware upgrades or bribe off other hackers that are present in the game. Go as far as bypassing complex security systems to make your way into buildings and steal data. Frame people or even murder them using ingenious traps.\n\nYou are not alone in the game. Other hackers controlled by a complex artificial intelligence, will stop at nothing to destroy you.\n\nThe game features a single player mode where you follow the game's story and an open world mode, where you play a death match against other hackers.","November 23, 2013","true","132.6"," 4 of 30 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","4","30","0","4"

See thread http://steamcommunity.com/app/70120/discussions/0/648812917138941379/\n\nWhen we finally were able to download and launch the game in April 2014 it became apparent that it was, and still is, unplayable. There are game breaking bugs, such as not being able to read the tutorial. See thread http://steamcommunity.com/app/70120/discussions/0/540734423812915043/\n\nWe have periodically been promised that an update will be out "this weekend", "soon", "this week", etc, for a year or so by now.\n\nIn December 2014 the promised update was released on Windows and Mac, with a promise that "it will be shortly followed by the Linux update". At January 13th the developer said "Will be out this week" and now at February 6th we have still not gotten it for Linux. See thread http://steamcommunity.com/games/hackerevolutionduality/announcements/detail/168087289828647736\n\nDo NOT purchase this game if your intention is to play it on Linux. I want to believe that the developer has the best intentions and has just messed up with the promised Linux release. However, history sadly shows us that it's not possible to believe his promises.","February 6, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I promptly uninstalled this game, and went to go play Uplink's free, multiplayer, more modern cousin, Codelink.
