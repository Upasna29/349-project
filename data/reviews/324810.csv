After hearing about a new Combat Arena FPS coming into the works, I was really looking forward to it. Normally, I would never look into Early Access games, but for once in my life, I was actually EXITED to back this up... Hell I bought the $90 Godlike Package >_>\n\nFrom what I've played so far, if feels exactly like UT, with the only a few differences I can see.\n\nA temporary "Cloak" or stealth that will turn you invisible for a few seconds to help you get away or help you flank your opponents.\nThere is no form of "Rocket Jumping" or at least I have yet to pull it off. The reason why I bring this up, as there is some armor in the 1 map we get that has armor that is impossible to jump to, thus I thought you could only get that from Rocket Jumps, but I guess I'm doing it wrong.\nThe weapons also do not seem to have a "combo" as UT did with some of their weapons, ex. the Shock Rifle from UT.\nNo power ups like jump boots, quad damage, shield, etc. There is armor, health, and a turbo health and that is all I've been able to find. Again, I'm only going off of the 1 map that is available.\nCurrent weapons selection is as follows:\nWeapon        Description                Raven        Pistol with single shot and burst shot (only can have 1, that I can tell)                Bullcraft        Shotgun with single and double shot                Violator        Assault Rifle with Grenade shot                Falcon        Sniper Rifle with Scope (Zoom)                Stingray        Lazer Assault Rifle with full auto and beam single shot                Dragoneer        Flamethrower with spray and charged fireball (Yes, a f***ing fireball)                Cerberus        Rocket Launcher with a locking on function? (never successfully got it to work)\nOtherwise, it plays almost exactly like UT does. It has your quick movement dodges, double jumps, adrenaline pumping combat, great looking graphics, great sound and music. Hell even the AI is pretty good, feels like I'm playing UT... Which is why I brought up the joke about changing the name to UT 3.5, there isn't really anything new thus far!\n\nIf you are new to Combat Arena FPS games, go buy Unreal Tournament, it's a finished game with tons of content, or even Quake Live to get a feel for fast paced FPS. I recommend you to wait for more content to become available in TOXIKK before I can tell everyone to purchase this game, in it's current state.\n\nI can't wait to see what else Reakktor Studios has in store for us. Don't let us down!\n\n\n*I was originally going to keep this updated with each update, but I decided to wait for the full release.\nAlso keep in mind that I am no professional reviewer, professional game critic, or Pro FPS player, I'm just a guy that loves to play video games","January 22, 2015","true","6.4"," 162 of 181 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","162","181","17","7"

(You need to reduce the splash radius (or the damage) and maybe    even reduce the fire rate by a margin because it is a bit too easy to kill people).\n- Head hitboxes are way too big, you can hit people with the outside of your crosshair on their head.\n- The pistol is a joke, so when you spawn you really have to avoid people.\n- Play will be very limited until the new maps come out, but I am happy to wait.\n\nThe Ugly\n- Me","January 22, 2015","true","8.0"," 126 of 144 people (88%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","88","126","144","23","9"

Even in its early stages with only one map (this review is written as of 0.73 Wasabi), the game shows a balanced arsenal where one doesn't even feel guilty for using the rocket launcher.\n\nAlthough many players may have already been introduced to the genre, TOXIKK holds its appeal for new players that freshen up the pool to add new experiences, and wage new wars. However, this comes at a price since the arena shooter genre has gone all but extinct since the 90's, with the last "popular" arena FPS being Unreal Tournament III in 2006, which was poorly recieved due to its unbalanced weapons and poor movement.\n\nHowever, TOXIKK features improved movement in comparison to UT3, and again, a more balanced arsenal where a player is encouraged to utilize all weapons at their disposal. With the development team faithfully taking the opinions of the players to heart, weapon balance is still being perfected even now.\n\nA nostalgia trip for old school gamers, and a new experience that completely abandons that of modern shooters for the new generation, TOXIKK is an amazing game that revitalizes its genre with fast paced action and impressive graphics (for an indie game especially). Reakktor Studios is putting their money where their mouth is, and indeed letting us "Frag like it's 1999"!","February 16, 2015","true","8.2"," 100 of 110 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","100","110","4","14"

The first Early Access build has been released about a day ago and the developers included one single map only - on purpose. This is because they focus on basic gameplay and weapon balancing at the moment, which will be done based on community feedback. However, new content will be released every 2-4 weeks. Reakktor have posted a detailed release plan on the official forums, which can be found here:\nhttp://forum.toxikk.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=993\n\nI'll try to update this review as new content gets released.\n\nSo here's my current opinion:\n\nI knew this would be a very early release and hence I had my doubts about how playable and enjoyable it would be and how smooth it would work from a technical perspective. The download was about 800 MB only (including the dedicated server files), so I was very curious about what I would get to see.\n\nWell, what should I say? Everything works just perfectly! I experienced no crashes at all. Graphics are smooth and beautiful despite my rather old system (Win7 64, Phenom II X4 CPU @3400 MHz, 8 GB RAM, Radeon HD 5800 graphics card with 1 GB). I play in full HD at high graphics settings and get no stuttering at all.\n\nThe game actually comes with a single player mode called "Blood Arena" where you can play against adjustable bots. If you set the number of combatants to 1, you will be alone in the map and can try out everything you want while taking your time. Once you're fed up with fragging bots, there's also the "Multiplayer" mode. Here, you can play on the internet, as well as on your own LAN. In both variants, you have the choice to create a listening server (where others can join while you're playing as well) or join another server (listening or dedicated). So playing a LAN game with your friends is really easy, for example.\n\nThe gameplay as such is very fluid. There's double jumps, dodging, dodge jumps and wall dodge jumps (exactly as in UT2004). At the moment, there are 7 weapons in the game including rocket launcher, sniper, flamethrower, shotgun, pistol and some more. The rocket laucher (called Cerberus) is somewhat overpowered in its current state, but I'm sure this will be fixed with the next release as weapon balancing is one of the main goals currently. You also can't access the options while being in a map yet, so the first setup is somewhat of a hassle. But once you're done with this, it's all ok. This will be improved as well for sure.\n\nApart from this, I'm really impressed how well everything works. Playing the game is great fun already - even if there's just one map (called "Foundation") right now. The menu, characters, weapons and map design is outstanding in my opinion and the sounds and music fit very well too. All players have equal chances as there's no such thing as DLCs, micro transactions and the like. To me it seems that this really could be the start of a true 1999 Arena FPS revival with up-to-date visuals.\n\nI've been in the developer forums for some months now and I can really say that they have the right attitude towards the community, development and marketing. They have made everything as transparent as possible (as you can see with the  beta roadmap linked above, for example). Also LAN mode, free dedicated servers for everybody and the possibility to create your own clan in the game (not included yet) have been implemented as a result of community feedback - before the game even became available in Early Access.\n\nJust 1 1/2 days after EA start, there are many active players and people trying to build up a community already. You can find Steam groups, twitch channels, clan pages/forums, TS servers, IRC channels and so on.\n\nTo conclude this lengthy review: I recommend getting this game asap and frag like it's 1999. ;) But keep in mind that EA has just started and the full content will be available in 4-6 months only.","January 24, 2015","true","54.9"," 68 of 74 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","68","74","6","3"

There's too many reviews that just say "Good game." Right?\n\nThe gunplay is as you'll expect, however you might find it difficult moving at the dizzying speeds you move around. (Have a bucket ready)\n\nThere is currently one map, which is all mappy and stuff - the map design is very well done and the visuals of the game might ruin your pants. (Have a spare pair ready)\n\nThis are pretty much the main simple pro's and con's of the game.\n\nPro's        Con's                Great gunplay and movement.        Weapons unbalanced according to some of player base.                Fair amount of populated servers.        Limited Server Locations.                Amazing map design.        Only one map currently.\nBut I'm pretty sure you want my opinion, right?! What!? you dont wan- HAVE IT ANYWAY!\n\nUpon respawn, you will start with a puny weapon. You will sometimes spawn right next to people who have rocket launchers who will murder you. No matter how much you scream "Come at me bro!!" you will still die alot on respawn.\n\nCamping is encouraged by the respawn times of weapons actually being shown to the players. Do you want to run around with a pistol still, or wait 2 seconds for the rocket launcher? I think we would all wait the 2 seconds. In my opinion the game would be improved in future by removing the visible timings.\n\ntl;dr: The game is great considering early access, it has flaws, which are pretty much tiny.

(Almost) Any critique get's shut down, removed and banned. (Usually, see last post in the threads, for wisest developer answers ever, such as, why would you play an unfinished game? It's unfinished, stop saying that people don't play it!)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/324810/discussions/0/617335934143545687/\n\nFor example. So they're saying that being concerned with the developer actions has nothing to do with the game. I love it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/324810/discussions/0/611703999965041818/\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/324810/discussions/0/617335934125994144/\n\n"So, calling Toxikk "dead" before it's fully released, before famous YouTubers have reviewed it... actually, before we have spend a SINGLE CENT on advertisement... is just ignorance or trolling. You choose. ;) " - Quote from one of the developers, Sharkster.\n\nYup, they even insult other developers and Early Access games there, saying, their's better. Great PR. -2nd link, last post in 3rd part of the thread.\n\nYeah. I also whined about the game being dead and having lots of bugs. I got banned and scared with a lawsuit.\n\nDon't buy it. Horrible developer. There's only 1 active man from the team that you can talk to, nobody else, that's unacceptable.\n\nNow the game:\n\nThe description lies to you:\n\n1. No matchmaking system.\n\n2. No skill system (it's so broken it's not even existant).\n\n3. Most unbalanced game of the year.\n\n4. Small maps full of corridors.\n\n5. Does not feel like any game from 1999-2004. It's a clone of UT3, runs on same engine, uses same assets (not all of course, different people have different opinions about the usage. From opinions I got it's between 20-40%).\n\n6. The devloper was supposed to release the game in 2014, almost no shops (checked all known shops from my country, most of them have the release date on 2014, so at least in here) besides steam were informed, even the team that actually makes, and has a major effect on the production:\nhttp://schwiezer.com/project/toxikk/ -yup, they got the idea, release date is still 2014. -UPDATE: They have updated it to 2015 now.  OLD: http://pl.tinypic.com/r/1roz9l/8\n\n7. Community will alienate you immediately- even if you're polite, if you don't dislike the game, get ready to be made fun of, harassed and stalked. If you made a video on it, they will downvote all your videos - with full approval from the developers of course (it seems so)- why they'd remove links from their forums to downvote and harass you in any way? No, asking to remove links and settle this won't help.\n\n8. If you're not a super hardcore arena FPS player you won't be able to get on higher levels and grab most powerups - you will get obliterated.\n\n9. Maps are made for controlling a particular area, usually that has a rocket launcher. Area's give alot of advantage versus any other player (RL, super armor, megahealth can be found in close proximities on some maps, to rocket launcher, which also leads to high, advatage areas on the map that usually have 1 or 2 entrances).\n\n10. Mouse acceleration is on by default. I don't remember that in my early Arena FPS shooters.\n\n11. Prepare for massive lags/ping.\n\n12. You need a good PC to run it. Even then you will have framerate drops.\n\n13. No levelling? Why I have levels in the game then?!\n\n14. No F2P stuff?? How about skins, you know, the thing that F2P games live on? Oh yeh, we've got these!\n\n\nAfter reading the description and playing this game for a bit, then uncovering most informations, this game seems like a scam to me. I got my money stolen, I got cheated on and scammed for non-existant features and (in my opinion) false advertising, golden hypocrisy and misleading information were applied in order to make me pay for it.\n\nThey've tried to scare me with lawsuits for defending Your wallets. That kind of behaviour from a developer is unacceptable, especially when all critique is being taken as trolling and they start to insult other players before banning them.\n\nI've warned you.","June 15, 2015","false","8.5"," 200 of 336 people (60%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","60","200","336","14","43"

Amazing!\n\nYes, It's difficult to get into a game with anyone actually populating servers, but this is intended, somewhat.\n\nThe games still in a phase where getting balance, feedback and testing is more important than marketing the game in it's current state.\n\nThe sad part of all this is that the game is currently in a state where It's absolutely playable, enjoyable, but lacks any online fragging. It's been in EARLY ACCESS for quite a long time now, and yes, I do have more than 6 hours of playtime.\n\nIt should be coming to a close, and hopfully Reakktor can market this game out so we can finally get some fragging going up against actual players. (And with stable server connectivity)\n\nSo, question you must want an answer to, and that must be "Are the BOTS any good?" Yes, they are, and It's still fun to go off SOLO.\n\nThis literally is an ARENA FPS, and while it doesn't do anything that revolutionizes the genre, it does great in what the team set out to do with TOXIKK, and that's to transport us back to 1999 (More like 2003) with better graphics.","April 4","true","5.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","2"

What does that say about the mainstream gaming industry? I appreciate this game because it goes back to basics. There's something about the simplicity in the combat and weapons system that is volumes more satisfying than any of the Triple-A blockbuster games in the genre today.\n\nI've been enjoying myself. I discovered that I very rarely found myself ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off or bored. Why?\n\n***INCOMING RANT***\n\nBecause there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this game -- just as the developers have stated. There are no level 99, prestige 256, plays-this-more-than-he-goes-outside, 13-year-old, pissants, who apparently f**** everyone's mothers on a game-by-game basis, with completely decked-out gold-plated, diamond encrusted, Dorito (TM) sponsered, akimbo, rapid-fire, Panzerschrecks. There is no godforsaken, pay-to-win, microtransaction system. There are no killstreak-rewarded weapons of mass destruction. There are no premium-edition, day-zero, spend another $50 for the complete game experience, downloadable weapons/ maps. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThis game reminded me why I originally fell in love with the FPS genre. It has brought me back to a time before a bi-annual Call of Duty release. Before Battlefield 5: Give Us Your Wallet. Before anyone gave a damn about the color you customized the laces on your soldier's boots.\n\nIt has brought me back to a time of Halo CE. A time of Counter Strike. A time of Unreal Tournament.\n\n***END RANT***\n\nI don't get mad when someone nails me in the head with a shot from their sniper rifle from miles away because I know that it took skill. In fact, I'm impressed by it. This game goes back to the time-honored tradition of shooting first and shooting precisely. The frag goes to the person with a truer aim. Not to the guy with better perks or a superior weapon unlocked late in the game. Everybody has an equal chance to use any weapon. You just have to find it on the battlefield first.\n\nIn short, this game is fair and fun. It is a FPS in the most traditional sense. I can only hope that Toxikk will spark a resurgeance of the traditional, competitive first-person shooter. Although, it isn't complete yet, it will be well worth the $20 and then some.","February 19, 2015","true","4.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","14","14","3","0"

However that's really where it falls short. Toxikk really has nothing in common with a proper arena fps and its really just another casual modern FPS game.\n\nHere are the core problems.\n\n* Over the top fog and post processing that cannot be disabled in online mode (see forum post:  http://forum.toxikk.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1400&p=13556#p13556)\n\n* Film grain / HDR / Bloom / Post Processing / Distortion / Grain effect make visibility worse than even call of duty.\n\n* Mouse acceleration and smoothing is difficult to remove, to fully remove it you have to change a number of config settings, these config changes tend to get overwritten if you don't set them to read only.\n\nSeeing as this is an early access game, and this is the direction the developers have decided to take the game really disappoints me. I will update this review if any of these issues change, and hopefully they do.\n\nI would personally avoid the game and go for a proper competitive fps like Reflex.\n\n**EDIT 1**\n\nI create a youtube video to demonstrate the differnces with fog on and off: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=381959609\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\nThe dev's released an update today that fixed the visibility issues to some degree.

Anyway, the game itself is lackluster but what's there is really good. This probably won't be true after long since it's early access. They advertise "no perks" and "no regenerative health"just as the games of old played. It's really fast paced. A lot of what makes the game simple and fast paced is well done. There are two equal teams and balanced weapons with varied abilities, each of them with two fire modes. The best thing about this game is the movement system. It's not really parkour but you can still move around the map quickly if you knew how.

Thankfully the new Steam policy is more forgiving.\n\nLike other reviews, this game truly is a ghost town. Going onto the forums, the devs have said they are holding off on promotion until the game is complete. Who knows how long that will be. But honestly- if you are going to make the game available, and nobody is playing an exclusively online multiplayer game, something is wrong. It shouldn't be an available product. There is very little content to speak of - one game type, small handful of maps. Getting people into the game now would still be very important I think?\n\nI do actually like this game quite a bit. I played with bots and the visuals are amazing... but I'm worried for the future of this game. Will this ever get the player base it deserves? The early access might be damaging this game's reputation. Honestly, I would've liked to hold onto this in my Library and wait it out but if it doesn't even have enough content to hold onto a small player base then why is it available? Will people ever come back?\n\nOther problems - the guns are severely unbalanced. The starting gun is extremely weak, the rocket launcher is a one hit kill.

This accompanied by the awesome level-design make this game very special amongst shooters, I have never found a shooter that feels this fluid and well-thought-out.

Very quick gameplay with a variety of weapons. Just some thinks that could do with tweaking:\n1. If you pick up a gun that the game thinks is better that the one that you are using it changes it which is good due to the quick nature of the game. However the choises it makes can be a little confusing as the Violator for example is much better that the Dragoneer or the Falcon because of the grenade  but it swaps to one of the other two if you pick one up. Please could we have of editing the order of priorities in the settings.\n2. I know that this game is in Alpha but we need more game modes and maps.

Yes. I'm afraid the negative reviews due only to lack of players will offset the recommendation for when the game is released. And this is a great game. The servers used to be packed.\n\nAre the servers empty? Yes. However, the devs are constantly active on the forum and don't want to market the game until they feel it's ready. This isn't other Early Access titles where the devs release a crappy game and vanish with your money. This game is ready to play but has limited maps. The devs are active and answer questions not only daily but HOURLY. During the last release it was a matter of minutes and seconds.\n\nReally, in its current state, the game is an investment. Buy now at the $19USD and play it when it is finished and there is a higher playerbase. Or wait and pay what may be $50, because that's what the game is worth - that's what any other publisher would charge for this game in its completion.

I rarely bother writing reviews for games I don't recommend. This one will be one of the very few exceptions.\n\nUPDATE: After speaking to the developers (http://steamcommunity.com/app/324810/discussions/0/594820656469042804/?tscn=1435229190) it's clear to me that I will undoubtedly end up changing my review to a booming thumbs up. However until what was said is done I cannot do so. I am looking forward to being able to enjoy this game, and I will probably spend quite a bit of time playing once more people are present.\n\nI was drawn to this game because of their take on what an arena FPS should look like. I also loved the tagline; "Frag like it's 1999."\n\nTo start things off, this game looks beautiful, and plays greatly. There are no issues with gameplay in my opinion. I really like what they've done with the arena FPS concept.\n\nNow here is the problem. The developers are not really the brightest, they've commented before saying that they won't be actively marketing the game to attempt to create a playerbase, as they want to focus on developing the game. When you first read that statement it sounds like the devs actually give a damn. Here's why they don't. THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IS A GHOST TOWN. THERE IS ONE GOD DAMN SERVER IN EUROPE AND IT'S ALWAYS EMPTY.\n\nBottom line, this game is great in terms of gameplay and asthetics. On the flipside it is completely unplayable as there are no active people. I've spent 30 minutes playing against bots before deciding this was an awful purchase.

Yes I am aware it still has the Early Access label on it, but at this point the game is pretty much on the path of being complete. I doubt the game will change much after this review so I expect it to be at least valid until somewhere around 2017.\n\nSo where to start? Toxikk is a game attempting to bring 90's skill based shooters back into the mix, which seems to be growing more and more within today's industry despite the E-sports MOBA dominance. Developed by Reakktor (the typos are strong with this one) their game runs on the Unreal engine. Their task is welcomed by many FPS fans such as myself, unfortunately the game simply isn't up to snuff when compaired to games like Quake 3 Arena and it's expansion Team Arena or Unreal Tournament.\n\nNow why is that? The game does a good job of playing like an Arena FPS but with a couple new features and weapons (although the weapons really aren't all that fresh) the answer is simply where the game is going, I just don't agree on a lot this game is trying to do. There is too much attention paid to graphical eye candy rather than the design of the map. For example the new map Citadel is a redux of Facing Worlds from Unreal Tournament. However it has been forged in a way where it's just overly complex and rather annoying to get anywhere on the map. One of the joys in Facing Worlds was how simple yet very competetive it's map design was. Now the flag sits on top of a metalic mountain of a building where your chances of getting off are slim to damn nill.\n\n\nLet's talk about the audio. I gave Reakktor a break thinking they were just place holder sounds and music...I was sadly mistaken. The weapons have no kick, no punch at all to them. This is an FPS mind you, one of the base objectives if not map quality would have to be the sounds of your gun. Once again this could be changed but after talking to one of the developers about their sound they feel it's perfectly fine. Which is great, for them. I of course disagree with them but I have little say in the matter.\n\nAs for the music this was another complaint i had for the developer. The base tracks you hear a majority of the time are just generic. There's no adreniline rush to the music like Quake or Unreal Tournament. Instead it sounds more like dance music of today, really cheap dance music.\nAlthough the new tracks this update has brought in are pretty good, they sound like they would fit in more with a cyber punk RPG such as Deus Ex, rather than an Arena FPS however.\n\nFinally weapon variety. Basically all they did was take existing weapons from UT and Quake then fused them together. The Sting Ray is basically the plasma gun from Quake with the Shock Rifle's primary fire thrown in as a secondary fire. I understand there is only so much they could do with the guns, but I would rather play with UT weapons than these...\n\nDo I suggest this game? It's hard to say. I like Toxikk and it's plan but it's not excuted properally to call it a soul successor to Unreal or Quake. I suggest getting the game on sales, it's just not worth the full price when you can get Quake and Unreal for cheaper.","May 16","false","93.3"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","29","47","0","9"

It is good to see actual skill based games come back into the fold. I had some trouble getting acustomed to the movement, but after I realized the mechanics of Dodge then jump+jump "Gotta go fast" I was having a blast out gunnning or hunting people down, closing the gap in .1 second for the kill. It is a good feeling of when one kill actually feels a rewarding as the next, instead of being a float in the sea of military cookie cutters. It brings life to a genre that is not only rewarding, but shows you what dedication and time put into it can do if you want to learn, you shall get better, instead of a one button beats all design.\n\n- The guns -\nfor the most part are pretty well balanced despite say the flamethrower need some graphics tweaks (Flame obstructing vision.)\n\nThe rocket launcher - I can see the backlash, but take into consideration the map size. I was engaged with a player at a farther range and I could dodge his shots with ease and outshoot him, which resulted in me getting the kill.\n\nThe Pistol - NEEDS a buff, it is near impossible to maintain any sort of survivability with it, it either needs a damage boost of maybe 30 - 35/ faster firing rate OR get rid of weapon respawns and implement an always active weapon availability like UT.\n\n- Customization -\nThis was a big problem for me seeing as how I am a aesthetic jumkie. There needs to be color customizations on Hud, beam colors, crosshair + ALSO adding crosshair customization, maybe even character LED lights.\n\nAlso the posibility of creating a character/presets available.\n\n- Future -\nI hope this game is still supported and looked after like a small child to a paret after the release, possibly more maps and guns. A constant overview by the devs and interaction from them as well to he community with open ears.\n\n-Conclusionn -\nNeeds a few tweaks, but it has impressed and can be near perfect if things are addressed/changed, but not to the point of ruining the weapons/alterations. (Balance, don't nerf to uselessness)\n\nThank you for all the time and work put into this, brings my heart joy knowing the gaming industry is still fighting and is much alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 24, 2015","true","21.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

They felt... different, but in a good way. Both games did multiplayer in different ways to eachother and they are examples of multiplayer done correctly: fast paced, neverending action and a whole arsenal of weapons. The great thing is that they still hold up in terms of gameplay. Since then, I feel no other game did multiplayer quite as great as Q3A or UT1999 but I remained patient to see if there would be another game like them. And it was worth the wait.\n\nTOXIKK claims to be "a spiritual successor to the FPS giants of the late 90s and early 2ks, TOXIKK carefully evolves their mechanics with modern technology and fresh ideas elaborated with Arena-FPS enthusiasts" and it does its job perfectly. It leans more towards the feel of Unreal Tournament, has a few ideas from Quake III Arena while also staying very original. TOXIKK is one of the few examples of multiplayer done correctly. In TOXIKK you won't find (including but not limited to):\n\nCussing 12 and below year-olds\nGrinding for weapons by leveling\nCheap skill\nPeople accusing you of cheating, because lets be serious, you're not cheating 99% of the time, it's just pure skill\nBitter people who hate on those who are better\nTOXIKK is just pure fast-paced, skill-oriented multiplayer where tactic is your greatest ally. However, the only downside to TOXIKK is that there doesn't seem to be many people playing this game at the moment. I hope that when this game is out of Early Access that more people will be playing TOXIKK. If you want to support the developers and if you're a big fan of arena FPS then I cannot recommend this game enough. The price it is at when not on sale is a steal.

It couldve been the next Unreal Tournament, or sparked the return of old-school shooters. But unfotunately, TOXIKK has been plauged by numerous issues both within and outside of the game:\n\n1. Lack of Content and Updates\n\nYou think Killing Floor 2 has little content, or has slow development? TOXIKK blows KF2 out of the water with lack of content and lack of good updates. There was ONE map at launch with 2 very similar modes: FFA and TDM. They did add another map shortly thereafter, but thats about it. The devs have seemingly abandoned TOXIKK in favor of promoting Friday Frag Fest notifications every 4 minutes...\n\n2. The Game is Dead, No Community\n\nThere was a fairly healthy number of players on the *very first day*. Emphasis on *first day*, because the community quickly died off. Why, you may ask? Well, not only was there ONE map, but the Rocket Launcher weapon (can't remember the name) was so overpowered that whoever had it was garunteed the match win. The only people who got ANY kills whatsoever were bunny hopping while spamming the Rocket Launcher. They did nerf the ever lasting hell out of it later, but the game was dead on arrival thanks to not only the severre lack of content, but the sheer power of the Rocket Launcher.\n\n3. The Developers are very Unprofessional\n\nThis one is quite controversial, but i will try my best to remain neutral. At first i loved these guys because of their very blunt marketing of TOXIKK as a return to Old-School Arena shooters of the late 90s. In fact, TOXIKK's taline is "Frag Like It's 1999", accompanied by the trailer, which pokes fun at Modern Shooter features like Regenerating Health, Level Progression, Micro-Transactions, ADS, and of course, Free-to-Play games. However, after looking into the things they've done and said to the community, i think its safe to say that the devs of Day One Garry's Incident were more professional.\n\nTo start off, there was this thread trying to explain why TOXIKK was already dead. The devs Locked out the thread saying that "this is going nowhere" and claiming that "its either trolling or stupidity, you decide ;)" Unfotunately, i cannot find this particular thread, but it was basically rambling nonsense about why TOXIKK was dead, and i will agree that the thread was going nowhere, but is it really the dev's authority to be closing threads like that? Just go to TOXIKK's Forums on Steam, surf through maybe a few pages, and you should find at least 3 or 4 threads closed by Reakktor. Sure, some developers like to get feedback on their game, so it makes sense that someone is checking them from time to time. Howver, while some of them are troll threads, or pointless nonsense, why are the devs cracking down on threads that they believe "aren't necessary" or are "just pointless trolling"? Some of those closed threads are genuine criticisms about the game, but Reakktor closes them anyway. Way to treat the "idiotic trolls" like me who took a $20 gamble by placinfg their faith in you and your product.\n\nAnyways, i really thought that TOXIKK would grow and prosper, as it had much more promise than other EA games, but with the lack of updates and players destorys the whole purpose of playing a multiplayer game. But what really puts the nail in the coffin is the Developer's Unprofessional attitude and egarness to silence criticisms and close threads. Do not support developers like this, let TOXIKK die off if Reakktor are not dedicated to the playerbase and the overall quality of their product. If they don't treat their product and customers with respect, why should we?","July 17, 2015","false","4.7"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","2"

This is probably the most polished Early Access game I've ever played, and also one of the best-looking ones as well. Especially for an indie developer. The game is perfectly stable, crash-free, and runs smooth as silk on my PC. Was able to set my options and join an online match within seconds, no problems whatsoever. The game runs on Unreal Engine 4.\n\nIt has all of the settings you would expect from a proper PC game. World detail, shadow detail, light shafts, AF level, multiple forms of anti-aliasing, different framerate caps, V-sync, and FOV slider that can go well over 100. I'm playing it on the "Very High" preset with a few extra tweaks. I'm sure I can run it on "Ultra" just fine, but I haven't bothered trying yet. It's such a fast-moving game that there isn't much point in stopping to admire the pretty graphics (but it's a very pretty game anyway).\n\nThe menus are laid out well, the server browser is slick and functional, and - as I said - the whole game feels extremely polished.\n\nFans of Quake and Unreal Tournament will feel right at home here. The devs have been pretty straightforward about their resentment toward F2P games and microtransactions. There's no leveling, loadouts, XP, or any other "modern" FPS features. No sprinting, no ADS. Bunnyhopping is alive and well. The rocket launcher is the most devastating weapon in the game (as it should be), but it's not fast enough or explosive enough that it doesn't require skill.\n\nThe weapon spawn points actually have a timer floating above them to show when they will respawn. A clever feature that I have never seen in an arena shooter before.\n\nThe one little gripe I had is that I couldn't modify my settings during a match. Had to back out to the main menu to change my mouse sensitivity. A bit frustrating but something you'll only have to deal with once.\n\nThe other thing I should point out, is that there is, literally, only one map right now. But it's a very fun, polished, and well-designed map. Lots of branching paths without feeling too cramped. My understanding is that the developers are working on balance right now, and will release maps over time; the next map probably being sometime in early February.\n\nReally glad I took the risk on this game. The people making it are obviously pretty passionate. If you're looking for classic deathmatch-style gameplay with a modern coat of paint, it's a must-have.","January 22, 2015","true","4.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

And for me personally that's a very cool thing (at least I can't make an excuse that someone has higher level than me and that why I suck xD).\nThere are only two maps in the game, but they do show that devs know what they are doing - maps are very well designed, nicely balanced for all the game modes you can run them on, have enough space for close combat as well as for long range encounter, and of course look pretty cool.\nThe game code seems to be quite solid - I rarely had dips below 60 fps. And the ones that happened seemed to be related to particle emitters.\nCell capture mode (that is essentially CTF) is pretty awesome too. Mostly because of the huge map with vehicular combat and all the crazy stunts you can pull off.\n\nSo, if you like old-school arena FPS games - I'd definitely recommend TOXIKK.\nAnd if you think that 3 game modes and two maps are not enough, then just add it to your wishlist and keep an eye on it. It is pretty damn enjoyable.\n\nOn the downsides:\n- Game features only three modes and two maps at the moment\n- Vehicles are behaving a bit whacky from time to time\n- Looks like weapons that emit a lot of particles (mainly flamethrower) currently crash the game\n- For some reason game has mouse smoothing on by default (although it's barely noticeable)\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY6o3eKB-HY","February 20, 2015","true","2.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's perfect to me.

However, this game has two very poignant counterarguments:\n\n1. It's *stable*, and the content is *polished*. The game has never crashed on me, and even with the settings basically-maxxed out, it runs butter smooth on my laptop (core i7, 16GB RAM, SSD, GeForce 965M). There are only a handful of maps, but they load nicely, look great, make sense, and I've never run into a geometry issue or other annoyance.\n2. LAN. This game actually works over a LAN. This is something that so few games have these days, which annoys me, because I love getting together with my friends and having a frag fest in the same room.\n\n\nI'll also add a few other minor nitpicks:\n1. Weapon balance could stand a bit of tweaking. The default gun is about as effective as a marshmallow launcher, while the rocket launcher will kill basically anyone in one shot, even with a whole-lot-of-health. Similarly, health power-ups are very sparsely littered around most of the maps, so death is near-constant.\n2. The AI could use a bit of improvement. Playing against bots seems to go from "they'll run in highly predictable patterns, never capture the flag, and ignore your existence when you're shooting them" to "you'll never make it five steps out of the base before you get killed with a headshot from halfway across the map".\n3. Vehicle maps aren't yet optimized. Most of them are extremely large, taking a long time to traverse. The land vehicles have some handling issues, and getting from one side of the map to the other takes a while on foot, due to the lack of a translocator or hoverboard kind of mechanic to help speed things along.\n\nNone of my nitpicks are actual show stoppers, if you're an Unreal Tournament fan (especially the underrated UT3, which is unsurprising given Toxikk's use of the engine), you'll feel right at home in this game that seems to take the tenets of the UT series (clearly its inspiration) and give it an overhaul in all the right places. I look forward to the forthcoming content and system optimizations, but even with its handful of maps and modifiers, it's worth the asking price - especially if you're looking for a game that supports LAN play.","September 22, 2015","true","3.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Because in current state, it is very unclear when it is comming out and how will the game look like in the end.

As far as the player base is concerned, go check it out on steamcharts.\n\nIf you are deciding between Toxikk and Reflex, GET REFLEX. I'd recommend reflex over toxikk every single time.

As the game's description outlines, it plays much closer to older games like Quake or Unreal Tournament (incorporating things such as map placement of weapons as opposed to preset loadouts and non-regenerating health) and ends up being a refreshing change of pace from what you get with a lot of online shooters these days. However, considering there's only one map and the weapon balance/map placement is still being worked out I'd probably recommend people to wait for a couple updates just to have a bit of variety and not get burned out on playing it before the game's at its full potential. Regardless though, the core gameplay is entertaining and it seems like there's a lot of promise in this for anyone that just wants an Unreal Tournament-style game to get into so it may still be worth checking out if only to see the solid foundation the developers have laid.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe they'll call it something else by the time it officially releases; otherwise you might want to boot up some eroge like Sakura Angels or a valley girl simulator - such as the critically acclaimed Barbie Dreamhouse Party - before jumping on here and save yourself the embarrassment of your friends seeing you playing something that sounds and looks like a bad Xbox Live gamertag.","January 23, 2015","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Do you like old arena shooters and think, "They just don't make them like they used to!"? Then give Toxikk a try!\n\nStill in very early access as of this review, Toxikk is a pretty damn solid arena shooter in the stylings of Unreal Tournament and Quake, and celebrates itself as one with all the polish of a next-generation game. It prioritizes the importance of a responsive, enjoyable gunplay and does it in spades, with a very fun arsenal of weapons, each with their own functions and purpose. The balancing is overall handled very solidly, and does enough to not just clone the arsenals of it's source materials and be unique in that regard.\n\nIt's also a very visually good-looking game so far. Again, very early access, but they really make some good-looking character models and environments that are not only bright and colorful, but look really fantastic amid all the havoc.\n\nIf I had to be critical about something, it'd be that the game does celebrate the late 90's/early 2000's era of arena shooters, but it makes me think more of something like Unreal Tournament 3 as opposed to the original of 1999. Maybe it's just the modern aesthetic, and in some ways this is to it's benefit, but I do feel it tries too hard the style of something like UT99, but being much closer to UT3 in terms of style and aesthetic.\n\nRegardless of my minor nitpicks, this game is definitely worth a look if you're a shooter guru looking for something new to try. Updates come out fairly regularly, and they're definitely doing a good job so far with the game's quality.","January 4","true","3.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Lobby-based games kinda killed server-lurking, and Toxikk requires some server-lurking to see it shine. Get a full 8v8 match with real people, and it turns into a freakin' gem.\n\nIt's still got some rough edges, and if you're expecting something with "modern weapon" values, you're best served to look elsewhere. Toxikk is tooled around spamming rockets, bullets, and not blinking for five minutes at a time. You'll probably see a lot of complaining about balance--but any player that remembers playing UT '99 when it was new will tell you that's a load. You'll see rockets, grenades, energy beams, shotgun blasts... and it's a riot. I nearly had an aneurism when I first read some of the threads cropping up about the rockets being OP--back in the day, you didn't get to tank three hits, you gibbed.\n\nMy only real complaint so far is limited to the Raven starting pistol. Don't bother with it--unlike the Enforcer of UT fame, the Raven is essentially there to keep heads from popping around a corner in time for you to snag a real weapon pickup; which is disappointing. Entire strategies existed for single and dual Enforcers, and I'd like to see the same come into this as well.\n\nFor an early access title, it's rather well assembled. The maps are pretty and hectic, with natural hotspots that gravitate players so you spend more time shooting and less time running, the weapons are cathartic and satisfying, and the play itself is quite satisfying when you rustle up three spare warm bodies.","April 26","true","8.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

Weapons feel great and the devs are taking weapon balance as their top priority, which is more than i can say for others.  Yes YOU Bungie.\n\nPerformance wise it runs perfectly fine on my middle-tier PC on around medium settings while still looking really damn nice. Bugs? I haven't encountered any. NONE.  Bots are included and function perfectly for those who want them.\n\nThe only con I can think of is that there is only one DM/TDM map at the time of writing.

This game needs to make it to the top of the competitive shooters. 10/10","January 23, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Without the basic movements ( dodge, double jump, walljump, strafe / feints ) you will be an easy kill. Don't blame the game when the fault is ONLY yours.\n\nOtherwise, cod and the rest of crap shooters with bad netcode, balances, and stuff ( sold as complete games when they're not ) is the way for easy wins.

This is true continuation of UT style (and not unintentional, obviously - lots of direct hints there, like the infamous Deck 16 map from original UT, which has been Deck 17 in UT2004 and simply Deck (18?) in UT3 is now Dekk 19 in Toxikk - and what a Dekk it is! It is probably even better than the original, which is barely possible). This is what we've been expecting (and didn't get) from UT3. It’s finally here!\n\nBut most important is that even if one disregards the whole UT franchise thing, Toxikk is a very good looking and very well performing (even at this pre-release stage) game, which is very fun to play. What more can you ask for?\n\nWell, perhaps a bit more content, but more on that later.\n\nJust like UT, there are several game types, a variety of nice weapons which are fun to use and all have alternative fire modes, a vehicles with different specializations (including ground and aerial vehicles) and some with external seats for shooters besides driver. And the trademark “more moderate than Q3 but still faster than CoD/CS” game pace which I’ve been missing so much since UT2004.\n\nBesides that, the visuals in the game are stunning. Everything looks beautiful and professionally designed - weapons and projectiles, vehicles, maps (hell, Dekk maps is a work of art). The virtual world of Toxikk is a pleasure to be in even if you get your butt kicked by other players :-)\n\nSo again, I’m very happy with this game and I couldn’t recommend it more.\n\nRegarding the content though: the sole notable downside of Toxikk is the lack of maps. There are just a handful at the moment, and only one that has vehicles (Twin Peaks).\n\nAlso somewhat notable is lack of vehicles (there's scorpion cross hellbender with UT3 style eject+self-destruct (which is total fun) but hellbender style weaponry, there's a raptor cross cicada thing, and there's some manta-like hover tank, but that's it - no tanks or other slow heavy vehicles) and game types (I know Last Man Standing is soon to come, along with some Duel whatever it is - but no Assault, which is a pity - it was a true highlight of UT, and most sad - no Onslaught, which is a best game type and true highlight of UT2004 IMO).\n\nBut I expect more content to be there at the release and some more to arrive later - as DLCs perhaps, and of course some third party content from workshop. There are already some third-party maps in the workshop, and they are very good (an absolutely amazing version of Grendelkeep for Toxikk, a very stylishly Borderlands like looking Novus map, and a smaller space massacre FusionKKore map, which is clearly inspired by UT'99 DM-Fractal - well, not directly but by it’s UT2004 version DM-Gael, which author did mention in comments). So I’m not getting any points off Toxikk for that, because I expect this issue to go away eventually.\n\nAnd thus final verdict is - 10/10. Get it. Now. The 4-pack.\n","March 27","true","36.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'll try to keep this short; if you like Arena FPS games, then this is a safe purchase. The controlls are tight, weapons feel great and are a lot of fun to shoot, and graphics and sounds are top of the line.\n\nTons of great options and customisation, but sadly not when you are in game. And for those who want the real oldschool look may have to change a few things in a config file. I have encountered one major bug, and thats the gamecrash if you click and move your mouse a lot befor the serverlist has loaded up completly. But nothing more then that. It runs at 220 fps on my GTX 980 and seems to be very well optimised, and sets a good standard for early access games.\n\nThere is only one map at the moment (luckily a very good one), and there is some weapon balancing to be made for sure. Yes the rocketlauncher is silly and way to easy to get in such a tight map. But other then that, flawless! 10/10!!!\nNew maps, modes and weapons every 2-4 weeks according to the roadmap(link below), and i can't wait to see what else they have in store for this game!\n\nBest FPS i have played in a good long while.\n\nRoadmap:\nhttp://forum.toxikk.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=993","January 26, 2015","true","33.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

I say Ironically because in my opinion this game is better than the last few Unreal Tournament games. This game runs about 30-40fps on my R9-m290x, depending on the  map milage varies. The texture detail is nice, what you would come to expect from a AAA UT release.\n\nGame play is fun, it plays just like the original UT, with a few improvements that I think add a lot to the game.  Weapons feel a lot like they Did from UT, They look similar and function pretty much the same way they did. You're going to find yourself picking one up and say this is the Plasma Rifle. Some weapons vary a little, in the alternate fire modes, but they will feel familiar.\n\nOne of the little Improvements they made is after you kill an enemy they drop a health pack. What a simple reward for killing someone, it really prolongs the carnage. The health pack is available for anyone to pick up so if you are in the right spot at the right time you can grab that health pack after someone else’s kill, however the reverse is also true, wait too long and someone else will get it.\n\n\nI think that the bot ai might be a have a steep learning curve, as on the easy setting (ridiculous ) they will literally walk by you and not even notice that you're there.Compared to that to higher difficulty and you see situations where Ai will mop you up pretty easily. This could just be my lack of experience with the game, but it seems that in order to get off the higher difficulty you're going to have to die a lot.\n\nOne of the things I can’t get over is just how much fun this game is to play. I have said it before but this game just is so much like the original UT the only way to get much closer is to Remake the Original using today's Graphics. The whole game just is familiar if you have played the original UT, the game play should just come to you naturally. I have also said that I think this is a lot better than Epic’s Newer UT, and I meant it  The game just has captured the core of what a Deathmatch FPS should be and ran with  it.\n\nRight now there are several game modes, including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, which are blood lust, Squad assault, and Cell capture, Read Deathmatch, team deathmatch, and CTF. Nothing special to note here other than they do have some vehicles in the game.They have put in a nice scoring system, for every kill you get you get x points, for and for every double kill, killing spree or whatever you may have gotten you get additional points. In capture the cell games a cell capture gets you points, so it might be possible to win the game just on the number of points.\n\nFinal thoughts.\nMore people need to buy this game and get in the online mode, just because the online play looks to be a little slow right now. That is just do to a total lack of players right now though. Buy this game and you wont regret it I promise.","May 17, 2015","true","6.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"Frag like it's 1999."\n\nBut with some nice nouanced twists and additions to the old formula.\n\nMovement feels just like the classics (UT, Q3A). Some tweaking to the mouse settings and veterans feel at home within a handful of botmatches.\n\nThe first map might be a bit small, although I feel for 8 people its just right. In my view it can absolutely compete with the old classic standarts. Actually I absolutely love how contorted it is and how fighting places are spread both horizontally and vertically across the map. Very good design.\n\nWhat's toally new to the classic formula is the cloaking. By a press of Q you become transparent, which can help you get away from hairy situations. But it has a well balanced reload time and limit of uses. It's a nice tactical element.\n\nLast but not least, this is actually a beta status early access release in the good old way, not a prototypic alpha that's gonna crash every 5 seconds. What is there is rock solid and by todays standarts absolutely release worthy as far as stability goes.\n\nBest 15€ (that was the pre-order price) I have ever invested into a game.

I think my biggest issue was thinking that i was in a flying vehicle when it was actually a hover vehicle.\n\nThe game play is almost reminescent of Halo serious in the bigger map.\n\nThe smaller maps are a closer game play to Quake, but different enough to stand on its own.\n\nAll guns have 2 firing modes beside the sniper, which is replaced with a scope. This makes for interesting mechanics, along with the ability to fake death and go invisible. These tools help you get by the noobs and show your dominance. Any veteran player will be able to quickly realise this though, and will wipe you out.\n\nThe controls are responsive and fluid. My biggest gripe was the Mouse Acceleration that is on by default, but can be disabled easily in the options.\n\nAnother down fall is the TAB button opens the console, and F1 opens the scored board. I think this is a default UE4 thing, and it should be changed.","February 18, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Can be quite hard as a beginner but crazy rewarding as you get better)\n6. LAN play?\n7. Great optimization?\n8. Early access which is only missing some maps, weapons and such? (Only found one bug as of yet)\n\nIf you could answer yes to any of these questions (mostly 1, 2 and 5) then yes.

They were right! The feel of this game is great, the movement is excellent and the graphics are spectacular. If I had to compare this movement to anything it would be UT3, double jump and dodge are here. My few complaints will (hopefully) be addressed as this is an early access game. Spec mode is pretty bare bones, I can't figure out how (if you can) talk while in game or find out who exactly I'm spectating unless I follow the kill messages. One map is disappointing esecially when you are basically paying for a beta BUT the devs said the will be adding more before playtest is over.

However, i was pleasantly surprised at how good it actually is (and could be) once more updates are released. This game is much further ahead than many other early access games and is in a very playable state, even if there is only 1 map right now.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to UT2004, while fans of Quake will find a lot to like here, it is quite different and it's not quite as 'hardcore', meaning it's a lot easier for newcomers to jump in and start fragging. Do i recommend this game right now? Yes i do, however the content is low right now so it also wouldn't be a bad idea to wait for the February updates, when a few new game modes and maps will be added.\n\nI have a great feeling about this game, with a few balance changes and the extra content (which is due very soon), this could be one heck of a game for arena fps fans.","January 26, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I know it's early access but I still paid for the game give me at least 3 maps.\n-The lens flare on the lights is distracting\n-Map hitboxs are inconsistent\n\nTHE CEREBUS - Let me start by saying that this is the reason I stopped playing. The Cerebus is a rocket launcher which you can pick up near the center of the map. It's an OP weapon which almost everyone uses. People would rather not use skill and instead use this OP weapon and think they're good because they're getting loads of kills. YOU CAN NOT USE ANT OTHER WEAPON BECAUSE THE CEREBUS IS BETTER. The damage of the weapon isn't the problem It's the firing rate of it. You can't escape it and it just ruins the game and until they tweak the weapon I'm not playing online because I'd rather use a veriaty of guns.\n\nOverall the games great but maybe don't buy it yet...

It feels like a mix of quake, unreal championship, and Halo; but done very poorly. It's not balance or robust enough to play competitively, yet not big enough or have enough content to be played for fun. It's awkwardly trying to be something it can't with content (or multiplayer community) it doesn't have and an appeal to a market that wanted it so badly, just done right. Much like Sim City (5) syndrome; It's a let down that teases you until purchase with it's promises and pretty pictures.

The gunplay is satisfying and every weapon feels good to use, even though some of them are highly unbalanced at the current moment (looking at you Cerberus).\n\nThe graphics are great aswell as the artstyle, really fits the game.\n\nSo far there is only one map available which is a bummer but it's Alpha/Beta/Early Access/Whatever-you-want-to-call so it's not too much of a hassle. The map layout is good with some open areas and a lot of chokes and close corners that "enforces" CQC, kinda wish they would add a larger map aswell so we would have a bit more variety.\n\nTo sum it up:\nPros:\n- Great and clutch controls\n- Satisfying gun-play\n- Good graphics\n- A bit of fresh air from the current trend of modern military shooters\n- Brings back memories of the good old days of Arena FPS's\n- Good hitboxes and netcode (atleast what I've experienced)\n\nCons:\n- Only one map, will be fixed eventually.\n- Unbalanced guns\n- Seems to be a bug that when you spawn your gun doesn't pop up immedietly meaning you are defenseless for a few seconds (might be server lag?)\n- To remove mouse acceleration completely you have to edit .ini files.\n","January 24, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I suck as much now as I did then and I love it! I'm running this game on high settings on a 4 year old ASUS ROG G73JH and it's smooth as butter with the framerate. This is going to be a great way to relieve some stress in-between other games and just unwind, but most of all, for early access, it's functional on launch day. Albeit, it's one map, but 3 game modes currently and much more to come. Worth the purchase and worth the wait.","January 22, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fun to pick up and play, even for a casual game.

What I played, I really loved. However, that's at around 18-20 fps. I know it's not me, as I just got done playing Crysis 3 at a steady 60 fps with everything on 'high.' It may be because I have an AMD Radeon card. I'm not going to fault the game for this as it is Early Access and it just came out. I'm also getting a bug where the options menu hangs everytime I apply the option. I can keep selecting ''apply,' but it won't go away, forcing me to manually close the game.\n\nThe game plays fantastic. Currently only one map, but the game feels fantastic. I'll give it a cautious recommendation and hope that it gets updated very soon.\n\nEDIT: The game seems to be locked at 17 fps for me. This is...odd. I get 30fps at the splash screens.

I have been eagerly waiting for this game to be released since I saw the Debut Trailer back in August. I see that the game is released and quickly pick it up to see if it was going to live up to my hype over the past few months, and to be honest, I am not disappointed. The game is very smooth, the graphics are very well done, the movement is fliud, the guns are fun to use, neat character customization, leaderboards, gameplay is a load of fun, the list can go on for miles.\n\nThe only negatives I can even try to come up with right now is the slight gun balance issue, and the lack of more maps, which i'm sure will be dealt with soon as those aren't very big issues and its all a part of the game development.\n\nThis game also keeps the skill based gameplay from Quake and Unreal Tournament, yet still allows for anyone to enjoy this game, even against bots.\n\nSo a quick summary of the Pros and Cons of the game.\n\nPros\n+ Very smooth game to run\n+ Graphics are outstanding\n+ Very fluid movement\n+ Guns are enjoyable to use\n+ Character customization\n+ Leaderboards\n+ Gameplay is addicting\n+ No health regeneration\n+ A reasonable price\n+ No buying weapons or Leveling (You must find your weapons on the map)\n+ Just a quality game in general\n\nCons\n- Slight gun balance issue\n- Limited map selection\n\n\nVerdict\n\n9/10\n\nI have to give it a 9 out of 10, alongside the great gameplay and graphics, it also has a nostalgic feel to it due to playing Quake and Unreal Tournament for hours on end many years back.

Toxikk seems to want to be a small niche shooter for those gamers who want to enjoy a arcade/arena shooter, it runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and plays quite well. The speed seems to feel faster and more intended compared to UT3 which is a blessing but as you can tell by any screenshot it feels very much alike in terms of design. Toxikk seems to copy the atmosphere of UT3 which can feel kinda wierd with how simple and clean arena shooters are meant to look, more of an opinion, but they certainly could have picked a more vibrant map to showcase the game with then the one in Hong Kong, which can feel very much like Shangri La off UT3.\n\nNow the movement and fluidity of the game feels overall very good as it should be. I spend a few matches alone just dodging in and out of areas. And the guns used in our single map seem to work really damn well. The guns so far implemented are the...\nRaven (Handgun with an alternate fire burst of 3-4 rounds EXTREAMLY like UT3),\nBullcraft (Shotgun with a great alternate fire with a pretty beefy blast radius somewhat feels like a flack cannon), Violator (Assult machine gun with a canon style launch alternate fire kinda like flack guns alternate),\nFalcon (Simple sniper rifle with nice looks but wish it was a lightning gun),\nStingray (Acts like a much quicker link gun with a shock rifle type alternate fire),\nDragoneer (Flame through that does quite good in close quarters usually I would think these would suck in arena fps),\nCerberus (Rocket launcher, unfortunately doesn't fire more then one rocket with alternate).\n\nWeapons seem pretty good so far and there alternate fire is very well done.\n\nThe developers might have a pretty good flushed out game on their hands that really has released at a good time. A lot of arena shooters are in development and the only big one thats open source is far from completion on the new UE4. If players continue to recieve weekly or biweekly updates on maps and they are flushed out and don't feel sammy there will be great success. Keep doin what you're doin devs. I hope to see that one map in the preview with snow and a mountain/lake soon! Show us players other gametypes that we could put those weapons to use with, looks good.","January 22, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortris/recommended/324810/","fortris","Pasp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortris/","460 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nREVIEW WILL BE UPDATED AS GAME PROGRESSES\n\nIf you don't want to read a long review, then here's an easy choice:\n\nIf you LOVED UT2004 (or the Unreal Tournament series in general) and want to support/play a very early version of what could be a phenominal game buy it for the cheaper price now.\n\nIf you always preferred Quake over Unreal Tournament, or don't want to buy a unfinished game, don't puchase this.\n\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n\nFor a more IN DEPTH review, here are my thoughts so far.\n\n-Pros\n\nFantastic movement system, you can set how fast your double taps dodge or even use another key entirely to dodge in the position you're moving, which is excellent for newer players (or baddies like me).\n\nWeapons actually feel varied, and a lot actually adapt to team colors when picked up (like the stingray, instead of the traditional teal shots they will change to a darker blue for the blue team or a red for the red team) which is a nice touch.\n\nGame looks fantastic, running on the Unreal 3 engine (sadly not 4, but I supposed it's been in development for a long time) and still looks great. Plenty of graphical settings to tweak, which is expected of a PC only game.\n\nIs actually FUN to play, one of the most important aspects of a game period. It's entertaining and if you've loved Unreal Tournament you will most likely love this.\n\n-Cons\n\nIt is early access. At the time of writing there is only one map, and two modes. Now has two maps and three modes, deathmatch, team deathmatch and CTF. Know what you're getting into and realize the possibility (not assuming anything, just stating it could happen) the devs abandon the game similar to other early access titles. Only buy this if you trust that the devs will deliver on their plans.\n\nBalance is off right now, again it is early and this will most likely be sorted out, but it's worth noting that the cerberus is a one hit on fresh spawns and fires far too quickly, while the starting pistol is essentially worthless. While it's worth noting the starting pistol should be BAD, this is almost unusable. Game has been properly balanced, weapons all feel fair as of now.\n\nLeveling system is, well, superfluous. It doesn't do anything at the moment, it's incredibly easy to level up (even bots give levels) and the numebers go rediculously high (I think I'm level 670 at the moment?). I don't understand why a system that is completely unneeded or unused is in the current build, but this is basically nitpicking since it doesn't do anything.\n\n\nSo overall, if you trust the devs to finish the game and want to play it now, it's definitely worth the $19 (on sale for $17 at time of writing). I'll try to keep this post updated, but honestly I'm a pretty forgetful person. Solid recommendation as of now.\n\nEDIT: I will strike out any outdated info and add notes stating what changed.","January 26, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Toxikk seems to want to be a small niche shooter for those gamers who want to enjoy a arcade/arena shooter, it runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and plays quite well. The speed seems to feel faster and more intended compared to UT3 which is a blessing but as you can tell by any screenshot it feels very much alike in terms of design.

HOWEVER, additional content should come in pretty quickly since a lot of the content shown in the trailer is not there yet, meaning it's probably almost ready to be added to the official build. On top of that, the core gameplay is 99% done I think, the 1% left being the details they MIGHT change according to user feedback, so IF I'm right and the core gameplay is mostly done, that means the focus will be on adding content to the game (even maybe additional gameplay).\n\n>EARLY ACCESS DETAILS<\n----------------------------\n\nOMG. That's what I think of this game. I never felt such a tension since I played UT2k4. Actually the whole game is a love letter to UT2k4 with modern graphics and a whole new set of weapons (it still have classics projectile but powerful weapons, explosive-type weapons, widespread weapons and charged weapons but there is many fun and new primaryand secondary fire modes. Cause yeah, the game features two fire modes, something introduced by the Unreal serie and used almost nowhere else (unfortunately IMHO) and here it goes.\n\nIt's exactly what I excpected from UT3, an evolution of UT2k4, with better graphics, a few twist of its own, and a competitive gameplay.\n\nIn short there are now 2 main "competitors" that aren't really in competition. Reflex and Toxikk. BUt as I said they do not compete, Toxikk, is UT-like arena shooter where Reflex is a lot more akin to Quake ;) Still you should own both at some point (wait a bit for Reflex it's not that much polished as of now).\n\nLast but not least, the game features a SDK. I didn't download it, but on the website they say that every registered player have access to it for free, so I guess it might be a Steam tool or a download on Toxikk website ! This SDK will allow players to create skins, maps and so on, so I guess this so on could possibly mean developing your own mod and mutators like in UT2k4 (hell, the match creation screen even has a category mutator with no mutator as of now, but still it exists so my prediction is 90% accurate).","January 24, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's as the trailer says: no reloading, no cover system, no classes.\n\nMy first geniune FPS I've ever played was Goldeneye 007 for the N64. The game is a classic and didn't have so many FPS standards we're so used to today. TOXIKK manages to bring the FPS genre back to basics, gameplay found more typical in '90s shooters a la Unreal Tournament and Doom, but in a way that's refreshing and just purely fun for this current decade.\n\nMy only gripe is that no one seems to play online compared to other FPS games. I might recommend making this game free-to-play to bring in more players, but that could cheapen the quality of this game. I'm hoping with the recent release of DOOM that arena shooters such as TOXIKK get more popular.\n\nOverall, this game is quite good for Early Access and I'm quite excited to see where the game goes from here.","May 18","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/324810/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game is the Rocket Launcher is, in it's current iteration, too overpowered in narrow maps. It's the old quake rocket launcher, with quake damage and speed. For maps with small corridors and twisty turny multilevel playing fields this is just basically like handing murder-onna-stick to the capable players in the arena.\n\nThat's the bad.\n\nThe good? Where do I start...\n\nIt's beautiful. All the other weapons handle perfectly, it's like someone walked back to the late 1990's, found Unreal Tournament, blew the dust off, cradled it lovingly in their embrace, and went "It's okay, you're safe now, modern game developers might have forgotten the concept of the pure deathmatch shooter, but we won't forget. We will make you shine, we will make you stand tall once more."\n\nAnd they did.\n\nOh god, they did. Toxikk is effectively what happens when you pull Unreal Tournament out of the 1990's, put it in the hands of developers who loved, absolutely loved Unreal Tournament, and then decided to take all that was good about the game, and make it -better-. The graphics, beautiful. The sound, meaty. The gameplay, tight. The effects, lush. The core levelling concept - pitch perfect. Everything about this game save the one thing I mentioned right at the outset is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.\n\nWhat we've got here, is a beginning, and if the devs keep up the good work from this point on, we're going to see an explosion, a return of the FPS arena shooter on the PC in a big way. This is worthy of your time, and your money, and even with the one map it runs right now, it's glorious. Get it.

It is absolute garbage. My friends and I bought the game in a four pack pre-release and the dev couldn't even get their forums working properly. People would IM me asking me to play the game with them and I had no way to respond because the option simply wasn't there.  Then once the game actually opened  a year or more later it was so dull no one wanted to play it. This was a complete waste of time and money for me.

It is a competent arena style shooter with amazing graphics, a variety of weapons with two different fire modes each and is generally just entertaining. The downside, as many people have already stated is the playerbase. I for one can play a round with bots once in a while and get enjoyment out of it, but for a multiplayer centric game it is pretty much lacking the most basic ressource: active players. It is sad and certainally not the games fault but this is just a too important negative factor to recommend this game in general. If you don't care too much about that sinceyou want to play it with a group of friends or just bots, pick it up","January 14","false","3.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

It is highly polished, the gameplay works almost flawless.\nI'm just as much hyped as I've been when UT2003 came out. Toxikk is a bomb of a game.\nToday, the newest update has been released, featuring the vehicular mode capture the cell (basically vCTF but with little interesting twists!) and a new map.\nSo far the beta only has two maps but I've been playing them for nearly 20hours total. Roughly 15hours on just the first map..\nThe game is highly addicting and fun. That is not only my opinion but the opinion of dozens of players in the game chat. The players are friendly and fair (so far). I could not find any harassment yet. I could always find a server with players. Even though it's just a test version with (as of writing this) 2 maps.\nOh did I mention the graphics look gorgeous.........?\n\nI really love what Reakktor Studios have done with this. In my opinion it sets the newest milestone for arena fps!\nWith more maps coming, this game will beat everything comparable out there, hands down. I don't even care about the newest UT in the making since they don't even seem to know what they're doing and Toxikk already sets the bar really high!\n\nSkill wins here, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t luck with unlocked perks and upgrades...\nIf you want to compete your skill.

But the major issue is the developers' incomprehensible behavior.\n\nMy biggest concern relates to the maps. I purchased the game in March this year and since that time they managed to release just a SINGLE deathmatch map (Ganesha) - which was in fact using the same props and assests like one of the previous two (Artifact). I don't count the VCTF maps (as far as i know there are two of them), because I can't recall that fragging in 1999 was involving vehicles - so yes, I don't give a damn for this mode. Why on Earth haven't they provide a "blockout" state or "shell" maps (like Reflex or UT4 did)? If not why haven't they released the map editor for the game? The community would fill the gap quickly enough and that could bring back the community to a certain degree! Instead, they're pulling the wool over our eyes with the pompously announced reskin of UT2k4 Deck17 - something that would be done long enough, if the map editor was released. And btw, it's been nearly month and a half since that announcement -- where the hell is the "DEKK"? Is the game still about to be release on 22nd of January 2016? Because with the current pace it's not going to come out in January 2017...\n\nAnd don't try to sugar-coat it with the Early Access mantra. It's as early as it was 7 months ago and it's not getting more complete in anyway. And since I've paid a full price for it I do have a right complain.\n\nI have a hope that the developers behavior can be explained by a sheer incompetence... But the slow pace of development arouses my suspicions that there might be something much more ominous going on behind the scenes. So far, Toxikk is my biggest disappointment of 2015.\nOriginally posted by MeowMeowFuzzyface:Originally posted by rocKit:And don't try to sugar-coat it with the Early Access mantra. It's as early as it was 7 months ago and it's not getting more complete in anyway.This is what happens when the devs have your money already.  I bought Toxikk to support people still developing AFPS games, but now I'm starting to have doubts.  They were promising the SDK when I bought the game in June and 5 months later I haven't seen any indication of it actually coming.  In that time I saw one new map and some minor netcode and balance patches.  The game has stagnated because they take ages to release maps.  I don't blame anyone for getting bored after playing the same maps over and over again.\n\nI think the devs did an amazing job up until v0.8 or so.  They said they are putting some things into the final version that they can't reveal, and that's the reason for such slow development.  We will see.\n\nFor now, I've uninstalled the game.  There's no one playing, there's no patches, there's no new maps, and there's no SDK.  Even on the few Friday frag fests that I was able to attend, we had 3 or 4 players max.\n\nI really hope they have something in the works that will justify the slow progress.  I have no way of knowing their budget, but I can't imagine it's enough to keep development going for another full year.  I still praise the quality of the game and the competent development, but I'm starting to feel like it was a poor decision to purchase it at this point.\n\nAs to your suspicions about the developers, I don't think they're bad people.  The quality of the game tells me that they were genuine about their project.  That being said, I suspect development did slow down after they got so many backers and early access buyers.  Does it make sense to keep putting all your money into developing a game after it has sold already?  We've put our faith into them by buying the alpha, so now let's see if this developer can deliver on their promises.  In retrospect, I do think they've made a few poor choices, but there's nothing that makes me think they're disingenuous (yet).","May 11, 2015","false","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most of the rounds I've played in this game are so called "Boot Camp"-games with bots. It's sad. Especially when it's an awesome game like this one.\n\nI know it's in early access and people don't wanna buy it just because of that. But hear me out: Even in early access, this is hands down one of the best FPS-games I have ever played. Now, that could be because I like Quake-ish, fast paced and not too complicated games that doesn't rely too much on intricate strategies, but rely more on direct combat strategy and good aim.\n\nThe Options-menu in this game is also very well implemented. Detailed mouse settings also include in this game, which is essential in a game like this.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you like old school shooters like Quake and UT, you have to try this game. It's still early access, I know, but you still won't regret it. Because they are constantly working on it.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI was optimistic about TOXIKK. But not so much anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good game. I don't have anything against the game itself. But the fact that no one ever plays this game online, except for some very few instances, made me ask Steam Support for a refund sadly. I didn't get it though, considering I've had it for too long and played it too much.\n\nSo I'm changing my mind about the review. It's a great game thus far, but I don't recommend buying this game. At least not yet. It lacks community.","May 21, 2015","false","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

But the major issue is the developers' incomprehensible behavior.\n\nMy biggest concern relates to the maps. I purchased the game in March this year and since that time they managed to release just a SINGLE deathmatch map (Ganesha) - which was in fact using the same props and assests like one of the previous two (Artifact). I don't count the VCTF maps (as far as i know there are two of them), because I can't recall that fragging in 1999 was involving vehicles - so yes, I don't give a damn for this mode. Why on Earth haven't they provide a "blockout" state or "shell" maps (like Reflex or UT4 did)? If not why haven't they released the map editor for the game? The community would fill the gap quickly enough and that could bring back the community to a certain degree! Instead, they're pulling the wool over our eyes with the pompously announced reskin of UT2k4 Deck17 - something that would be done long enough, if the map editor was released. And btw, it's been nearly month and a half since that announcement -- where the hell is the "DEKK"? Is the game still about to be release on 22nd of January 2016? Because with the current pace it's not going to come out in January 2017...\n\nAnd don't try to sugar-coat it with the Early Access mantra. It's as early as it was 7 months ago and it's not getting more complete in anyway. And since I've paid a full price for it I do have a right complain.\n\nI have a hope that the developers behavior can be explained by a sheer incompetence... But the slow pace of development arouses my suspicions that there might be something much more ominous going on behind the scenes. So far, Toxikk is my biggest disappointment of 2015.\nOriginally posted by MeowMeowFuzzyface:Originally posted by rocKit:And don't try to sugar-coat it with the Early Access mantra. It's as early as it was 7 months ago and it's not getting more complete in anyway.This is what happens when the devs have your money already.  I bought Toxikk to support people still developing AFPS games, but now I'm starting to have doubts.  They were promising the SDK when I bought the game in June and 5 months later I haven't seen any indication of it actually coming.  In that time I saw one new map and some minor netcode and balance patches.  The game has stagnated because they take ages to release maps.  I don't blame anyone for getting bored after playing the same maps over and over again.\n\nI think the devs did an amazing job up until v0.8 or so.  They said they are putting some things into the final version that they can't reveal, and that's the reason for such slow development.  We will see.\n\nFor now, I've uninstalled the game.  There's no one playing, there's no patches, there's no new maps, and there's no SDK.  Even on the few Friday frag fests that I was able to attend, we had 3 or 4 players max.\n\nI really hope they have something in the works that will justify the slow progress.  I have no way of knowing their budget, but I can't imagine it's enough to keep development going for another full year.  I still praise the quality of the game and the competent development, but I'm starting to feel like it was a poor decision to purchase it at this point.\n\nAs to your suspicions about the developers, I don't think they're bad people.  The quality of the game tells me that they were genuine about their project.  That being said, I suspect development did slow down after they got so many backers and early access buyers.  Does it make sense to keep putting all your money into developing a game after it has sold already?  We've put our faith into them by buying the alpha, so now let's see if this developer can deliver on their promises.  In retrospect, I do think they've made a few poor choices, but there's nothing that makes me think they're disingenuous (yet).","May 11, 2015","false","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most of the rounds I've played in this game are so called "Boot Camp"-games with bots. It's sad. Especially when it's an awesome game like this one.\n\nI know it's in early access and people don't wanna buy it just because of that. But hear me out: Even in early access, this is hands down one of the best FPS-games I have ever played. Now, that could be because I like Quake-ish, fast paced and not too complicated games that doesn't rely too much on intricate strategies, but rely more on direct combat strategy and good aim.\n\nThe Options-menu in this game is also very well implemented. Detailed mouse settings also include in this game, which is essential in a game like this.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you like old school shooters like Quake and UT, you have to try this game. It's still early access, I know, but you still won't regret it. Because they are constantly working on it.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI was optimistic about TOXIKK. But not so much anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good game. I don't have anything against the game itself. But the fact that no one ever plays this game online, except for some very few instances, made me ask Steam Support for a refund sadly. I didn't get it though, considering I've had it for too long and played it too much.\n\nSo I'm changing my mind about the review. It's a great game thus far, but I don't recommend buying this game.

It has a feel very similiar to the old Unreal Tournament games, that's for sure.  Sound-wise the game is satisfying and well done - a step up from the old breeds.  Graphics-wise the game is gorgeous but there are some textures errors here and there, but nothing really noticible (you have to look to see them, and it could have been on my end).  The controls are tight, responsive and well produced.  The guns seem to be balanced and offer a good variety of strategy and tactics in order to master the elements for success in this game.  However, despite all the goodness in the deathmatch mode, the capture modes are weak and not fun - the maps are too big and feel lacking in the arena feel.  Overall the deathmatch maps at this point are great, fun, well designed, and balanced.  They are gorgeous as well and feature wonderful and engaging sounds/music.  The team play capture maps, I personally think, are lacking, not fun, and battles are too spread apart.  So far at this stage in the early release there are always good US servers to play on.  Netcode seems to be tight and responsive.  If you are an arena fan, get this game.  Also the developers are responding to the community very well, and very quickly.

But I still wouldn't recommend it, because there is the original out there with way more content.\nIn that regard I feel this review might be a little unfair, because objectivly TOXIKK is not a bad game and is targeted on fans of classic arena shooters, which don't need much innovation in the first place. But since here we have basically none, I don't really see the point of investing into this game.\n\nGorgeous graphicsBeing based on the Unreal Engine, this game looks really great. It surpasses modern standards and runs fluently on halfway decent PCs. I would definetely call this game the best looking arena shooter at this point.\n\nGodly AIAnother thing this game makes good use of from the Unreal Engine is the great AI, which results in very smart behavior of the bots. Even though currently there are barely any multiplayer games going on, as this game is not really popular, it is not a big deal because you can practice just fine with bots and have fun with them.\n\nLack of contentAt this point there are only a couple of maps with just 3 modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and some sort of Capture the "Flag" on bigger maps with vehicles. And apart from that there is really nothing you can do. That is rather poor.\n\nLack of innovationWhile the description of the game claims "fresh ideas", I haven't really found anything that makes this game unique compared to other arena shooters. This is the game's biggest problem. A simple arena shooter is nice, but without something that makes it stand out from the crowd, this game won't get far.\n\nAll in all I don't recommend this game to anybody who is not into arena shooters, since there is nothing special to see here. Arena-FPS fans might consider it, but should wait for more content first.","June 23, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

TOXIKK is an unreal engine game, with that you would think there'd be similarities to other unreal games such as Unreal Tournament, but I felt  that TOXIKK was an exact ripoff of unreal tournament with better graphics and no campaign.

The game itself is a ton of fun, don't get me wrong. Despite what my playtime implies, I haven't had this much fun with a multiplayer shooter in a long time. The problem is that the playerbase is super low. I thought it might have just been a dead time of day, but take a look at the game's activity charts. There's very few people playing this game, and that's a very bad thing for a game meant to be multiplayer-only. I didn't buy a multiplayer-only game just for botmatches.\n\nMaybe this game will get popular once it leaves early access, who knows.

Be prepared for their testosterone-fulled indiscretion and lack of foresight. It's hard to beta test when you don't have fun AND have to pay for it. Thankfully there are good people around if you keep poking about; don't turn down a server because they are using custom content or show 160 ping.\n\nThat being said, the game itself is largely solid. It handles high ping well. I really enjoy the Bullcraft and Dragoneer. Rockets and AR 'nades are one-shots, though, hope that gets patched out. Maps are decent, though very tight and random (need a few more, specifically orderly and/or spacious ones like Dekk and Ganesha IMO). Dekk looks fantastic, whoever worked on remodeling that map needs a bonus and to be told to make a novel map.\n\nI am marking not recommended (for most) because early access + diehard tryhards clearing the only server or two = rough.

It has great visual details to it, sparks, explosions, laser pew pew pews, but I think that's where it stops being a good game.\n\nLet's start with the pros, shall we?:\n\nPros:\nPolished Beta\nVisually amazing\nClassic UT competitive feel\nShows a lot of promise\nDescription of Pros\n\nWhat a great game to first start up and get into. The color choices, graphical additions (explosions, etc), and yes, even down to what they let you set in the settings, this game has it going on. With the vehicle additions, bigger maps, and other promises, I can see this game going far. I'd love to experience all of that in the final expansions to this game's beta and final release. For now, we can expect the devs to slowly roll out what they have to add.\n\nCons:\nTerrible map design on this first map\nThe worst starting pistol ever designed\nSluggish character movement and terrible shift key (It's a mix of a jump run).\nStarting settings are terrible\nUnfair weapon choices (Rocket launcher dependent)\nGameplay seems sacrificed in order to maintain a sense of "hardcore".\nGun pick ups take too long?\nDescription of Cons\n\nNow... Where to begin... Let's start with the horrid map design. I don't know who was in charge of this beauty, but they need to check their work again. The map design feels like a mix of Call of Duty meets Operation Metro from BF4. Extremely tight corners, tunnels leadiing to MAYBE 1 or 2 exits, and really just feels cogested. Extremely focused gameplay on the rocket leads to choke points in that area.\n\nThe pistol deserves it's own paragraph because, I'm telling you, this thing is the ♥♥♥♥♥iest invetion of all time. It's a single shot left click, triple shot right click (Think the glock in CS). The damage is unbelieveable terrible and where it fires comparative to the actual location pointing at seems off to say the least. I don't think this pistol should be in the game due to the fact that when everyone has the laser rifle or rocket launcher, you're stuck spawnin with this sack of ♥♥♥♥ and get instantly killed.\n\nUgh. This game feels SLOW. Against UT2004, this just doesn't feel anywhere close to as fluid, nor do I feel like the shift key helps you in any regard. You slow down to as if you were standing still after using the shift, forcing you to jump, or do something else, such as get killed. If you guys want a fast-paced (T)DM, this isn't the game for you. The mixture of tight hallways, lack of fluid movement, and unfair weapon choices kills it.\n\nI don't know if anyone else noticed this, but the added acceleration in the mouse controls killed a whole round for me. It's WAY too fast. My G502 literally whipped around as if I was on crack trying to aim at people. I can't do it. Had to turn that ♥♥♥♥ off. Why isn't Raw acceleration in the settings?\n\nThe rocket launcher and possibly laser rifle are the only two guns worth using. Really guys? Back in UT2004, almost everything was worth using, even that ♥♥♥♥ing shield if you wanted to ♥♥♥♥ someone off. I'd rather have that shield than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol you gave us. C'mon now.\n\nThis is the most important point, too. They want no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but have sacrificed raw gameplay in order to achieve it. You start out with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon, have to go find the two weapons that are the best, most likely die in the interim, spawn in against some rocket launcher, and continue. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in my eyes. UT2004 at least gave you an AR + Shield combo to start in with. You guys want to frag like 1999? This isn't the way to do it.\n\nMaybe this is jsut me, but the gun pick up time limit seems much, much longer than any UT/Quake game I've ever played. What do you think?\n\n[/rant]\n\nThanks for reading through. I will continually add on to this as I see fit, but for now, I will continue playing when more people get on. Seems pretty dead so far. Deathmatch is just not worth it.","February 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","10","24","2","0"

We got way too hyped for a game that was released as a "beta" way too early with very few features (1 map, etc). It was not ready to be publicly shown.\n\nGo to steamcharts.\n\nBuying a 4-pack of this game makes me hate early access hype. Bad release timing, slow updates and opaque communications from the devs totally lost the core fan base for what is really a niche game. If there were just 1000 consecutive players every day, it would be playable and the devs would be able to get lots of feedback and could mine a lot of gameplay data.\n\nAs it stands today, I'd say it's the game I've most regretted buying. We paid to beta test and I feel stupid for doing so. I still have 1 or two keys for this but nobody cares anymore.\n\nThe most value I had from this is, aside from the first 3 days playing with actual people (which were really fun, tbh) was playing DM or Cell Capture with bots during lunch at work.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what this game will be like in six months.","June 15, 2015","false","11.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

TOXIKK would be highly playable if it wasn't UT3 visually.  But, unfortunately, it is.\n\nPros:\n\n-UT2004 movement.  Not everyone's cup of tea, but definitely mine.  You got your double jumps, wall jumps, slope jumps, jumps and potatoes, jump stew, jump gumbo, etc.  I was operating on UT2004 movement instinct and it translated almost perfectly to this game.\n\n-You can press F to feign death and go ragdoll.  Possibly the most entertaining feature in UT3, and the fact that it's in this game is probably only a byproduct of the game being built on the UT3 UDK demo or something.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Everything else.\n\n-Lack of visual clarity. It suffers from the same lack of visual clarity that made UT3 so fugly.  It's so cluttered and the lighting is way over-the-top, like in UT3.  I can't tell if I'm playing a shooter or attending a rave, with all of the flashy effects and glowing and bloom going on.\n\n-Generic weaponry. It seems like 70% of them are hitscan weaponry that you feel like you just don't have enough room to use in the cramped single little deathmatch map they have.  I'm sure they'll release more deathmatch maps as time goes on, since this is early access, but for now, it's a problem.  They also lack personality, both visually and in function.\n\n-Less of a fresh take on shooters that implements what made old shooters so fun and more of something that takes the physics and movement from UT2004 and puts it in a UT3 knockoff.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Review: Go play UT3 instead, if you're craving a visually muddy shooter that you can press a button to ragdoll your character in.","March 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","1"

All Robots just with different colours, how creative.\n\nThe Music and Sounds as well as the Voiceover are kinda narcotic.\nAnother disadvantage of Toxikk is the Movement. "Running", if you wanna call it like that, jumping and other moves feels like in slowmotion.\n\n\nIf you compare both Games (The positive Aspects)\n\nUnreal Tournament 3:\n\n- 8 Years old\n- Better Graphics (!!!)\n- Better Physix\n- Better Animations\n- Better Voiceacting\n- Better Leveldesign\n- Better AI\n- Better Gameplay\n- Better Soundtrack\n- Better Soundeffects\n- More demanding Achievements\n- More detailed Character design\n- More Levels\n- More Gamemodes\n- Campain Mode\n\n...\n\nTOXIKK:\n\n- has VAC which is good of course.\n- 1 Euro cheaper\n\n\nToxikk is not all bad, but there is no reason to prefer this over UT3.

Free kills for the other team, based on terribe spawning.\n\nAnd if you get a lucky random spawn and start elsewhere?  Chances are, you wont get a weapon, because each weapon pickup has a 15 sec CD on it (the RL has a 30 sec now, because the devs don't understand weapon balance and didn't want to nerf it too hard).  So instead of a fluid game, you have to wait for a CD to finish to get a weapon.  And hope another player doesn't turn up and one shot you while you are waiting.\n\nAnd with that being said, every weapon in the game has the potential to one shot you.  The usual ones apply, for example, the sniper rifle, that will kill you in one (head) shot.  But every weapon can do the same.  The Stingray alt fire works like the shock rifle, but it can headshot as well (♥♥♥♥).  The flamethrower, can be charged up (much like the UT3 bio), but instead of having to lead and time it right, it can be unleashed (it is a fast forward firing projectile that kills anything in its path) to melt anyone instantly.  And the shotgun?  The alt fire is a double barrel, and it will kill you instantly.  It is fun to use, but boring to play against.  All of the weapons combine to make the game dull, because it is simply a case of point and click, instead of dodge and dominate.\n\nDespite the bold claims of this game being a throwback to the 90s, this game is more of a 'we want CoD players!'.  Most of the weapons are based around one shot mechanics, which isn't such a bad thing, the game is very fast paced.  But the 2 seconds after spawning where you can't do ♥♥♥♥ all (pistol cocking animation), coupled with the rubbish spawning and the weapon cooldowns, means you can get multiple kills in a row (every dead player leaves a +20 health pack, simple to survive no?), but once you die, you are so screwed, as you can die 5-6 times afterwards before you get a safe spawn and a weapon.\n\nThis game is great when the RNG suits you, you spawn on the best weapon and get to ♥♥♥♥, but when you die, no matter how good your skills are, you might end up a sitting duck when you spawn, with a guy just waiting for your 2 secs of spawn protection to end (you can't hit back during this) at which point, he gets a very free kill.\n\nThis game might turn out to be okay, but given how bad the weapon balance was on launch, and how bad the devs responded with their first patch, I would say to anyone, wait until this game is finished before you spend money on it.","January 31, 2015","false","154.8"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","0"

However, the chart linked below continues to show that there is really no interest in this game making it a bad buy at this point.\n\nOriginal Review Jan 2015: If you like UT3, you will like this game. Literally the only difference between them is the weapons and the dodge jump. Toxikk is a repackage of the UT demo contained in UDK with only minor gameplay related changes and minor modifications to several models. There is nothing wrong with this, but if you think Toxikk is a polished game you should be impressed by what you can do with almost bone stock UDK content with a very small team.\n\nIf I had to guess, most of the time working on this game was spent on the menus and the leaderboard system. None of this means that the game is bad, but the only map available right now is very cramped, the weapons are not well balanced and the rocket launcher is overpowered to all heck. You can easily dominate a match by focusing on the rockets and timing the armor. But despite all that you can actually have fun with this game and if you want some of the feeling of UT3 mixed with a small amount of UT2004 you will probably enjoy what this game has to offer.\n\nFYI, F is feign death and Q is turn invisible (yes everyone can turn invisible)\n\nIn the end I'm voting "No" on recommending this simply because the game is incomplete. The one map gets boring fast and if you aren't used to arena FPSes, you will die more than you will kill which is frustrating. Give this a bit more time in the fryer and it will be a decent game.\n\nP.S. Thanks trolls for down-voting an honest review.

It's essentially an Unreal Tournament 2004 clone with prettier graphics. The current map is also typical of an UT deathmatch map, featuring tight areas and some sense of vertical height. The map itself is well designed as are the weapon models and the sound effects have quite a bit of impact. Expect powerups such as health vials and armour to be placed strategically, the same strategies of Quake also apply here. Variety of weapons is limited; as you'd expect for a game this early in development but each handles well and are overall quite balanced with the exception of the shotgun and rocket launcher. Most of the weapons are also too similar to those found in UT 2004; to the point where they even share the exact same secondary fire modes.\n\nI'm hopeful for the future of this game but in reality, quite worried that it will play it too safe and not deviate from the already established formula.\n\nIn my opinion, it will take some creative map design and new game modes to separate this game from UT. As an example, there are a lot of things which can be learned from Halo 4 which we've not yet seen on PC. It would be interesting to merge the exotic map design and experimental game modes of H4 with a fast paced old-school competitive shooter like Toxikk. Even the free-to-play Tribes: Ascend was built off being able to predict player movement and splash damage whilst travelling at fast speeds. It would be extremely refreshing and beneficial to this genre to introduce more platformer type mechanics into deathmatch maps.\n\nI hope the developers don't stick to the same design philosophies for other game modes and hope they really try and craft something special.","January 24, 2015","false","3.9"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","24","7","29","3","6"

There is currently only one map available not because they decided to build 10% of a product and ship it as is, but because they want to make sure the weapons are balanced with as few variables as possible before they turn on another slew of already-created, yet-to-be-100%-polished content.

Its a very pretty, pretty game: the lighting and colors are beautiful. The audio is on point, the music just loud enough to hear, but not loud enough to cover whats going on. I enjoy the design style, and i personally quite like the double jump and dodge maneuvers implemented in the gameplay.\n\nI have two issues with the game.\n\nFirstly, I expected more. The trailer had multiple maps, while the release on has one, and a small one at that. As well, I got turned around quite a bit, and I still have trouble locating one of the weapons consistently. The trailer also promised vehicles, of which there are none, and 9 weapons, of which I can count 5 or 6. I understand that this is an Alpha release, but Im just somewhat dissapointed.\n\nMy other issue is with one of the weapons, the Cerberus launcher. To me, it seems like it is too overpowered, or at least, overused. I personally prefer the Violator, especially its grenade launcher. While playing with bots, all of them use the Cerberus to the point of ridiculousness, and the actual servers provided me with too much lag to get a proper approximation of what they were like.\n\nAll of these issues can, and I hope will be, fixed by later patches of the game, and I am excited to see what the future holds for this game.\n\nUPDATE:\nI must say, after playing another match or two, my opinion of the game has vastly improved, on top of my already high opinion. My new favorite weapon, the Stingray, is immensly satisfying to kill with, especially with its secondary fire. I would also like to amend my previous statement about the Cerberus, as now that Ive figured out how to dodge, I can avoid the rockets for the most part and retaliate with the Stingray before they can get off a second shot.\n\nIm a little dissapointed that this map doesnt allow us to use the Falcon very much, as its scoped zoom is almost useless in this close quarters map. As well, i would still have liked to see a couple more weapons, but perhaps on a larger map, as another weapon would make this one feel too cluttered.\n\nWhile playing Squad mode, I quite enjoyed the little markers that would tell you where your teamates recently died, as it made it easier to find the nests of enemies the bots inevitably formed.\n\nI still have some concerns.\nFirstly, the fact that you cannot change settings or options while in game is incredibly frustrating, and lead to me having to quit matches to change my graphics settings far too many times. As well, the framrerate can tank, which is annoying to say the least.\n\nAlso, the lack of weapon names in the controls while changing keybindings frustrated me. Perhaps because of my years playing Quake, I expected to be able to see which weapon is which, so I could map them to keys accordingly, but sadly, this was not the case.\n\nI shall update this review as my experience continues.","January 22, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The one map that we're able to play on right now (Foundation) is a fairly small map, but has well-placed weapons, health packs and so on. The map is also well made to allow for quick movements and clever tactics.\n\nI'm looking forward to the bigger maps with vehicles as they come. I really think this is going to be my next shooter. I've gotten bored of military shooters. Advanced Warfare did a little good with the exosuits, but this game just brings me back to the Halo days a little bit which is what I grew up with.","January 23, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game changed all that. This game orders up a heaping portion of kick@ss with a righteous side of wanton destruction. It puts the pickle back in the bun of your arena burger... I feel like I may have lost my way a bit in this analogy. Bottom line, this game is too good not to support. It really channels the UT2004 vibe and does it even better, in some ways, by being even truer to the series than the series itself stayed. I feel like the most important point to take away here is that time travel exists... because clearly the devs have found a way to go back in time and make sweet love to UT2004 and brought back the love child for all of us to play with... and now we know why I should really stay away from writing reviews on Steam, sorry guys.","January 23, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than release a 0.0001 and expect people to bear with them for an eternal alpha, they have a beta whose biggest changes are balance-related. There is currently only one map available not because they decided to build 10% of a product and ship it as is, but because they want to make sure the weapons are balanced with as few variables as possible before they turn on another slew of already-created, yet-to-be-100%-polished content. They currently plan to have the next massive wave of content released around February 12, following the last of the major weapon balance tweaks.\n\nGreat gameplay, great performance (!), great devs!

The weapon system was slightly unbalanced at first, but after they changed up weapon strengths/spawn times, it has become much more enjoyable. I prefer base loadouts for all players in a FPS; it keeps the playing field level. But when a game allows you to hoard weapons, it can be very frustrating to players trying to find a gun that will stand a chance. This game does not have that problem.\nEverything about this title so far has delivered. It is a no-nonsense fast paced old school shooter with a new age feel. There are no perks or classes.

This is not a game based off of modern combat and using iron sights, this is a twitch game.  If you loved Q2/3 and UT99, this is the game for you.  Not saying it is perfect, and I doubt anything will fully replace UT99 or Q3 for me, but this is, FROM WHAT IS RELEASED RIGHT NOW, a game worthy of carrying the torch for those.\n\nThe game is fast and frantic, fun weapons, starter wep blows, badly, Makes me with for the cheesey machinegun form Q3 or the Enforcer., also I think the Dragoneer blocks vision a bit too much, but overall, from what is complete I have no major complaints.\n\nI am looking forward to more game types coming, as well as the option of starting private servers and that we can contribute content, just like the old days of UT.  Graphics are good, not the best, but good, also while SLI is stablke, it is not utilizing the other card(s), which isn't a huge deal, but I would like to see this detail added/corrected as time goes on.

Now, being an arena shooter, it is extremely fast paced, from the movement to the short, yet brilliant encounters with your foes. forcing you to "FRAG LIKE IT'S 1999".\n\nBeing a fast paced Arena shooter, Toxikk has quite the steep learning curve, and in it's current state, it seems near impossible without having quite the amount of hours, and at the moment, the people who play the game tend to be quite good, as a large majority of them have been playing this type of game since they were young, so don't expect to go in and be the best, cause you won't be.\n\nThere is also the aspect of this game not going F2P, a smart move for developers, as the want a strong community, mature community.

Its a small thing that presents a big problem, it makes you totally vulnerable at the exact point the player should be ready to lock and load. There are two ways they could solve this, one, make the player invulnerable for a few seconds after spawn, or two, get rid of the animation altogether. Personally i'd stump for the second option and it's something I really hope the developers address considering it puts a dent in the experience.\n\nSee video for my full impressions.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTkr1hU4Ceo","January 26, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far, it includes 1 map which can be played in deathmatch and team deathmatch mode. There are 7 weapons with alt fire modes, and no vehicles.\n\nA few things to know before you buy this:\n\n1. The balance of weapons is off. If you look through other reviews or the official forums, the rocket launcher (Cerberus) is widely believed to be highly OP.\n\n2. The skill level of some of the players is quite high. You will get fragged, a lot.\n\n3. There are already cheats available for it, which can alledgedly fool anti-cheat protection employed by Valve.\n\n\nStill interested? OK, this game is somewhat promising. I can't claim it's worth $17 at the moment, but there's some potential here. Notable features include an activatable and rechargeable cloacking device and pretty good graphics. It's also a pretty stable release, I haven't had crashes or glitches.\n\nIt still lacks "something" to distinguish it from UT2k4, maybe one can claim the pace is even faster and more brutal than that, as most of the weapons do a lot of damage.\n\nOverall, I can "recommend" the game to someone who is interested in getting an early look at a product that is clearly attempting to bring back UT2k4 style shooting to the PC, but it's still pretty rough around the edges. Everyone else, stay the hell away for the time being.","January 25, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/949/recommended/324810/","949","Gladdy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/949/","93 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is exactly what it looks like and what they say it is. if you're looking for an ultra-fast-paced, old-school shooter, get it.\n\nAlso, these devs understand Early Access better than most. Rather than release a 0.0001 and expect people to bear with them for an eternal alpha, they have a beta whose biggest changes are balance-related. There is currently only one map available not because they decided to build 10% of a product and ship it as is, but because they want to make sure the weapons are balanced with as few variables as possible before they turn on another slew of already-created, yet-to-be-100%-polished content. They currently plan to have the next massive wave of content released around February 12, following the last of the major weapon balance tweaks.\n\nGreat gameplay, great performance (!), great devs! Can't wait for more.","February 3, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
