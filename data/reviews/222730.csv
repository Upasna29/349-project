With their help you will create different biomes, plants, animals and ressources. Attracted by this, Humans will settle and build Villages, which you can then grow and care for.\n\nThe game is presented in its unique and suprisingly detailed visuals that let you zoom from the planet view in to the details of the villagers. Its something to experience, and makes navigating the whole planet fast, very easy.\n\nThe playtime is at first limited to 30 minutes, you have to play and unlock achievements to expand this to 60 and later 120 minutes. Yes the gameplay is heavily driven by achievements, but through this you are able to learn to effectively play the game. If they would have just ulocked everything from the start i would have been overwhelmed and confused. There is also an endless mode and various special gameplay options that you can play with if the standard gameplay isnt your thing.\n\nThe gameplay gets more and more complex the further you advance in the game, up to an suprising ammount of deepness that rivals the god-game-richness of classics like civilistaion or populus. The wiki helps alot to understand all the mechanics if youre lost: http://wiki.reusgame.com/index.php?title=Main_Page\n\nOverall this is a very solid and fun game, that will give you way more than you probably expected from it. - You should play Reus!","October 24, 2013","true","19.2"," 387 of 426 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","387","426","0","3"

You can create trees and animal life, grow entire plots of fertile swampland, and one of your giants can even punch veins of precious stones directly into the crust.\n\nAll of this, to attract the ungrateful little bobbleheads known as man to build great cities upon your surface. The humans create many great works on their own- well, with your help. Your giants can directly influence whether or not they complete their projects (do you really want a mad scientist around? How about a sacrificial altar?) by altering the landscape further, creating new resources that meet the goals of these projects. The more you complete, the more varying projects and resources you unlock, and thus the rabbit hole goes deeper. You can even unlock longer game-times as well, allowing more time to create and build, and allowing more time for the humans to try and rise up against you and your giants.\n\nThey do go to war with each other. And they'll attack your god titans too, which is a curious choice. Your giants can slaughter them back, as any good vengeful potential goddess will be happy to know.\n\nThe game can get quite complicated as you go on, however, the title screen provides a link to the Reus wiki, which will give a lot of ideas and help.\n\nThe graphics themselves are cartoony and relatively simple looking, but always bright and interesting to look at. The game is on a 2D scale, all around the surface of the planet. Your giants traverse the outside of the planet as well, so some of your time will be spent waiting for the big lugs to get to where they're going, but since their abilities have cool-down meters, that isn't too much of a problem. The soundtrack is rather limited, though, so have some of your own music handy for the longer games.\n\nOverall, Reus is a well-designed god game. It'll start off just slow enough to get you hooked, and keep you in for the long haul as you look to see what you can accomplish next.","March 11, 2014","true","84.1"," 282 of 300 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","282","300","0","7"

If you’ve seen my play history you’ll know that I’m very “in to” the game. Reus is a good game to buy because it’s a world builder, individual games are short, there’s a lot of replayability, it’s a game with deep strategy, and an easy learning curve. There’s a lot of value in this game.\n\nAs a world building “god game” it fulfills many of the things you’d naturally expect. You lay out the terrain. You manage where the towns go. You can destroy nations in an instant. You manage a lot of externalities. The cool part about this “god game” is you manage every thing with these potent giants who you enhance throughout the game by completing objectives. Each giant is different and has unique powers to explore. A mountain giant for example can create minerals but can’t create animals. An ocean giant can enhance plants but can’t create them.\n\nThis game follows the old school principle of “unlocking content”. There’s just some thing about unlocking content and learning as you play that is a lot of fun. In Reus the entire objective is to march through over 60 unlocks which are called projects. Each time you play a game you complete various projects with differing objectives. This gives the game a lot of replayability as many of the projects have opposed goals and there’s not enough time in a 2 hour game to get them all. When you finish a game you’re rewarded with new tools for your next game. This means you’re slowly learning new and more advanced ways to adjust things as you progress, it’s all very elegantly done.\n\nI have two negative things to say about Reus. First if you play a lot the music track is just simply not sufficient. The second is that even though so much of the game is modular there’s no DLC, no update packs, no nothing. They won’t even take my money for in game hats (for the giants of course).\n\nThis game is absolutely worth the $9.99. Skip pizza and destroy nations in an instant.\n","November 12, 2013","true","54.5"," 200 of 223 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","200","223","0","3"

I can certainly see why it may not appeal to absolutely everyone, but I think it does what it does well and does so in a charming little way that remains unique to its own identity.\n\nIt is a casual game, and a very much toned-down “civilization-management” style game compared to others in that genre.  It is actually a “god-sim” style game where you influence but do not control the civilizations in your world.  Furthermore, it is round based, each round starting from scratch and lasting 1 to 2 hours; however unlocks and certain progressions are saved across all rounds.\n\nThe main thing that I like about Reus is that it satisfies the desire to play a civilization-management / god-sim style game without overloading the player with piles upon piles of data to keep track of.  The tutorial is great, and slowly introduces the mechanics to the game.  Even after the tutorial ends, things in the game are unlocked relatively slowly as the player completes rounds of gameplay.  All this prevents you from feeling overwhelmed when you start playing.  And you can really understand how the game works piece by piece instead of it all just being tossed in your face immediately after clicking “New Game.”  It is a bit of a double-edged blade, however, as some players may inevitably find Reus to be lacking, as it is truly far less complex than many other games involving civilization-management.\n\nThe game is quite simplistic and it is way more god-sim than it is civilization-management; and it shows in the gameplay.  Control is limited and simple, and much of the development is automated while the player just makes sure everything is going smoothly by managing resources, and occasionally divinely-intervening in affairs of the NPC civilizations.\n\nThe art style, music, and even the game mechanics all add to the simple charm of the game that gives Reus its positive identity.  The game isn’t very innovative but it does have a unique feel that will satisfy.  Once you get into the swing of things, you will find Reus to be quite addictive.\n\nIn summary, I would say that hardcore fans of the civilization-management genre will probably find Reus way too casual.  In truth it is much more so a casual god-sim than it is anything else.   But for people who are interested in getting a small taste of civilization-management without the overwhelming feeling and tedious gameplay, they may be pleasantly surprised at what Reus has to offer.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 21, 2015","true","21.8"," 132 of 142 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","132","142","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelesis666/recommended/222730/","Kelesis666","Paikia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelesis666/","605 products in account",""Hmmm... another city / colony / civilization management simulator..." - this was the first thought about Reus. Well, that thought turned out to be wrong.\n\nWhile the game might look simplistic, childish or even shallow, because of the colorful visuals and the concept of giants ruling the world, I promise you - this is not the case. Being a Civilization series veteran, I'm used to deep and complex games. While Reus might not compare with Civilization 5 or other games on that subject, it definitely provides a sophisticated enough mechanism to keep me interested, at least so far. I've been playing for 4-5 hours by now, and I feel like I still have a long way to go before I really learn the game mechanics and master it.\n\nTo bottom line this - if you like the genre, get this game. It's well worth it, even at full price ($10).\n\nUpdate (18 hours total) - this game turned out to be one hell of a pleasant surprise! I'm having a lot of fun with the progression mechanism.\n\nI now have a much better perspective and understanding of the game, so I can give much more information. Skip to the end for a short bottom line, if you don't feel like reading all that text.\n\nThe idea in the game is to contribute to the developement of the colonies by supplying resources and improvements, mainly plants, animals and minerals of different sorts. But in order to unlock the better, more advanced resources and improvements (called "aspects" ingame), you must explore and use the more basic options, or you can't progress and reach the advanced stuff. Needless to say, I guess, that the more advanced your giants are, the bigger and more prosperous colonies they can sustain, support and control. ...yes, control. Sometimes a colony gets greedy and arrogant and attacks your giants, and needs a good kick in the ♥♥♥. In some cases it's even necessary to destroy a colony, if it looks hopeless.\n\nAlso, the humans in the colonies will try and develope projects of different sorts, and you're supposed to help them meet the required criteria (if you want that project to succeed). The trick is to choose the optimal combination of resources to supply to the colony, factoring in the resource's position, its level, and the level of synergy it might or might not have with other resources nearby, plus the project's criteria, of course. So far, most projects need specific amounts of either food, wealth or technology or any combination of them. Some projects, though, will also require one or more unusual conditions, such as winning a war with another colony or having another colony completely destroyed (either by going to war or by "divine intervention").\n\nThere are more aspects to the game, some of which I don't fully understand myself yet, but I promise to update if I feel l learn something important enough. For one, you have time limits, both for the "Era" type of game (what I've been playing so far) and for the projects. Obviously, it complicates things.\n\nAnyway, to summarize this update - this game is way more complex and rewarding than it seems, or at least more than it seemed to me at first. If you like strategy and colony management, get it, definitely worth it!\n\nUpdate (October 29, 2013, 40+ hours): This game is now officially one of my favorite games ever! It has a nearly perfect balance - it's complex and deep, so you don't get bored too soon, yet it's relatively easy to get into and learn, so there's no need to spend too much time learning the game and its mecahnics - it's fun straight from the beggining!\n\nI'd say this game is a perfect introduction to the colony management genre, much more begginer-friendly than Civilization 5, for example, which is an awesome game, possibly my #1 favorite of all time, but has a pretty steep learning curve.\n\nI really hope Reus generates enough profit and PR buzz to justify a sequel. I'd hate for such a great game to stay a lone shining gem, all by itself. :)","October 7, 2013","true","111.8"," 150 of 167 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","150","167","0","2"

Rolled the dice and was massively impressed. Basically, you play the part of the planet. You're totally barren and unable to sustain life. You control 4 different giants who all have different abilities. Your goal is to make the world liveable and grow the cities as big as you can (racking up the city and world score). Every city will produce a semi random special work with certain requirements. Upon completion, you get an ambassador to upgrade your giants skills/unlock new abilities. This is the real key to the game as higher level project require much more resources which cannot be obtained without upgrading resources (which start out locked and are unlocked by completing various achievements).\n\nThe challenge kicks in late in the game from the greed mechanic. When a city has more than 20 of any unused resource (threshold can be raised/lowered by various things like projects, awe, and danger) they gain greed. Too much greed and they'll start attacking other cities and even your giants. Late game they will start work on projects that give cities up to 500 unused resources (bigger gap faster greed accumulation). Losing a city can massively set back your score and cost you valuable achievements. The game is a balancing act of managing multiple cities and their needs while striving for ambassadors without letting the humans kill each other.\n\nMy one complaint comes from the 2 hour game mode (needed to unlock a lot of the high end achievements/resources). If you're really striving for absurd scores to get the best resources unlocked quickly, you spend a ton of time pausing and issuing orders to ensure you're maximizing building in the time limit. I honestly found 2 hour games far less fun than the 30 & 60 min game modes.\n\n\nTL;DR - Simple idea, complex planning. Kind of a mix of a god game and a puzzler. Need to have a plan to "level" your giants and build the world to maximize your score. Very good game.","August 24, 2013","true","27.0"," 102 of 117 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","102","117","0","0"

Civ building? Puzzler? RTS? It's hard to categorize the game. Briefly, you command 4 giants clockwise and counter- around a flat "globe", creating features such as animals, minerals or vegetables in segments or terraforming into mountains/deserts, oceans, swamps or forests. Villagers move in. They'll randomly decide on "projects" which you complete by having your giants create resources in the village. But take care -- if the villagers grow too fast they get greedy, and either attack other villages or even the giants themselves!\n\nGames are timed, and you're given rudimentary tools to start. You can't do everything that's possible in the game without "unlocks": achieving some goals each game. This may turn some off but it really works on multiple levels: limits the complexity to start and gives you different goals for each game so that you won't want to find the One Winning Strategy. 60 to 120 minutes is a big time sink (especially if you're pausing), but you can knock out a half dozen "unlocks" in a given game, especially at the beginning.\n\nIn a game where everything works together well, it only makes sense that the core mechanism of the game is "symbiosis". Some features work better next to others (e.g., bonus food for having this animal near this plant), and then you can embue features with different aspects and then transmute them into higher-level items which likely have different symbioses. This is crucial because there's simply not enough land within the border of each village to accomplish the goals as they get harder and harder.\n\nAnd I didn't even mention ambassadors. Or having to have your giants "put down" advancing armies (or let them through -- Hammerville was looking a little snobby).\n\nReally, everything in this game works together so well, and it's very unique.

If You’ve ever heard, or better, played legendary ‘Black & White’ series, You’ll instantly  notice some similarities between those two titles.  They both may be called “God simulation games”, ‘cause in both of them we take up a role of tremendous beings, with power to shape the world itself, and the humans are only there as some kind of a cattle, growing and expanding their culture thanks to, or despite our actions.\n\nIn Reus, we get to control not one, but four godlike beings – The Giants, awoken from their slumber by the power of The Planet itself, in order to reshape it, and make habitable for humans. Each of those cute beings rules over one aspect of the planet – oceans, forests, swamps and mountains/desserts, but in order to restore life, and make it blossom again, they’ll need to use, and combine all of their powers.\n\nOne of the main problems Giants will encounter, and an inspiration behind the game itself, will be a growing greed of the human race. This feature not only defines gameplay pace, but also may prove crucial in achieving game objectives, required to unlock more complex resources. Basically the more goods You’ll provide to humans, the more they’ll want, and while trying to get them they’ll no compromise, resolving to fighting with each other, launching a full scale war or even attempting an attack on The Giants themselves.\n\nBut the best thing about ‘Reus’ is a seemingly endless, and flexible number of possible development strategies. Every resource created has its own unique “symbiosis” making it more potent under certain conditions. For example certain plant may provide more “food” while growing next to a mineral, which may also benefit further from the nearby animal nest. With 108 different types of resources present in total, You’ll need a long time to discover all potentially useful combinations, and craft Your own unique strategy to master the game, and help Your humans complete most challenging projects !\n\nThe last thing worth mentioning about this game, are its undoubtedly beautiful visuals. The whole planet, The Giants, and human villages are set in a cute, round and pleasant 2D environment. This concept fits the game perfectly, and in symbiosis (sic.) with a good soundtrack makes a perfectly addicting combination definitely worth it’s price !\n\nPros:\n-	Extremely high replayability.\n-	In-game milestones provide targets for every round.\n-	Intense theorycrafting is possible, due to a huge number of possible choices.\n-	Lively community, developing its own challenges, and competitions. (Official Reus Forum[forums.abbeygames.com])\n-	Cute and enjoyable visuals.\n\nCons:\n-	Unusual gameplay, may be boring for some players.\n-	It takes time to figure out every aspect of the game.","January 22, 2014","true","36.4"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","40","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eighteen2party/recommended/222730/","eighteen2party","Rawrrawrshebear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eighteen2party/","106 products in account","I love this game. But--full disclosure--the strategy genre is almost exclusively where I spend my gaming hours. The remaining time is usually allocated to sandbox games, and Reus sort of falls into both these categories.\n\nWhile definitely not an open world game by any stretch of the imagination [the world is literally a closed ring], Reus follows the sandbox/god game pattern of affecting the world in a way similar to an artist painting a portrait. Using the proper tools (the Giants and their abilities), you masterfully paint your world on the blank canvas that is the earth. Unlike the artist, however, your creations are living beings!\n\nThe Experience\n\nFor the most part, you play the game by ordering your four Giants to either place resources, augment existing resources, terraform/terramorph the planet, or attack an area. This basic premise is compelling, and the art style is rather charming. However, once you start to really dig in to Reus, its weaknesses start to come to the surface.\n\nAt a macro level, the only real issue with the game is its repetitiveness; a trait which is no stranger to the genre, and Reus certainly doesn't aim to change that. You're literally starting from the same place every time you play [an empty planet], with little deviation in your opening choices from game to game. This weakness is something of a non-issue to genre fans, of course. Just be aware that if you struggle to enjoy city/empire-building strategy games like Civilization V, for instance, you're not likely to be won over by Reus.\n\nThe Mechanics\n\nMore specific to the gameplay: the aspect of Reus that makes it compelling happens to also be its biggest drawback. Reus retains replay value in two major ways: randomness/chance and unlocks [achievements]. The random aspect is the aforementioned double-edged sword: your villages grow by completing projects, which are chosen from a pool of potential projects (depending on terrain, etc.), which each have a randomly-chosen resource perk, which in turn dictates how you should build moving forward.\n\nThis RNG is obviously intended to keep the game fresh, however it is often at odds with the direction your unlocks want you to follow (especially once you're down to your last handful). The game requires a lot of pre-planning (prepare to spend a lot of time reading the wiki), but then forces you to rely very heavily on what are essentially a series of dice rolls to line up perfectly. If you're averse to save scumming, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nThe game engine also has minor goofs from time to time [no surprise, it's an indie game!]. Such as: a village spiking from 1 greed [high levels of greed are obtained by growing too fast and determine how aggressive villagers are] to attacking their neighbors just by loading savegame. These events seem to be rare, however.\n\nConclusion TL;DR\n\nIf you enjoy the planning aspect of strategy games, and don't mind a lot of waiting [as resources build and for projects to start/finish], Reus is will reward you with hours upon hours of relaxing cognition.\n\nSeriously. Reus can give Civilization a run for its money with all the pausing and tabbing out you do in a 120-minute game.","August 26, 2014","true","105.0"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","0"

Solid game, best played casually once in a while, interesting alternative take on what a God Game is.\n\nAt first glance you might be forgiven for thinking Reus is a god game. And at the start, in a very simple way - it is. But that's not what Reus is about - Reus more than anything is a puzzle development game, which just so happens to have god like giants striding around carrying out your latest puzzle solving commands.\n\nYou can probably stop reading here and decide whether you like progressive puzzles that require repeated plays to figure out. If you don't you can skip Reus. If you do, or at least you really like at least the theme of a God Game that's actually a puzzle game...\n\nThe first couple of hours of Reus will get you familiar with moving your guys around, creating the land types - and what kind of variations you can get up to, and most importantly of all will introduce you to the main element of the game - puzzling out the transformations of one resource type into another.\n\nAt this point you might leave the game alone. A light game. Couple of hours of play. I get it.\n\nBut, if you're the type of player that likes to build things that will see you progressing and unlocking new capabilities and achievements, that enjoys trying to optimise and plan a better setup, then Reus could lock you up for countless hours.\n\nAs Reus progresses your virtual world dwellers will demand ever increasingly impressive buildings to be built for them - and your job is to supply the required number of resources to do that. But resources are not just a simple task of sticking down a mine here and an animal there. In Reus there are dozens of resources - and most of them can only be utilised in a not so easy to navigate upgrade tree.\n\nWhat you can build depends on how many successful projects you have built in the world - and therefore the upgrades your giants have in order to place ever better resources and upgrades, and also how far through the game you have progressed. Most of the upgrades and buildings will simply be unavailable to the starting player, and the game will need repeated plays for you to unlock achievements and unlock those better resources. It will often be the case that you will be able to progress so far - and then no more, as your paltry set of resources just don't have enough clout to cater to the demands of your meeples.\n\n\nReus has a lot of depth to it. The sheer number of resources available and their unique synergies with other things around them gives a huge amount of variation in effect. And this gives rise to a fairly interesting laid back game that comes down to puzzling out the best placement and interaction of what's available to you. But it takes time. Reus is going to eke out what it lets you play with so that you need to play it over and over again. As each unlock opens up new capabilities so you will be able to push the envelope and release a new set of unlocks and so on. As the depth of your unlocks increases so too does the time required to get your civilisations up to the point where they can start utilising them.\n\nNice progressive game mechanic, or cynical attempt at lengthening game replayability of an otherwise much shorter game ?\n\nOverall Reus is worth playing, it's a solid game and has some nice depth to it - just how long you will be playing for depends on you temperament.","December 23, 2013","true","64.6"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","0"

It is quite unique, there is a lot in the form of unlockables and plenty of combinations and variation among the different resources and mechanics. Besides the somewhat annoying project mechanic, the game functions well and is quite addicting, not to mention it has a nice and beautiful little art style.\nThere is some basic functionality lacking in the form of speeding up time or customizing your game settings more and the game can get repetitive.\n\nI would have loved to see them go a little bit more all-out with this. Lets be honest, every god game needs to have vulcanoes.

The problem is that that cohesive whole is more of a morsel than a full meal. Gameplay purely comes down to optimizing a very small set of tiles while managing a similarly small set of values, and that truly boils down to a lot of tedious testing which feels more like work than fun. Or you could just go search the wiki for optimal builds, because ultimately, memorizing what building goes with what other building is your end goal. Once you know that, the game is over, and that just isn't enough depth to persuade me to choose it over the myriad of other strategy titles.\n\nAbbey Games was really onto something with Reus.

You control 4 giants who can terraform the planet, and add animals, plants and minerals, while you watch peoples settling villages, exploring the resources you made available, getting greedy, waging wars and even attacking you. I have to say that I don't usually like games froms this genre, but Reus has so many fresh elements and the concept appealed so much to me that I've really enjoyed playing it--and I still will in the future! I've played it for 20h so far, or so it seems, but I'm definitely not done with Reus. It has a few minor flaws, but it's a great game.\n\nPros:\nReus features something really nice called symbiosis, which means some natural sources (animals, plants and minerals) get bonuses when put close to or distant from other elements\nGorgeous 2D graphics\nEach giant has a unique set of skills, which you can unlock and upgrade as you complete projects\nSpeaking of which, projects are like short-term objectives you need to achieve for a tribe and they give bonuses to the tribes and provide ambassadors to improve your giants' skills\nThere 3 unique main biomes (forest, swamp and desert), plus 2 extra minor biomes (mountains and sea), each of those having their own sets of natural sources\nIn-game achievements unlock new natural sources, adding new elements to new games, not to mention they provide ideas for what you should do in a given era, adding a lot of replay value\nReus also disencourages you from getting ahead of yourself and starting to create a lot of natural sources, since they make your tribe greedy and you may end up losing everything or even being attacked. If you still wanna rush, you can add "awe" and/or "danger" (by setting the right natural sources), so the villagers are struck by them and don't have time to get greedy.\nBasically, you can play the game and succeed using different strategies, which adds a lot of replay value to the game\nCons:\nThe beginning of each era (or "game", if you'd prefer) is always the same, and that takes a bit of the replay value away--the only difference is what you decide to do in a given era. So I always sigh when I'm starting a new era. And usually I have no patience to start a new game right after finishing another one.\nThe game starts really slow, then in the end your giants can't handle all the fuss anymore, unless (maybe) if you activate a cheat (they call it "alternative option") to make them faster. Giants' speed could've been more fine-tuned.\nGreed sucks. I love the concept, but you should be able to do something to make it go down. Once a village becomes greedy, nothing will revert that. Then you'd have to either deal with it until the end of the era, or destroy it and start from scratch. And you'll probably have to destroy all natural sources, too, since a new village settled in the same spot with become greedy in seconds!\nNot a con to me, but many people mentioned it, so I thought I should, too: you'll be doing a lot of math in your head! "If I change my chickens for a salt mine, I lose 3 food, but I get 10 money. Oh, wait, but I'll lose that other symbosis and I'll lose 10 tech, but I'll get 15 awe from a new symbiosis..." etc.\nBecause of that, Reus generates a lot of analysis paralysis--you'll probably pause a lot and spend at least 3 or 4 hours playing a one-hour era.\nBought on: I actually traded a bundle link for Reus for another one I had. But it's not an expensive game. Definitely worth its full price.","December 31, 2014","true","19.9"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","0"

There is something very satisfying about cobbling together a few planets and trying to make thing coexist... then learning new strategies and patterns that are even more fruitful. There is a nice steadily deepening set of gameplay mechanics that comes with the resources you unlock at the end of each world that leaves me looking forward to the start of the next era. There are also interesting challenges presented (Like have a village reach a certain prosperity using only plants and animals) which let you try something out of the ordinary. These challenges do bring one of my few gripes though, as I'm never sure when a village is going to expand (and include a resource that is not allowed) or if I'm even allowed to use adjacency bonuses with offending resources that are outside of the village borders.\n\nFor those who want to know a little more about the game:\nThis a game is all about adjacency bonuses. There are two basic kinds of plants/minerals/animals per biome and 5 biomes. Then all of those can be evolved a couple of times with various aspects... and each stage of evolution has different bonuses, usually pertaining to what it is near. This on it's own could probably be mathematically solved pretty easily to yield the greatest possible output of the planet you control, but then there's humans that pop up and build cities over some resources and have projects that they want to build, throwing in extra bonuses that apply to things within their border. At the end of the era, you unlock new plants and animals and minerals to use in future plays.\n","October 4, 2014","true","33.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","0"

Theoretically, Reus is very similar to most civ-strategy games. Resource management is the core mechanic, upgrades are vitally important for continued advancement, great works will occupy a lot of your energy, and warfare is an ever-looming danger. What sets Reus apart is that you're not trying to make one civilization the best in the world; instead, you ARE the world, and you're trying to make ALL civilization succeed.\nYou exert your will via four semi-elemental Giants - titans, really - each with unique but related powers that alter the landscape of your surface. Humans will automatically settle and then try to form a civilization depending on what resources you give them. You then care for your babies, give them what they need, what they want, and watch as they thrive. But be careful not to give them too much, or they'll grow greedy and war-like; at this point, you either sit back and watch them form an empire, or take action and smite their army - or the entire town.\nThe game's replay value comes largely from its slew of challenges, which largely boil down to "Be this successful with these limitations." The only way to complete these challenges is by repeatedly playing the game until you understand how resources interact with each other - called Symbiosis because, you know, nature - so that you can maximize resource output with minimal combinations. Completing these challenges unlocks further Transmutations (resource upgrades) that then make it possible to complete even more challenges. So yes, the achievements actually mean something, which means that every time you play, you have to play differently. So if the game gets boring, well, that's your problem.","February 6, 2014","true","26.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

Optimizing the aquisition of these values involve placing the tiles in the correct order, making each run a predictable excerise in mathematics.

You can choose between swamps, deserts, mountains, oceans and forests. As you create your world humans will build cities, will you help the humans achieve a utopia... or you can smash them... they probably reserved it.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Has anyone seen this ever watched the old cartoon "The Iron Giant"? (Warner bros, 1999) This game is nothing like that movie. I just wanted to see if there's anyone else that remembers that film. Actually all that's similar is the giant aspect.\nI don't think there is a single word spoken throughout the game, the game starts out by teaching you how to use the various giants. and explains how to shape the world around you. When I started I felt very overwhelmed about how much I had to learn, don't worry about learning it all right away, you'll have plenty of time to slowly get used to the concepts in the game as you progress.\nAs you play you unlock new animals/fruit/plants and longer world lengths. As you progress you need to accomplish various different goals, this give the game a sense of direction to keep trying to get better, and experience different things.\n\nGame Play: You only control 4 giants, you select various abilities and tell them where to build and what to build. When the humans show up you try to help them and keep their development very balanced so that they don't have more than their neighbors and try to prevent wars... unless you want wars, then go ahead and give one city all the things and watch the humans become greedier then Ebenezer Scrooge.\nthe game controls are simple, you can play the game with just clicking, but I try to get used to the hot keys for faster response time. the giant also need to move to the selected location before it can build or destroy anything, this does limit how fast you can create on your world.\n\nAchievements: The achievements in Reus are tied directly with achievements in game, and these achievements, when earned, unlock various new animals/fruit/plants to add to your world. This makes getting achievements actually mean something, other then aesthetics and a good pat on the back.\n\nPrice: Reus costs $9.99, I've put in 11 hours so far, this game is by far worth it's price. I did buy the game over the steam summer sale, but even at full price that's pretty good quality.\n\nConclusion: I strongly recommend the game to anyone who likes strategy games, again the game has some fun things to unlock, and various ways to play through it to unlock more the controls are simple, the strategy is engaging, and I just enjoyed playing this game, and will continue playing because I still haven't played through without getting at least one new thing unlocked.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update April 05, 2015: fixed a few spelling errors, and concluded you can just smash the puny humans instead of caring about their greed.","September 20, 2014","true","14.8"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","3"

Relaxing, but fairly repetitive game. Trying to unlock everything can be challenging. If you're not a completionist, you'll probably get bored after the first few games.\n\nYou control four elemental gods: rock, forest, ocean, and swamp. They can create three inhabitable biomes upon the planet: swamp, forest, or desert. Additionally, they can each create and improve different versions of the three resources: food, gold, and tech. As you create resources, villages settle around them. As the villages improve, they will pick specialties and demand more of some of the resources. If you give them too much too fast, they will become greedy and attack each other. If you don't satisfy their needs in time, their specialty will disappear. If you do satisfy their needs, they will gift you with an ambassador. Ambassadors are used to increase the power of your gods. Each god will get different powers from the ambassador depending on the village's biome.\n\nOn its face, the game is quite simple.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JinjoID/recommended/222730/","JinjoID","Jinjo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JinjoID/","82 products in account","Reus, the Dutch word for giant. What an appropriate name for a game with such scale. At first glance Abbey Games’ Reus may not look like much, a simple god game with a lack of depth and strategy. But with further examination there is more to Reus than meets the eye. If you can get past the slow start of tutorials there is a surprising amount to learn and discover.\n\nIn Reus you are the planet and control 4 giants, the Forest Giant who can create the forest biome as well as basic plant life. The Swamp Giant who can create the swamp biome as well as animals and plants. The Ocean Giant who creates the ocean biome allowing the planet’s soil to support forests and swamps and the Rock Giant who creates the desert biome and raises mountains as well as minerals from the earth’s surface. All these giants are used together to create increasingly advanced forms of life as you progress through the game.\n\nCreating life attracts humans; humans will create villages on your planet in the varying environments provided. These villages will start out as simple towns, but can grow into prospering cities when the right resources have been expanded and advanced. Villages will construct projects requiring certain amounts of food, wealth and technology from resources to be completed. Once completed ambassadors will be asked to join your giants, unlocking new abilities and resources. Reus features many different mechanics including a greed system that can lead to wars with other villages and eventually the giants themselves. Reus is best played when the player is left to discover the game by themselves so I won’t spoil anymore and really, there is too much for me to get into detail about everything.\n\nThe way you progress through Reus is rather interesting, and for me the most engaging part of the experience. Progression through the game is made by the collection of achievements, the game is on a timer and when you first start you are given 30 minutes to evolve your planet and complete the goals required to earn achievements. Earn enough and longer time periods are granted.  Achievements also unlock greater and more powerful plants, minerals and animal life so it is certainly necessary, and satisfying to collect them all.\n\nYour level of enjoyment in Reus will be determined by the kind of player you are. For me, Reus really engaged me, and immersed me in its world. It had my interest right from the start and that interest continued to grow as I discovered everything the game had to offer. However, I am the kind of player who loves to collect things, loves to level up my character until it reaches maximum rank.

You control four giants who help form a brand new planet as you see fit. It takes some strategy to combine the right resources so that you villages may flourish. And that makes it really addictive, because the better your villages do, the more powers your giants get to add new and more powerful resources. The game also makes good use of developments/achievements, which in itself is quite rewarding when you finish a game.\n\nWhen starting out playing this game it might take a while to figure out how to combine resources and how to make your giants stronger, but don't let this get you down. You learn a lot by just trying stuff and the in-game explanations make combining resources easier. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes a perfect mix of good artwork and intelligent gameplay. It's one of the best ones I've ever played!","January 18, 2015","true","26.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacebowser/recommended/222730/","spacebowser","SpaceBowser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacebowser/","357 products in account","There are two schools of game design. The first, puts emphasis on how things “feel”. The second, tries to make all the numbers add up on a spreadsheet. The first may not be all that balanced, but the second tends to be no fun at all. Reus leans too much towards the second.\n\nA session of Reus goes like this: you pick how long you want to play, 30, 60 or 120 minutes. There is a non-time limited Freeplay, but you won’t unlock any new technologies in that mode. As the game starts, you’re presented with a flat, formless planet and four Giants. Each Giant represents a sort-of element: Water, Swamp, Forest and Rock. Each can terraform the landscape in their own way, and manipulate the ecosystem by creating creatures or plants. Casting these “spells” costs nothing, and often you’ll have to overwrite previously placed elements as the situation changes.\n\nSpells don’t have any real logical match-up to their Giant, which can be very confusing until you have it all mapped out via rote memorization. After a terrain type has been made, such as forest, settlers will move in and set up a little camp. The way the Giants move around, the circular cut-away view of the planet, and all the little people doing their thing, is very charming. But underneath that charm is a very cold, soulless spreadsheet that governs how the game plays out.\n\nReus is more of a puzzle game than a god sim. Settlers will construct a “project”, mostly at random, and you need to manage the landscape within a town’s boundaries to meet the project’s completion criteria. These range from having enough Food, Tech, or more difficult ones, like going to war with another settlement. Fauna and flora have “synergies”, which unlock additional resources when things are placed a certain way. It’s a house-of-cards balancing act, placing things next to other things in the most optimal way. When a project completes, you gain an Ambassador which - when paired with a specific Giant - unlocks more powers for that Giant. New projects start, and you need to rearrange things to meet the new criteria.\n\nThe foil to the system comes from Greed. If a town grows too fast, or lacks sufficient Threat from nearby Predators, they’ll stop fearing the Giants and may even start to attack them with arrows. Which is possibly the only real humanising moment to be found in the game, watching the Giants cower. When the time limit runs out, the Giants go to sleep, and you unlock new technologies to use in the next session, depending on how well you did.\n\nI kept asking myself, “is Reus badly designed, or am I just bad at it?” It’s a difficult question, made all the more vexing when you’re aware of the Dunning–Kruger effect. Reus is a badly designed game. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad game. There just isn’t much to it.","September 22, 2014","false","5.2"," 33 of 53 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","33","53","0","4"

The major flaw seems to be that every action needs to be premeditated; if you don't keep track of every single item that the giants can create (and in what contexts the item can exist), you can't create enough resources for the towns to progress.  The game seems to be best played with a piece of paper detailing all the important synergies in order to be able to place the very few successful combinations that can get you to advance.

It is largely a 'spinning plates' affair where you have to keep track of a lot of individual and interacting elements to make the most out of each play through.  Mostly this game amounts to nothing more than Achievement hunting, but if that is your thing, maybe you will like it more that I did.  For me it was cute for a time, but I quickly got bored with it.\n\nThe only significant problem, even for Achievement hunters, is there is no in-game upgrade tree or information menu.  Efficent planning is essential to acquiring whichever goal you are hunting, having to plant and re-plant resources hunting for that one you couldn't quite remember how to get, is time wasting and frustrating.\n\nA simple menu option that allows you to check the upgrade steps for any resource you have unlocked isn't exactly a big ask. The fact they seem to expect you to remember the variations for a dozen different resources that have different, branching upgrade paths depending on which of the four different elements they can be placed in, seems like a bit much for what is, at its core, a casual game.","December 11, 2015","false","46.7"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","33","55","4","0"

It certainly put me in mind of both Black & White and Populous, both games I loved once upon a time.  The graphics, while simplistic, are candy to the eye and suit the theme of the game perfectly.\n\nIt's suprisingly complex; easy to learn, difficult to master.  The premise is simple on the surface: you're the planet and you've been slumbering in between eras and when you wake, you use the last of your energy to form four gods with different abilities to terraform your surface and make you live again.  As a byproduct of your nature gods' work, nomads choose to settle and form cities and you have to keep them happy via your gods so they don't go to war and decimate each other, and you.\n\nI quickly became obsessed with forming better and better cities within the limits of the planet and my gods' abilities.  Should you wish, you can play for 30 minutes at a time, with longer time limits becoming unlocked as you earn achievements, or you can play sandbox-style once your time is up.  It's fantastic for those times you want to actually relax with a game instead of tensing up on the edge of your chair, screaming obscenities at pixels (which I do quite regularly as well).

Easier. Crisies happen less often, economies are more stable and easier to manage, and your little followers are easier to please.\nWhile this has been great for making the genre more accessible, it's also had the adverse effect of sometimes making these games... Trivial. Whereas sandbox modes used to be enough to keep a god game fun because of the challenge involved in growing and regulating your domain, a lot of what you're seeing now requires extra layers of stuff such as objectives and whatnot tacked on to keep it fun. While this is not inherently bad, the problem is the actual gameplay isn't designed with these goals in mind well enough, and the management gameplay falls flat.\n\nReus is a fascinating experiment in building a god game with genuinely engaging management gameplay that's actually quite simple to learn. It's very much the same satisfaction you get from playing a good puzzle game as you try to set up the proper improvements you need in the right places, and the progression arc for both a given era and a full game is clever and keeps you engaged, and gives you something new to do every time you play.\n\nOverall, this game is a steal for only $10.

A giant that can creat frozen tundras, polar bears, peinguins,walrus's, pine trees, and more! Once you finish the second era, you gain the MAGMA GIANT. A giant that is similar to the rock god, and can only place a biome by going onto a mountain that the rock giant built and transforming it into a volcano.

This slow, arbitrary game might be for you.\n\nSay your Forest Giant creates a fruit plant. Well by default you get blueberries, for no apparent reason. Using powers ("aspects") from your other giants, you can upgrade those to either strawberries (which produce more food if next to blueberries) or apples (which produce more food if next to animals).\n\nThe game is built on these sort of relationships between tiles (which surround your planet in a flat circle). There's never much rhyme or reason as to WHY e.g. armadillos produce slightly more food if there's a mineral nearby, or agate produces 10 more wealth if there are adjacent frogs.\n\nAfter playing a few rounds I get the strong impression that this game can be mastered by making a giant spreadsheet, or better, just visiting the wiki. There doesn't seem to be much skill beyond memorizing the abritrary numbers on the various convoluted tech trees.","January 28, 2014","false","2.8"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","4"

Only a few entries were made in the last couple years with no real successor to the genres prime example. Reus is one of these entries. It doesn't try to overthrow the king, but it captures the spirit of Black & White very well. With quite a few changes.\n\nStory\n\nInstead of playing a powerful god that controls cities and mighty creatures alike, and being constantly annoyed by your conscience, you are instead the very planet itself which wakes from its billion years long slumber to fill the surface with life once again. Since you are just a giant rock sorrounding a burning gas ball you receive the aid of four giants to help you fill the surface with all kind of life and protect it, if necessary. I think we had that part somewhere before, didn't end well for the giants. Anyway, your Giants are equipped with very different kinds of powers for that job.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe four Giants are called after the four Biomes they can create. Ocean, Forest, Mountain, and Swamp. They can create Land, setting up Recourses, and even enhance them with different skills, but that later. The first important thing to use is the Terrain Generation. You have five Biomes at your Disposal. While all Giants can only create the Lands they are named after and forest and swamp need to be placed next to an ocean, deserts can only be created when raise a mountain and there is no ocean in its sorounding.\nAfter designing the landscape you are ready for the next step: Resources and Settlements. The main feature of this game is to let small villages settle somewhere and provide them with food and gold and everything they could need. While Black & White lets you decide where to put new villages and what structures they build, you are here to waitfor the game to decide which building they want. And on that comparison, the Villages in Reus are just one single structures you can't interact that much. But that's not that much of a problem since Reus uses a new, almost puzzle-like aproach on how to interact with villages. You create Resources (Animals, Plants, Minerals) and your villagers will start to use them (and give them Food, Wealth, and Tech). Since that alone would be pretty boring, the Resources have special abilities attached to them, which grant additional bonuses if you meet certain requirements. So can a Plant almost double its food output if you place it next to a mineral. And on top of that, the different Resource types behave completely different. While Animal can make your Village more aggresive, while Plants have an effect to counter that. Minerals dont have such a system on that scale like the other two, uses some unique features. Animals and Plants have a range on where they give out their bonuses and form different kinds of Animals and Plants, depending on in which Biome you put them. Minerals on the other hand don't use such fancy techniques. You will create the same Minerals whereever you go (with a few exceptions here and there). And instead of a range system they just throw out all bonus on the place they are standing on. To differentiate them even more you need to overcome a special obstacle (called symbiosis), to to make abilities usable. For this your villages need to already use a certain amount of food, wealt, or tech. Stupid rocks.\nSpeaking of Villages, these things have, too, some special features worth mentioning. First, Sttlements have Borders. Everything inside these borders will be counted, everything outside ignored. Don't worry, the Borders will expand once the Settlement reached a certain size. The second thing are structures. These are special building outside of the village, which grant certain additional bonuses, depending on what they are. You can have which grants a tech bonus for each Plant within the borders, or fishing docks gives out a food bonus for each fish around it. And completing it will give you the key to victory, an ambassador.\nThose little people will then sit on your Giants and unlock new powers. These powers, called Aspects, can increase the output of the recourse a little, or activate the last grand feature in the game, Transmutation. You know, that cool thing where you can transorm something in something completely different. It's fun, just don't try to resurrect your dead mother with it, okay? It works like placing a new resource, the first transmutes are not necessarily more powerful, but more you go down on the transmutation road, the better your outcome will be. Of course, if you don't activate the abilities you won't get much farther with it. So plan ahead and draw yourself a map of all the transmutations (I do and will eventually post it here). It will even help to understand certain structures of the transmutations, like the conjunction between ocean animals, you can jump from both animal a1 and b1 to a2 or b2, while the desert animals a1 and b1 only share c2, a2 and b2 are only reachable from the same letter. So keep that in mind. An interesting addition to this is that in the beginning only very few transmutations are available to you. To unlock additional ones you need to unlock steam achievements, which will be tracked ingame. These things are finally useful for something.\n\nConclusion\n\nPretty solid, beautiful drawn, 2-D god game, which can lead to some tedious puzzle work if you want to come far. There are some critic points, like when settlements go and try to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of your Giants. Reus is one of the best examples of the creativity of indie games. If you like slower paced simulations, where you can watch and devolop the towns under your watchful eye, without any pressure, timed or otherwise, you can't do anything wrong with this game. Buy it, enjoy it, and see for yourself.\n\n\nIf you want to get a better look at a playthrough of this game just click the link below:\nhttp://youtu.be/jdKaXzZ8gJM?list=UUMxIS2guRxfCuJ1gllMecuA\n\nFor more Reviews visit my Blog at:\nhttp://achievementunlockblog.wordpress.com/home/","September 10, 2014","true","43.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Balance out the demands in all of your established biomes and the people will be happy. Fail to do so and you’ll see wholesale revolt by your populations.\n\nIt is quick and easy to get into this game: learn the four biomes and what role the associated giant performs and you’re good to go. The game helps you out by giving you progressively more difficult challenges to meet before advancing to the next level.\n\nIs it re-playable? Most definitely, and I would make it part of the gameplay. By this I mean that you have a countdown timer in the “Era” mode which is like a ‘campaign’ mode (I use the term loosely) where you have to successfully complete all the challenges before unlocking the next level (longer countdown, different challenges). Endless re-playability, but some might say endless repetitiveness.\n\nUnfortunately that’s all there is to Reus and while there is no defined end game (besides dying), you can certainly achieve everything there is to achieve in the “Freeplay” mode (no countdown timer). While I do recommend playing this game (positive Steam rating), I cannot call it a good game; it is mediocre at best because of how limited the gameplay is.","October 2, 2014","true","15.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And a Dutch product, which I am very proud of, of course. Think of Reus as a 2D Black & White, minus your pet animal. You control the landscape, you place the elements and let mankind take over from there. They'll build villages and projects. Don't like a certain village, or are they starting too many wars ? Destroy them. Give other villages the opportunity to grow. There are so many possibilities, the choice is yours.\n\nThe game is shown in 2D and is extremely detailed in how it looks. You can zoom in and out and that way see the planet or the people living their lives. I'm amazed by how this was accomplished.\n\nPlaying a game takes 30 minutes, or, if you unlock enough achievements, 60 minutes. I think games can last even longer than that if you unlock even more achievements, but I can not confirm this yet. Earning achievements allows your villagers to create much more advanced buildings later on so starting off with the bare minimum is a good way to ease players into the game. Throwing too much stuff at them in the beginning might just confuse them. But, to be honest, even I got confused a couple of times, even in the very beginning of the game. There's a lot of micromanaging involved in this game, and things can get kind of hectic if you don't know what each button does. That's why the tutorial is a good place to start. If you're not into tutorials you can always try and play a game. The game will never punish you for not knowing things, but if you want to truly enjoy it just stick with the tutorial.\n\nReus has no real goals besides the achievements, which are completely optional. It can be quite relaxing after a hard day's work if you do nothing but build, avoiding the achievements. Also, playing a game of Reus will never frustrate. It will always be fun and random.\nIf that sounds good to you go on and buy it.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","May 27, 2013","true","20.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The visual style is pretty cool and the symbiosis mechanic is pretty interesting too and makes you need to plan your layout of resources carefully.\n\nBut despite all this i found after a few hours i was bored and the novelty of the game had quickly worn off. Because unlocking different types of resources is achievement driven you will have to do several playthroughs to unlock them initially a half hour then expanding to an hour and so on.

(an objective might give you +100 money per marlin within 2 tiles of it - and a marlin is makeral+ lesser hert aspect=seabass.

That's what truely makes this game special. For eg; rabbits give 3xfood. foxes give 5. every rabbit you put together gives an extra +2 food over 5 tiles. every rabbit inside a foxes range gives +4 food.put 2rabbits, a fox, 2rabbits, and you get something huge like 100 food.

Oh, and a blueberry in range of the rabbits for more food, and a bit of natura (some things give bonuses if the natura is high enough under it's tile)\n\nor maybe by puttingferrits next to a mineral they gain a +14 gold bonus, and putting quartz next to quartz gives each one a +10 gold bonus. and you ned to figure out how to maximise a villages resources, inside it's borders, so that you maximise their potential BASED ON THE CURRENT PROGECT (eg a project might give you +35 tech for every pair of apple trees).\n\nIf you expand a village too fast, it gets greeedy and will soon be destroying other villages (meaning less resources and no ambassadors coming from that city or land type), or killing your giants (game over).\n\nAdd to this the fact that there is no real manual, only a short tutorial, and no clear documentation showing the upgrade paths (so how do I build silver again?) There is a lot of too and fro trying to find the information on the wiki - what you need to build to get the resources you want for later. and the "access the wiki on the ingame browser" seems to be broken for me as well. The wiki is not great - it says iron is transmuted from salt. then you need to find salt transmutes from agate. then you need to find out what is required in each resourse to make it transmute. agate becomes salt when you put lesser siesmic on it, which comes from the rock giant if he has a swamp ambassador. salt becomes iron once you have a greater siesmic, which requires two ambassadors. and then it only occurs 30% of the time.\n\nI like the thing. I see at least 200/300h in it for me. There iks a freeplay mode so you ca just go forever,\nI'm a bit dissapointed that it seems that if you dont manage it, things will only ever devolve. it would be kind of cool to be able to leave your world with a balanced ecosystem, however I think the little humans would find some way to muck that up for you if you were not there. Also, nothing would happen, ever, if you left it in freeplay mode. humans dont advance, dont plat their own crops, nothing. You do all that for them. They just use whatever you give them.\n\n\nI have found a couple of bugs - things not showing up when they need to. but it's 99% there, and it's a gem of a game, even if it is rough around the edges. I hope the dev continues working on this until it is completely finished.\n\n\nIf you brave the game, and you like intelligence in design, and intracacy in execution, you may just love this game. But only if you keep this bookmarked:\nhttp://wiki.reusgame.com/index.php?title=Natural_Sources\n\nI printed off all those pictures and keep them next to my keyboard ina a binder now, they have saved me SO much frustration. it's only a pity that they are all black backgrounds. - so much wasted ink.... or you could same all the pics and invert the colours, I guess..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VolatileSchemer/recommended/222730/","VolatileSchemer","Volatile Schemer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VolatileSchemer/","102 products in account","What’s this game all about?\n\nSince there is no established genre which Reus would fit in and it’s not easy to intuitively understand what the deal with the game is, I’ll explain the core gameplay loop in detail.\n\nAt first you’re presented with your barren 2D planet and you’re given control of Reus’ four trademark giants. With them you create your planet’s biomes and resource nodes, which in turn leads to establishment of human settlements. Each settlement’s most important attribute is its resource count, split into three categories: food, wealth, technology. Resource count will gradually rise from nothing at founding to some maximum amount dynamically determined by composition of resource nodes within settlements’ borders. Resources don’t have any traditional functions (i.e. food isn’t used to feed the population), they are simply gathered for two purposes: they count towards overall score and are used to complete so-called ‘projects’.\n\nProjects are the core gameplay concept in Reus. They are buildings, such as a granary or an observatory, which spontaneously appear as construction sites within settlements’ borders and they are completed once settlement gathers certain amount of resources. Each project provides a unique passive bonus to its settlement, so players are usually forced to adjust their resource composition once a new project pops up. Completing projects is rewarded with ‘ambassadors’ each of whom is assigned to a giant thus upgrading it. Upgrades allow giants to create more advanced resource nodes which in turn makes it possible to complete increasingly demanding projects.\n\nWho’s going to like it?\n\nI’d recommend Reus to anyone who is going to enjoy getting familiar with characteristics of a large number of resource types, combining them in a manner that will extract the most value from each land patch, tinkering with secondary resources to power up their settlements’ growth, analyze what upgrade path will best suit their current situation, etc.\n\nAs far as presentation goes Reus is pretty strong. Graphics are simple but stylish. Music is calm and pleasant even if it becomes slightly repetitive after a while. Interface is tidy and responsive, although some of the tooltips are not informative enough (luckily there’s a wiki website which describes everything in detail).\n\nAny red flags?\n\nThis is not a god game, so if anyone is looking for that particular fix - look elsewhere. Humans of Reus have extremely limited autonomy and the game requires lots of micromanagement.\n\nThere is no form of time compression so sporadically players will have to sit through a period of nothing to do. Generally pace of the game is rather slow with plenty of waiting for cooldowns or for giants to move between settlements. Players with little patience might want to think twice before plunging in.\n\nAnd completionists beware – top tier projects require some serious analysis and calculations and on top of that there are tons of unlocks available. Generally, you won’t be able to just breeze through the content.","August 29, 2014","true","103.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In this game you control 4 giants, each representing an aspect of nature, who manipulate the earth in ways that attract, grow, and motivate human settlements.\n\nWhile the basics are relatively (for this type of game) easy to learn, the complexity ratchets up quickly through 2 main mechanics.\n\nFirst, your giants evolve their abilities during each game through the collection of ambassadors who appear when a village reaches a project milestone. This grants them the ability to upgrade plants, animals, and minerals in new ways. Second, as you accomplish objectives, you unlock new types of flora, fauna, and minerals for future games, as well as open up longer gametype modes.\n\nIn this way an initial 30 minute game (era) where you place a few simple plants, animals, and minerals around a few primative villages eventually gives way to 2 hour-long games with dozens of possible ecological effects with hundreds of combinations, all bent on stimulating  settlements to grow and build epic projects.\n\nIt's these ecological combinations that will either make or break the game for you. If you enjoy the challenge of mixing and upgrading  varieties of plants, animals, and minerals to find the perfect symbiotic mix while under time, space, and villager greed limitations - you'll love this game. If not, you'll probably get frustrated quickly.","May 20, 2013","true","18.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a god game, where the player controls 4 teraforming giants who plant resources on a planet.  Villages form to take advantage of those resources and give missions (called projects in game) to the player, usually revolving around having a certain amount of resources and tile types.  Complete a misison and get an ambassador which empowers a giant letting them built more advance resource types.  To really succeed, a player needs to take advantage of resource "synergies."  For example, you develop a deer node, which gives substantially more food if near certain types of plants.\n\nThere are catches.  Villages that grow to quickly may declare war on other villages and wipe them out, depriving the player of a possible mission/ambassador.  If villages get really greedy the may declare war on your giants and attack them!  At some point, it is better to just destroy the village.\n\nThe game is at first a lot of fun with a ton of unlockable achievements that let the player unlock new game modes and new resources.  However, the unlocked 2 hour mode is necessary to get some of the more difficult achievements, and is simply to long.  Furthermore, the harder achievements require players to make carefully planned decisions regarding which ambassadors to pair with giants.  So, the game becomes outright tedious.  Spending 2 hours or more (with pausing) only to discover you missed unlocking that one achievement is very disapointing.\n\nStill, a player should give more hours of enjoyment out of this game than the standard FPS single player campaign.  Combine that with a budget price and you have a cheap way to entertain yourself for a week.","November 26, 2013","true","84.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With them you create your planet’s biomes and resource nodes, which in turn leads to establishment of human settlements. Each settlement’s most important attribute is its resource count, split into three categories: food, wealth, technology. Resource count will gradually rise from nothing at founding to some maximum amount dynamically determined by composition of resource nodes within settlements’ borders. Resources don’t have any traditional functions (i.e. food isn’t used to feed the population), they are simply gathered for two purposes: they count towards overall score and are used to complete so-called ‘projects’.\n\nProjects are the core gameplay concept in Reus. They are buildings, such as a granary or an observatory, which spontaneously appear as construction sites within settlements’ borders and they are completed once settlement gathers certain amount of resources. Each project provides a unique passive bonus to its settlement, so players are usually forced to adjust their resource composition once a new project pops up. Completing projects is rewarded with ‘ambassadors’ each of whom is assigned to a giant thus upgrading it. Upgrades allow giants to create more advanced resource nodes which in turn makes it possible to complete increasingly demanding projects.\n\nWho’s going to like it?\n\nI’d recommend Reus to anyone who is going to enjoy getting familiar with characteristics of a large number of resource types, combining them in a manner that will extract the most value from each land patch, tinkering with secondary resources to power up their settlements’ growth, analyze what upgrade path will best suit their current situation, etc.\n\nAs far as presentation goes Reus is pretty strong. Graphics are simple but stylish. Music is calm and pleasant even if it becomes slightly repetitive after a while. Interface is tidy and responsive, although some of the tooltips are not informative enough (luckily there’s a wiki website which describes everything in detail).\n\nAny red flags?\n\nThis is not a god game, so if anyone is looking for that particular fix - look elsewhere. Humans of Reus have extremely limited autonomy and the game requires lots of micromanagement.\n\nThere is no form of time compression so sporadically players will have to sit through a period of nothing to do. Generally pace of the game is rather slow with plenty of waiting for cooldowns or for giants to move between settlements. Players with little patience might want to think twice before plunging in.\n\nAnd completionists beware – top tier projects require some serious analysis and calculations and on top of that there are tons of unlocks available. Generally, you won’t be able to just breeze through the content.","August 29, 2014","true","103.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You’re given a planet with four giants to help construct said planet and bring life to it. You hold ultimate control over the fate of this barren landscape.\n\nSure, the game may not look like much out of the box, but its rather complex and has quite the learning curve to it. The game’s tutorial, although long, should suffice, as it did for me. A session in Reus starts you off with four giants and an empty planet. These giants each have their own unique traits and can each create a biome of some sort. There’s an ocean giant, a rock giant, a forest giant, and a swamp giant. Each creates its own specific biome, as you should be able to tell from their name, the rock giant, however, creates deserts and hills.\n\nLife will eventually bloom on the planet in the form of humans. They’ll settle villages, which, being the god of this world, you’re tasked with tending to. You can even destroy these settlements if you wish, which may have to be done if said village poses a problem to all other villages.\n\nThe gameplay in Reus gets more complex as you get further into the game and you’re slowly allowed more playtime based on achievements. Once certain achievements are unlocked, you’ll be able to spend more time in a single world than before.\n\nReus is a a lot of fun, if you can last through the learning curve. The graphics are very simplistic, yet they fit the game well. The gameplay appears simple and fun, but is actually quite complex.

This is also the same year where the concept of REUS came to life. However, their first creation was not REUS but it was the prize-winning Tinytanic. Early 2013 REUS finally landed in our hands and it was the first debut game from Abbey Games that truly left the world in awe. A fun fact that not many know about is that REUS is Dutch for giant and is actually pronounced quite differently than how you would say it out loud.\n\nSettings\nImagine yourself as a god, in control of four powerful creatures that can shape the planet to your will. No wait, you don’t have to imagine it anymore. You are a god or a goddess in REUS and you have four mighty giants at your disposal. Each giant has the ability to create nature in its finest: forests, swamps, deserts and oceans. You determine how to shape the perfect world for monads to life in, providing them with the necessary resources such as plants, animal life and minerals in order for them to survive. However, humans are unpredictable and while you do your best to give into their desires, greed may become a possible threat to your once idyllic planet. As the master of these four giants, it is up to you how you react on these threats by adding animal life with danger or minerals that provide awe and much more. You are the creator but you can also be the destructor.\n\nGame play\nMuch like any game, the tutorial is essential if you’ve never played a god game in your life. You start by controlling one giant, then another one and so on. You will also be introduced to giving into the will of mankind that roams your planet and the threats that will arise if greed takes the upper hand.\n\nThe rest of the game play is pretty much the same. You start with a planet which you need to shape by creating oceans, forests, swamps and deserts accompanied with mountains. Then you need to decide if you’d rather place plants or animal life, or even minerals for the nomads to settle down. As a god, you need to help them by providing the resources they need in order for them to build the desired projects such as a school, a granary and even a shrine or a temple. You will unlock even more projects, fauna and flora by helping the humans develop differently. Thanks to the complex system of upgrades and synergies, the game provides you with an endless amount of play time and play styles. There are 123 achievements to be unlocked and I would advise you not to focus on these as much since the randomization of the humans needs can slow you down. I tried to hunt these achievements down for three Era’s and then just started playing more strategically, suddenly unlocking five achievements unintended. However, don’t push these achievements to the side completely as you can only level up by completing an X-amount of achievements. By leveling up you will have access to even more projects, plants, animals and resources leaving you completely addicted to the game.\n\nFinal conclusion\nYou can say a lot of things about REUS, yet at the same time there isn’t much to say about the game since it completely blows you away. It’s logical and simple but it’s still capable of amazing you in every aspect. A must have for every casual gamer and even every hardcore gamer who wants to slow down every once in a while.\n\nScoring: 9/10\n\nThis review can also be found on NearlyEnoughDice.com","February 17, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Reus is a thinking game, and it rewards experimentation.\n\nSimple in concept, unique in visuals and smooth in execution, Reus lets you shape a 2-dimensional planet by terraforming the land with your Rock, Swamp, Forest and Ocean giants to create deserts, swamps, forests and oceans which you can then populate with wildlife and foliage. Once any such biome has been created, and any resource has been placed within it, humans will appear and the true game will begin.\n\nThe game is primarily about providing for humanity while monitoring how quickly they claim the resources you give them, lest they become greedy and have to be put down. While I doubt this is a new concept to the god-sim genre, I found Reus to be approachable enough for me to get sucked in despite historically not being a fan of said genre. The controls are fluid and clear, there is a great variety of things to toy and experiment with and the game actively rewards your experimentation with new and more powerful bonuses which, when combined with the unlimited number of retries, the free play mode and the simple goal of "develop humanity beyond X points" makes for an interesting experience that keeps you coming back to try more.\n\nOn the downside, the game's replayability runs a bit short when you complete all the objectives, and there seems to be a glitch that lets you unlock achievements on the "easy" mode (which is normally supposed to disable achievements). In addition, the randomness of human development can often be a pain and you may find yourself frustrated by that one village who refuses to try a different project than the one you keep denying, no matter how many times you destroy it.\n\nA more subjective downside is the simple slow pace - your giants move slowly, resources are gathered slowly, abilities have significant cooldowns - which is all the more pressing an issue when you have 7 different human villages you're trying to manage at once. This could be also be considered part of the game's difficulty however, and some enjoy a slower-paced experience.\n\nOver all, I thoroughly enjoyed Reus and would absolutely recommend it, especially for it's low price ($10CAD at time of this writing). Even if you aren't normally a fan of god sims, I would recommend picking this up on sale and giving it a try - it might surprise you.","April 15, 2015","true","57.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I picked it up for $2 and I have no regrets.  I do not usually play games like this, so I was a little bit hesitant as to whether or not I would enjoy it, but I can say with absolute certaintity that this game is fun for the right audience.\n\nIt plays like an RTS, you have 4 elemental godlike giants that control and shape the planet so that the humans can develop there villages.  You need to manage resources and make sure that the villages do not get too greedy otherwise wars will break out (these wars usually don't take too long anyways).  Each giant has the ability to create it's own biome, as well as their own resources.  It's the little things that matter, but I enjoyed that even though you would use the same giant to create plants or animals, it would spawn different plants or animals depending on what biome you are using (e.g. with the same giant you could place chickens in the forest biome and kangaroo rats in the desert biome).\n\nAs an incentive to keep playing, there is a levelling up system.  The more you level up the more resources you unlock in terms of plants and animals, which is a good way to keep the player motivated.  One thing that I disagreed with is that you also have to level up to unlock different play times; for example, you start out with 30 minute trials and once you reach level 2 you're allowed to use 60 minute games, etc.  I would have preferred if you could unlock every game time from the beginning.  However, Freeplay mode is unlocked at the beginning, which is a nice addition.  In Freeplay you don't have to worry about helping the humans build a certain amount of projects in the allotted time period, but you also don't level up or unlock anything in Freeplay.\n\nTL;DR if you're looking for a fun, godlike RTS game to pass the time with then this is a great game to pick up, especially if it is on sale.

It allows the player to be creative as possible when distributing diverse and interesting landscapes across their Earth. Different combinations of plants, animals, herbs, and villages allow for symbiosis and transmutations to occur, leading to an even more diverese world than the last! I recommend this game, although the beginning is quite slow and tedious due to there being three tutorials, all of which you should play however to get used to the controls and the environment. You will need to know everything from these tutorials, so study up! This game is definatley worth the $2.49 I paid for it during the Steam Summer Sale and I recommend it. This game is not, however, for smaller children, as it can  become very confusing and complicated at times.

Controlling 4 giants acients with 7 'skills' each; you have got to terraform the world into a habitable place before the ancients return back to their slumber.  You're working against the clock here, and the more you vary your playstyle - the more terraforming options and tweaks are available to you for your next playthrough.  Probably because of this - the replayability is VERY rewarding; couple it with the fact that each game is a SET time (30mins / 60mins / 120mins) - it's a game that you can 'budget' your time for quite well.  It won't stop you from sinking MANY hours into it though.\n\nI thoroughly recommend this.  Having just come out of my first BIG slog of playing, I am actually still itching to go back and carry on.

Very relaxed game where it's up to you to help human civilizations prosper as much as possible within a time limit.  It can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be.  I don't like how I have to wait for the elemental gods to walk all the way across the map just to do an action.  If they are gods shouldn't it be instantly?  I don't like how humans can attack the gods either.  Gods can't be hurt by mere mortals so calling them gods in the first place is kind of stupid.  They are like giants with super powers.  Fun game.

Also at the end of a game you unlock new environments and projects for the next games.\nThe combination of simplicity of the game mechanics and the depth/replayability is very good.\n\n","April 1, 2014","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It allows the player to be creative as possible when distributing diverse and interesting landscapes across their Earth. Different combinations of plants, animals, herbs, and villages allow for symbiosis and transmutations to occur, leading to an even more diverese world than the last! I recommend this game, although the beginning is quite slow and tedious due to there being three tutorials, all of which you should play however to get used to the controls and the environment. You will need to know everything from these tutorials, so study up! This game is definatley worth the $2.49 I paid for it during the Steam Summer Sale and I recommend it. This game is not, however, for smaller children, as it can  become very confusing and complicated at times.

What is so nice about this game is how the scope is limited, but allows a ton of replayability and variation in each play. This game makes you decide on what to specialize each village in, food, tech, wealth and awe for example. This means you can have several forest villages with all varying focuses. This will change to meet your goals and village projects. Also the giants get ability boots from the villages, so you can see how the resources, village types, and giant type can lead to a lot of varying combinations. Its fun and rewarding. Plus you can tell there is a lot of thought and effort into fleshing out the small aspects of this game, i.e. the resources, their animations and development tree.","January 1, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals of this game are stunning, and the mechanics are very straight forward. The game, and its tutorials, do a very good job of slowly introducing you to the concepts and then letting you gain control of them yourself. In addition, the individualization for each Giant and what you can accomplish is vast, allowing many different styles of play and adaptions to the game. The major issue, however, is that the text box is very small and hard to read/follow, deterring many from even playing the game.

You're working against the clock here, and the more you vary your playstyle - the more terraforming options and tweaks are available to you for your next playthrough.  Probably because of this - the replayability is VERY rewarding; couple it with the fact that each game is a SET time (30mins / 60mins / 120mins) - it's a game that you can 'budget' your time for quite well.

The main game mode gives you reign of a 2D globe for a set period of time (from half an hour at the shortest to two hours at the longest) and leaves you to achieve whatever goals you choose within that time, with the suggested goals that unlock new items being things like making a city that prospers using only animals and minerals, or making a particularly large city. The strategic element of the games comes from achieving each city's goals using the limited number of tiles around them by taking advantage of symbiotic combos, such as a predator that gets a bonus from being around smaller animals, or a plant that grows better next to mineral deposits.\n\nWhile there is a free play mode, I prefer the structure that the goals offer, since they challenge the player to try new things and new playstyles. The limited time sessions are also a good design decision, since they avoid the weakness that some sandbox games have of dragging on for too long and becoming formless. I find that Reus is a good game to dip into for a session at a time, try a few new goals, relax a little but also think a little, and if that sounds like the kind of game you'd like to have in your library I would highly recommend it.","December 24, 2013","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While you do play a godlike being in charge of building a world, little of the game involves direct interaction with the population. You will seldom use attacks on cities or armies.\n\nRecommendation: If you like puzzles involving synergy, this game is for you. Each resource has a certain bonus effect that occurs when conditions are right, and the vast majority of gameplay is spent figuring out how to maximize synergistic outputs. For some projects, these synergies must be very precisely managed indeed. Often success comes down to a single configuration of resources boosted precisely by aspects.\n\nWhen you start play, most of the resources will not be available, along with the 60 minute and 120 minute game modes. Completing a variety of objectives unlocks the resources you will need to complete the hardest projects. Objectives can only be completed during the regular game modes, but you are free to experiment at any time in the 'Alt' mode, where a number of conditions will make the game easier to mess around with.\n\nI found this game very fun and entirely worth the $5 or so I spent on it when it was on sale. It took me about 50 hours to unlock every resource, and I may still go back to complete the 60 minute challenge achievements at a later time. There are a few errors in the printed synergies. For instance, a Snow Leopard will gain the listed gold and danger boosted for each zinc or silver in range, not just once. (Exploit this if you want a gigantic amount of gold and danger from one Snow Leopard.)\n\nGreed can be frustratingly hard to combat. However, with careful play, greed is usually completely avoidable. Keep danger high, or keep the resource gain under the awe. Never let greed go above 3 if you can help it.","January 5, 2014","true","61.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What is so nice about this game is how the scope is limited, but allows a ton of replayability and variation in each play. This game makes you decide on what to specialize each village in, food, tech, wealth and awe for example. This means you can have several forest villages with all varying focuses. This will change to meet your goals and village projects. Also the giants get ability boots from the villages, so you can see how the resources, village types, and giant type can lead to a lot of varying combinations. Its fun and rewarding. Plus you can tell there is a lot of thought and effort into fleshing out the small aspects of this game, i.e. the resources, their animations and development tree.","January 1, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals of this game are stunning, and the mechanics are very straight forward. The game, and its tutorials, do a very good job of slowly introducing you to the concepts and then letting you gain control of them yourself. In addition, the individualization for each Giant and what you can accomplish is vast, allowing many different styles of play and adaptions to the game. The major issue, however, is that the text box is very small and hard to read/follow, deterring many from even playing the game.

Its a classic style god game where you indirectly shape civilizations by terraforming and can directly affect them with powers such as earthquake.  There is a surprising amount of depth to the game, with different biomes multiple synergies between different plans, animals, and minerals in those biomes, and you control the placement and upgrading/transmuting of these with your giants, which can in turn be upgraded in different ways via ambasadors, which the towns give you when you complete projects.\n\nOn the whole the game is well balanced and enjoyable, with progression provided via unlocks from acheivements, each game has a time limit so you must persue specific goals to be able to progress within the time.\n\nOn the downside its a bit slow to get going and you will need plenty of patience to get into it properly, but if you have enjoyed god games in the past then this is a classic example that you will almost certainly enjoy too.","December 31, 2013","true","31.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main game mode gives you reign of a 2D globe for a set period of time (from half an hour at the shortest to two hours at the longest) and leaves you to achieve whatever goals you choose within that time, with the suggested goals that unlock new items being things like making a city that prospers using only animals and minerals, or making a particularly large city. The strategic element of the games comes from achieving each city's goals using the limited number of tiles around them by taking advantage of symbiotic combos, such as a predator that gets a bonus from being around smaller animals, or a plant that grows better next to mineral deposits.\n\nWhile there is a free play mode, I prefer the structure that the goals offer, since they challenge the player to try new things and new playstyles. The limited time sessions are also a good design decision, since they avoid the weakness that some sandbox games have of dragging on for too long and becoming formless. I find that Reus is a good game to dip into for a session at a time, try a few new goals, relax a little but also think a little, and if that sounds like the kind of game you'd like to have in your library I would highly recommend it.","December 24, 2013","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. You said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And upon the desolate planet, you created four great giants, aspects of your divine will. They toiled, carving ocean trenches and raising mountains; planting forests and filling swamps with all sorts of beautiful creatures and strange planets. And finally, the first humans appear in the shadows of the giants as they stood guard to protect your creation. Such is Reus, a new 2D god game created by Abbey Games and released earlier this summer.\n\nWhen I first played this game, I admittedly thought of Black & White right away: shepherding humanity on its way through indirect influences—though instead of animals, you have elemental giants to do your bidding. Mind you, this is something completely different, a sort of puzzle/strategy simulator kind of package.\n\n...\n\nWith surprising complexity, great graphics, and addictive gameplay that always keeps you on your toes, Reus is an awesome game and a great second title from Abbey Games. I can’t wait to see what else is in store for both this franchise and these developers.","July 20, 2013","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especially since the game gets more and more complex with every single thing you do and considering the complexity (what plant goes next to what animal to give me what output? or was it two plants? reading tooltips, upgrading one plant or animal and the whole system is broken and you can't find a way to fix it) 30minutes (the games "campaign mode") is just not enough. The simple fact to be able to "pause" the game (whilst still being able to issue commands to the giants) is of little help, as the giants need ages to get from one spot to the other anyway; and since you have to read the tooltips all the time (unless you are a walking wiki of plot-combinations) you basically would pause/play/pause/play/pause/play all the time. And after 30mins it's all over and you have to repeat that by getting achievements to activate the 60mins. And it starts all over again, just 30mins longer. (as I am still trying to activate the other game modes, I didn't use the advanced settings mode to change the world, yet, nor did I use the free play)\n\nIt comes with its complexity and sometimes a little frustration, despite that it's still a fun game.

Rebuild life on the planet after your deep slumber with four giants of Earth, Swamp, Water and Forest. It's always interesting to watch how humanity develops and see the true nature of humans as you either aid them in their society, or make some more room for a more deserving group. Beating this game actually depends on your achievements in creating a sustainable environment for all of life. There are many different achievements that you will want to blaze through to get to the next level that grants you more time to play with the little people. Gameplay is pretty solid and the art style is very simplistic which I like.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jdonftw/recommended/222730/","jdonftw","jdonftw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jdonftw/","243 products in account","In Reus you control four giants who all have their own unique abilites to affect the planet. The goal of the game is to create prosperous villages. Prosperity is gained by having the giants create animals, plants, and minerals for the villages, which in turn give food, tech, and wealth. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. To maximize prosperity, you need to take into account symbioses and transmutations. Both of these concepts take a while to get the hang of and use efficiently (at least for me). And if a village becomes too prosperous, they become greedy and will attack other villages and even the giants. This creates a whole new facet of gameplay, leading you to put the village in danger, take away resources... or even destroy the village. Each giant can create a different biome, meaning each village you create can evolve differently.\n\nWhat I find interesting about this game, as an avid achievement hunter, is that achievements (developments) must be obtained to progress in the game. Earning achievements unlocks new game modes, resources, projects, etc. If you aren't a fan of achievements, you may find this annoying. Well, earning these achievements actually acclimates you to the game, and gives you the chance to experiment differently every time you play. I find myself planning each game I play in advance in order to maximize achievement gain.\n\nTo those who say the game is boring and repetitive, yer doing it wrong. The ability to have villages develop differently every time you play creates massive replay value. My advice: buy the game. If it's too expensive, wait for a sale. But either way, I suggest you give it a try.","February 16, 2014","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have awoken four enormous servants to do your bidding, and make the surface inhabitable while driving the humans who come to live there to ever-greater heights of development.\n\nThis is a strategy game.\n\nAt its heart is what is a little like a logistical card game. By having your giants place "patches" of various kinds, they synergise with other kinds to give various bonuses to production, which are used by the villages to complete random projects. Goals are given by the 'developments', which map directly to achievements and unlock extra improvements. They range from relatively simple, such as 'have a forest village with X prosperity" to quite difficult, such as "get a village to X prosperity using only mines".  It's quite slow-paced, but the time limits and your villager's whims can make it quite tense.","July 16, 2013","true","36.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Completing projects for the villages will help you unlock other types of plants, animals and minerals. Of which there is quite a bit.\n\nThe game can become a tedious and repetitive in the beginning, when you still need to learn the different combinations.  The time in the begining rounds is also quite limited until you get to the second level and you have 60 minutes in which you have to complete the different projects.  On the third level you get 120 minutes per game. (Still need to get there)\n\nThere is also a freeplay option, but this will not allow you to unlock anything or get any of the achievements.  I would only use this when I have unlocked everything.\n\nOverall I like this game.  The graphics is nice and the UI is quite easy to use.

Too much of the game experience is sacrificed for the sake of the whole "giant" fantasy. All of your commands feel unresponsive because you have to wait for your incredibly slow giants to move for each order, and then complete a painstakingly slow animation when they get there. This delay adds up and can account for literally 30-50% of your actual time "playing" in any given round. The animations are charming and immersive at first, but quickly become a source of frustration.\n\n2. The game relies on "randomly generated math problems" to create the majority of its depth. Since you have control over the placement of absolutely everything, the only thing in the game that actually poses a "challenge" and offers a "reward" is the completion of your humans' randomly generated "projects". These projects require you to meet certain "productivity" targets, and doing so requires you to solve a complex math problem to determine which resource placements will grant you the correct symbiosis/specialization benefits to meet the target.\n\nBecause of the way the "Ambassador" system works for unlocking your giants' powers, you have very few options early to solve very easy problems. Then later on you have tons of choices, but usually ONLY ONE RIGHT ANSWER, or possibly no answer at all depending on how you slotted your Ambassadors.\n\nMath problems are tolerable once in a while, but it's the hallmark of a "god game" that you get to make lots of "fun" choices that really tailor your world and your experience to match your own playstyle. Reus offers none of that.\n\n3. The initial experience does a good job of guiding you through the basics, but then the game throws you at a wall of "achievements" that you have to complete to unlock additional "choices" (Possible solutions to the aforementioned math problems). Your initial set of choices is very limited, so naturally the goal is to complete these "achievements" ASAP.\n\nThese achievements are all very similar and can generally be completed at a rate of 6+ per game if you do your math well. But then you move on to the next set, and it's all the same challenges with bigger numbers. Get 600 Prosperity. Ok now 1200. Ok now 2400... It's really just completing longer and longer games and bigger math problems, and no other twists or challenges added in.\n\nI would have much rather been presented with a series of carefully crafted and themed "challenges" with specific goals that all feel distinct from one another. If you ever played "Sim Earth" back in the day and did, for example, the Mars/Venus terraforming challenges, that's what I'm talking about.\n\n--\nALSO: There's a major bug where your Forest Giant can get "stuck", and the only way to fix it is to Save/Load your game.\n\nAll in all, it's clear that the developers put a lot of effort into this game, and it was a very fun and polished experience until it started feeling repetitive about ~3 hours in. I would recommend spending a few hours with it if you can get it on sale, but I wouldn't consider it worth the full purchase price.","December 25, 2013","false","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But this game, among many others, tried to do something that has become a trend of indie's lately: It is trying to be "more" than it actually is. I say this because this game has LOADS of content. so many unlockables and achievements and fun things that just look pretty. But thats where the list of good things ends (except maybe the controls, which by the way are flawless IMO). Ive played enough of this game to unlock 90% of everything and found myself wanting more, which is not a good sign. Dont get me wrong, this game is amazing and i WOULD recommend this game... if there wasnt a lack of solid story. The only actual story is the tutorial... yes you read that right. I love games that let you craft your own story and make a new world each time, but this isnt that. This is a game that allows you to build and build and build until you cant build no more (or run out of time). But there is no objectives (except those that are required for a building) and there's no element to this game that truely makes this game stick out other than an interchangable/interlinking environment. Sounds very nice doesnt it? Well it is, for 5 minutes. Then its a hassle to deal with.\n\nSo to wrap this up im going to finish with my honest opinion of this game: Its beautiful, its a great time waster, and it can be a good stress-reliever. But that isnt enough for this to be considered a good, long-lasting game. Buy it if you'd like. In the end you'll come to the same conclusion i have.","May 29, 2014","false","63.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

You basically are mix and matching different pieces of life that synergize with each other to complete objectives. It's almost like those element combining games mixed with Tetris, since you don't have much room to do all this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/222730/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","Reus is probably my favorite god-game of the past decade.\n\nAt its core, the game is something of a 2D (or really, technically 1D) Sim City RTS. You cannot directly control humanity, but you create and arrange resources in order to help them thrive. Villages need Food, Wealth, and Tech, which can be gained in various combinations from Animal, Plant, and Mineral resources.\n\nIt may not be obvious from the screenshots, but the planet is divided up into individual tiles. Each tile can only be occupied by one resource or building at a time, though you can usually "overwrite" a tile's contents.\n\nYou direct your four giants (Ocean, Rock, Forest, Swamp) to terraform the world's surface and to place resources on specific tiles. Eventually humans will settle near a resource, reserving several contiguous tiles as a town square, and setting up borders a certain distance from the square. As a village develops, the borders will be pushed back, opening up additional tiles for the village to use.\n\nMost of the game's progression is context-sensitive.\n\nGiants have vague powers, such as "Create Exotic Animal," but the TYPE of animal is determined by which biome (Forest, Swamp, Desert, Mountain, Ocean) the power is cast upon.\n\nIndividual resources may grant bonuses depending on what occupies the adjacent tiles (Salt is more useful if there is a different mineral right next to it).\n\nGiants are able to upgrade the attributes of certain resources. For example, the Swamp Giant is able to increase the amount of Tech provided by any plant tile. Improving aspects in this way unlocks the ability to upgrade the resource to a more valuable/effective (but often more specialized) resource. By manipulating aspects, you can develop Blueberries into either Strawberries or an Apple Tree. Each of those choices also has branching upgrades with different bonuses. In order to keep the choices from getting overwhelming, certain upgrades must be unlocked with achievements.\n\nThere are two separate classifications of animals, two of minerals, and two of plants. With all the valid combinations of resource-types and biomes, there are 25 possible entry-level resources, each with various upgrade paths.\n\nA village's "type" is determined by whether the town square is planted on Forest, Swamp, or Desert tiles. This will determine what sort of civic projects the villagers will want to build (Forest emphasizes agriculture, Desert emphasizes wealth, and Swamp emphasizes technology).\n\nVillages will occasionally decide to construct specialty buildings. In order to successfully complete these projects, the village must reach a certain quota of Food, Wealth, and Tech (or other factors) within a predetermined length of time. It's worth it to help villages reach these goals, because they unlock achievements and award you a village ambassador. Each ambassador can be assigned to one of your giants, who will as a result unlock (or strengthen) a creation or aspect power. The type of power affected is determined by what type of village provided the ambassador.\n\nEach village has a Greed meter. When a village acquires resources too rapidly, the Greed meter will fill, encouraging that village to attack neighbors (or the giants!). This is disruptive to your ability to efficiently and effectively develop these communities within the time limit (Once time runs out, your accomplishments are judged and you are allowed to continue playing, but some achievements must be reached while the clock is still ticking).\n\nThe real meat of this game comes from trying to shuffle your resources around within a village's borders in order to maximize context-specific bonuses, because the project the village wants to build just requires SO MUCH of a given resource (or several!) that it needs to be your singular goal. Except it's your multiple goal, because your other villages are also trying to build their own projects, and you can't upgrade this mineral over here until that giant walks over there and casts that aspect upgrade on it (Did I mention the giants have to walk to the tiles where you want them to take action? They're not fast). Since different projects have different dependencies, it's often necessary to maintain at least one of each type of village (Forest, Desert, and Swamp) to ensure a variety of ambassadors (and, by extension, upgrades).\n\nReus has vibrant art assets and a pleasant soundtrack. The game is fairly easy to pick up but the depth of it might catch you off-guard. You can also choose from a variety of modifiers (such as planet's size or a speed boost for your giants) when starting a new game. Some of these modifiers prevent you from unlocking high-level achievements, but they are a nice way to get a head start in what can easily turn into a several-hour session.\n\nIf you like Populous, Sim City, or Black & White, I would recommend giving this game a try.","September 30, 2014","true","25.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Maybe it was because since Black and White 1, I always enjoyed “God Games”, maybe because the artwork at the Steam Featured games showed a very neat and colorful game. The fact is that I decided to buy Reus pretty much with the full retail price.  And it was worth it.\n\n\nRight of the bat, let me say this: some people disagree that Reus is categorized as a “God Game”. It is different from the Black and White series (considering by many the gold standard of the genre), or even From Dust, since you don’t control directly a God or Entity.\n\nInstead of controlling a God, you have full control of 4 giants. Each of them have different abilities, weakness and strengths. Working together, they  mold a deserted and inhabited planet by terraforming or creating resources. When resources are laid and combined with several symbiosis, human settlers will appear and so begins the journey to transform the once deserted planet into a beautiful and lustful planet, full of civilized beings.\n\nBecause of the way the game works, it is more like a “resource managing, strategic planning and puzzle solver” kind of game. Since humans can become greed, you can’t give them a lot of resources, or they can destroy the other towns around them. In order to grow and become more developed, the villages need to complete project that demand different kind of resources or pre-requisites. This is the main objective of the game: give humans enough resources to complete projects, but don’t let them become greed. Know\n\nEvery game run is a 30 min, 1 or 2 hours Era, in which you will need to accomplish several achievements to unlock new resources and new projects. The game is very achievement and objective oriented, although you can “Free Play” it just for fun. The good part is the achievement fits very well with the game mechanic, you don’t have to go out of your way or grind and do repetitive tasks to get them. Your drive to have more resources, more prosperity, more projects is enough to motivate you to keep going. When an Era finishes and you start a new one, a brand new deserted planet will be generated and you and your 4 giants will start form scratch.\n\nThe game artwork and soundtrack are both amazing! I do have the soundtrack in my Spotify right now, for example. It is worth to listen to it by itself. The artwork is extremely well done, colorful and beautiful.\nI liked this game so much that I dedicated several hours of my free time to translate it from English to Brazilian Portuguese, in a community effort. When I was playing it (now I achieved everything and did everything I wanted to do), it overshadowed several AAA+ games that I have in my Library.\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t think there is a patch, DLC or Expansion on the way. The game is what it is. The Devs said time again that they think it is better to do a brand new Reus game them tweak on it gameplay right now (and I agree with them).\n\nAlso several people reported technical difficulties, mostly Mac users. The bright side is that the Devs are present (even on Steam Forums) and always try to solve the problems at hand, with good results sometimes.\n\nOverall, this game is worth it. It is a extremely well made game, fun to play and challenging. If you see it on a Bundle (it is on Humble Bundle sometimes) or a good offer, consider buying it!\n","June 4, 2014","true","95.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But in this game you don’t control a giant benevolent hand, able to squish your people between thumb and forefinger. You control gigantic… giants that wander around your planetoid, manipulating nature and the elements to help create the best possible ecosystems for all the villages that settle there. I’m going to call them titans since every time I play the game, I imagine the guys from Hercules.\n\nReus is very fun and by setting a strict time limit on each game, you don’t get carried away spending hours trying to perfect your planetoid, or trying to perfect a single village… which never happens since they inevitably get too greedy and turn on your, despite the generations of aid you have provided them.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2013/11/08/reus/","January 4, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Reus now seems more alive more of an experience. than when you first were greeted with that flat and dull earth. the controls are pretty\nstraightforward. your mouse serves as the primary movement for the gods left click to move right click to stop the mouse wheel, zzoms the view in and out, so you oh mighty player can take a closer look as to what is going on. also the arrow keys l and r will do the same, but I find the mouse far more easy to work with. and 1-f  are the gods powers.  OK I know, I know this is a long review, but reus is a game that is deceptively complex  and  requires the player to pay attention this is not a game that you can butten mash or watch the latest, episode of  the walking dead  giveing the game  halfassed  interest will make for a very unbalanced play and not to\nmention some very unhappy villagers! thinking of how to make everything flow, is done in a playful way you are encouraged, to take youre time to think things out and to even smile. reus is a game that wants you to feel good, from its beautiful  almost child like graphics to the whimsical music. this game is about joy and useing your thinking skills. think of Reus as civilization v that got thrown into a  nickalodion cartoon. but with a polt written by a biology major. give Reus a try  and know what it is like, to  have the power over a crab god who is friends with a  monkey who is also a tree. it will make sense trust me.","February 1, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was "The Perfect Game" but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10","February 2, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Though that the core elements are simple, and easy, to understand, especially the effects of synergies/symbiosis have to be mastered first so that you can actually dare to build the higher tier projects.\n\nThe unlock system is simple, complete an achievement, and if it contains a reward you get a new feature on how to upgrade your plants/mines, etc. Each era (or game) is parted into 30, 60 or 120 minutes lengths, which unlock as you progress in levels. There are 3 levels, 2 to earn, which give access to new ressource options aswell.\n\nEach giant has different abilities, in addition to their normal powers like planting bushes or other ressources, that become available as soon as this giant takes a certain ambassador onto its shoulders. Those are gained by completing building projects. These abilities give you access to moving ressources around or higher damage values for attacks (which you need to defend yourself, if a village becomes too greedy) or upgrade a ressource with either aspect of science, wealth or food, which are the only three ressources needed in the game. You can have up to four ambassadors on each giant.\n\nYou can activate different modificators before starting an era, that make gameplay much easier for beginners, but you are then unable to complete higher tier achievements, to unlock the last upgrade stages of ressources. This, in my opinion, adds just the right amount of difficulty. (Yet, I still gained 2 achievements in this alt mode, that were tagged as not achievable in alt mode, cough.)\n\nThere are five terrain types, consisting of forest/grassland, swamp and desert, with mountains and water/sea being the last two, though there are no villages to be built on either. Village types are, as you could guess, three, habitating the forest, swamp and desert. Every village in the different terrains wishes for different projects, and they also have a main ressource aswell to finish those\n\nEven though, that the game is cheap, and definitely worth its price, i would really like to see more updates, with more combinations, more natural ressources and upgrades.\n\nI hope, that I didn't forget to mention anything...","December 2, 2013","true","20.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Im_Special/recommended/222730/","Im_Special","Special","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Im_Special/","2925 products in account","Reus is a bad game that's bunch of random concept thrown haphazardly in without any care about how they fit together. Resources are just colored spheres that don't do anything other than meet arbitrary demands for various demands the villagers randomly give you. You have no control over what the r****ded chimps you watch over will decide to build or where they will s*** their worthless buildings. So good luck trying to accomplish your goals which depend completely on villagers a) deciding to build the right building b) getting the right goal/bonus for the building they build c) that they don't drop the building in middle of your tree chain and thus ensuring that you will accomplish absolutely f*** all during this game because without the synergy chain you have zero f***ing chance of collecting anything.\n\nYou would think that villages would require food to grow and other resources would fill other needs and thus guide the villages' development but nope, the dudes are happy to eat Wealth and Science and grow big. Or that the villagers would build the extra buildings depending on what resources they have at hand but nope, Food/Science mountain village will always build that Tax Office that you already have all achievements for and scream that they need f***ton of wealth !!STAT!, Wealth/Science forest village will build Granary without fail and who knows what the f*** swamp villages build, they live in swamp so they are probably actually r****ded.\n\nThere's also really no other gamemode than timed Sandbox, during which you try to accomplish achievements which give you access to more buildings, which do basically the same as old buildings except better so when your r****ded villagers demand five thousand more red spheres and also two thousand blue spheres, you can look at the last free plot you have free and then check your build options:\na) You have the required advanced building - Congrats, a winner is you! Have your giants squat that pile of rocks out and collect your savings.\nb) You don't have the required advanced building - Ignore that s***ty little village that will never progress more and give you the achis you despair for, pray for better RNG next round.\nThere's also the hilarious game mechanic where, if the resource source sits on blessed ground, it will have chance of jumping into SUPERADVANCED when you upgrade it. PERCENT CHANCE. Some of the building goals basically require you to get these sources, so you will be spawning, blessing, upgrading and demolishing sources for a while. Good luck. The giants also have cooldowns on their skills, probably to f*** you over at this because they also lumber around slow as all f***. Enjoy watching your morons slowly roll around and scratch their asses while you wait for something to finally happen.\n\nThis also brings up the upgrade mechanic, where the good stuff is locked behind Village Ambassadors. Help village build a building and they'll let one of your giants to pick up an ambassador, who gives THAT giant the Aspect of Forest/Swamp/Mountain. In practice this means that you first try to desperately see into future to figure out what Power you are going to need to complete next building and then figure out which of your giants has that Power. Did I mention that all the upgrades and powers are split among your four giants basically randomly? Having all buttons spread between four different a***oles allows you to wonder who had that power you need now and then remember it's on the worthless crab that's still at the bottom of the sea. Now watch him slowly waltz around the whole world to get to where you need him.\n\nOverall, my time playing Reus was split between, waiting for cooldowns to come off, waiting for giants to drag their asses to where I need them, wondering why my villagers are so r****ded and wishing I was playing a better game.","November 11, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There isn't any in-game way to overview all the possible resources, transmutations, aspects and synergies, so the player either has to constantly alt-tab or keep the whole system in their mind to achieve even the medium-difficulty unlocks.\n\nAlso, even though while advancing through the game the system of resources, transmutations, aspects and synergies quickly become VERY complex, the gameplay itself still stays quite repetitive and shallow with an overwhelming amount of micro-management needed. And players can only unlock more advanced resources by replaying the game over and over again, which just kills any remaining joy over the fresh concept and makes playing a chore. (It also doesn't help that you can only play fixed-length games, so even if you finish your goals for the given game early, you still have to micro-manage your way until the end of the half hour / 1 hour / 2 hours session.","December 17, 2013","false","8.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That's not bad, I could have done more research. What I was expecting was some sort of sandboxy world builder, where you add things and see how their affects spread or change what you currently worked on. Sort of like a "Mother earth" game where you call the shots but in the end you are just balancing things out so they work, with little variance. Is that the game's fault? Nope, if you enjoy this you will get a huge kick out the game and the pricetag is good.\n\nThat being said while I'm not into these games I'll probably go back at some point just so I get my money's worth. It's not worth it to me, so I can't give this a positive review. That being said though if you look at all the reviews in general there's some quality here.","October 6, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Game mechanics are simply boring. It is just about: "k units of parameter x is needed, place some y's. Parameter z is rising, you have to put some w's next to that q's". You do something, wait for the consequences, try to balance the numbers. God, those numbers... a very old fashioned way of game logic. Plus, you don't enjoy doing those things because basically you don't see them very much. All the plants, animals etc are simple undetailed miniature figures that wander in the background, they don't seem to interact with the environment. Graphics are very frustrating in that sense, making Reus no different than a board game, except you play it on your own.\n\nAfter all the tutorials, i didn't have any will to play this game.","June 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a little too overtly new-age environmentalist for my taste, but it has potential. Unfortunately, so far I have been very underwhelmed by the game-play. I'm not exactly sure why, but it's simply not all that fun. I'm going to keep playing it a bit more to see if it will grow on me. I think it's because there is no logical connection between all of the different abilities and upgrades for the giants. It's difficult to choose which path you want to go in upgrading, and it doesn't seem to make a huge difference anyway. If there is a Reus 2 ever-if they deal with some of the gameplay problems, I think this could be a great game.","December 9, 2013","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Rarley is a god game so simple and full of heart and charm. Playing inviisble giants that roam the world, givng and taking life gives the gameplay more meaning than one would think. The design behind these giants is very totemic and spiritual, and having to pick up devoted followers, or "ambassadors" in order to unlock most of thier full potentail makes them seem more wordly as well, a god without followers has little power.\nSeeing your creations grow, providing for them and occasionally wiping them out gives you a feeling like you've made something, like you've been actually produtive instead of playing a video game all day.\nMy only quibble with the game is a performance issue, You need a halfway decent Graphics card (i.e. one with a brand name like Nvidia or ATI attached) to run the game at the moment due to the engine and the limited staff Abbey Games actually has. Not to say that the potentail for beautiful graphics isn't wasted, Ultra high settings are fantastic and stunning.\nI thuroughly enjoy Reus and Highly reccomend picking it up, You can wait for a sale if you wish, but in my opinion, it more than earns it's ten dollar price tag","August 27, 2013","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On the face of it you'd presume it was a god-game but in actuality it is a puzzle crossed with a strategy game. The worlds you play are more like stages whereby challenges appear and you have to change the resources to meet the goals while attempting to limit how greedy you villagers become as you give them enough to progress to the targets needed for the challenge. As you play you kind of need to plan ahead a little as you can reach a point where you basically end up limiting your options or not really finding the optimum combination of Giant upgrades to suit the challenges appearing in the towns. While I wouldn't recommend this at full price I would certainly suggest checking it out when on sale.","July 17, 2014","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure, you have four giants you can control and you try to please humans by creating stuff, but the entire game revolves around putting either food, technology, or wealth-generating stuff on "patches" of ground. A town forms when you make a resource on a patch of ground, and the town is freaking tiny (its borders). You then have to place resources next to other resources which have synergies. If you don't use the right synergies, your resource totals won't go high enough. The entire game seems to revolve around putting the right resources next to other resources, and if you can't figure out what order to put them in, you have nothing to do in this game. The game doesn't seem to progress until you unlock a bunch of in-game challenge/achievement sort of things. If you don't unlock enough of them, you have to keep playing in 30 minute increments until you do. This game is a huge time-waster puzzle game wearing the indignantly sliced off face of a god game, and the puzzle aspect wasn't fun at all for me. I got the game for three bucks and I'm still not happy with this purchase. The only thing I will say I like about the game is the art. It's quite nice to look at, but you can get that from watching the trailer. The gameplay is horrid.","December 25, 2013","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's a little too overtly new-age environmentalist for my taste, but it has potential. Unfortunately, so far I have been very underwhelmed by the game-play. I'm not exactly sure why, but it's simply not all that fun. I'm going to keep playing it a bit more to see if it will grow on me. I think it's because there is no logical connection between all of the different abilities and upgrades for the giants. It's difficult to choose which path you want to go in upgrading, and it doesn't seem to make a huge difference anyway. If there is a Reus 2 ever-if they deal with some of the gameplay problems, I think this could be a great game.","December 9, 2013","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it's more like you control a bunch of Gods and make the planet into places where suddenly human tribes started to settle down and build towns and cities. And if they become greedy, they'll attack one another. Then you just simply destroy that aggresive tribe into dust.

On the face of it you'd presume it was a god-game but in actuality it is a puzzle crossed with a strategy game. The worlds you play are more like stages whereby challenges appear and you have to change the resources to meet the goals while attempting to limit how greedy you villagers become as you give them enough to progress to the targets needed for the challenge. As you play you kind of need to plan ahead a little as you can reach a point where you basically end up limiting your options or not really finding the optimum combination of Giant upgrades to suit the challenges appearing in the towns.

Give them too little and they will stay stagnant in time. Give them too much and they will turn into greedy devils. You control 4 elemental giants to shape the world to an ecology of your choice and while you can allow the world to prosper, there's a strong chance for the world to crumble and shatter.\n\nDo you want to create a mountain in a swamp village with blueberries beside a nest of poisonous frogs? Go ahead. Do you want to add sharks to the pier to force the people into a state of isolated fear? Up to you. Do you want to control your rock giant and level a whole village with two seismic punches? Sure.\n\nThese are all posibilities and the best part is, there is no right and wrong. It's a simulation game that relies on unlocking its unlockables to unlock (phew) more content in the game itself. For example, you can't exacly breed sharks if you have not completed, say, the challenge to win 5 wars. On the other hand, you can't unlock mango trees if you even had a war in a single session in the first place.\n\nThe game also introduces a mechanic known as the symbiosis system. It adds a lot more depth to the gameplay while still making it simple enough to follow from the get-go. It's a system that makes use of the the ecology within your village and how you link them all up together. The giants each possess a number of skills which are used to help produce and maintain the symbiosis of the village(s). Mastery over the system and the skills would ensure global prosperity and ultimately, that is the true main goal of the game.\n\nIts art style, music and atmosphere come together sweetly and makes for an enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of the genre, then by all means, give it a go. I highly doubt you will regret the decision.\n\n","January 16, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The jist of the game is that you control several giants, each with their own powers such as creating oceans, mountains, wildlife or minerals, and you try to create an environment in which a human settlement will start up and hopefully thrive. While this sounds like a fun god game, unfortunately, for me it was boring and cumbersome.\n\nThe main problem, as well as the real draw of the game, is that each ability that your giants have can synergize with another ability, meaning that if the two are together, they will produce more food, science, or minerals. While this good be a very interesting mechanic, allowing you to create strands of synergizing areas for a town, this element is stifled by the fact that each village can only have two plots of land on either side of it that it can use, so even when you have 40+ abilities to choose from and syergize, you can only do to synergies, then that place is done. On top of that, the giants move very slowly, for no apparent reason, meaning that the game takes much longer than it should to get things done, which can be a problem when each world has a time limit on it.\n\nUltimately I feel this could have been a very good game, but the fact that the giants take so long to get places and the creative and strategic ability of the player is limited by the small areas around settlements puts this game out of my mind as I move on to better games.","December 7, 2013","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game looked incredibly promising. However, there were a number of issues that prevented me from enjoying it enough to get further than the second tutorial.\n\nThe controls are absolutely abysmal. It requires a mouse output to control and activate things. However, rotating and adjusting the view for the game requires the use of the arrow keys. Not WASD, arrows. The abilities have a hotkey function already bound to each one, there's no rearranging or organizing them. The left hand homerow and first row contain the game's shortcut commands.\n\nIn order to play the game most optimally, you would need your right hand on the mouse, your left on the quick triggers, and a third hand to control the arrows.\n\nThis certainly wouldn't have been any sort of issue if the game developers had allowed you to remap controls, something that is becoming progressively more standard in PC titles. This is not offered here. I would have been happy to continue trying the game if I could map controls to use WASD and the number rows for view-movement and shortcuts.\n\nThe game seemed interesting enough to at the least try playing with these confusing controls. However, the game forces you to go through the tutorial in the beginning, there's absolutely no skipping it. so if you're a play-and-learn kinda person, that's not an option. Further, the tutorials are painfully linear. After I planted an ocean and a forest, while I was waiting for fruit to be planted, I had the ocean giant go create another ocean. I soon had two oceans and four forests, though I was primarily using jut one. When the next setting, the desert, came into play, the location I placed it had the forest and desert bordering one another. This either caused some odd interactions, or the game is just that difficult to handle and understand what is gong on. The game wants you to have one ocean, one forest, and a desert far away from them. No room for legitimate learning, just do each command forced upon you. There's also no (at least no easy and readily apparent) way to go back through the dialogue box.\n\nThey kindly label each patch with the wealth and food it produces, but that's about it. It makes reference of project patches, but nothing stood out as a "project patch." It also introduced symbiosis and specialization which had almost identical symbols in the text of the dialogue box. Remember how I mentioned there's no way to go back? It would have been great so I could reread the bits about project patches and symbiosis and specialization. Generally speaking, you want the player to be able to review things during the tutorial. Apparently not.\n\nThis game might very well be a great and interesting game. However, the tutorial is unhelpful, not all of the UI is clearly labeled and legible at a glance, and the octopus-based control system means that I have to awkwardly use my left hand in a traditionally right hand placement, and just forego the use of shortcuts altogether.\n\nStart with letting us remap controls. Then maybe the tutorial will be easier to bear and pay better attention to, letting us actually get to the game.","April 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was really, really looking forward to this game. And after playing it a while I came to the same conclusion. This isn't even a game. You can only progress by placing down the correct combination of improvements to make the next improvement to complete the goals. That's the game, and you can do it via memorization or with a webpage open. Everything else is visuals to accompany the mechanic of placing the right combination of improvements.\n\nDeveloper fail.\n","June 1, 2015","false","9.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The reason being that the game lags beyond recognition as soon as the people appear and make a village. It could possibly be my own computer, however I doubt this is the case as this machine runs much bigger and higher detailed games online with no lag whatsoever.

He saw Matthew and Victoria sitting across from each other, confused, he did not intervene. He stared intently in disgust, yet glued to the spot, in order to see clearly what was happening. Victoria rubbed Matthew's nipples ferociously. Matthew by this point was turned on to holy hell, and was ready to rip her clothes off. He loved the smell of her, her scent, her taste, her hair, all of it just made him desire her more. She smelled of raspberries and cassadea, his favorite. As she pressured her fingers into his nipples more and more, his raging erection hardened to that of a rock solid metapod. He moaned and squealed in pleasure, obviously never being touched this way before by Michael, it was new and it was exciting. She increased the speed of her hands, rapidly rubbing his nipples to the core. As her speed increases, so does Matthew's constant moans. The rushing of rubbing was tearing his insides apart.. He was ready to burst. In a sudden motion of pure euphoric emotion and pain, Victoria ripped Matthew's nipples off in an aggresive motion, blood and lactate juice splurged from the missing chunks on his breasts, he screamed in pleasure, shooting ♥♥♥♥♥ from his small but erect ♥♥♥♥♥, it sprayed on to Victoria's thighs, leaking into her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ almost instantaneous. They both sat bolegged apart from each other, staring intently, but happily at one another. Jason closed the door and began to shake rapidly.

Whats there is passable looking at whatever still frame you catch it but once all parts are moving you realize its a flash game with poor polish. The mechanics are unorigonal, unintuative, and bland and slow; though the game itself moves so fast that you are forced to pause it while all forms of your incredibly slow interaction tools are given time to catch up and damage controll.\n\n-Titans have 8 abilities each and atleast 2 of the 8 are combat abilities (I didnt get far enough to try two of them.)\n-There is no acruing of resources.\n-There are no forms of timers except the ocational failure timers that make you count the incredibly slow steps of your titans   even more than you do already as there is literally nothing els you can do while they are moving.\n-the humans are completely souless, the creators seem to think the human race can summed up in; ten skins, thirty two picture bubbles, and constant poorly executed war.\n-there is no goal, there is no story.\n-game rounds are 30 minutes... this is far to much, but thank god at the end of it you realize is over and it is impossible to win or lose so you can stop.\n-the interaction you do have boils down to A:s**t a brick of gold on them. B: derp some berrys or dumb animals which behave like berries into existance. C:Smash the humans with origonal donkey kong smash graphics while they two frame run back and forth.\n-There are no physics.

From personal experience during the first four hours of so I had an absolute blast trying out different combinations of powers and land types. It's quite enjoyable to unlock new structures and lands that can then help you achieve further unlocks.\n\nUnfortunately there is a mechanic where towns will actively go to war if they suddenly get too many resources, and if ther aren't any towns to attack they will prey on your titans. At first this was a nice challenge and forced me to try to up danger levels as well put the titans other skills to use. However when building upgrades are on a time limit you're forced into the position of increasing resources and boundaries, but then if the resources you need don't produce danger you have to put up with beating down warring jackasses for the next couple of minutes until they finally simmer down.\n\nIt is unbelivably frustrating and it is unfortunate because up until that moment it was a fun game. Perhaps there was some secret method or technique I hadn't discerned to make the game less aggravating in the longer modes? I think it bears repeating that Reus is looks amazing and the general gameplay is interesting and enjoyable - up to a point. You will at least wring a few hours out of it, but if you're a completionist you will have to weather some extremely trying mechanics.","June 17, 2014","false","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But something about the charm of it lead me to anticipate its release.\n\nReus takes everything wrong with humanity and wraps it up in an atmosphere of childish innocense--- a beautiful take on our own world and on who we are.\n\nThe gameplay, smooth and accomodating, can be called puzzle-solving on analysis but does not feel that way at all; it feels like everything you do is for a reason and yields a natural consequence as in any good simulator. The challenge and reward system also makes for a heap of replayability and excitement for more to work with as you progress.\n\nMy only wish is that there had been more content and greater limits to strive toward--- but that is my desire of any great game.

And worth the money (at least sale prices!).\n\nAs you can see the aim is to command giants to build and shape the world to allow villages to grow.\n\nThere are 3 short tutorials that outline the basics and then you progress from early eras to later ones, each giving you more time to complete the goals. These goals are called unlocks and are basically achievements, which then level you up.\n\nThe game has the correct pacing; the games last 30+ minutes, each task inside a game gives you 10/15 to complete, though they don't take that long... and yet there's always something more to do and a higher score to reach.\n\nThe graphics are 'cute', very cartoony but quaint and adhering and gives the game a non too serious approach.\n\nI got it on daily deal at £1.50 and after 2 hours I've already had my enjoyment's worth out of it, and yet I've unlocked 7 from about 60 unlocks/in game achievements.\n\nNow I'm not a very good gamer, so at some point I won't be able to do more of these challenges. No worries, there's also a freeplay mode, where you can just build up your planet however you want with no worries to over arching objectives for the unlocks... though you cannot progress either. It's more like a skirmish in an RTS game for eg. But this mode by itself is something I'd come back to for a few hours at a time to chill out and watch the world grow.\n\nOverall a unique styled game, lots of fun, right level of challenge; increasing as you progress, and for a couple of quid it's a real valuable game to own.","December 31, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willdotwhite/recommended/222730/","willdotwhite","The British Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willdotwhite/","142 products in account","Reus is a world-building simulation style game, where your god-like interaction with the world is done by way of four giant monoliths with magical powers. You and your four vast minions will help grow small settlements of nomads into bustling village-sized cities, providing the citizens with enough resources to survive, expand and thrive. At first glance Reus seems like a very small and simple god game done a thousand times before, but upon further inspection the game reveals a huge level of complexity that is both shocking and fantastically deep.\n\nReus only really has one real gameplay mode – Era . The aim of Era is to work towards completing all of the available achievements in the game, and Reus serves up a generous dose of replayability with a staggering 120-odd levels to grapple with. This replayability is thanks in no small part to the curious way in which you control the lives of your nomads.\n\nThe mysterious Planet of the Creepy Giants is an artistic 2D slice of barren rock onto which the environments, plants, animals and minerals are spawned from your giant helpers, and the lack of space means efficiency is key. A village might start a project to complete a school or church, and it’s up to you to find the space to squeeze in the mind-numbing amount of food, wealth or technology the project requires. Enter symbiosis,the mechanic where every object your giants summon has the potential to interact with nearly any other object in the game and every base object has about 4 – 6 different ways to evolve.\n\nReus is a very pretty game to play, if a little repetitive at times. Your 2D slice of planet-pie has a 3D-like surface. The game’s major weakness is the lack of art assets, borne from its small development roots. When every blueberry bush and snake den has the same picture, a row of the same resource breaks the immersion of world-building somewhat, and replaces it with a slightly lesser world-assembly feel instead, and this jarring sensation does hurt the feeling of power and mastery a good god game strives for.\n\nSimilarly due to the small team the game was built by, the other major weakness Reus suffers is a poor user interface. The graphics options allow users with poor eyesight to change the resolution to the lowest settings, but even when all the icons and fonts are as large as possible the tutorial text proves impossible to read without 20/20 vision. The few controls the player has on-screen are so minimal and unnoticeable, the tooltips and hotkets are in approximately font size 6. While such a minor graphical issue might go unnoticed by the majority of players, Reus is almost certainly not appropriate for players with less than perfect eyesight.\n\nThat said, once the game gets going and the Era progressing, Reus has a huge amount to offer to keep a player engaged. All of the players’ efforts are focussed on pleasing the tiny humans who settle in your lovingly planned environments, and when your forest-dwelling humans plan to open up a world-class mine there are a few options before you, depending on what sort of god you want to be. You could form a large amount of forest-based minerals around the tiny village, terraform a forest into a mountainside landscape or just burn the village down and hope the next squad of settlers aren’t as greedy. A word of warning, however – if a new village settles amongst in a land of plenty, they are much more likely to become greedy and violent.\n\nWeaknesses aside, Reus is a new twist on a god game with a huge amount of gameplay behind it for those who can bear their way through the slightly arduous tutorial. It offers at least 30 hours of entertaining god play, with the ability to command your mountainous workers to bless or crush human villages as you see fit, and that is no bad thing.\n\n7/10","April 26, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it looked "AMAZING!!!". Being able to shape your own world and rule over villages with 4 gods. However of all the games I got excited for and bought the second it came out... It was just "ok". It was fun for the first round goofing around with the giants, testing out their skills. But then like that the 30 minute timer was over. I tried to unlock the 60 minute mode but I realized this isn't a goof off god simulator, it's a strategy game. Giving the resources to whichever village needs it, smiting the vilages that have become bloodthirsty or who defy you. And that may seem  fun. But it isn't. I have played over 22 hours trying to unlock the 1 hr mode but I am not that good in this game, because it isn't meant to be fun it is meant to be a puzzle to get achievments to unlock more game time (and buildings) to unlock more achievements. And really that's all this game is. Before each session you can choose which 3 of the many acheivments you'd like to strive for. It sold itself as a fun god simulator. While it is, it just isn't really that fun after the initial first hour or 2.\nThis game would be perfect for people who love a challenge and figure out the best way to put the earth together.\nBut I am not that person. In the end it's just an "ok" game. If the timer wasn't so limiting it might be better. (Oh also there is an infinite time mode but it just isn't satisfying because you have to unlock a ton of buildings from the timed sessions.)","August 4, 2014","false","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beginning from player-directed general biome placement (small islands? long mountain ranges? Endless swamps?) to placing animals, plants and minerals around the villages that spring up to live off of them. From there, managing symbiotic effects gives a sense of juggling the welfare of a planet while still encouraging experimentation. The scoring system is crystal clear and provides helpful goals without fussing over every last point of wealth or food. Finally, as cities develop, trying to control the people within them indirectly either by managing dangerous environments or building respectful awe with your creation adds yet another dynamic to the game.\n\nThe weakness of Reus is probably its overwhelming complexity: beyond having to balance many systems, there is an almost endless amount of minutae (transmutation paths and required essences, which ambassador boosts what, the symbiosis effect for each resource) the wiki, or cheat-sheets of your own creation, are almost necessary.","August 13, 2014","true","57.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reus contains many differnt stratergies to make a thriving planet of differnt civiliztions. I personally love this game and i would reccomend it. There are so many things to try and do. One of my favourite things is seeing my villages change from tiny tents big stone castles.\nThe villages fight and the troops automatically upgrade from having small swords to guns. I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys playing God games and raisng and destroying countless civiliztions. Also it has a good price for what this game can offer.\n","August 15, 2014","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spawnoftheflames/recommended/222730/","spawnoftheflames","Spawn Of The Flames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spawnoftheflames/","56 products in account","Reus plays almost like a card game. The planet is split into tiny sections were you can place your 'cards' (plants, animals or minerals) and these differ depending on the land type they're placed on (swamp, forest, desert, mountain and sea). These "cards" for my analogies sake, work in combination with those surrounding, either the section next to it, a highlighted range around it or the village's range. Together they give bonuses to one another and give your villages their resources.\n\nYou are the planet and you help the villagers using your giant avatars. The villagers will want resources for projects, complete these and your giant can pick them up, unlocking a skill. These skills can be used to transform the 'cards' you've put down into more advanced or specialised 'cards' making the combos etc more complex. You can unlock the advanced and specialised cards by completing achievements in the game. Your villagers will get greedy if you spoil them however and destroy other villages through war. You don't have a faction, you gain skills by having villages of different land types so you want to keep everyone flourishing. To try and keep your greedy villages at bay you have to provide them with dangers that keep them occupied in the form of predators or dangerous mines etc but this is quite difficult and occasionally you may need to intervene with your giants. Villages may turn on you and attack your giants if they are unhappy, not in enough awe of the giants or just greedy but eventually enough pummeling will set them straight.\n\nAs well as unlocking more of the advanced/specialised 'cards' to place you will also unlock longer play time as well. So each time you play you start of with a dead planet but have a few more tricks up your sleave allowing you to advance farther quicker and with more time in which to do it. After a few goes it felt like I was playing the same game over and over but depending on your villager's projects depends on what you place, how your planet looks and which skills you can unlock for that particular playthrough. So it always ends up different and the more you achieve the more you unlock. A very addictive game, with a bit of a learning curb as you learn what all the skills the 'cards' have. Its really satisfying get good combos working however. I'd highly recommend the game if you like strategy or card games but won't mind if their aren't actually any cards.","June 29, 2014","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a few months before I came back. I found the Walkthrough page on wiki.reusgame.com gave me enough pointers on my return to properly get into more advanced town-building tactics, focussing on using the symbiotic relationships a bit better. I do still have to pause the game a lot to check reference charts, but with regular playing they're becoming more familiar.\n\nI am a big fan of strategy games, and I think if you're not then your interest in Reus may be short lived. Except that I guess if you like god-games for the "Release Godzilla!" type of actions, then Reus will allow you to build a world and then watch it burn in a variety of ways.

It sometimes can take a while to actually develop a village and I would would say thats its only downfall. 8.5/10","September 15, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Starts a little slow but much of the advancement comes from unlocking challenges which give you more variety of plants, animals and minerals. Later games adds more complexity as you try to balance city growth while keeping greed down, replacing sources with higher level options and ensuring the giants have the right abilities.\nNice animation and cute design.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ujuidarehcram/recommended/222730/","ujuidarehcram","UjuidarEhcram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ujuidarehcram/","989 products in account","Reus is a sim game where you control four giants capable of terraforming the planet to make it a place where human villages can thrive. But, if you give them too much, they may turn against each other or against you. Each time you play, your progress will allow you to build bigger, better things the next time around.\n\nI love these types of sim games, and I've had a ton of fun with Reus. I love trying to figure out the best way to give my village as much food as possible so they can build the next upgrade in the small amount of space they have. There are many ways to go about playing, and lots of viable strategies. Greed can make the game tough at times, though, because some of the villages will gain greed without provocation and start burning other villages down, which gets annoying at times.\n\nThe graphics are simple and colorful, and they do their job well. The sound and music are fine. The game controls fairly well. My biggest criticism against this game is that the tech tree is pretty complex, and there's no way to pull up a map of it inside the game.\n\nIf you like sim games or slower-paced strategy games, Reus is definitely worth buying.","July 23, 2013","true","49.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The giants' inability to directly control humanity proves to make this an interesting and very rewarding game.  Reus is definitely worth a try.","November 25, 2013","true","53.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it had some fast forward bar or something on it, i would put more hours onto it.\nIf you feel like playing something while you watch TV or something its a good game.\nVery pretty, and interesting idea.\n","December 28, 2013","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
