I like adventure games, and while this type of "adventure game" isn't what say Gabriel Knight or QFG was, it's still fun especially when I have nothing else to play. It's also luckily not a hidden object game, disguised as an adventure game. It looks good and has a good atmosphere, and so far I was digging it as much as the Drawn series. I kept having these crash to desktops with a pop up dialog box saying "error in gc" (which, given it's made in Unity means a garbage collection issue). Minor inconvenience which I readily ignored as restarting put me right back where it left off. However, I got to a point halfway through the game where I was reading a diary I uncovered from a locked safe (won't spoil it, but it's in the place soon after you get the 1/2 way done achievement) and it crashed while reading the first page. Restarted, put me right back at the first page so I thought whatever, no big deal. Got 2 more pages in and it crashed again. Restarted and on the main menu it told me my profile was corrupt and it was DELETED. So all progress completely wiped and now I would have to start all over again. Which I'm not doing because how do I know I'm not just going to run into a similar bug at some other point.","September 7, 2014","false","1.6"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","26","33","0","1"

The fun and varied puzzles are just the cherry on top.\n\nLong version:Shaman Games is known for their casual point ‘n’ click adventures that use every element associated with modern hidden object games, with one exception: there are no hidden object scenes in them. Dreamscapes: The Sandman is another one of these.\n\nAs the title suggest, the story is about dreams. We play as an unnamed (male) volunteer who enters the dreams of a famous violinist in order to save her from a nightmare entity that wants to take over her body. Her dreams range from rather mundane to high fantasy, giving ample opportunities to showcase different worlds that never overstay their welcome.\n\nSince this game relies only on item collection and puzzles, it tries to offer as much variety as possible, with good success. Progress is never too easy or difficult, and the minigames are quite fun. In other words, it is highly advised to all HOG enthusiasts, despite the lack of the genre-defining hidden object scenes.","December 1, 2015","true","4.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Seek out the dreamcatcher to help Laura regain control over her dreams before it's too late.\n\nA unique way of rescuing somone with a twist. Something like this might not have been done before by other game developers.\n\nGame Visual/Audio\nThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they sometimes aren't that crisps and clear. There isn't much can be said about the game's audio asides from that they really go well with the game. The audio and visual can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are two different game difficulty mode to choose from:  Regular and Expert. The game's difficulty can be changed anytime during gameplay.\n\nThe inventory panel has an lockable feature. It allows the players decide whether they want a stationary inventory panel or not.\n\nThe first diary notebook belongs to a young woman named "Laura Young." Collect the pages that are scattered throughout the game to complete it. It tells the story about Laura Young's life.\n\nThe second diary notebook belongs to a man named "Professor Sanders." Collect the pages that are scattered throughout the game to complete it. It tells the story about Professor Sanders' life.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are rather easy to solve without much difficulty.\n\nThere are thirteen different achievements to unlock. Each of these achievements has certain requirements to complete before they can be unlock. These achievements have to be manually place, it's like a sticker book, the achievements are located in a panel off to the side of screen. Please note that these achievements are only in game.\n\nThere are collectible items in the form of an eye and diary pages. Not all of the locations in the game will have a collectible to find. But when there's it'll most likely be more than one to find. There are 110 eyes and 12 diary pages in total.\n\nThe dreamcatcher belongs to Laura Young. It has been destroyed by the 'Sandman.' Find all of the pieces then placing them in the correct slot will fix it.\n\nThe gremlin named Benny is sort of a helper and nuisance at the same time. He doesn't follow you around but he tends show up in almost every Laura's dreamworld.\n\nThe bonus chapter can be accessed only after the main story of the game is completed. It continues where the main story had ended.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere's built-in strategy guide, it can be accessed during gameplay, clicking on the '?' then on the 'strategy guide button' will bring up the guide.\n\nIn the game's extra section it has the following:  8 Screensavers, 9 Music Soundtracks, Bonus Gameplay, 12 Wallpapers and 17 Concept Art.\n\nFinal thoughts, I really did enjoy playing the game, it's storyline had grasped my attention and kept me interested all the way to the end. There's a little bit of replay value. I would recommend this game but not at full price though.","November 8, 2015","true","12.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Her dreamcatcher is scattered around dreams she's making, however, in each of them, she's in danger of death...\n\nThe story is well done: while the beginning of the story is set in our real world, the rest is in Laura's head and dreams: you'll learn more about her destiny and her past. It means that you'll be visiting different locations: fairy world, Laura's home, desert, iced lake, attraction park, church... Each time, you'll meet a Laura in need but also Benny, a creature that knows more than you can think.\n\nThe game is a casual adventure game: you find items, you use them to advance and you're solving puzzles. There is no hidden object scene in this one. However, there is a nice bonus: find beholders, strange creatures, in the scenes. They're often well-hidden. But these beholders are just there for in-game achievements.\n\nThe soundtrack is very nice and the graphics are pretty good, given all the locations you're visiting.\n\nHowever, there is a breaking game bug. The game is crashing every two minutes more or less (though I've crashed less on Win7 than on Win8). I don't know why it's like that but it's crashing. My first playthrough ended up in a corrupted file, so that you can't do anything about it. I wanted to try the workaround of setting the CPU infinity to 0 or 1 but back then, I didn't find it how.\n\nI was very sad to put a thumb down to a game that had a great potential. And then, I decided to resinstall it and to find finally if the workaround was working. I managed to find how to access the affinity settings and I did what I was told to do.\n\nAnd it worked like as charm. No more crashes. No more corrupted files. I could finally enjoyed the game! It means that I had to rewrite the previous review.\n\nIt's just sad to see that there is no patch for that problem. I know that some "old" games can be a problem, however, Dreamscapes isn't that old: it's on Big Fish since 2013 and 2014 on Steam. Gamezebo reviewed it in 2013 and they're rarely reviewing old games.\n\nAnyway, now that I've been blessed to have this workaround working, I can recommend the game, though not at full price. You may never know if it will work for you. At least, for me, on Win8.1, it worked.","September 6, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even though I did it correctly, it wasn't giving me the item. Okay no biggie right, just hit skip and get it? Wrong, it plays the animation to solve the puzzle but the powder that you're suppose to be dissolving keeps appearing and then disappearing. So skipping also did not give me the item for finishing the puzzle. In other words, I'm stuck and cannot progress. Other people have stated that the save file corrupts easily so I'd say take your chances with this game because it is good but skip it if you don't want to risk wasting your time due to bugs. I'd happily change my review if these bugs get fixed though.

The story is good, though.\n\nThe main story gets you through the dreams of a woman and you have to save her soul from that dream world.\nYou have to find objects and use them to go on in your adventure. Sometimes a mini-game is required to proceed. The main goal is to rebuild a dreamcatcher.\nIf you ever get stuck a "Hint" button points you to the next interesting area.\nIf you don't know where to go a "compass" button (just over the "hint" button) will tell you where you can go from there.\n\nYou can get in-game achievements so you can complete the game more than once to get them all.\nAlong with the main story you can catch some robot-animals in each screen (you can earn up to 4 achievements for this).\n\nOnce you complete the game a "Bonus Chapters" can be played.\n\nI found this game in a bundle from BundleStars. Totally worth the price I paid.\n\nA little bug makes a "developer window" appear sometimes during mini-games (especially if you move objects too fast to the edge of the screen). You can still play the game (and cheat through that window) but it's a little annoying.","July 29, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good graphics and this one really plays like an "adventure light" game, it is filled with puzzles - most of them on an easy scale of difficulty.\n\nBesides this, you come to note - where is the hidden object part? Well, you have to find "Beholders"... And beyond that, you won't notice too much that you are in a HOG. I encountered no lag, no errors during the game. This taken into note, the game still is quite short - but the dreamscapes are disturbing and at the same time marvelous.\n\nPros:Hides the HOG part subtly into the story.Nice told story with some voiceacting, which happens to be quite engaging.Some of the artworks are well constructed, take a closer look - you might find some hidden jokes inside.Cons:Open End... this end was a bit, dissapointing. Never leave a lose end in a story, even if you are planing another game.A bit short in time, since HOGs have a very limited replayability.\nRecommended\nBut this recommendation doesn't come without a slight reprimand. The Game itself was good, the end was a bit of a dissappointment (as already noted in the list). The decission to give the game an unconditional Recommendation was very, very narrow. Genretype this game is a 3+ or C+, not too bad, but also not too good. Or on the 70 %. Actually there was not one minute of boredom in the game for me. But the Ending had me on a very disappointed mood. Mostly because of the recurring villain theme that now hangs around. Other producers use this stunt also very regular, and it feels to me, like a second hand, worn and torn boot on my foot. It's just not going well.\n\nAside this, the game is technically solid fare, no bugs were encountered and the game is quite forgiving to misclicks.","November 22, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has surprised, and amazed me, how delightful hidden object games can be.\n\nCons:\nYou feel dumb when you need a hint\nLow replay value\nIn the end, missing an observer is easy, because of areas being locked down once you finished them, but a speedrun is still fun.\nEventually, the time it took was 5 hours, which isn't a lot.\nThe name, no idea why exactly, but the name seems to drown apart from a logical placement in my games list...\nThe controls aren't always amazing. Your inventory opening, when you want to leave an area, or closing before you can click on the item you want to use, and the game in the arcade, please, use the keyboard, clicking on those buttons on the screen with your mouse makes it very hard to finish the game (I got killed by jumping on a wasp dropping down towards the flag area)\n\nFinal statement: I'd say that if you like hidden object/point and click games, this is well worth the money, if you're more of a "meh" I can take or leave them, I'd still recommend it, but mybe wait until there's a sale. This game was made to make a good player experience, not trying to hang onto old outdated: These types of games must act like this or that scenario.\n\nEven though now I'll delete it, it'll be a happy thing to see as I scroll through my games list, and maybe, I'll redownload it, if a friend comes over.","May 5","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a Point and Click game, just like all Telltale P&C games. I made a mistake of playing the second game before the first one. The second game was a HOG and much better than the first. The quirks I have with this game is the following.\n\n1)The animation does not lip-sync/moves their mouths with the dialog. The timing is off by a few seconds. So you are watching the cut scene and trying not to laugh at the animation. If you do laugh, you will miss the whole story.\n\n2)The whole story is cliche from the beginning to end. You could tell what is going to happen next.\n\n3)What items you can pick up should not be too random, when you could I do not know find a better item.\n\nSpoilers: Laura is trap in a grave. How will you rescue her?\nThere is a shovel in one of the area and that is not the right item. But you need a handle for a jack, a metal rod to push the stone tablet, and an air hose for the pump, but not the shovel that could of removed two different items from that list.\n\n4)The puzzles should not be that easy that a fifth grader could solve in a few seconds. There is no hard puzzle and they flat out give you the answer in the same room. At least in the second game they up the ante.\n\nIf I was you and want to play this game, here is what I have to say. Skip this game and play the second one. It is more the same story with the same players but, with Tim in trouble.\n\nPlease remember this game is a P&C, not a HOG. Do not forget to go and buy the second game, it is really a HOG.","April 20","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
