Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- is on Steam!\n\nGame looks great. One of the most beatiful looking not only fighting but all games in my opinion. And it runs 50-60 fps on my almost 4 year old laptop. Sure it will run smoothly on most PCs\nAudio is great, you can switch between Japanese and English. BGMs all just as always perfect (you also can unlock BGMs from Guilty Gear XX-2!) if you ever played Guilty Gear or BlazBlue you won't be disappointed.\nGameplay wise it is one of the best fighting games today. It's harder to master than Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, but in-game tutorial is decent and you have various challenges apart arcade mode to train your skills.\nFor now i didn't touch online so i can't say anything about it. But considering it's a Guilty Gear on PC and the price is nice i certainly recommend this game to anyone who love fighting games and want to support this genre on PC.\n\nWell, there is nothing more to add. Just crank "HEAVY DAY", buy the game, call your friends and enjoy this gorgeous looking and, most important, fun game!","December 9, 2015","true","13.5"," 127 of 137 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","127","137","4","3"

Game looks fantastic and plays great online.\n\nOne thing that I'm amazed at is how awesome the training mode is for this game. They really teach you the VERY basics of how to go about playing this game. It's something that will ease beginning players in without having them feel overwhelmed by everything right from the get go. From there you've got a mode that teaches you combos and another mode that puts you in typical situations that you'll find yourself in from time to time while playing against opponents. Along with the is a very fleshed out freestyle training mode that they been offering us since 1998.\n\nOnline play seems pretty smooth right off the bat, although there are some who seem to be having issues with lobbies at the moment. Aside from that, playing in game is smooth. If there was lag then I'm oblivious to it. The few matches that I had so far felt great... Aside from me getting stomped into oblivion.\n\nWhile some people will scoff at the number of characters in this game, I see nothing wrong with it as you can see ASW seems to have gone with quality before quantity. Every character has been animated in a way to replicate the animation frames from the older games. It's a joy just to sit back and just watch the characters, attacks, specials, instant kills, and intros/outros.\n\nI haven't had the chance to try out Story, Arcade, or any other of the modes so far due to trying to learn Ramlethal at the moment, But as soon as I do, I'll make sure to update this review.  But from what I've experienced you shouldn't even hesitate at spending your hard earned money on this. It even comes with a slew of goodies. Including an awesome soundtrack.","December 9, 2015","true","28.0"," 68 of 74 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","68","74","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2KI/recommended/376300/","2KI","2KI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2KI/","413 products in account","My review may be biased by the year I waited craving to play this game that was a console exclusive but I guess it's fine...\n\nAnyways, the game is a gem: extremely good mechanics, extremely good graphics, extremely good music, various and interesting "game" modes, unlockables, actually working netplay.\n\nNow, in detail. Guilty Gear Xrd mechanics are probably "weaker" than Guilty Gear XX^core+R but still on a top tier level, they gave more freedom on Roman Cancels use and found a good way to make them netplay-viable, most old mechanics like Faultless Defence, Gatling Combos and Instant Kills are still there just like they were on previous titles and overall they feel extremely solid.\n\nGame artwork/graphic is amazing. You play full-fledged 3D models and you almost can't tell they actually are 3D models instead of hand-drawn sprites until the camera pans/zooms for special events... amazing.\nAs always character design is flawless, animations are good (anime-styled deformations and such included) and generally speaking, the tech/workflow behind such an amazing result is most likely going to be used as example in the future by developers.\n\nMusic is good, yep. Ishiwatari Daisuke strikes again.\n\nNow, about game modes. You think you're buying a fighting game, but you actually buy a fighting game, an in-game graphic animated visual novel/anime and a nice fighting RPG (M.O.M. mode), not to mention the Bonus Soundtrack (which is not Guilty Gear Xrd Soundtrack, it's a Bonus Sountrack for real).\n\nFinally, netcode. I can't say the netcode has no issues, but I was able to play smooth matches with friends I know I ping good against. For fighting games netcodes are almost always "the hard test", mostly because it's the one thing you can't beta test enough and that tends to change a lot moving from different consoles or PC.\nSo, well, it's not that bad, not that good either, definitely playable on a good level if both players have a good ping.\n\nRecommended? Yes, yes and yes again, one of the few games you cannot regret spending money for.","December 11, 2015","true","89.2"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","43","48","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/recommended/376300/","MTizzler","Dark MT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/","483 products in account","Overall, a great game with some PC specific issues & buggy multiplayer\nI never thought I'd see the day these games landed on PC.\n\nBy no means am I a fighting game pro, in fact I probably suck at them compared to the average enthusiast. But I am very fond of them nonetheless, and have been playing fan favourites since childhood with GG and KoF being my favourite franchise due to the cast of characters. When I saw Xrd had hit steam, I immediately purchased it, and boy, do I have no ragrets.\n\nGeneral Gameplay\n\nAs far as fighting games go, I'd rate GG as one friendlier to newcomers to the genre than other mainstream favourites like street fighter, some difficulty levels above the level of Tekken. Most competent gamers should be able to maintain themselves throughout the singleplayer modes of the game and the skill ceiling is high enough to maintain a healthy skill diversity between players whilst retaining the accessibility of the game to an audience simply playing for fun. Don't treat my opinion like it's worth a damn though, I really can't git gud at these games even after a decade of playing them.\n\nGG Xrd comes with plenty of content as far as gameplay modes go, with a classic arcade mode, an item based progression mode called M.O.M and a story mode to boot following the arcade completion. Multiplayer is also an option with network play available to players that decide to get their ♥♥♥ handed to them online.\n\nLearning the game itself is very friendly to new players and perhaps the most newcomer-welcome title I've ever laid my hands on as far as fighting games go, with an extremely helpful tutorial mode, and challenge modes for each character that lay out all the potential skills and combinations that one can master as a beginner. Though I'd rather have input commands displayed in a clearer manner, they are indeed shown for those who wish to monitor where their buttons are being pressed.\n\nA common complaint of Xrd is the lack of characters and lack of some fan favourites from the cast of previosu games, even with the free DLC. This is personally a more important detractor to those who have enjoyed previous titles, since as far as the game itself goes there is barely enough variety to just about keep the matchups entertaining. More irritating however, is the EU implementation of GG Xrd (this release) which lacks a lot of the DLC characters released in Japan.\n\nFinally, the most important factor of gameplay in fighting games; controls. They're tight, very responsive, extremely customisable (keyboard gamers rejoice!) and displayed clearly for beginners. No complaints in this department.\n\nGraphics (They're beautiful)\n\nXrd is interesting in the sense that the game meets a halfway between old school 2d sprites and new-generation 3D models that older players tend to dislike. Arc have somehow managed to develop fully 3D characters in the unreal engine, whilst making them appear in a 2D anime style during play. This is supplemented by GORGEOUS animation for intros, cutscenes, special moves and finishing moves for each character. There are few complaints from me as far as graphics go, and though some players dislike this graphics style, I personally am extremely fond of this hybrid approach and pray that more JP fighting games take this technique to develop it further.\n\nAudio\n\nIf you're a fan of JRock or Guitar instrumentals in general, you will be in love with this soundtrack. Even from the perspective of an exclusively rap listener, it is undeniable that a lot of love was put into the soundtrack (and the game in general).\n\nBut far more impressive than the soundtrack is the voice acting. With anime industry veterans taking the cast for each character, dubbing over everything, everything from menu voices to every cutscene and finisher. Though it's become somewhat standard to expect great voice acting from fighting games, it still blows me away that Xrd has the VA/Seiyuu cast that it does.\n\nPC Port\n\nIf there's one thing JP devs suck at unanimously, it's usually the PC port. As far as Xrd goes, users have been cropping up with performance issues here and there, usually in an intermitted manner. Anecdotal experiences will vary and I personally take them with a hint of salt, but it appears that the game is not completely perfect and those with lower spec systems should take heed of this. Fortunately, steam now gives us refunds so it's easy enough to test this out and see how it runs. I should also note that finishers/cutscenes are locked to 30FPS (correct me if I am mistaken, please) if you care about that.\n\nMore importantly however, is the network play implementation. Many players have been complaining of buggy and malfunctioning network play, and though the connection issues aren't as frequent for me when I try it on the few occassions that I did, I would again, take heed of this and check pcgamingwiki or google for potential issues that may arise from this port. All in all, though the port is evidently far from perfect, the disappointing standard set for PC ports by Japanese game studios has been demolished by Xrd's PC implementation. Please, just check that the game will work for you first, and make sure to do this within the refund window.\n\nFinally, there are some issues with the UI being upscaled to ludicrous degrees on the PC port, leading to quite a lot of overlap/interception between elements of the HUD. It's a minor annoyance but a consistent annoyance nonetheless.\n\nFinal Notes\n\nThere's really not much left to say, this is one of my shorter reviews and is also a review for a genre of video games that I have very little expertise in. I would take what I say with a grain of salt, but if you are a newcomer to the genre, know that other scrubs like yourself are having a lot of fun with this beautiful game and recommend you purchase it, especially if it's on sale like it is at the time of this review. As far as fighting games go, the volume of content that you get with a learning curve that won't immediately throw you off from playing the game more are more than enough reasons to at least try a few hours before refunding it.","December 10, 2015","true","14.2"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","36","37","3","4"

That doesn't really matter with Guilty Gear Xrd Sign, though, because this game is deceptive. Steam, user reviews, and promotional material may lead you to believe that you are putting down money for a fighting game, not an unreasonable assumption at first. As you pick up the game, in fact, the deception continues. You will swear you are playing a fighting game. It's interactive, fast-paced, sidescrolling. There are quarter circles. Potemkin is there. Don't be fooled, however. What you are really paying for is around 12 episodes of an anime set in the Guilty Gear universe. And it is awesome.\n\nOK, I'm being facetious as usual, but the above paragraph is quite accurate. Arcade mode begins the story, and then there are a solid 6+ hours of cutscene. They split it into its own menu option. Not being a Guilty Gear veteran, said "story mode" didn't make a ton of sense to me overall, but I had a blast nevertheless. The characters are decently developed and play off of each other quite well. There's plenty of over-the-top action and I watched the whole thing in one sitting, eager for more. As for the gameplay, it's pretty much standard for fighting games. There are five distinct attack buttons, you hit the opponent until they fall down twice, some moves flow into each other, you know the drill. Despite my ineptitude, I can tell that this game is solid. The controls are very responsive, and the sound design is top-notch. I would recommend this game to anyone who's even remotely interested, because even if the gameplay turns out to not be your thing the story mode is substantial enough to justify the purchase on its own. And that is not a claim I make lightly.","February 1","true","11.9"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","35","38","9","0"

I am a huge fan of fighting games and didn't want this to be a horrific port. ArcSys dashed out ALL doubts I had. While I can't yet speak for the online portion of the game, the offline / single-player experience is as smooth as can be.\n\nFor $24 (as of this review), you get the full game (obviously), but you also recieve ALL DLC for no additional charge (at least that's how it was for me :p). This includes 3 additional characters, all costume colors, and all system voices to change the announcer voice to that of your favorite character! The game also has MAGNIFICENT art style (in my honest opinion of course). The game's music is also fantastic (and as a side note, the creator of the game is also the composer for all the music. How cool is that?!).\n\nThe only "con" I have is that when you play the tutorial or challenge mode, the onscreen inputs change from the keyboard's keys to the Xbox buttons every couple of seconds (if you're using a controller / fightstick). But this is a simple fix as the game has an option to switch the input display from the Xbox / keyboard buttons to the abbrieviations of the attacks as they are called in the game.\n\nSo even though this review isn't really an in-depth one, I can honestly say I recommend this game to anyone looking for an anime game, (or in my case) a new fighting game to play. 10/10\n\n****EDIT****\nAfter looking up information about the PC release, I have now found out why I have access to all of the DLC. For the first week of this game being on the steam store, you will get ALL the DLC for no extra charge.","December 9, 2015","true","12.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

Before I bought this game I had little to no experience in fighting games other than the original Super Smash Bros. and Brawl. I've heard of the Fighting Game Community and Street Fighter peaked my interest a few times but it never really hooked me into it.\n\nSo exactly why did I decide to buy Xrd? A fighting game that really shouldn't be recommended for newcomers? Because of the MOTHER! ♥♥♥♥ING! SOUNDTRACK!!! The OST in this game is absolutely amazing for any rock and even metal lover. Guitar riffs are almost always original and most songs feel like they could be seperate video game themes simply from how good they sound. Diva of Destruction, Give Me A Break, Starry Story, Just Do It are all particular songs that I just can't listen to enough.\n\nBut what of the rest of the game?\nWell the designs and functionality of each character is extremely unique even within the game's universe. One character does not feel like the other and usually has their own unique playstyle. You have the Big Brooding Badass Sol Badguy who uses a sword more like a hammer and can bust out his Dragon form when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and then you have the (21 year-old) Japanesse Loli Pirate May who is basically the equivalent to Anime Aquaman in terms of power but is actually impactful to the story and is quite useful. From a design standpoint you have a crap ton of variety of characters so you're almost gaurenteed to find someone you like.\n\nThe gameplay itself is as solid as I've ever seen. Almost anything can be answered with anything else. The mechanics of Roman Cancel, Faultless Guard, Jump Cancel, Burst and much more intricate mechanics make sure that literally no match is decided by character selection it's all skill and the community as far as I've seen backing this game will do everything in their power to make sure you git gud.\n\nWould I recommend this to someone interested in the fighting genre? Yes. Absolutely yes. Even if you don't take the game seriously enough to be competetive the characters and art style of the game is unique of itself and deserves to at least be tried. I believe anyone who's in the FGC and hasn't at least played a few matches of this game is sorely missing out.\n\nWould I reommend this to just any casual video game player though? No. As I said before there is a lot of stuff to take in when you first pick up this game and it can easily get overwhelming. I studied this game and it's mechanics months before it came out on Steam and the tutorial still overwhelmed me because of how much I needed to consider in a match. It's ultimately fair but at the same time it can be grueling and even cruel at times to newbies.\n\nIf you're thinking of buying this game though then go for it. You won't be disappointed I promise. The soundtrack is amazing, characters are great, artstyle and graphics mesh really well together with the combat and ultimately this all comes together to make both the game itself and it's individual battles between players fun to watch and fun to play.\n\nCurrently, I'm waiting for SFV to be released so I can get into another fighting game and then after that I'm going to be waiting for BlazBlue ChornoPhantasm Extend (another game I've been hyping myself up to since it's from the same developers that makes GGXrd.) I can wholeheartedly say that this game is the game that got me into the Fighting Games Community and for that I couldn't thank GGXrd, Daisuke Ishiwatari and Arcsys enough.\n\nA word of advice to the newbies from a fellow newbie though. YOU WILL GET YOUR ♥♥♥ KICKED IN! But do not fret. In fact embrace the ♥♥♥ kicking. Learn from the ♥♥♥ kicking. The only way you're going to ultimately get better is to find a character you like with a playstyle to match your mindset and then just go online and fight. At first you might be discouraged but do not quit. You ARE getting better and you will eventually see your struggle come to fruition when you land your first dust-to-knock down combo in a match, then when you land a perfect Roman Cancel and then finally you'll score your first few wins. And the best part about all that is that you know you did it yourself with no handholding.\n\nWell that was a much longer review than I'd hope.","February 15","true","67.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

I've been looking forward to this port for awhile.\n\nPROS-\n-Stylish look. Keeps the anime artstyle that made the series true, but also uses 3D models. It's actually insane how crazy good these models look and how they apparently aren't 2d sprites.\n-Fairly similar to other Guilty gear titles. It's slightly slower in terms of speed and it's not as technical, but these mechnical charges are extremely small.\n-This is a port, and the port (for the most part) is great.\n- Netcode is FAN-♥♥♥♥ING-TASTIC. It's seriously real good. I played over 40 matches today and none of them had noticable lag. Of course, I'm sure this could change with distance between players, but this is definitely one of the best PC fighting games in terms of its netcode.\n- Challenging difficulty that makes the game rewarding to learn. Not incredibly easy to pick up and definitely hard to master.\n-Pretty decent sized roster\n-The rock and metal themes in this game are iconic and amazing to fight to. Makes fights even more entertaining\n\nCons-\n-The only real issue I have with this port is a possible memory leak issue. Many people have reported issues with fps slowly dropping over time when playing the game. It seems to be related to dxinput controllers. I simply unplugged my fightstick while playing the game, and plugged it back in and got a stable 60 fps again. But this is still an unacceptable issue for a game that shouldn't be very demanding.\n-The level of entry in this game is very steep. If you never played a fighting game, this one isn't bad to start with, but you'll be losing a lot (as you would with most fighting games anyway if you're a noob).\n-The story is odd and non-traditional. It can be a bit offputting to others.\n- No real options to go past 1080p from what I've read. Could be wrong.\n- This version will be outdated soon, as GGxrd Revelator is coming out soon. I'm glad Arcsys Jp decided to finally get a company to port this game for us, but if they really want these games to do well, they need to make sure to keep them updated at a timely fashion just like with the console versions.\n- Online is not cross play with ps4/ps3. Steam users only, which will eventually twindle, since fighting games aren't big on PC.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great game. Amazing fighting game and I'm having fun learning it. I hope Revelator comes out on pc around the same time as the console versions. However, there are some port issues that hopefully get ironed out by the next patch for the game. Regardless, I still recommend this game, but please be wary of your purchase, since you might run into some issues due to shoddy porting. My experiences had a quickfix, but who knows what you'll run into.\n\n8/10.","December 14, 2015","true","18.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

And we got (almost) everything we asked for: not obsolete, costs less than a horse, port worthy of your boat, and the net with a lot of fish in it.\ntl;dr buy it, read more to know what to expect.\n\nI don't need to tell anything to people who played Guilty Gear series with me for the last 10+ years, we are already online and mashing it. The rest of the review will be dedicated to the new players who are looking to try our favorite game out there.\n\nThe game is fast paced - you need to keep your pants up at all times, actively guard the incoming swings and watch for unguardable stuff with a counter at the ready.\nThe game is mechanically robust - which is a synonim for complicated. The closest genre to fighting games is RTS, so think of it as a starcraft 2 of fighting games. There are about 20 different systems you can game in there, some available to all, some unique to certain characters. For example, to guard against a normal strike, you have a choice of 4 different types of guard (normal guard, instant guard, faultless defense and blitz shield), all have different properties and execution difficulty (think RTS micro) - they can pull the enemy closer, push them away, and even open for a counter; and not only you have to guard yourself, but watch the enemy guard, as even getting pounded on your guard can be turned into an advantage when the attacker is not paying attention and lets his pants drop.\nThe game is not constrained - anything you do can be meaningful, and in any situation there's something you can do. You can break the enemy's combos, you can turn around a match with a nickel of health. The same applies to your opponent, so watch out to not be baited for a combo-breaker by a prepared opponent.\nThe game is not hard to learn - the combo system has very minimal rules and feels light; generally speaking, every move has a set duration of stun it applies, and every move fast enough to hit during that window is a combo, applying its own stun. This "anything goes as long as it hits" system opens a very vatiative maximization game, and not only for damage - you may choose to go for knockdown to get a favorable position as opponent gets on his feet, or to go for extended but less damaging path to gain more meter, or even go light hits with fast recovery to be able to react and punish a combo breaking attempt. To use more moves in your combos, you'll need to learn cancel system, which nullifies recovery phase of your moves and allows faster hit chaining.\n\nSo, after you buy it, the first advice is "COMPLETE TUTORIAL". It's good and teaches you basics on the field. Play against bots for a while, pick some of the stronger characters to avoid being miserable while learning (I can recommend Sol Badguy and Elphelt Valentine for that), and complete your character's challenges. After you have chosen your favorite and learned a thing or two about how it works, it's netplay time.\n\nBy the way, don't play Guilty Gear solo for too long. It's about as good as offline Battlefield title outside of competitive mode. The game was made for tournaments, and just doesn't feel right outside of them. Feels 20/10 in a tournament though.\n\nThe first few weeks of online play will require to prepare your ♥♥♥♥. Ranking system is not up on PC yet, so you have very few hints on who you're about to face; me together with my vet bros will hand over your butt to you in many perverted ways which may have not seemed possible. Always check the relative skill sign near the opponent, and if it's a red triangle, wear a plug before challenging. Find pink equation sign opponents for an equal challenge, or blue triangle opponents to polish your skills. And if you meet the red triangle playing your character, spectate him, and ask for hints without hesitation - we know all the systems and will always give you an advice on how to counter/avoid the trap or deal more damage.\n\nIf you are ready to learn, and treat this game at least as seriously as people treat competitive RTS, it will reward you with the best fighting game experience available up to year 2015, running hype train circles around less robust games like MK or SF series.\nIf you are ready to learn, and want some nice matches with your buds, it's still a good pick - after all, it rewards outlearning the opponent pretty well.\nThe story and lore of guilty gear, along with music and style, are also available for people who are just into exploring and unlocking stuff - the release discount offered that at the very good price, the current price is also not too high.\n\nIf you're just into mashing buttons, you're better off buying some beat-em-up game instead of a fighting game.\n\nP.S. Dear Arcsys, please be less ninja. Give us a pair of weeks notice at least, not 2 days, my body was definitely not ready for this. You made us beg for years, and I think we lived up to our promise, we bought it, we posted over 1000 positive reviews on it, your turn - Revelator on PC please.","January 5","true","300.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HaxorViper/recommended/376300/","HaxorViper","HaxorViper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HaxorViper/","23 products in account","-Intro:\nI am just going to get it out of the way; Guilty Gear is the king of airdashers, or anime fighters. The first Guilty Gear on the PS1 is the one that started the madness of jump blocking, clashing, dashing through the air, and instantly killing the opponent in a fun anime fashion. I got into the series recently after watching the Guilty Gear XRD Top 8 at Evo. There were many amazing moments, and some shameful upsets, (I am looking at you, Woshige), so I was instantly hooked. I had the delight of starting from the beginning with an emulator and experiencing the series' growth. I worked my way up through Guilty Gear X, XX, Accent Core, and now we are here, (I am sorry that I didn't play you, Overture).\n\n-Graphics:\nGuilty Gear XRD is the revival of the series after ages of experimenting and releasing revisions of XX, and boy, it delivers. How much? Enough for it to be my favorite fighting game of all time. Enthusiasts say that fighting games are all about gameplay, but I cannot ignore what this game does with its graphics even in my horrid CRT monitor and bad system specs. The game looks like a drawn anime, but the catch is that it's actually rendered in full 3D with cel-shading that makes it look like an anime. You can see glimpses of this everytime you perform Dust attacks (Which are basically full-screen launchers), when you perform Overdrives, when the round is over, and with Instant Kills. The Instant Kills are pretty hard to hit, so they aren't broken; they are pretty damn rewarding tho, and I always compared them to Mortal Kombat fatalities as they get easier to use when the enemy is about to lose the match. Everything in this game is gorgeous and full of personality, however, the framerate on model animations is pretty jaggy, (Apparently because they wanted to make it similar to the animation of anime).\n\nDuring the following paragraphs I will go over all the new mechanics that the game has, so if you are not interested in reading that technobabble you can skip to the content section:\n\n-Mechanics:\nXRD revamps the Roman Cancel system, as XX's was kinda unreliable with its forced roman cancels. RC's cancel attacks and slow down time significantly, giving you time to use them effectively. Now Roman Cancels are divided into three versions, Red, Yellow, and Purple. Red RC's are used when linked after an attack that hits the opponent and can extend combos, but they cost half of your Tension bar (The bar used for Overdrives), they are often better than overdrives because they are already hit confirmed and are usually friendlier for hit scaling. Yellow RC's are used after an attack that doesn't hit the opponent yet or at all; they cost 25% of the bar, so you can use them often to cancel out of punishable moves and slow down time like a vampire. You don't want to use Purple RC's, as they are just like the Yellow ones but cost 50% bar, they happen when you are late to do a YRC. There are many other new mechanics, like the Blitz Shield, which is a parry that leaves the opponent open to combos (It costs 25% of the gauge, but you usually get 12.5% back from the combo, so it's very good), and the R.I.S.C. Gauge, which punishes overly defensive play with forced counter attacks and stun.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that there isn't just multiple variables to everything, such as the above uses of RC's, the two uses for the Burst attack (One to get out of combos and the other to attack and get a full bar of tension), and the R.I.S.C gauge decreasing with hits as a secondary hit scaling, but additionally, there is an answer for everything as well, such as Bursts being thrown, Blitz Shield follow-ups being Blitz Shielded back, and the usual Block>Attack>Throw>Block. What Arc Sys has made a system deep as an ocean, but it isn't inaccessibly complex, everything that I just told you is in the in-depth tutorial which explains every single system of the game. Anything that isn't said in the tutorial, such as Jump Installs and Faultless Defense Cancels, are explained in character Challenges for those who have them. It may sound like a lot to keep in mind, but you can always revisit the tutorial, learn combos in the Challenge mode, and practice the systems and matchups in Mission Mode.\n\n-Content:\nI mentioned the Tutorial, Challenge mode, Mission mode, but there is also a Training mode; all of these are part of the Practice section and there is 600 challenges and 50 missions, more than enough to provide a great learning experience. Additionally, there is a singleplayer Arcade mode, which has cutscenes for each character (Except the three bonus characters and the arcade boss). These cutscenes serve as a prologue to the game's Story mode, a 5 hour long anime "Movie", or rather, an animated visual novel, which is the closest thing you will get to an actual Guilty Gear anime. The Story has no gameplay so there is no forced fights that ruin the pace of the story, which happened to me with Mortal Kombat; you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the chaos unfold. The last Single Player mode is M.O.M. mode; a survival game where you can costumize your character with extra special moves, stats, and equipment. To get the items you have to fight for money and loot against opponents with many low health bars (Don't worry, you get multiple health bars as well with score level ups). When an opponent is at his or her last health bar they activate "boss" mode where they get anti knockback armor, attack in patterns, and basically become a Megaman boss. I don't have much experience with this mode, but I really want to play more of it; it's great for practicing Bread n' Butter combos as too!\n\nThere are 17 characters, 3 which used to be DLC and you have to unlock with in-game money. I heard unlocking them takes $200,000 for each character (The games currency), but I had them unlocked when I bought it because I got it in the first month, but be prepared to finish every arcade mode to unlock all characters. In total it's a pretty small fighter roster, but considering it's the series' first jump to 3D and the game will have 6 more characters when the new installment comes out (Johnny, Dizzy, Jam, Jack'O, Kum, and Raven), it's not such a big flaw, especially with so many unique and interesting characters. Speaking of which, Revelator is coming out soon so you may want to use this review for that game instead, but be warned, its story is going to be a continuation of -SIGN- so you may want to play this first.\n\nFinally, there is the Online mode. There are Ranked matches, where matchmaking gets you an opponent to fight, and Player matches, where you go to a virtual arcade to fight, spectate, and chat in a lobby with 4 arcade machines and 8 players. Honestly, I have virtually no experience playing on Ranked (Only 2 matches) because I want to be really good before getting a bunch of losses. Nevertheless, the Unranked format is my favorite and is done in many Arc Systems games. Some people don't dig it, but it's really fun to play King of the Hill on one arcade and land an Instant Kill with everyone commenting "OOOOOOH NO HE DIDN'T!". My connection experience varies depending on the location of the person I am playing with, thankfully you can see their connection bars, the host's country, and even the frame delay you are gonna get. You can also set your room to training, private, and M.O.M.\n\n-Music:\nButt rock to its finest: (Parody) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUZxR-k186I\nBut in all seriousness, as a metalhead, I couldn't be more pleased with this games' soundtrack. Every character gets his/her theme and it fits them well. There are songs from previous games too.\n\n-Overall:\n9.5/10\n+ Extremely deep gameplay.\n+ Gorgeous graphics.\n+ A lot of modes and learning tools.\n+ Fun story.\n+ Interesting and colorful characters.\n- Jaggy FPS for animations.\n- Small Roster.\n\nThis is my first review so sorry for it being badly written.

Nothing can even compare to it. Street Fighter? Mortal Kombat? They can't even compare to the vibrant style of Guilty Gear. Much like how Guilty Gear X was a huge graphical achivement for 2D fighters back in 2000, Guilty Gear Xrd has set a new achivement for next gen fighting games.\n\nOnce you get past how mind blowing this game looks and get into the gameplay, it's very familiar. This game very much feels alot like classic Guilty Gear, they did a great job keeping the feel of the game very much the same. Utlizing Roman Cancels has been eased a great deal and are easier than ever to use, although some people may not apperciate the changes, particularly the slowdown during them, as well as how simple and even derp they can be this time around. I wasn't a fan of FRC's in the older Guilty Gear XX games, I felt they were just too hard to use and the new Roman Cancel system is alot easier to use, but maybe a bit too easy. It's not hard to really abuse this system and it can be quite obnoxious. It's hard to please both crowds though. Really the only new mechanic that I think really raises an eyebrow is Danger Time, which is just really silly and shouldn't of been in the game.\n\nYou can't discuss Guilty Gear without mentioning the audio. Most of the classic Guilty Gear sound effects are back, and the cast of characters sound great (In Japanese). I'm still not really used to most of the new character themes in the game yet, I liked alot of the original Guilty Gear X/XX soundtrack, but given time it'll probably grow on me.\n\nOnline Play can be either hit or miss as with most fighting games, but it's a good system allowing several games in one lobby to go on at the same time.\n\nI'm looking forward to watching Xrd grow and bring back many classic Guilty Gear characters over the next few years.","December 20, 2015","true","6.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","1"

If it was a 1:1 copy of the ps3 I would already say this is a steal.\n\nGameplay:I feel that the game might not be as refined as streetfighter but amongst the anime figther sub-genre GGxrd should be the mold used from now on. The controls are fluid, the action is fast and the specials have that cinematic punch which makes them feel amazing when well executed. Even for a casual player like me the gameplay is challenging yet enjoyable. Unlockables aren't content blocks yet rather minor avatar cosmetics or sounds (aside from the unlockable characters which are already unlocked as of now).\n\nGraphics: Old sprite based games look like poop when upscaled to 1440p and above. Even modern 2d sprite based fighters aspire for the 720p-1080p range. This game looks great at any resolution and it runs SMOOTH on older hardware (60 fps easily). Somehow they got the game to almost always have that distinct anime look without the jaring animation transitions which many cartoon graphics games have.\n\nPrice: The game just came out on PC even though its been out for over a year on console. Many publishers would market their game at $60 because its new to the platform regardless of when it originally came out. The $30 price tag is extremely fair for getting the game and all the DLC content that consoles have.\n\nConclusion: Arc System Works is starting to become one of my favorite game developers. Now that they publish their own games on PC we are getting high quality releases with full content at reasonable prices while the game is still relevant. I'm hoping they look to further break the trend of price gouging on fighters by releasing the next installment, -Revalator-, for a discounted price for owners of GGXrd -Sign-.","December 9, 2015","true","2.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xsrw/recommended/376300/","xsrw","xsrw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xsrw/","166 products in account","I'd like to preface this review by stating that I'm not a fighting game enthusiast.\n\nIn fact, the only real experience I have with 2D Fighters prior to GGXrd is The King of Fighters XIII-- and I wasn't really a fan of that game. Despite my inexperience with the genre, I can say that Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- has salvaged my interest.\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nThe characters in Guilty Gear are, well, ridiculous. From a sleeping boy who wields a weaponized bed to a British time traveler, the cast covers all the bases. Each fighter has a unique playstyle and, in many cases, a more peculiar fashion sense. Whether you want to fight with swords, sickles, anchors, flowers, billiard balls, or your own hair, Guilty Gear has it all. Another nice aesthetic are the palette options (skins) for each character-- all of them look great!\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nAlthough my arcade-fighter backlog isn't extensive by any means, I know that GGXrd plays great. The controls are simple, combos easy to pick up, and the fighting overall feels tight and responsive. Fights against NPCs seem fair with an appropriate amount of challenge. This means I can actually play Arcade and other AI game modes without the fights becoming too tedious or underwhelming.\n\nSOUND/VISUAL:\n\nSomething that anyone, novice or veteran to fighting games, will notice immediately is the polish  all over  GGXrd. While the character models are 3D rendered, they still manage to appear beautifully 2D. This effect really brings the game to life and allows for over-the-top battle intros and special attack cinematics.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is impressive, too. Having no original preference, I tried out both the English and Japanese vocals and ended up loving both. Each character's tone seems to fit so well, their voices emotive and packed with energy.\n\nXrd's soundtrack is also worth mentioning. From what I can tell, a lot of the BGMs were brought back from past Guilty Gear titles and given new life-- my personal favorite being May's  Starry Story .\n\nOVERALL (TL;DR)\n\nIt's safe to say that Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- showed me how fun fighting games can be. Everything about this game prevents it from being just another bland entry in the genre. The characters, visuals, and music are never lackluster and they brilliantly show off the devotion that ArcSys has to their games.\n\n","December 29, 2015","true","16.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","3"

The strong universal defensive system mechanics along with the way the tension/super meter works creates an exhilerating, fast paced game with a strong focus on offense and momentum.\n\nThe PC port runs perfectly fine, with some anti aliasing and the "standard" resolution options including widescreen. The options menu is kinda sparse, but because it's an unreal game you can do a lot of ini editting to really lower the graphics if needed.\n\nThe netplay is delay based, and having the PS3 version of the game, the PC version is as good if not slightly better. (This might be because 99% of PCs are on wired internet, as opposed to PS3s) Ranked Mode suffers more lag then the player match rooms. Although unfortunate they didn't fix it, this was an issue on the consoles as well.\n\nWhile I don't have the most controller options, it instantly detected my Qanba Q4 and my xbox one controller, as well as having more then enough keyboard support. If you don't plug it in before you start the game, there might be trouble though.\n\nThe worst thing I can say about GG is that it has a steep learning curve, even by fighting game standards. However, with the tutorial, challenge, and mission modes, it makes jumping in blind not as daunting, the only fighting game that does the tutorialization better would be Skullgirls, and even then this is very close if not equal. That being said, this game is good enough that I urge you to look at some gameplay of it, and try to dive right in.\n\nAlso, for the first month all of the DLC is free, including the colors that were exclusive to PS+ on console. Even after the first month; as opposed to the console version where just Sin was avaliable with your ingame fight money, all 3 of the DLC characters are obtainable with it. (Sin, Elphelt, and Leo)\n\nTheres a reason why this game is only half-jokingly referred to as God's Gift.\n\nPraise be.\n\nP.S. If you're interested in learning more about the game in depth, Dustloop is the main community for Guilty Gear and other Arc Systerm fighters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kuma_King/recommended/376300/","Kuma_King","KumaKing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kuma_King/","78 products in account","Guilty Gear Xrd is essentially a huge step up from other 2D fighters that were ported to the PC. It has little to no bugs especially with arcsys working hard to fix the game often. For a game not originally made with a PC port it's got pretty good online play albeit it still needs improvements.\n\nPros:\nTo start off with what GGXrd does right is that for a game that was originally for PS3/PS4, it runs just as, if not even better on PC. No real input delay, and is even supported by a diverse amount of controllers (keyboard included). Although it should be noted that the controller needs to be plugged in before you start the game otherwise the game will only recognize the keyboard inputs.\nGraphicswise it looks and performs better than the PS3/PS4 version (as long as you have a graphics card better than the standard Intel card). However, the game can still even run around 50-60 fps on the Intel graphics if you turn down the settings. Don't expect it to look pretty though. The game itself runs on Unreal Engine 3 which was originally intended for Windows.\nAlso, the online lobby system is one of the best I've seen. It has 8 player lobbies, with 4 battle rooms for those players to interact. So it doesn't just come down to 8 players with 2 fighting while 6 spectate. You have full control of your player icon to move around the rooms and switch what battle room you want to participate in. Whether you want to play winner next in line or just spectate. There's even an AFK section for players who haven't pressed a button in awhile so people don't get stuck on empty battle rooms.\n\nThe character cast itself is really well done for a fighting game. Very diverse and stylish character designs. And the characters themselves offer playstyles suited for almost everyone. Starting from simple straightforward characters like Sol Badguy and Ky Kiske, to zoners like Axl, and for the people who like playing two characters at once there's Zato-1.\n\nCons:\nThis is not really a problem I've come across with the PS3/PS4 version. However, it's worth mentioning because people are bound to come across this issue. Like I mentioned previously, the online play itself works fine. Connecting into player lobbies is mostly consistent especially if you're playing with someone in the same region. Playing with someone far away can cause input delay, which can even reach to 10-14 frame delay which is almost unplayable. In my experience, I've tried playing with people on the other side of the world and sometimes had 4 ms delay so it can work sometimes far away. The biggest problem with GGXrd on the PC port is that there's problems connecting to people, especially with ranked mode. And also if you're playing on strict NAT you won't be able to connect to people at all. Which can be a problem for colleges specifically as most run on strict NAT.\n\nOverall rating - 7.5/10\nIt's a great fighting game, and a must buy for arcsys fans especially if you're a Blazblue player. Would rate higher if not for it's issues with the online function that I touched upon. Although, arcsys has been dishing out patches continuously to better improve the online as well as other bugs.\n\nWith the sequel "GGXrd Revelator" rolling around the corner in just a couple of months, this is a great opportunity for new players to give this game a shot.","April 17","true","100.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The lack of in-depth options is dissapointing, and the game has quite a few minor issues that hurt this port. That being said, this port has fantastic netcode! I had 2F delay to somebody in Seattle! That's insane if you consider the before this I've only ever had 2F to a person living near me. For that reason alone, this PC port is a big step up for Arc System Works. It's not rollback, but it's pretty damn good. I recommend this game to anybody interested in fighting games (so long as you don't gush over Elphelt :^) )\n\nI'll now list the issues I've discovered.\n\nYou can not change your resolution in full screen mode. Full screen is a seperate resolution option.\nThe games UI is from the PS3 port. The in game graphics are not, and neither is the hud. Unfortunately, this makes the menus look awful when upscaled to 1080p. They don't look very good at 720p either.\nAnti-aliasing seems to have no effect. I can clearly see jaggy lines no matter which option I set my AA to.\nThere are no (obviously) usable configs within the games files. I can not change the settings to optimize it's performance on my system. (This is somewhat alleviated now thanks to a community guide showing me how to downsample from 4K resolution. Game looks pretty great and runs well.)\nThe game seems to be having memory issues for me. If I play the game for quite a while, the framerate will slow down between 30-50 and run extremely poorly.\nThe music may be of slightly lower quality than the music in the PS4 version. As well as this, the character attack sounds are kind of bad. Especially on Axl, I hear awful audio crackle. It's very obnoxious.\nPlayer matches are very buggy at the moment, if a lot is going in in public lobbies there seem to be many issues causing players to vanish, be fighting no opponent, or just get kicked out of the lobby. It's a little tricky to play online right now. Ranked matches aren't fairing too well either, I can't play ranked right now due to a bug. The game will claim they declined the match almost instantly, but this happens with all players in ranked mode right now.\n\nThis issues aren't the end of the world, but I'm sure we'd all appreciate it if these problems were fixed.\n\nAlso, Elphelt should be removed from the game. Not really, but she just doesn't fit in with the cast if you ask me. Who won a competition to get their waifu OC in the game?","December 10, 2015","true","50.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

Console DLC characters are all unlocked free of charge at the beginning, which is nice. The story actually is decently long and the characters are unique and vaired, so you'll probably find someone you like among the cast. There's also a tutorial mode which is great for newbies to anime fighters or just fighters in general, so if you're new and are considering picking this up, go for it.\n\nCouple other things to note are:\n- Graphics are amazing, really good compared to most fighters this gen.\n- Soundtrack is great.\n- Mobility is pretty big in this game, so if you're a smash player or just like to move around a lot it'll probably be more enjoyable compared to something like Street Fighter.\n- Combos are easier than most fighters, too.\n- Netcode is extremely good.

Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- is finally here and it is awesome. First, the graphics are amazing, never would have thought that UE3 can generate this kind of graphics. PC port has a slight problem with scaling if you're using non-standart resolution monitor like I do, but nothing too major.\n\nThe Gameplay is mostly based on Guilty Gear X2 #Reload, instead of Accent Core +R. Character balance is decent, no big complaints here either. However, there are not many characters even though we have three newcomers.\n\nStory is engaging but lacks the proper gameplay, so you could say it's more of a Visual Novel, not everybody's gonna be happy with that.\n\nI kinda didn't like that they didn't include usual Survival Mode and instead merged it with revamped M.O.M. mode, but I guess I can give it a pass.\n\nWhen I tryed the netplay I didn't get any delay, but there were so disconnections, I hope they will fix that.\n\nOverall, the game desieves 9/10, because while some graphics scaling and network issues are present, the gameplay proves to be just as much as it was in previous games.\n\nP.S. While we're already getting tons of your games in 2016, I still hope to see Overture in Steam as well.","December 12, 2015","true","36.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aslyumbeast/recommended/376300/","Aslyumbeast","Mister Ms. Loyotaemi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aslyumbeast/","142 products in account","The port of this game is very good by most standards as the Netplay and Ranked is functioning pretty well along with improvements done through patching that removed some noteable issues including Memory leaks and region locking. The gameplay itself is also fast paced with a good cast of mostly balanced characters. The best part is that this is one of the few fighting games that are immediately getting patches coming in for any issues.\n\nOverall, If you are into fighting games, Its not hard to recommend this game as Its pretty competitive and gives you a wide array of in-match options without much overhead (IE picking styles/grooves/Assists before fights). Its just a straight 2-D fighter.\n\nI cannot comment on the DLC policy as I am an early adopter. Story mode is pretty decent but It does follow some Anime-likeness (as expected, it is a 2-D Fighter from JP), but dont go into it expecting a large fighting tourny. seriously, you probably could youtube the Story and get the same experience.\n\nComplaints for the game include ranked play being kind of a lost cause compared to player matches. This is mostly blamed on the messed up starting of ranked games when the game came out causing it to lose traction. There is some issues related to connecting to players for a select few, but this is fixable by port forwarding or just trying again to connect. Last issue the lack of windowed full screen. Outside that, its pretty good and includes most things you expect of a PC game such as v-sync, FFXA and other post processing along with both languages and individual volume controls.","January 16","true","196.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The Game itself is still played in 2D (Arenas are tough 3D Maps with Impression giving 2D).\n\nYou can choose over 16 Characters (some New alongside some Old Ones) each with his own Challenge Course for learning BnB Combos. The Story Mode is now a Movie (estimated 4 hours) without some Interaction, so you can sit back and press only the Text Screens away during Talking between Characters.\n\nFor Singleplayer there is not much Content: M.O.M, Arcade, Story Mode, Challenges and Missions (BlazBlue in Comparison offers in that Regard more Gameplay for Singleplayer)\n\nNetwork is like in BB by opening Lobbys for People to gather. As Host you have Options kicking out unwanted Guests or announcing disclosure of Room (Useful for better Closure while others are finishing their Matches)\n\nFor People who wants to buy it more or less now: Be aware that you wont find many Rooms anymore, since the new Update "Revelator" is coming. Check out the Steam Thread for Players in your Region.\n\nHere are some of my +/ o / - Points:\n\nPositive:\n- 1080p Support for gorgeous looking Fights\n- 16 Chars to choose from which isnt that few since its newly developed\n- Roman Cancel Mechanic was remade, so that FRC is possible for everyone (in GGXX FRC were limited and difficult to perform for Beginners)\n- M.O.M has more Depth than in GGXX (Comparable like the Abyss Mode in BB)\n- Network Code is much better and has automatic Delay (GGXX used static Delay if i recall)\n- Videos in Story Mode gives you some Anime Feeling and is good to watch\n- New Mechanics like Blitzshield for Counterattacking, etc.\n- Connection and FPS Counter for Network Mode gives you good Infos if Match is possible\n- Hellfire Mechanic (Higher Damage, etc.) gives you Motivation to continue when you reach Critical Health.\n\nNeutral:\n- Party Time Mechanic can be annoying depending how you see it\n- Some Old Chars have gained/losed more Moves than other (for Example: Axl/Ky getting better Moves while Sol got only a KickDive Move, Slayer being ripped off of some Moves from AC+R, etc.)\n- New Roman Cancel Mechanic may be a Turn Down for Veterans from GGXX\n\nNegative:\n- Low Content for Singleplayer\n- Huge Damage Scaling. Some Combos can reduce nearly 3/4 of your Health Bar in one Combo Chain!!!\n- Balancing Problems in my Eyes (DLC Chars potentially stronger in good Hands)\n- Few Old Chars nerfed strongly in Xrd (Slayer and Potemkin from Top Tier to Low Tier in Xrd)\n- Rarely Bug: After committing to a Match, you get thrown out because Connection wasn't possible\n\nFazit:\nI can wholeheartly recommend this Game for GG Fans and Newcomers. One Advice tough: Since the new Revision "Revelator" is coming(or has come at the Time you read this), you will find less Players to Play(and few of them are mostly Veterans, so prepare for a huge Beating)\nKeep this Info on Mind before buying it!","April 17","true","191.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuturuu24/recommended/376300/","tuturuu24","Nichole24 - Brb Tropical Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuturuu24/","503 products in account","The Game:\n\nGuilty Gear Xrd is a 2D anime fighter in the same line as Blazblue, Arcana Heart, UNIEL, etc. Or rather they are in the same line as it, considering how long Guilty Gear has been around. Xrd -Sign sports a roster of 17 character, 12 which are returning veterans. The 5 new characters are all somewhat more gimicky than the veterans but are a nice addition and fit in well regardless.\n\nGame modes include standard affairs like arcade, versus, and training modes, as well as a challenge mode that has specific trials for each character that help you learn them ala Street Fighter 4 or Blazblue. It contains a story mode, which is about a 5 hour long anime more than anything else, as you don't fight in it. MOM mode also makes a comeback but has been heavily revamped. Instead of being a straight survival mode where you collect medals and healing items, its more of a conquest type thing  where taking on one hexagonal challenge opens up more and it keeps branching out as you colelct medals to buy items and upgrades for your character. Mission Mode also makes a comeback, but instead of just being a fight with certain conditions attached to it like "Only the 5th hit in a combo and above deal damage" it just puts you in a situation and asks a task of you that you have to succeed at more times than you fail.\n\nOf course there is the online aspect of the game. I haven't been able to get into any ranked matches unfortunately but player matches have worked wonderfully. The lobbies try to replice an arcade environment, having up to 4 boths where players can fight and spectate at. Ther weird thing i syou have to pick your character before you confirm the fight with the other person, which is weird, but not too bad. Ive only noticed a bit of latency and lag when a lot of people are coming and going from the lobby at once, otherwise its been a very steady experience, especially with friends.\n\n\n\nThe Port:\n\nGame runs absolutely great and looks gorgeous. Haven't had much trouble online with the randoms I played, a little bit of latency here and there as people came and left the lobby but nothing bad. When playing with a few friends in a single lobby, it was perfectly fine with no hiccups.\n\nPoints taken off I guess for some of the UI being a lowres, not that I reall care about that. Also some people report the FPS taking a nosedive after a long session due to memory leaks, most notably on AMD products. I myself use a 6850 and fx-6130 and have had no issues regarding that. I played about 3 hours straight online with friends while recording the game at 60fps and still had no issues. And the final thing to note is that trying to configure the keyboard controls are a pain in the butt. I use a stick but my friend uses keyboard and he has trouble configuring the arrow keys for movement instead of wasd.\n\nThere is an ongoing argument about whether this is a  PS3 port or a PS4 port, but I honestly don't think it matters. it has all the same content and really only a few UI elements are noticeably different upon being pointen out, though ASW and Shini on twitter did say patches are to come. Otherwise the game itself, characters, stages, effects, etc, look completley on par with PS4 and in some situations better in comparison screenshots, and thats before any sort of downsampling or any sort of texture filtering through Gedosato.\n\nConsidering how well optimized it is and having all the content of the PS3 and PS4 version, save one superfluous overworld lobby system everyone hates, I think it definitely gets a solid 8, even in the face of the previously mentioned issues. Its an above average port and way better than I had anticipated from ASW.\n\n\n\nOverall:\n\nThe game itself is amazing and marked the return of Guilty Gear as a major player in the Fighting Game Community and the port itself is very solid. I have a very midrange, soon to be outdated, computer but it handles the game perfectly fine at max settings and at my monitors resolution. The online has been a solid experience so far as well. There are a few issues with the port that will hopefully be ironed out as mentioned above, but otherwise its hard to get better than this. For the discounted $24 with free DLC or even the full $30, I heavily urge you to try it out.","December 10, 2015","true","32.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It got the basics, 4 different kind of attacks, a Dust attack where you basically swing people up into the air for aerial combos.\n\nSure you can go deeper into the mechanics and do some crazy combos into a instant kill move, but those require a lot of time and practice.\n\nI started playing this game with some friends when it was released for PS4 and i was in love instantly and i was sitting at my computer, looking at steam and wondering why it wasn't released here since X2 and Accent Core is released here, but finally it's here and it's better then ever.\n\nTake everything that have been released for the console version like DLC characters and colors.... And you have that here.\n\nMy god i can't even begin to talk about why this game is so amazing.\n\nThis far i can list up a couple of things.\n\n-Easy to get into\n-You can find easy BnB combos quite easily\n-The Port is freaking amazing, it runs at a steadily 60 fps without any problems.\n-Lesser graphics means that basically a stone can run this game WHICH IS GOOD\n-Since it's on PC it's easy to just plug in your favourite controller and beat people up.\n-Really good rooster, altough i'm a bit sad that older characters like Baiken and Bridget isn't in this one.\n-Really good netcode, played a couple of games against different people and it runs amazingly good.\n\nWhy are you still reading this?

I went "yeah, it's great, it looks like sprites but it's 3D- it's on Unreal Engine, you know...too bad it's only on PS4 or whatever". Imagine my surprise when he corrected me and told me that not only is it coming to Steam, but it's already on there. I didn't believe him at first and hectically checked the store page...there it was, just casually sitting in the new releases category as if it wasn't a big ♥♥♥♥ing deal to have an ArcSys game released on Steam, and especially before it has drifted off into complete obscurity. As a European in particular, this is as if Christmas had come not mere 3 weeks, but 3 years early.\n\nSo far I've played through and enjoyed the first ~25 challenges of all characters and played the advanced tutorial, which is pretty great and I'd say comparable to the advanced (and widely praised) tutorials in Skullgirls. They really teach you how to get around stuff that newbies often have trouble with, like zoning, ground to air anti-airing with normals, and so on- probably my favourite feature of the game. There is a mode called M.O.M. that seems very similar, if not identical, to Abyss mode in BlazBlue games; I'm not sure how close they are, I don't bother with that stuff, but it's there.\n\nThe game has some teething issues, like titles all still being in Japanese and the HUD resolution only scaling to 720p (which is getting fixed), but it runs quite smoothly (alt-tabbing is super fast, as well, which is a real blessing), it obviously looks great, and from what little I remember of the older Guilty Gears, it's pretty close to its heritage with some innovation. My Hori Fighting Edge (PS3) was recognised immediately and with no further work required (take note SFV). My favourite "meta"-improvements over other recent ArcSys titles are the ability to automatically save all replays and being able to unlock BGMs from older GG games in the gallery. If I had to pick one thing I really disliked, it would be the Story-mode. In BlazBlue at least there were some battles in between the (usually humorous) story, but in this it's just animu, not a fan.\n\nI haven't played online yet but if the netcode is as good as everyone says, DENOUTTADEN.","December 11, 2015","true","14.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Words like "satisfying" sound a little trite and hollow considering the tremendous effort that goes into a fighter that delivers what you expect from a worthy entry to the genre. Guilty Gear Xrd is, quite simply, one of the best fighters out there right now, let alone one of the best fighters available on this distribution platform. As you'd expect from this series, the visuals are gorgeous, the sound is killer, the community is decent, and the basic mechanics are easy enough for a novice to pick up and enjoy. The Tutorial and Mission modes in this game are an outstanding introduction to Xrd's new elements (For those of us who need to be broken of the bad habits we picked up in AC) as well as a great platform for newcomers to improve not only in this game, but fighting games in general. If you're one of those guys that cut your teeth on #Reload's multiplayer, you'll be at home in rather short order.\n\nThat said, it's not perfect. The character roster is disappointingly lean, and the learning curve for a considerable number of those characters available is startlingly high. The multiplayer interface is unintuitive garbage, and in general, too much of Xrd's metagame takes place in corners for my liking. I personally still prefer AC+R for these reasons, but not by a significant enough margin to abandon either game. Get Xrd, play the Tutorial, jump in, and I think you'll have a good time.","April 2","true","40.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The characters and stages just look absolutely stunning and are beatifully designed and go along well with the astounding Butt-Rock soundtrack.\n\nWhile Blazblue usually goes for a story mode for each character with multiple endings, Xrd features the sort of arcade mode you have come to expect from most fighting games and an actual watch/readable story of approximately 3 hours length.\nThere also is the so called M.O.M. mode where you have charcater progression with leveling and items and fight enemies with special stat-modifiers that includes items that you can actually use in combats, such as bombs and potions.\n\nThe diverse cast consits of seventeen characters that are all unique and play completely different, and thus I never really found yourself longing for more characters as I was already helplessly overwhelmed by the sheer diversety of each character.\n\nAs a disgrace to the human race in general and the gaming community in particular, I found solace in the fact that this game features some of the most helpful tutorials I've ever seen.\nThe game teaches you everything from how to execute special moves to spacing, punishing, wake up pressure, lenghty combos (which are thought in the "Mission" gamemode), blocking mixups and utilizing other various defensive options. It even teaches you how to handle abusable moves of the entire cast.\nYou want it, the Xrd tutorial got it.\n\nThere isn't a lot to say about the netplay other than "it's fantastic", and the lobby system where up to 8 people can play at once (in 1v1s of course, pls don't paraphrase me) is quite nice.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is an amazing looking game with an amazing soundtrack. It's amazingly deep from a gameplay standpoint yet amazingly beginnerfriendly due to the amazing tutorial (and the ArcSys combo system in general).\nTo top it of, the online is also amazing.\n\nIf you have any interest in fighting games in general you owe it to yourself to own this game.\nIf you haven't, you should really aquire some interest in fighting games or else you propably won't expierence this game.\nAnd that would be a shame.","December 14, 2015","true","40.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's also some weird framerate problems in the menus, but they clear up as soon as you reach character select.\n\nHowever, these problems aside, this is a solid port of what is an incredible fighting game. The game itself looks better than ever, and perhaps most importantly, the great netcode the game had on consoles persists to the PC version. Assuming your internet is good, you can play across an ocean and experience minimal lag with a 3-5 frame delay.\n\nI'd talk about the game itself more, but I'm gonna assume anyone reading this already had an interest in the game prior to its Steam release and just wants to know about the port.

Ничего не буду говорить по поводу сюжетки, но она есть, она хороша, она интересна. Проблема в другом, а именно - баги, проблемы именно на ПК платформе.\n\nИз плюсов:\n+ Порт в принципе прекрасно пренесен. Практически всегда держится планка в 60 кадров.\n+ Невероятно отличный неткод. Серьезно, я думал, что меня будет ждать история со skullgirls, когда дилей был огромный, но нет, тут неткод восхитителен и с парнем из Германии я играю так, будто он сидит со мной за компьютером в версус моде\n+ Графика. Ну, анимешный стиль, что еще сказать-то?\n+ Хорошо проработанные персонажи, их лор, реплики для проламливания 4-ой стены + вы можете выбрать комментатора из доступных персонажей\n+ Живой онлайн (но это скорее зависит от игроков). К этому же плюсу относятся удобные "быстрые сообщения чата", если вам лень писать или же вам действительно нужно быстро что-то отправить\n+ Удобный фильтр онлайна\n+ Нуб-френдли механика. То есть я, будучи полным профаном в файтингах, сумел разобраться всего за вечер и неплохо играть даже в онлайне\n\n= Удобное управление на клавиатуре (?). Серьезно, просто купите геймпад\n\nВ принципе, плюсов довольно много, так что перейду к недочетам, над которыми (надеюсь) работают девы.\n\n- Берегитесь, обладатели АТИ и АМД, вы огребаете вновь. А именно иногда вас могут ожидать падение кадров в онлайне.\n- Не с каждым разрешением вы добьетесь полноценного полного экрана, так что шаманьте с АМД центром.\n- Временные проблемы с подключением. Да, бывает по-разному, но зачастую это как баг.

Note that they even reduced the frames in the animations so it would look more like "regular anime".\n(I also found a price tag somewhere:59.99, whoa!)\n\nWell then, as for the game itself. I'm just going to throw this out there, I have never played a Guilty Gear game before, and I've proven myself time and time again to be horrible at fighting games, so I am not really the best person to give this game a fair review.\n\nWhat can I say, the game is fun, looks awesome, it's colorful, the soundtrack is pretty good and I guess it kinda' helps building the style of the game.\nThe characters look awesome and the voice actors fit (admittedly, I have only played with the japanese voices 'cause I was recommended to do so, my inner weeaboo approves)\n\nLike I said, awful at fighting games, so the first thing I go to is the tutorial, which just covers the basics, then goes WAY deep with the Roman cancels (which I forgot about, until I got the achievment by accident).\n\nTo conclude, as a game, neat. Probably wouldn't work as your first fighting game, barely worked as my second.\nStill, don't take it from me, I'm just over here semi-mashing my way through the arcade mode.","December 27, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Spent extensive time with this game on PS4.\n\nEasily my favorite current-gen fighting game.\n\nThe Good:\n\nGorgeous graphics, incredibly fluid movement, mechanical depth, and good character playstyle variety.\n\nBeautiful 2D sprite aesthetic (despite using 3D models).\n\nGameplay: Fun neutral game. Good input buffering for combos. No touch of death ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like MvC. Combos aren't boringly long like in Skullgirls/MvC. Less awful input correction than SF4.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nBug: game client starts getting frame lag and sound stuttering after about half an hour of multiplayer. Doesn't affect everyone, though. May want to wait for this to get fixed.\nUI Oversight: Using 720p assets for the in-game menus, instead of 1080. Makes the least important section of the game look grainy, but it's still sloppy.\n\nBoth issues are specific to the PC port. The PS4 version didn't have them.","December 10, 2015","true","128.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Can't really say much more than this: GET IT! Let's build a huge GG Xrd community on Steam, like... NOW! :)\n\nThe game is gorgeous, like seriously so damn pretty. But it does not end there: it also plays damn well. The characters offer great variance and there is a huge amount of depth. It is also one of my favourite fighting games to just watch someone else playing. Somehow Arc has just nailed down that part also.\n\nOnly real critique is the way the game handles online VS. But that's a bit of a subjective matter I guess.\n\nPS. next if they'd port P4 Arena Ultimax and Blazblue: CPE (oh, edit: IT IS COMING!!!) for the PC, my mind would be blown into million pieces. ;) But man, this is HUGE!

Hopefully they release things on PC day 1.\n\nAnyhow what people want to know: As usual GG always has solid fighting mechanics. The controls are sleek and responsive. You never feel totally cheated or walled in like other fighting games. Beautifully animated and use of cell shade, and engine. Most of all story mode... Its true men can cry. Perfect music score characters. The voicing is very good as well, not great but does the job. All I cared about was Sol's voice since he is my fav character.\nI wish they would have added more characters. Oh and another thing I love about this game.

If you're into fighting games pick this up ASAP, preferrably before it's $30 and even more preferably before the DLC stops being free with the game (End of December)","December 11, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My internet is pretty crappy I live on SA region and played with some1 from NA and it worked pretty good. I couldn't notice any input lag tho i'm sure there must be some so my point is that if you play with someone of your same area it should work PERFECT!\n\nFor 24 bucks (time of release) it's a hell of a deal!

The aesthetics of the game are top notch and honestly the best midway between 3d models and sprites. Each character is quirky in his own wait, not a dull one in sight. Almost no shared moves between characters except the obvious "shoryuken". Combos are easy to do and are very pretty to look at. Most good combos are aerial and can very large. Overall as a fighting game enthusiast I can give this game a thumbs up and recommend it, even thought it has lots of mechanics they are all leasy to grasp and fun to use.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TLG-X/recommended/376300/","TLG-X","Xx TLG xX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TLG-X/","54 products in account","Let me tell you something: If you're a fan of fighting games, you HAVE to play this game.\nIf you played previous games before, you notice some changes in Xrd. First, Multi pathed story mode is removed (from what I've seen so far) and for a better understanding of the story, you have to complete arcade mode with all of the characters first and then move on to the story mode. Second, Unlike the previous games (or BlazBlue series), Xrd has 2.5D visuals. Third, Because of changes in story mode system, arcade mode is changed too and you don't have to face Ramlethal (A.K.A. The boss character) for every character. I mean, with some characters (like Slayer), you never get to fight her.\nNow for the story... From what I read, the story begins after the events of Guilty Gear 2: Overture (which I never played :( ) and tells the events of.... Well, I better not spoil it here. Also, Xrd has very great surprises for you if you have played GGXXAC+R on Steam. like:  Chipp is now a president!  and you can unlock several musics from AC+R for matches. (like The Midnight Carnival)\nGameplay is still the same: Fast and hard to master. And everything is still in place: Instant kills, Roman cancels, Dust move, Burst, etc...\n\nOverall, It's a very great game and this port had a way better launch on PC than Lag Kombat X. Sure, It has some problems (that I know will be fixed) but it's playable. Also, some of those problems are fixed now (like the ugly looking HUD) after the 3GB update (large size, don't you agree?).\nOkay, let's finish this. You want to have a very good fighting game? Then buy this game AND GET READY TO ROCK!\nOh, and by the way.... Thank you Arc System Works for bringing this great fighting game to PC platform. I'm looking forward to see BBCPE and Xrd Revelator!","December 26, 2015","true","21.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

First of all, I started my fighting game journey with Skullgirls. I initially mained Filia, then Fukua. These characters fought with their hair... so the first character in GG Xrd I pick up is "Millia"... funny. "ilia" and hair attacks, I rolled with it. I noticed a similar playstyle in both, I got hyped.\n\nLong-story-short: I now main Millia. When it comes to combos though, this game does not make it easy. Skullgirls made my life a living hell. Not while I played it, after I played it. I honestly can't combo worth a ♥♥♥♥, but I want to learn- which is definitely a good thing. It's hard for a game to make me angry and want to learn at the same time. Last time this happened was with Skullgirls.\n\nSorry I keep making comparisons, I just found it my primary source of comparison, given, I have played SF4 and did not have a fun time with it.\nSo. Would I recommend picking this game up? Yes... without a doubt. Only $30, all characters, all skins, tons of playtime and even a competitive scene.\n\nThis game requires quick as-♥♥♥♥ hand movements, great memorization/muscle memory, and a willingness to get better. In other words: Buy this if you like fighting games that take effort and reward greatly.","December 27, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean it's even better than street fighter in therms of fun while the mechanics are deeper. The game is really rewarding for those who spent time to improve.\n\nQuality :\n-Unique gameplay for each characters and deep mechanics (you will need hundreds of hour to master one character)\n-Incredibly fun even for new player\n-Room online is really nice way to make a little community feel alive (i find match in like 12 seconds)\nAmazing graphics\n- The community is friendly I did not read any insult or encounter toxic player. Even when you get crushed they always propose you to rematch and type gg in all chat.\n\nWeakness :\n\n-A lot of player are already good at the game so you will need to find and add begginers on your own\n- ArcSystem do not update their game to give you free content.

The graphics are simply stunning.  Netcode seems very good too, I'm living in Taiwan and playing with my friend back in Hawaii (my connection seems to go to california, and then bounces back to him in Hawaii so that should speak loads for the netcode quality) without any instability, just a few frames of delay, which is all auto calucated for seamless play.\n\nFavorite fighting game in a long time and there is simply no reason not to buy this whether you're a fighting game fan or just a Guilty Gear fan.  I'm just average skill level at fighting games so I can't give any detailed pro's and cons on mechanics but it feels very fair, but also high skill cap.  It doesn't seem like any mechanics have been removed since I last played GG X2.\n\nI don't have a single complaint for this game, and I'm usually a heavy critic.  The only possible complaint anyone could have is that you can't use the mouse for menu navigation, it all has to be done via controller or WASD/arrows.  That's literally it, and as far as I'm concerned that isn't even a valid complaint for the genre since any remotely serious player has a stick or at least a controller.","December 26, 2015","true","21.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am very sorry but you cannot play online, the game has some major issues when it comes to online. For starters, sometimes you cannot even connect to a lobby. You search like 5-7 times and nothing. You exit the game, enter again and suddenly it works; MAGIC IS REAL!. Another issue I had is that the game crashes in online. It crashed one time when i entered a lobby and right after this it crashed again during a fight. My last concern is the community, which is kind of small....I mean i couldn`t find any ranked match and even the normal matches were scarced. I am very sorry, I love this game, I played Guilty Gear X2 like a maniac and I still do, I was very happy when this came to PC but dispite the fact that I love the game, I cannot give it a positive review due to the online bugs, issues, etc. and I intentionally bought this game for online purposes. If you like waiting like 5-10 minutes untill you find a match and then finally enter a match and get disconnected or have a laggy play then suit yourself, I`ll stick to the old Guilty Gear or the Single Player of this one.

Guilty Gear is an amazing game, arcsys makes the best 2D air dashing fighting games in the world. XRD is a fresh reboot, which throws out a lot of the complexity from the older games while maintaining the classic feel of some of the most iconic characters around.\n\nThe systems are great with some draw-backs here and there, and the visual style of xrd is second to none.\n\nXRD is a game that plays fast and aggressive while looking amazing.\n\nHowever the PC port is extremely garbage. If you look around Dustloop, SRK, and the steam community you'll find lots of complains about frame rate issues.\n\nI've got an amd cpu and an nvidia gpu, my friend has the same gpu and one model worse on the amd cpu. His game runs fine, mine doesn't.\n\nNow, what happens is after a number of matches (about 10 or so) the framerate goes from a solid stable 60, down to 30 and the game becomes unplayable.\n\nAs I've mentioned, I looked into this a lot before refunding the game, this happens to all combinations of amd and intel cpus and also nvidia and amd gpus. Online, offline, it doesn't matter. For many people the game is just unplayable.\n\nXRD is a fantastic game and I've loved it since the NA release on ps3, I'm just upset that I can't play with my pc friends.\n\nFor the sake of clarity I've tried a couple of fixes that were suggested online, both on forums and the steam community. I tried various configurations with nvidia control panel, in game settings, resets, game cache validation, re-installing the game, and nothing fixed the problem. Time and time again, after a number of matches the frame rate would halve rendering the game unplayable.","December 30, 2015","false","46.2"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","4"

Particularly when the game breaks controller support when you use a KB and M, confusing resolution support with a 1080p limit (I know you can use higher resolutions thorugh an ini file, but I shouldn't need to), and online that broke a few times times when I was trying to play with a friend. It just needs a patch to get this up to standard.\n\nUpdate: Recent patch seems to fix the keyboard problem with xbox one and steam controllers, which is great. However, PS4 controller support is outright broken on my end (before it worked, albeit with keyboard issues). It would help if we can manually select which controller to be selected under players.

This is a huge disappointment and in a sense, truly mindless. I don't know what the publishers have learned from all the complaints they received when Acana Heart 3 was just released on steam. THIS HAS TO BE FIXED. Also, I do not know whether it is a bug or not, but when I re-bind the keys, I cannot use the same keys for in-game and menu. For instance, when I bind the direction keys to 'I, J, K, L', I can move my character in the game, but have to use 'WASD' again in the menu. The menu screen simply forces me to used the keys that have been binded by the game.\n\nMenu UI and Character select screen shows that it is not native 1080p. Although this is not something that directly influences the gameplay, it still is a disappointment nonetheless. But this can be overlooked because it is relatively small matter compared to key-binding/functioning problem.\n\nAs much as I love this series, I'm depressed at the current state of this game. Turn on the PC version of 'Ultra Street Fighter 4' that was released some time ago, and go through everything in the Options menu. You will be surprised to see a game that had its prime some time ago with uncomparable quality in options.\n","December 9, 2015","false","42.0"," 24 of 89 people (27%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","27","24","89","3","7"

You think with the power of the unreal engine 3, that indie devs would start to actually try to make 3D MODELS in a 3D ENGINE, but instead, we have this.

However, once I became one of the boys with an updated computer and graphics card I was able to witness the splendor that is Guilty Gear XRD. The game is one's proverbial 2D fighter, where ea ch character has their own unique play style, combos do not have to be done in a 1-frame link sequence and the presentation of the characters and environment are well presented. Furthermore, whether one plays online or against the ai, the introduction to the battles are well concocted in addition to the instant kill moves. I would reccommend this game to anyone in a heartbeat, because the cinematics are well-developed in addition to the gameplay itself, truely a phenomenal game.","March 6","true","97.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm running it in a notebook lol. There is some info on what to disable on the game Forum, works as a charm.\n\nThe messy lobby system from the console versions have been streamlined, and is way easier to use on PC, still retaining every feature from the console version.\nNetplay itself is also pretty damn good, even shows you the frames of delay in real time, making it easier to account for it in execution.\n\nOverall, no complaints from me, amazing game, solid port, great netplay.\nDo yourself a favour and stop playing that sluggish broken mess that is Ultra Elena Land IV and join us in the good stuff =)","December 12, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Problems however arise as the netcode is a bit shoddy at the time of this review (It's like a chore to find a functioning match to play, Player matches also have some issues) but other than that the game is fine. For those who have toasters, your in luck as this runs reletively well on said PCs. You can find more information about that in the Steam discussion forums somewhere.\nThis game was even one of the many reasons I bought a PS4 (and damn was it worth the purchase) but now you can skip the buying a PS4 part and instead grab it on your trusty computer.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is worth your money especially if you love fighting games. Even if the newest version REVELATOR comes almost 3 months or so from now, it won't be a big problem as balance changes from SIGN to that are minimal. Go ahead and pick it up. DLC is also free for this month so consider that.\n\nIf you ever need someone to fight in Xrd, I'm all for the challenge.

I don't think I can express how greatful I am to see such an amazing & functional port of what I would consider to be the most impressive 2.5D fighting game released to date. Absolutely amazing job, 10/10 would buy again, highly recommended for realsies.\n\nIf I did have to make one very minor criticism of the game it would have to be that my waifu, Baiken, is completely missing. Since her appearance in Guilty Gear (PSX) she has steadily fell lower & lower through the ranks with each passing game & is now reduced to nothing more then a footprint in the sand, threatened to be washed out of existence by the sea of the ever changing Guilty Gear timeline. She used to be your series Akuma, harder to unlock than Justice, & now she's just gone! I just can't stand for this, you gotta bring her back. I don't care if you have to pull some SJW bull, tell everyone that her inclusion helps diversify the roster or whatever. She's only got one arm, that has to be worth something! All I want is to make Guilty Gear great again. Just bring Baiken back. #BringBackBaiken","February 23","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also a personal one, I couldn't find an option to hide the keyboard controls, so the commands in challenges will always blink changing keyboard and controller inputs making it really annoying. Technically speaking, it has few graphic options, but it runs great, also you have to tweak the config files to max out resolutions or decrease graphics and so, but overall is a really good port except from small things that I found annoying like some sprites on the menus are pixelated (I don't know if its the games fault or my resolution). I don't know if the PS4 online is better, but if so, I can only recommend this to people that don't have a PS4 or just wanna play it for the story or locally with friends.\n\nEDIT: matchmaking is still down, game needs more patches\nEDIT (22/2/2016): Recently I got the PS4 version and I can say the online is a little more active there, here on Steam has been "officialy dead" for weeks now (100~ players), connectivity is now patched, lobbies work fine, still haven't played ranked due to the lack of players, but you can find players on the steam group or in the reddit community, so if you don't mind struggling to find players, get this game (also the DLC is cheaper).","December 14, 2015","true","54.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not utilizing 17% of my GPU.  Speaking of Story Mode, there are such bad sync issues that it's nearly like you hear voices and no lips movement for 5 seconds after the voices are done.  Other than that, the game is a PS3 port with AA.  What that means is expect at most DirectX9, 720p assets and cutscenes, and if you are playing on high resolution, then forget about seeing anything but pixelation like it's an old bootleg VHS of anime during those scenes.  The game could really benefit from the DirectX11 1080p cutscenes, renders, and assets to possibly make my GPU use 25%. It's a ram hog.  Says that it's utilizing 12Gb of my system memory when it's running.  Also, using my x-arcade or my quanba Q2 LED, yields the same results of controls being B to select and A to back out.  I had to change my controls before playing.  Seems the same way on my Xbox One controller as well.   Please holding out hope that they will release a high resolution texture and prerender pack or even dlc to get it to look better during the non play moments, and fix the almost 26 seconds of audio to mouthflap lag that goes on in  between fights(If you're reading Arksystem  Works or H2 Publishing or whoever did this, please give this to us.

For this reason, I must say that the learning curve is pretty darn steep. This game is NOT for players with short attention spans (e.g. immature CoD/CSGO players, casual players in general). The controls will feel wonky and unintuitive if you're also coming from Smash Bros. because the mindset you have to adopt is COMPLETELY different. It still feels that way, but given the gameplay videos I've seen on YouTube, I really think that the effort will pay off in the end.\n\nOptimization/Graphics:\n\nThe game runs at a locked 60fps (because button timings need to be very precise with only a few frames). It seems to run well for most people, but for those on lower-end systems (like me with Intel HD graphics), you're going to need some tweaking in the files because the graphics settings in-game are more of a hindrance than they are helpful. Once the tweaking is done, the game should run very smoothly. In my opinion, the tweaks don't take too much away from the overall look because of the brilliant art style and cel-shaded graphics.\n\nMusic:\n\nIt's good and makes sense for this game, but as a rather completely new player, I don't want to hear the same song over and over again when I'm struggling my way through the 50-step tutorial. Allowing custom music would be nice (I imagine it wouldn't be too hard to implement). In any case, I would probably just mute the in-game music entirely and hand-pick power metal songs on YouTube.\n\nStory:\n\nDon't know much, but there is character development in the tutorial (and the Steam Trading cards give backstory!), which is good. I will get to it when I'm fully comfortable with the controls.\n\n----\nOVERALL:\n\nThe difficulty of this game is daunting, but the art style and amount of thought put into this game convince me to keep trying.\n\n??/10 indecisive.","December 12, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

But looks aren't the only things this game has, it also has amazing gameplay with it that will turn any heads.\n\nLanding that overdrive, that DESTROY, chaining up attacks, everything about this game will make you feel good and feel cool about every move you do. You can easily learn the controls to this game, but boy if you think you can face off against people in Guilty Gear like it was Skullgirls, you best be calling GG because there's a long way to mastering this fighting game series and that's what makes this game have lasting replayability. There's always something new to learn at every turn at every character.\n\nAnd if that's not enough for you, THE MUSIC IS GUARENTEED TO PUMP YOU THE ♥♥♥♥ UP, Daisuke Ishiwatari has the best music for fighting games ESPEICALLY FOR GUILTY GEAR. His music is full of heavy rock with inspiration from Gun and Roses and other bands (Even the game itself has inspiration and references to Rock music) Everything about the music fits the fast and crazy fights of Guilty Gear, that to be honest without it Guilty Gear wouldn't feel like Guilty Gear.\n\nOverall this game is a solid 10/10, 11/10, ROCK YOU/10 because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to hate this game, moreso this amazing port to the PC.","December 13, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just Faust.\nHowever, there are a few problems (not that the game's bad):\n-Roster size is a little small compared to other fighters (Revelator will fix that a bit)\n-English voices are waaaay inferior to the Japanese voicetrack (a bit petty, I know)\n-I'm waaay too scared to even touch online (a more personal, "scrubby" issue)\nStill, I'd recommend it, especially if you want to scratch that fighting game itch with something different than Stret Fighter.

Not utilizing 17% of my GPU.  Speaking of Story Mode, there are such bad sync issues that it's nearly like you hear voices and no lips movement for 5 seconds after the voices are done.  Other than that, the game is a PS3 port with AA.  What that means is expect at most DirectX9, 720p assets and cutscenes, and if you are playing on high resolution, then forget about seeing anything but pixelation like it's an old bootleg VHS of anime during those scenes.  The game could really benefit from the DirectX11 1080p cutscenes, renders, and assets to possibly make my GPU use 25%. It's a ram hog.  Says that it's utilizing 12Gb of my system memory when it's running.  Also, using my x-arcade or my quanba Q2 LED, yields the same results of controls being B to select and A to back out.  I had to change my controls before playing.  Seems the same way on my Xbox One controller as well.   Please holding out hope that they will release a high resolution texture and prerender pack or even dlc to get it to look better during the non play moments, and fix the almost 26 seconds of audio to mouthflap lag that goes on in  between fights(If you're reading Arksystem  Works or H2 Publishing or whoever did this, please give this to us.

But looks aren't the only things this game has, it also has amazing gameplay with it that will turn any heads.\n\nLanding that overdrive, that DESTROY, chaining up attacks, everything about this game will make you feel good and feel cool about every move you do. You can easily learn the controls to this game, but boy if you think you can face off against people in Guilty Gear like it was Skullgirls, you best be calling GG because there's a long way to mastering this fighting game series and that's what makes this game have lasting replayability. There's always something new to learn at every turn at every character.\n\nAnd if that's not enough for you, THE MUSIC IS GUARENTEED TO PUMP YOU THE ♥♥♥♥ UP, Daisuke Ishiwatari has the best music for fighting games ESPEICALLY FOR GUILTY GEAR. His music is full of heavy rock with inspiration from Gun and Roses and other bands (Even the game itself has inspiration and references to Rock music) Everything about the music fits the fast and crazy fights of Guilty Gear, that to be honest without it Guilty Gear wouldn't feel like Guilty Gear.\n\nOverall this game is a solid 10/10, 11/10, ROCK YOU/10 because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to hate this game, moreso this amazing port to the PC.","December 13, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have an i3 2.2Ghz CPU, 1GB Nvidia 630M (yes, M!) and 4GB RAM running Win7 64bit and I have it running at 60fps, which is a must.\n\nThe netcode is actually pretty decent. I'm in China and I have managed to play people in Asia with 1-4 frame delay and I'm using WIFI!!\n\nRoster is interesting. I will admit I was sad to see all of my favourite characters gone (Zappa, Jam, Johnny), but the new characters are unique, I especially love Ramlethal and Elphelt, and the returning characters are true to their previous incarnations.\n\nGraphics are amazing. This is the new standard for cell shading. The animation is slick and maintains the style from the sprite based games and the stages look good.\n\nThe game system is the "usual" ArcSys fare; double jumps, air dashes, Roman Cancels, instant blocking, etc.\nThe mechanics are slightly toned down compared to Accent Core, but it's still a solid system. Remember Accent Core was evolved over many itterations to get as complicated as it was and this is effectively a "new" chapter for Guilty Gear.\n\nProblems, there are a few. Ranked matches often don't connect, Lobbies sometimes cannot be joined. There is a memory leak. Some of the keyboard keys apparently cannot be bound (I use stick so I don't know details). Some problems with using certain resolutions (there are work arounds). The devs have acknowledged these problems and are working on a patch at the time of writing (playing launch version, no patches).\n\nWhy are you still reading this, buy it now.","December 14, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For this reason, I must say that the learning curve is pretty darn steep. This game is NOT for players with short attention spans (e.g. immature CoD/CSGO players, casual players in general). The controls will feel wonky and unintuitive if you're also coming from Smash Bros. because the mindset you have to adopt is COMPLETELY different. It still feels that way, but given the gameplay videos I've seen on YouTube, I really think that the effort will pay off in the end.\n\nOptimization/Graphics:\n\nThe game runs at a locked 60fps (because button timings need to be very precise with only a few frames). It seems to run well for most people, but for those on lower-end systems (like me with Intel HD graphics), you're going to need some tweaking in the files because the graphics settings in-game are more of a hindrance than they are helpful. Once the tweaking is done, the game should run very smoothly. In my opinion, the tweaks don't take too much away from the overall look because of the brilliant art style and cel-shaded graphics.\n\nMusic:\n\nIt's good and makes sense for this game, but as a rather completely new player, I don't want to hear the same song over and over again when I'm struggling my way through the 50-step tutorial. Allowing custom music would be nice (I imagine it wouldn't be too hard to implement). In any case, I would probably just mute the in-game music entirely and hand-pick power metal songs on YouTube.\n\nStory:\n\nDon't know much, but there is character development in the tutorial (and the Steam Trading cards give backstory!), which is good. I will get to it when I'm fully comfortable with the controls.\n\n----\nOVERALL:\n\nThe difficulty of this game is daunting, but the art style and amount of thought put into this game convince me to keep trying.\n\n??/10 indecisive.","December 12, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Not utilizing 17% of my GPU.  Speaking of Story Mode, there are such bad sync issues that it's nearly like you hear voices and no lips movement for 5 seconds after the voices are done.  Other than that, the game is a PS3 port with AA.  What that means is expect at most DirectX9, 720p assets and cutscenes, and if you are playing on high resolution, then forget about seeing anything but pixelation like it's an old bootleg VHS of anime during those scenes.  The game could really benefit from the DirectX11 1080p cutscenes, renders, and assets to possibly make my GPU use 25%. It's a ram hog.  Says that it's utilizing 12Gb of my system memory when it's running.  Also, using my x-arcade or my quanba Q2 LED, yields the same results of controls being B to select and A to back out.  I had to change my controls before playing.  Seems the same way on my Xbox One controller as well.   Please holding out hope that they will release a high resolution texture and prerender pack or even dlc to get it to look better during the non play moments, and fix the almost 26 seconds of audio to mouthflap lag that goes on in  between fights(If you're reading Arksystem  Works or H2 Publishing or whoever did this, please give this to us.

But looks aren't the only things this game has, it also has amazing gameplay with it that will turn any heads.\n\nLanding that overdrive, that DESTROY, chaining up attacks, everything about this game will make you feel good and feel cool about every move you do. You can easily learn the controls to this game, but boy if you think you can face off against people in Guilty Gear like it was Skullgirls, you best be calling GG because there's a long way to mastering this fighting game series and that's what makes this game have lasting replayability. There's always something new to learn at every turn at every character.\n\nAnd if that's not enough for you, THE MUSIC IS GUARENTEED TO PUMP YOU THE ♥♥♥♥ UP, Daisuke Ishiwatari has the best music for fighting games ESPEICALLY FOR GUILTY GEAR. His music is full of heavy rock with inspiration from Gun and Roses and other bands (Even the game itself has inspiration and references to Rock music) Everything about the music fits the fast and crazy fights of Guilty Gear, that to be honest without it Guilty Gear wouldn't feel like Guilty Gear.\n\nOverall this game is a solid 10/10, 11/10, ROCK YOU/10 because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to hate this game, moreso this amazing port to the PC.","December 13, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Problems however arise as the netcode is a bit shoddy at the time of this review (It's like a chore to find a functioning match to play, Player matches also have some issues) but other than that the game is fine. For those who have toasters, your in luck as this runs reletively well on said PCs. You can find more information about that in the Steam discussion forums somewhere.\nThis game was even one of the many reasons I bought a PS4 (and damn was it worth the purchase) but now you can skip the buying a PS4 part and instead grab it on your trusty computer.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is worth your money especially if you love fighting games. Even if the newest version REVELATOR comes almost 3 months or so from now, it won't be a big problem as balance changes from SIGN to that are minimal. Go ahead and pick it up.

From the complete overhaul on how the controls respond, to tweaks of the original system and gauges, each battle is both combatative and strategic in a way that has been really flushed out now. Every character is a blast to use, and every animation and sound is pure and crisp.\n\nI recommend any guilty gear game to any person who likes fghting games. Play them now. Suki! Yaki!

Many songs just have no progression and sound very similar to one another.\n\nOther than the "still good, but not as good as older stuff" music, you seriously can't find a better fighter.\n\n","December 14, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DGFisawesome/recommended/376300/","DGFisawesome","FDb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DGFisawesome/","722 products in account","After literally more than a decade of EIGHT versions of X & X2 (not including the awkward spin-offs) Guilty Gear finally gets the proper sequel it deserves. Rebuilt to be an entirely new entry it has the same excellent fast gameplay as X2 with newbie friendly tweaks, five new characters, and the absolute best visuals of any 3D anime game to date. Between the game's approach to story and M.O.M (survival with persistant RPG stats) mode, it also has the most worthwhile singleplayer content in the entire series. It thankfully even has a tutorial mode extremely similar to BlazBlue's.\n\nThe most unavoidable weakness of the game is the missing characters, but that's only a minor complaint considering how surprisingly good the roster is without Dizzy, Baiken, Johnny, Robo-Ky, etc. All the returning characters have been intelligently picked for diversity's sake and all the new characters are worthy additions that bring something fresh to the franchise, Ramlethal and Leo in particular are excellent.\n\nThe other thing that needs to be mentioned is the legitimately terrible english voice acting, which can be switched back to familiar Japanese voices thankfully. (I only mention this because it's on by default. If you're already familiar with the Guilty Gear series you will want to switch it immediately. Ky sounds ♥♥♥♥ing awful.)\n\nMost concerning however is the online mode. While it defintely works with friends with very little issues I've had serious problems finding games with the search function, I've especially never found a ranked match. Weirdly enough I've set up public player rooms and they eventually become populated and work fine. I'm not sure what that's about but it needs to be patched.\n\nThis is Ark System Work's most polished game to date, and I cannot wait to see Xrd grow stronger. Just make sure your computer will be able to run the game at a stable 60fps for no slowdown, and then ideally with a controller prepare yourself for one of the best fighting games ever made.","December 20, 2015","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is pretty crazy. And by "crazy", I mean really good. I've only touched the training mode so far, but from what I've played, I am very impressed.\nTo elaborate on why it's so good, let's take a look:\n-Character diversity is rich\n-Simple yet deep gameplay\n-The new characters fit in seamlessly with the veterans\n-Speaking of which, the veterans are still great, as always (Millia loks great, Potemkin looks much better, Sol is still a badass)\n-Quite a few colors (not as much as Skullgirls, but still a lot)\n-Lots of things to do in single-player alone\n-Online seems alright, from what I've heard (the frame delay display is a genius idea)\n-Faust. Just Faust.\nHowever, there are a few problems (not that the game's bad):\n-Roster size is a little small compared to other fighters (Revelator will fix that a bit)\n-English voices are waaaay inferior to the Japanese voicetrack (a bit petty, I know)\n-I'm waaay too scared to even touch online (a more personal, "scrubby" issue)\nStill, I'd recommend it, especially if you want to scratch that fighting game itch with something different than Stret Fighter.

It is ton of fun to play it with another people, even your friends. For negative parts, I agree ranked is broken for now, but I bet it gonna be repaired soon enough.

Also tested on another computer with an Asus R7 250X 1GB which performs exactly like the HD 7770 recommended at the store page & it does run like butter on it. Also seems to perform fine on a HD 6850, but there appears to be problems still with some systems, especially laptops for some reason.\n\nTo continue, I now get a smooth 60fps across all circumstances in an extended hours of play & the fight pacing is so fast it's like a different game at all.

I'm never for one to care much about it but this game is glorious. 3D which are made to imitate handdrawn drawings can usually still appear 3D, but this game is a game changer in that field.

The devs sure knows how 2D animation techniques works & implemented it flawlessly with the 3D models (suffice to say, that's a damn hard feat).\n\nNext comes the rule book. Basically, the tutorial. Older GG fans know the stuff, but even then this is the first time that there's an actual tutorial explaining what are stuffs like Roman Cancel, Gattling Combination & Dead Angle, their mechanicsm & how to pull them off & in what situation. There is also a challenge mode which is basically where you learn combos & what probable combo chains you can create with them. This also gives newcomers an opportunity to edge up to veteran GG players quicker.\n\nThe fighting in GG is also known to be very fast, as in this one & perhaps the fastest in the genre of fighting games, yet it can also get very technical & requires precise input if you're really thinking of beating people. As hardcore as it is, GG is also surprisingly easy to get into. Any beginner can pick it up & could play it pretty well after sometime. Yet it's of those kind which is hard to master. Real mean gattling combos can get very tricky to pull off but the payoff is tremendous as you could juggle or pin down your opponent given they're clueless on how to get out of your mean pushes, but of course- if your opponent knows what he's doing, he can also save himself in many different way, so no unfair edge there.\n\nCharacters are also very diversified in terms of gameplay. Characters range from melee to ranged attackers to other weird shenanigans & none plays the same. The only downside to this however it'd take a really long time if you want to master them all as GG is the kind of game where it pays to main a character of your own choosing & play using him/her almost all the time. So take your pick & train hard. And if you play with too many too much, others will surpass you in any given character.\n\nI'd rant longer. But I need to go to sleep but including this & what everyone's saying, it's a great game, simply put. Some of us are luck to not/no longer face bugs with the game, but hopefully continued support is provided & they can fix the problem.","December 15, 2015","true","119.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","10"

Each character has a unique play style that you can tether to your own style to create new and fun combos. now unfortunately i live in an area where there arent many players so i suffer from long distancxe network issues but all in all its still a fun experience and it will definately test your metal as a gamer to excell at this game. the graphics are exceptional for a fighting game and i love the new look from the classic style of this series.\n\nmy only real complaint that is the reason i am less fond of this game is that in other installments the characters that were provided before had truly unique weapons and abilities that arent seen in this installment take example bridget or dizzy they did not return in this installment and i felt that the devs decided againtst that for unknown reasons but with the addition to the new characters that have been added they are intresting and fun to play and still as i stated earlier this game is a treat.\n\nnow im going to gush okay coming from old installments this game in particular has made you sit infront of your TV for hours mastering and perfecting rediculus and demanding combos it has been a staple oin this series since the dawn of the original guilty gear, only one thing about that has changed in this and that is the YRC or yellow roman cancels system. this allows ytou to burn a 1/4 of your tension meter to cancel anything and everything that you are doing on that exacT frame and this allows you to come up with never before seen combos and for those of you who are advanced mix-ups and mind games. will this was a staple in earlier installments you had to be dead on the money sometimes fram perfect and even then it was a mild advantage if you were able to utilize it through hours maybe days of practice. all anmd all i loive this series and they have breathed a starter of life backing into it and they made my blood boil like it did when i was younger im excited to get back into the swing of playing competeitively again","December 19, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good luck finding Ranked matches, however. Most play will be in the Player Lobbies. Fortunately, as of the first month, there's usually a good number of lobbies and players with a range in skill, so it's easy to have fun getting your ♥♥♥ kicked and watching others follow your example. If you've got friends to play with, or want to engage in a great fighter online, then this a pretty gold example in a world where Netherealm servers are still a thing.\n\nThe tutorial and challenge modes are some of the best in the genre, easing in new players and vets alike to the system mechanics and basic fundementals before you ever have to tackle a real match. You can spend hours in training without even realizing it. The combat is streamlined compared to past entries, but for the better in most cases (YRCs never needed to be as stupid tight to pull off for how integral they are to Guilty Gear's combat).\n\nSingle player is a mixed bag outside of learning. Story is eh, but like the gameplay, does a good job of explaining everything to newcomers to the series, wraps up quickly enough and offers plenty to those willing to sink their teeth into it. Arcade is your simple 8 AI fights wrapping up with a rival and final boss. M.O.M mode is an incredible grind with RPG elements attached to the fighter experience, and that's really all that's left.\n\nThese modes might be more enjoyable if the AI were any bit competant but unfortunately they're pushovers. Even on the hardest difficulty setting they rarely play like any decent player, lacking any pressure or severe combos to punish players, and they give no indication as to how the respective character is meant to be played. This is crucial, because now a player not only needs to play against real players to test how valid their practice is, but to also learn matchups outside of the tiny bit the challenge modes cover. The AI is very bland by comparison to the great example SFV has set in place (Even if that is a much simpler game).\n\nAlso, as is usual of Aksys, this version of the game will soon be outdated in a few months thanks to their God awful PC Release schedules, and the same will be said of Blazblue CPE once that releases 2 years after the first iteration came to consoles.\nIf you own a PS3/4, wait for Revelator. If you only game on PC, this is the most accessible, up to date Guilty Gear available.

I didn't see that many maps in this game which seems like a bummer since they have more depth to their background animation.\n\nstory mode could use more animation in it and I would like to see more from millia rage zato slayer and venom.. didn't see much of that side in it... the story seemed very holy crusadish...\n\nPotemkins commander should be a playable character.. he is seriously the most badass person in the games story mode besides sol badguy.","April 11","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The customization regarding graphics is quite limited. If you wanna do anything fancy with the display and what not, you have to mess around with the .ini files\nThank god the community is so fast and tight in the game where they have tips to help optimize your frame rate and such\n\nThe online play is quite good from what i experinced. Playing with 3-4 bars of connection felt as if the person was right beside me playing with only 1-4 frames delay. Thats not to say that it has its share of bad connection and horrible frame delays, although i suspect thats partly due to connection issues.\n\nOverall this is a great game & port!\nTotally worth the money\n\nIf you really wanna take Guilty Gear seriously and play with people in Malaysia! there is a community page for Malaysia. We do meetups and plenty of net play\nMalaysian Community :- http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075057027/groups/\n- https://www.facebook.com/groups/GuiltyGearMY/","December 13, 2015","true","390.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, once I became one of the boys with an updated computer and graphics card I was able to witness the splendor that is Guilty Gear XRD. The game is one's proverbial 2D fighter, where ea ch character has their own unique play style, combos do not have to be done in a 1-frame link sequence and the presentation of the characters and environment are well presented. Furthermore, whether one plays online or against the ai, the introduction to the battles are well concocted in addition to the instant kill moves. I would reccommend this game to anyone in a heartbeat, because the cinematics are well-developed in addition to the gameplay itself, truely a phenomenal game.","March 6","true","97.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Right off, Guilty Gear is ♥♥♥♥ing METAL, the volume is at base just louder which is an odd thing to think about or notice but its funny/awesome/welcome.\n\nGameplay is smooth and just like the earlier games insofar as attacks and combos are concerned, but the fresh system takes out all the particulars that started to plague later games in terms of balance.\n\nGraphics aren't usually a thing it talk about as an essential thing, and while i'm not saying this is cryteck ♥♥♥♥, but its a better looking game than so many others on the market. the choice to make it cell shaded is amazing and even the animation to the game is made to mimic the older 2D games, which this does wonderfully. the game is speedy as well much like a 2D game despite it being 3d models.\n\nStylistically Guilty Gear Xrd is far above whats out here in the AAA range but also a great addition to the series and welcome to the fighting game community.

While the Online mode has slightly less features (but nothing compromising) what I like that the PC is actually faster in terms of input lag (only 1 frame of input lag compared to the 4 of the PS4 version). Now this does not make the PC versione Arcade Perfect, HOWEVER it is absolutely a good thing if you plan to play this game online as the game being faster will make the online matches feel like the offline coin-op version of the game.\n\nUnless you are blessed with an active local scene or a group of friends that you can play with offline (for which I would recommend sticking to the PS4 version in that case), if you spend the majority of the time playing online then the PC version absolutely takes the cake.","May 12","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turns out that you have to make sure you manually set the game up in your graphic card options. Now that I got the game running its amazing. Still not alot of players online which is sad. Hopefully, the next version will be cross play between PS4 users so there is enough competition online to get this thriving scene going.\n\nIf you're new to guilty gear, you will find tutorial mode to be very entertaining and helpful. Otherwise, you will need to train ALOT! There's even a mode where you can train again certain vs character set-ups in case you fall victim to "Scrub-ville"\n\nDecent amount of characters of all style to pick from (if you get the DLC bundle).\n\nonly thing that sucks is the fact that there will be a new version coming out of this game in a month or two on consoles and we will have to play the waiting game again for Arc System to make it avaluable on PC.

Been a fan of the Guilty Gear series for a LONG TIME, and this one does not fail to deliver. Responds much better on PC than I hoped and actually fair enough for newcomers to pick up. If you haven't kept up with the series, you'll be fairly lost trying to get into the story. My only other complaint is the new art direction they went with in this one. A bit too cartoony compared to the others. Other than that, if you're a fan of the series you won't be disappointed. The story is FAR more fleshed out than in previous installments and leaves you with a good understanding of events that are taking place, if you've been a dedicated follower of the franchise.
