Where to start? Imagine yourself, for a moment, as a lion. King (or queen) of the Savanna. Within a few minutes you find yourself thirsty. You go down to the wateringhole and have yourself a nice drink. Time to relax? Nope. Now you're hungry. Time to go get food. So you bring down a wildebeast by chasing it around for a few minutes and biting it whenever you can. Eat the meat and now you're full. Time to relax yet? Nope. You're thirsty again. So, to the waterhole again. By the time you find a spot where there isn't a croc eyeing you and get a drink, well how about that, you're starving! Repeat this process two or three more times. Oh, but wouldn't you know it, a meerkat has ran up to you in the tall grass and you can't fricking see it. So you, one of the most deadly predators of the biome, has just been hunted and killed by a small animal that any lion could realistically rip the throat out of with little effort.\n\nThis game is horribly unbalanced. Pretty much any animal with an aggressive action can kill any other animal with little effort as long as the aggressor knows what to do. The meters for thirst and hunger run down way too quickly, so it's a constant struggle to keep from going thirsty or hungry that ends up being more frustrating than fun. As a carnivore, you don't feel the thrill of hunting, outwitting, and overpowering your prey, it's just a chore. As a herbivore, it's just a matter of running back and forth from a patch of edible plants and the river over and over again. It gets terribly repetative. The controls are awkward and the button to shift between aggressive and peaceful actions cycles way too quickly with anything more than the very slightest tap likely to land you on the same one you were already on.\n\nIf this game interests you, try the free version online first. Trust me, the two aren't all that different and you'll likely understand just how irritating this game is.","June 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 81 of 96 people (84%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","84","81","96","17","0"

Sometimes you randomly turn into another animal. I turned into a bear, and tried to eat a player who was a rabbit. The rabbit obviously knows the game better, because he killed me somehow. Then I think he ate me or mated with me, Im not sure, there's only like 3 sound effects in this game. The animal models don't even act like the animals they're supposed to be. The deer sits like a dog. It's strange. This game feels unfinished, and it's definitely nowhere near a realistic animal sim.","January 27","false","0.5"," 55 of 71 people (77%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","77","55","71","56","0"

Every Meerkat that saw me was instantly on attack mode and came after me. I find it a bit strange to be killed as a Wildebeest by a Meerkat, not a Lion or Crocodile, both of which never bothered me.\nThe game needs some major changes and updates, but I believe within the next few months, this game will improve for sure.\n\n-Piff","August 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","32","36","3","2"

Basically If you keep yourself alive you're winning, and what else you do is up to you.\nIt looks like their answer to hacking is to disconnect the game from the web player version right now. It makes things kinda quiet right now in multiplayer but I guess we'll see how that pans out, and on the upside you can now play directly with your friends via steam, which is a bit more relaxed than the previously manic "anything goes" web experience.\nI love flying about which feels fluid in a way that many games misss somehow, and just running about as an animal is fun.\nThe landscapes are ok, with beautiful moments mixed with not so beautiful. Generally it looks good.\nIt's not educational, it's just mucking about.\nI'd say if you ever wanted to run about like an animal in it's natural environment this game is for you, but obviously if you want huge story driven game or fps action then it's not.\nWithin it's remit I reccomends it :)\n","December 6, 2015","true","489.8"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","27","33","7","3"

Also, I looked everywhere and I can't find anything about the "practice secrets". They do not work at all...really all they do is place things like grass and food but they do not let you use them at all.....overall..I do love that they updated it and brought it back but...I am very disappointed that the game developers didn't really change anything but the look and the amount of animals.....everything else is pretty much the same.

Playing as different animals in their natural habitat as you explore and stay alive can be a fun challenge. This Early Access version is (currently) pretty much the same as Gamevial's free-to-play version in the browser; by paying for the Early Access, you'll get updates that bring Lif closer to its realization as a more realistic animal simulator/survival game.\nLif is open-world, similar to Gamevial's Fly Like a Bird 3, but Lif takes survival to another level. Naturally the animals chase and kill each other constantly because Lif allows you to attack or befriend as you please, but we can expect improvements in gameplay as Lif evolves. There's fun in being able to roam around doing what you want anyway, and we'll be able to do more as the game gets better.\nLif has huge potential, and as with any game, the only way it will improve is by supporting its development.","July 13, 2015","true","8.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I.. just coulent get into the point. It is nothing like it describes, it has no charts or lists or overlay to tell you what anything does or how to do anything. You don't get to Pick an animal to start, like it makes it sound. You will start out as a rabbit or a Meerkat depending on the biome you chose to start in. You simply run around and try not to die. There really is nothing else to it. From what I am reading totems might have something to do with picking a new animal. I opt for a refund already, There is not even anything to explore, Ive ran around but it seems like the area you start is a bit of it's own little loop and no matter how far you run, you are just going in circles.

The Demo version on steam is the same just without 2 maps.\n\nThere are alot of bad reviews by people who don't even know what they've bought.\n\nLif is an "animal survival simulator"\nYou start in a large map with other animals. You can even choose which animal you would like to play, like\neagles, deers, elephants, lions, etc. your task is to survive, which you can do by finding food, hunting animals and\ndrink water in rivers. The game offers beautiful maps, and a survival feeling. You can "roleplay" animal tribes with your friends like playing the "alpha male" as a lion in a large group, feeding the pregnant females (yes you can even mate), and fight your way up in the group. This game is really challenging, as even your own friends and race can kill you.\n\nSo what makes this game good enough for me to write a good review about it?:\n\n-There are no other animal survival simulators with such many animals\n-This is a good survival simulator\n-It is ALOT of fun to play with friends\n-you can make your own tribe\n-Mating hehehe\n-raise up your child\n-fight your way up and gain respect by others to become the alpha male\n-hunting and of course seeking shelter (holes for foxes, rabbits, climb on trees as a baboon)\n-This is really relaxing when you sit on a tree as a baboon and just watch the landscape and lions ripping elephants apart\n-offers a singleplayer mode (It's not that good, it's about the multiplayer)\n-Feed your kit's to raise them\n\nI had alot of fun with this game. I played with friends, played in giant elephant groups fighting against lions and defending our kits, climbed trees as a baboon to escape lions, hunted all kinds of animals that entered a river as a crocodile, flied across the map as an eagle or crow to hunt small animals, played in small wolf packs killing animals and bunnies, raised my kits in a fox hole defending them from harm, ran away by all kinds of birds as a hedghehog in the desert, ran across the map with my small lizard, surviving lions as grass eating animal, fighting my way through the forest as a bear, prooved myself as an alpha lion.\n\nThis game is so much fun seriously! The bad reviewers did not even know what they bought. If you want a animal survival simulator with a bit of roleplaying packs and such things this is the right thing. This game is in beta and existed as a browser version, which is full of hackers, so they released a safe steam version.\n\nYou DO NOT need to buy it. The DEMO version is actually the full version and offers all the maps from the browser version.\nTHIS version is like a DLC with 2 maps and new animals.\n\nGOOD GAME! Play the demo for free!\n\n\n","February 5","true","27.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I love the idea of Lif, always have. However, I spent less than an hour playing the "new" version, and went through steam to get a refund. Bottom line? The game is just not enjoyable anymore. Multiplayer is an utter joke, and single player is vastly more annoying than it is fun. I would highly suggest not purchasing Lif at this time, it’s a money grab on a web game that was free-to-play for many years. Until the game gets a true update, and not just more useless content, I would advise looking into other naturalist type games.","February 12","false","0.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Pregnet females should have a name above the name in scent mode. same with female and male for others\n7. More animals! :3 i suggest adding...
