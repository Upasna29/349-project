"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/288160/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","My initial impression of this was it struck me as slightly intimidating, like it was going to be a full on, hardcore puzzler that would probably require lots of knowledge of mathematics and note-taking, or just generally prove to showcase my ignorance as I'd have to hit Google a lot to find information for the answers, but I couldn't have been more wrong. It's much more about observation and curiosity and how savvy the player is at uncovering a secret hidden in plain sight.\n\nThe game is divided into five chapters, each literally revolving around some kind of object, be it a safe or table or elaborately decorated box, and it's up to the player to investigate every part of it for hidden compartments and objects to further unlock ever more secrets inside. I loved how unassuming every object looked, only to then find huge sections of it popping open to reveal some intricate mechanism to interact with and figure out. There are some slightly more conventional style puzzles along the way, but like the larger objects that house them, they're really more about poking and prodding at something to find out how it works rather than being a test of knowledge. It really is incredibly accessible, even for those who conventionally wouldn't ever go anywhere near puzzle games.\n\nIt's surprisingly atmospheric as well, giving a feeling that the more you strip away of the puzzles and the deeper you get into these contraptions, the more you're digging into something you probably shouldn't be and into a world much bigger than you. That also ties in with the story, told through notes tucked away by a slightly mad scientist as he searches for some mystical form of energy. This is also helped by occasionally switching views to a special eye glass which reveals a world hidden behind the shadows of everything you see around you. It's a really clever element that ties to both the puzzles and the story and gives something extra to what could have easily been a straightforward game about playing with a puzzle box.\n\nI'm trying to think of any downsides worth mentioning before you go into this, but I really can't think of any. There may not be a massive amount of replay value, since discovery is the main objective of the game, but even so I really look forward to going through it all again some day. It helps too that it's only about 2 or 3 hours long as well. Maybe it could have been a little bolder in challenging the player with some of the puzzles, but that's really a minor complaint to what was an otherwise fun and enjoyable experience, and maybe they'll up the ante a little if the second and third games in the series ever make their way to PC. I really hope they do release them here, and if they do then I'll be first in line to play them, but to those who haven't had the pleasure yet, I could easily recommend this to all without a moment's hesitation.","November 4, 2015","true","5.6"," 74 of 79 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","74","79","0","0"

Puzzle. Boxes.\n\nI'm not sure what it is about locks, tiny keys, hidden compartments, pushy things, slidy things, twisty things, little odds and ends here and there carved in exquisite woods and inlaid with embossed metals that causes me to foam at the mouth in sheer ecstasy -- but this game captured the essence of mystery and romance of that which is the puzzle box, in its entirety.\n\n"The Room" is one of the very few puzzle box games that I enjoyed every second of. There are no giant leaps in logic. The puzzles are wonderfully automatized. The euphoric feeling of hearing something click -- seeing something change -- is present and accounted for!\nSome might say the game is too easy, or that there is only one route, but this is the reality of the puzzle box. Most puzzle boxes in video games do not function like real, living, breathing puzzle boxes; however, this game comes as close as I've seen. I flowed through the chapters, following not only the logic of the puzzles, but the mechanical design of the box itself! It was a comfortable challenge and a feast for the eyes.\n\nThe game was thoroughly satisfying, regardless of the fact that it took me a mere two hours to complete.

Renowned for his tenuos grasp of things like the english language, directing, producing, writing and acting, Tommy has now turned to videogames as the medium in which to ply his craft. His first foray into this is a painstaking look at the nature of puzzles and how they effect us in life. After being betrayed and torn apart by his girlfriend Lisa, and discovering he is the fool, Tommy constructs an elaborate puzzle box to house his will and testement that names Denny, his mentally challenged neighbor/adopted son, the sole heir to his monumental fortune from working in at the Bank before commiting suicide. You play as Johnnies lawyer, charged with unlocking the box before Lisa and her evil cohorts can kill Denny. Their plan is to assassinate him while he's playing football in a tuxedo, something he does every day, so the time table is very tight on this thriller. Unlock box after box and throw spoons at the screen as puzzles refuse to relent.

A good port, not missing graphics settings for it massively upgraded visuals and quite good mouse controls for what is obviously a thing made for touchscreens with all the sliding and turning.\n\nYou've got an object, a big puzzle box, around which you revolve and zoom in on specific areas to interact with them by sliding things, turning knobs and dials, pressing buttons and whatnot. There are five stages, 4 original and one that was a DLC on mobile.\n\nThe puzzles are not exceedingly hard and if you ever find yourself not knowing what to do, there's a hint button that will provide you with several notes, starting at quite vague so you will still feel some accomplishment from solving the puzzle. The whole game is quite short, took me about 2 and 1/2 hours using few hints here and there.\n\nAside from really nice graphics I have to mention the sounds. Dials click, twisty metal things squeak a little, hidden mechanism going into action sound really satisfying. Every time I loaded the game I just had to mess with the keyhole cover in the main menu - so good!\n\nOnly negatives I found (not counting the game length as I consider the shortness a good thing - it doesn't overstay its welcome) are the controls spazzing out a little few times when you turn an object, and an unfixed bug that prevents you from finishing one puzzle in the DLC stage if your monitor is above 60hz - workaround for this was switching to windowed mode for five seconds to finish the puzzle, and back.\n\nOverall, heartily recommended.\n2.5 golden sloths.","February 7","true","3.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

Awesome...probably deserves a mic drop for being possibly the greatest puzzle game ever (IMO anyway). It really gets everything right: graphics, story, sound, atmosphere and ambiance, controls...everything is pretty perfect. My wife, who had played the original version kept saying how much better this port looked, sounded, and controlled over the original (due to the HD upgrades I guess), although I don't personally have a means to compare personally. What I can tell you is that it was an amazing experience. It's a very challenging game at times, but it never overwhelms and never feels cheap. Basically, you are following clues left by The Rooms creator, who was researching a basically unknown alchemical element (you know: earth, wind, fire, water...those are the four, and contrary to what the movie said, the Fifth Element isn't love, lol (at least, not in this game). It has a sort of creepy vibe to it, but it isn't actually scary at all. It's really more mysterious than anything else. I had no idea what was going to happen next. The ending clearly paved the way to part 2, which I haven't played yet (although I can see why people are chomping at the bit waiting for it to be ported to PC as well). ). I actually thought the ending was kind of comical, not because it's actually funny, but more because of how much effort you put into getting there....and while I know this probably doesn't make much sense reading it, it will totally make sense once you actually experience the ending. Still, it was a great ending that was also an obvious lead in to Part Two.\nI highly recommend this game, and although it's only getting 70's on average on metacritic, I easily give this game 10 out of 10.

If it had been longer, or if there I'd owned any potential sequels, I would not be writing this now. I'd have continued playing sans hesitation. Yet, questions remain.\n\nBut there really isn't much to say without compromising the enjoyment of this puzzle game for new players, so I won't try. Simply that the "craftsmanship" of the items was superb, and the "supernatural" storyline eliminated any physics issues to arise in players' minds. The controls were about as simple as one would ever hope to encounter, and more or less intuitive. I only hope the developers had as much fun making this game as I had in playing it.\n\nIt didn't take long to realize that EVERYTHING of value toward solving each and every puzzle was immediately available. It was rarely even necessary to look further than a foot or so away, even though that slippery slope might easily have been provided more layered challenges. I dare say without spoiling too much, just about the ONLY outside information needed was a knowledge of the primary colors. Yes, about 3rd grade knowledge. Even a reference to a verse from something as universally accessible as the Christian Bible served a completely different, albeit more interesting and deceptively simple purpose.\n\nOddly contrary to expectations, the last part of this game became EASIER. The last section was by FAR the simplist, completed in minutes, very nearly without thought or imagination at all. Just by completing simple steps, as though the basic idea had run out of "steam", so to speak. Or perhaps, simply as restful reward for diligent players. Yet there were so many ideas unused. The notes might have been better utilized, much as the drawings began to be (though somewhat nonspecifically.) The surrounding environs perhaps put to some use, if only the walls and ceilings (which were by NO means ignored visually.) Perhaps various lenses. Not to say that anything more was needed in the existing game, but it could have been longer or more complex. Or, dare I say, to make the last section more challenging. In fact, I would not hesitate to say that the last section could have rather been one of the very first, to warm up the player instead of to try to scare some away, as seems to have been done with some of the stronger early challenges. Stronger, but NOT engineering student CRAZY hard. A reasonably curious mind with a minor bent toward lateral thinking is fully adequate. A sense of humor helps greatly. I enjoyed this game VERY much, and only wish I could continue, unabated, indefinately.\n\nThe HELP mode. Yes...and No. Admittedly, I used numerous hints, and they added to the enjoyment, though were far from perfect. (Forgive me if I sound as if I criticize my very lifesaver. They certainly added immensely for one not willing to commit to a single game for an extended time, regardless of the high quality of enjoyment.) They often gave hints that were past being of use. Perhaps that was to make a player feel smarter, but for me they often did the opposite by dumbing me down, though sometimes most amusingly.\n\nPerhaps readers of this review can offer an assist. One hint told me I had missed something in the VERY beginning that was needed. Since there is only one SAVE, and that automatic, the only option to explore that hint was to restart the entire game. But despite that drastic step, the "item" was NOT available (confirmed by player generated video), nor was it mentioned again! Any thoughts, readers?\n\nMy only remaining question is if I will research a sequel BEFORE or AFTER I post this review....\n\nAs with many Steam games, offline gametime is ignored.\n(l&h/bSw!HC)","February 11","true","0.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

So the game is split into chapters where each time you try to open something, which takes you to different rooms.\n\nThe story is pretty much not existent, but it doesn't matter.  Maybe it's my fault that I missed something, but from what I gather you find a box which belongs to a scientist who found out about a new energy source. (Probably got the entire plot wrong).\n\nThe gameplay consists of you trying to open a series of complex boxes each containing locks which you have to solve puzzles to unlock. Each of the safes have more complex mechanisms and get's more complex as the game goes on.\n\nThe game was ported from mobile to PC and the gameplay is pretty much you dragging around a mouse to look around the boxes and zooming in to find a clue or something that will help you open the box.\n\nThe game also gives you an eye piece which helps you see things you can see with the regular vision. It let's you see fingerprints and through some objects.\n\nThe puzzles are very well designed, it ranges from really simple to pretty difficult. I only had to go to a guide once in the entire game, so if you're a seasoned puzzle gamer, you shouldn't have much trouble.\n\nThe soundtrack is also really good, it helps to build tension so much, that at one point I actually thought something sinister was hidden in the boxes.\n\nThe gameplay on the other hand I felt wasn't done all that well. I had trouble getting to the part of the box I want as the mouse controls don't really work all that well. But it's just a minor gripe I had with this game.\n\nThe game took me 2 hours to finish and I had a lot of fun with it and I highly suggest you pick it up at full price and you will not be disappointed.\n\nFinal Words:\n\nOverall I have not much bad to say The Room is one of the best puzzles games ever made and I cannot wait for Part 2 to come to steam\n\nPros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n+Interesting concept\n+Great Atmosphere\n+Amazing Puzzles\n+Soundtrack\n\nCons:\n-Mouse controls aren't the best\n\nFinal Rating:\n9/10\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n\n","May 9","true","2.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","2"

It's a relaxing, casual game so it's something to enjoy on a lazy day.\n\nDespite The Room being a puzzle game, there is a small storyline. You play as a man who was gifted with a mysterious puzzle box and with each lever pulled, switch flipped, and lock undone, the boxes get smaller and more elaborate. The letter you were given by your friend states that there's a mysterious power at the core of the box and you come across diary entries that detail some mysterious reasearch, so of course you'll want to proceed further.\nThe boxes grow smaller and smaller until...Well, you'll have to find out for yourself, won't you?\n\nFor a game that's short and humbly priced, it's gorgeous and fun to sit down with.","October 13, 2014","true","3.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The 3D is really good - it must be a blast in VR. All the inputs are done with the mouse, imitating real life movements. (Much like in Penumbra: Ouverture, which is a freaking amazing game) The 3D and the mouse manipulation makes you really feel like you're manipulating your environment, turning around the box, pushing this and pulling that. It's baffling! All that wicked machinery makes you dizzy just imagining the concept phase of the game.\n\nWhat I liked the most is the sens of freedom in the gameplay, with no hand holding; yet if you're stuck you can ask for a hint. My playthrough lasted 4 hours and a half, which is a steal for the price I paid for it during the Steam sales - 1€24!). I did have a tiny bug in the puzzle before the very last one, the cube wouldn't finalize and I had to quit to the main menu and reload my game to reinitialize it and redo it. But apart from that hiccup the game was bug free.\n\nTotally recommend it! I'm not much into puzzle games - have very few patience for them - but this one hooked me right from the beginning, it's in the upper quality category.

Five chapters of awesome puzzles based on observation and logic with an eyepiece to see though quantum flux to find invisible puzzles and clues.  Each chapter is a self-contained singular overall enigma designed to be solved by progressively solving a mirade of other puzzles.  In Chapter 1 the point is to open the safe.  In Chapter 2 the point is to open the puzzle box found in the safe.  Chapter 3 starts with the now unopened box which has converted into a much larger table.  As the player goes through each chapter the player is drawn deeper into the overall mystery at the same time the quantum compressed original puzzle box gets bigger, changes shape and dimension (literally) and becomes more complex.\n\nAs far as a storyline goes it is briefly explained through various notes of encouragement, explaination and clues left behind by a mentor and friend.  Me, personally I think I would be upset with my mentor friend after dragging me through quantum leaps and alternate dimensions then not having the decency to at least explain my whereabouts at my final destination.  (The game is basically left as a 'to be continued'.)  However, this should not be a discouragement for playing this progressive logic puzzle game.\n\nNOTE/WARNING:  If the player is having trouble on the very last puzzle (a simple slider maze) and finishing the maze because the piece gets stuck, change the frame rate to say 60 FPS.  Being an older game, it seems a too high frame rate causes this tiny glitch at the end of the game.","March 15","true","7.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Some puzzles actually require you to think and such, while others make the solution not so obvious. I also noticed the improvement in things like graphics and such, which I thought was a nice improvement, though not surprising as a mobile gaming being brought to PC, it would make sense. Take advantage of bigger screen and such. All in all, while a bit of a shorter game, with the puzzles, difficulty, etc, it makes it worth the purchase and it's a game I thoroughly enjoyed.","January 30, 2015","true","2.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

That should be expected, as the original release was an iOS app.  And there are optional hints that become available over time too; they did a reasonable job of nudging me in the right direction, when needed (which I used in several spots).\n\nI personally believe that $5 for a 2 hour game is worth it; you're spending less than the average movie for about the same entertainment, and the hints are good enough while not being completely obvious.  Looking forward to any sequels, if they ever show up on Steam.","October 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I've never been much of an avid puzzle game fan. But this game was incredibly satisfying to play and complete.

Later, i forced myself to come back and give it a second, more serious attempt. A short bit of time later and I was completely engrossed. With every twist, turn and pull of the game's many odd devices, I found myself sinking deeper and deeper into a state of intense, puzzle solving euphoria.\n\nAt several points, I actually squealed with satisfaction as I giddily watched the various contraptions shift around after successfully solving their riddles.

The Room is beautiful and elaborate, but not too complicated. You will rarely find yourself stumped for very long over a puzzle, and even if you do, you can use a hint to help you out. This might make the game seem too easy, but there are so many smaller puzzles that constantly move you along onto the next one that you won't notice it. You are presented with various devices that you are trying to open, in order to find out what the cryptic messages, which you've been left, are all about. The design of these devices is brilliant, with a lot of little mechanisms and clockworks that you need to make work, hidden panels you need to uncover and keyholes you need to find keys for. The HD textures, the option to zoom in on various sections and look at them from different angles, and the fact you need to use the movement of your mouse to turn keys and open drawers make the objects you interact with seem real, almost as if they're in front of you, and that makes them strangely inviting, you can't help but want to explore them to uncover their secrets. The game is not very long, and there's not much of a story in it, but it's a great game to spend a few hours with.","November 13, 2015","true","3.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You must examine the boxes from all angles to find hidden bits and clever doodads that you can manipulate to unlock more of the like. The boxes are, for starters, gorgeous if you're into that kind of thing. There are ornate bits, there are clockwork bits, there are twisty bits, slidey bits, and some supernatural bits.\n\nHonestly, I found that last one to be kind of disappointing early on. The best part about these boxes is that they really seem like they could be built in real life... up until you get to the impossible magic parts. This isn't game ruining, and by the end I didn't mind so much. It does help with the mysterious nature of things. But part of me would have liked to just work my way deeper and deeper into one big, realistic puzzle box to find some unknowable treasure within.\n\nAt the risk of repeating myself, I honestly found that last one to be kind of disappointing. Without revealing the actual plot any, I'll say that the ending kind of isn't really an ending. You unlock all of the boxes and then you're told hey great there are more of these to come. Not really any big revelation at the end or anything satisfying, just "buy the sequel" in so many words.\n\nThis isn't really a big deal either, though. The puzzle boxes are truly their own reward, and they're what you're actually here for. Although that does bring me back to my second paragraph in a way, since if the plot doesn't really matter and doesn't really lead up to much, then we probably didn't need to go supernatural after all.\n\nThe game controls well. It's clearly an enhanced tablet port, and the controls are held over from the touchscreen days. But for once that's not a bad thing. The controls work. You click and drag to rotate the things in front of you or interact with various things. Click to look at things and interact in other ways, and double-click to get a closer look at specific parts of the puzzle boxes. Right-click to zoom back out. Simple, yet effective.\n\nThe puzzles aren't going to break you. Worst comes to worst, the hint system question mark will appear in the upper-left corner if you go like two seconds without making progress. I'm just going by how it felt, on that one. Many puzzles are of the find an item, figure out where to use the item variety. There are plenty where you must align your view to line up the parts of an image a la those Riddler puzzles in the Batman: Arkham series. Most all of the puzzles are pretty simple, though. A few maybe disappointingly so (especially those ones where you slide a thing from one end to the other by rotating the tracks in the center with it on them).\n\nThis game is, in many ways, sort of like the antithesis to Safecracker.\n\nIt's short. You can complete it under 3 hours.

Unlike other puzzle games, you're never doing "levels" in this one; your current box always teases you with several obvious locks to open, but it depends on you, your skills of logic and observation, to figure out which one and how.

Most of the puzzles included finding objects where you then had to figure out where to put the object which lead to another object for somewhere else, it seemed a bit like a wild goose chase at times but some of the puzzles did work out quite nicely.\n\nI also quite liked that there was a few keys which had moveable parts on, giving the keys their own puzzles. You had to figure out the right rotation of parts so that the key would fit in the lock. I quite like how interactive the game was with every object, rather than just putting a key in a hole and having it magically turn you actually have to turn it using the mouse, making it seem a lot more realistic. Same goes with flicking switches and opening drawers.\n\nI liked the concept of having a eyepiece which allows you to see things that aren't normally visible, I think it fitted well with the theme of being mysterious. Graphics were quite nice looking too.\n\nRecommended if you like Puzzle-Adventure games.","April 8, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a little short, but worth every penny.  Some puzzles are easier than others, but each one unique.\n\nEssentially you rotate around an object (ie box, safe, table, etc) that has a bunch of mini puzzles that are interconnected to solve the larger puzzle.  Similar to the way Nicolas Cage opened up the Resolute Desks in National Treasure 2, but way more intricate.  It's unlike any 3D puzzle game I've played and it is a must have if you enjoy puzzle solving.\n\nOn a side note, I did experience one bug with this sliding gem on a circular sectioned platform where it got stuck on a little nipple/spike thing towards the end of the puzzle.  To work around this, I did a few rather large and quick mouse drags across the screen at different angles and I got it to jump over.","July 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Something they said could never be built. It is the only one in existence, and it is the key to incomprehensible power." The note you read sits on top of a large, ornate safe, along with a smaller box that contains an eyepiece without which the note claims you will be "as blind as the rest". It warns you that the stakes are high and that the safe was constructed to keep this incomprehensible power away from lesser minds. There's only one thing left for you to do: put on the eyepiece and open the box.\n\nExcept this safe isn't easy to crack. There are dials to spin and knobs to turn and pieces missing. The whole thing is designed with puzzles in mind, providing you with a pleasantly interactive challenge to surpass in order to unlock the safe's mysterious contents. The eyepiece allows you to see once hidden drawings and symbols, which often provide important clues on how to solve certain puzzles. There are hidden compartments and switches to flip (or not to flip) and buttons disguised as decorations. And once you open up the safe? Well, let's just say there's more than one box to open.\n\nThe puzzles in the Room are well-balanced and exciting, with each one being easy enough to solve that it doesn't frustrate you. Puzzles are often interconnected, with the completion of one puzzle unlocking an item that makes the solution to another puzzle accessible. As the game progresses, the puzzles become more involved and intricate. The design of each box is intriguing and, as the environment around you changes with the game's progression, the experience slowly becomes something far more surreal and fantastic than the dusty attic you start in.\n\nOverall, the Room is a short game that will pique your interest and encourage your curiosity. It isn't a game that will force an extreme intellectual challenge on you, but it will require some logical thinking and a few of the puzzles will make you scratch your head for a minute or two. The plot is vague enough to entice you without becoming hard to understand. The Room's shining glory is, without a doubt, its slow escalation from the ordinary to the extraordinary and its wonderfully beautiful atmosphere and handsome puzzle design.

Overall, I thought this was a great game, albeit short, and was a wonderful purchase for such a low price.\n\nVisuals: 10/10\nThe visuals were a nice upgrade from the original iOS graphics, and many little details and touches really helped the immersion factor of the game.\n\nSound & Music: 10/10\nThe music and noises in the background definitely help to set the eerie tone that the devs were going for. While not necessarily memorable, the music and sounds are a must-have in this game, otherwise the atmosphere wouldn't quite work.\n\nPuzzles: 8/10\nMany puzzles were a bit too simple, and others were a serious downgrade from the iOS version. In places where you had to use two fingers on the mobile game, you instead just do the switches one after the other with the mouse. In the future, it would be nice if these types of puzzles were altered to suit the PC platform instead of showing leftover better ideas from the mobile version. I also found many puzzles a bit simple, but that could be just me.\n\nStory: 8/10\nThe conveying of story fragments through sequential letters sprinkled throughout the playthrough was very interesting and worked quite well for the game. However, I would like for the next game (which I have not been able to play, due to my Android phone being incompatible) to have more story-driven elements to it, as I found that by the time of the next letter, I had nearly forgotten the last letter. On my second playthrough, however, I noticed a lot of symbolism sprinkled throughout the game referring to the main story, so perhaps they do a better job of reminding you than I give them credit for.\n\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nI enjoyed myself immensely while playing The Room (both the Steam and Android versions) and would reccommend it to most people I know, save those who throw puzzles out the window for Call of Duty or TF2. Regardless, if you like to solve puzzles and like a good atmospheric game, perhaps a little psychologically thrilling story here and there, this is definitely for you.\n","August 19, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A whole sub-genre of video game logic deals with how preposterous and improbable it is that, for instance, an ancient civilisation designed its temple such that only by rolling sixteen balls into position and solving a maths equation could they enter.  The puzzles might be solid and entertaining and challenging, but the premise requires a hefty suspension of disbelief.\n\nNever in my life have I played a game whose puzzles are so cohesive, so plausible, so absolutely real as they are in the Room.  Fantastic, sure; impossible, absolutely, but impossible in a completely consistent, believable way that draws you into the magic of this puzzle box.  Couple this with some of the most gorgeously detailed visuals I have seen in a game and you have without question the most immersive, engaging puzzler.  Rather than a series of brain teasers connected weakly by narrative, literally the entire game is just you peeling back layer after layer of this mysterious, mystical box, very occasionally reading a cryptic note by your predecessor that answers nothing but raises more questions and drags you further into the labyrinthine structure that seems to get bigger the more you delve into it.\n\nI cannot help but say this: the science-mysticism, the mood, the puzzles, the box itself - I couldn't stop thinking this is what Hellraiser would have been like if it were made by Rand and Robyn Miller.\n\nA word about the puzzles: despite the impossibility of these mechanisms all fitting within the box, the puzzles all feel solidly mechanical, they all make perfect sense as a set of puzzles you could actually use as a sophisticated locking mechanism for a box.  Many of the puzzles involve you poking at nooks and crannies to find hidden buttons or activators or concealed drawers containing cogs or codes, and the puzzles on a layer often feed into each other, one puzzle releasing the mechanism of another.  You are given almost no clues (unless you use the hint system, which, honestly, don't - this is one game where perseverance is its own reward, and I say this as an habitual user of walkthroughs), so it really feels like you are exploring and fiddling with this incredible device, moving around it, examining its finely-crafted detail, touching it and testing for a reaction.  It feels very real.  Even in the later stages when the mystical elements start to take over - a perfectly natural evolution of the box as you delve deeper - it still feels so scientific and so physical.\n\nOn the puzzles themselves: they are not very challenging, for the most part.  Figuring out what you need to do is harder than figuring out how to do it.  There are just enough hidden activators that you can overlook that it drives home that realism and that mechanical feel, but not so many that it turns into a frustrating hidden object game.  If you know roughly what you are trying to do - for instance, activate all the levers on one side of the box - you can generally work backwards to figure out which panel you should solve first to unlock that final side, and this process of deduction and experimentation is really the core of the puzzle gameplay.  Codes don't need to be deduced, they just need to be found, but recognising that what you've found is in fact a code is the challenge.  It makes for a very deductive, exploratory experience, rather than intellectual brute force trying to calculate permutations as is common in many pure puzzlers.\n\nThere is one single puzzle towards the end of the game that I think is poorly designed.  Without spoiling it, at one point in the penultimate stage you need to interact with a music box in a way that makes no sense, cannot be predicted, cannot really be witnessed or tested, and, even after reading a walkthrough for this one roadblock, I still didn't understand the puzzle.  When you get to this bit, if you can solve it, kudos to you; I couldn't, and not because it was hard but because it was so utterly random in a game that otherwise makes perfect sense from start to finish.\n\nThis single puzzle aside, the game runs for a couple of hours, and those hours are absolutely gorgeous and engrossing.  I want to say again how stunning the detailed art for the box actually is.  I, and especially my partner with whom I played this, have a love of antique furniture, and this game won us over from the very first sight of the box.  I cannot oversell this box: mechanisms aside, if you had a piece that simply had the visual detail of any layer of this thing you would treasure it as art.  With less attention to detail, the game would still be good, but because of the incredible work they did on the appearance and fidelity of the box itself, and the way the puzzles felt so mechanical and so cohesive, the whole process of solving this game felt real in a way that puzzle games never do.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, play The Room.  It does not get any better than this.","November 29, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Something they said could never be built. It is the only one in existence, and it is the key to incomprehensible power." The note you read sits on top of a large, ornate safe, along with a smaller box that contains an eyepiece without which the note claims you will be "as blind as the rest". It warns you that the stakes are high and that the safe was constructed to keep this incomprehensible power away from lesser minds. There's only one thing left for you to do: put on the eyepiece and open the box.\n\nExcept this safe isn't easy to crack. There are dials to spin and knobs to turn and pieces missing. The whole thing is designed with puzzles in mind, providing you with a pleasantly interactive challenge to surpass in order to unlock the safe's mysterious contents. The eyepiece allows you to see once hidden drawings and symbols, which often provide important clues on how to solve certain puzzles. There are hidden compartments and switches to flip (or not to flip) and buttons disguised as decorations. And once you open up the safe? Well, let's just say there's more than one box to open.\n\nThe puzzles in the Room are well-balanced and exciting, with each one being easy enough to solve that it doesn't frustrate you. Puzzles are often interconnected, with the completion of one puzzle unlocking an item that makes the solution to another puzzle accessible. As the game progresses, the puzzles become more involved and intricate. The design of each box is intriguing and, as the environment around you changes with the game's progression, the experience slowly becomes something far more surreal and fantastic than the dusty attic you start in.\n\nOverall, the Room is a short game that will pique your interest and encourage your curiosity. It isn't a game that will force an extreme intellectual challenge on you, but it will require some logical thinking and a few of the puzzles will make you scratch your head for a minute or two. The plot is vague enough to entice you without becoming hard to understand. The Room's shining glory is, without a doubt, its slow escalation from the ordinary to the extraordinary and its wonderfully beautiful atmosphere and handsome puzzle design. Very enjoyable and definitely worth a thumbs up!","January 11, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is a little lacklustre, but that isn't what is important here.  The difficulty increases in expert fashion, it never seems cheap and the puzzles are presented in a logical way.  As you begin to unlock the secrets of your box, you can find yourself completing the game in one sitting.  That is perhaps the only problem with the game; the lack of content.  It is a very short game, with a completion time of 2-3 hours.  Obviously once you have completed it once, you will be able to fly through it a second time.  This means that the first playthrough must be savoured and should not be ruined by using any sort of walkthrough.\n\nThe Room gets most things right: graphics, difficulty, atmosphere and progression.  When it is on sale, it is well worth a purchase.  I found this puzzle box game to be highly enjoyable and worth the sale price.  It is surprisingly creepy for a game where you are just trying to unlock secrets in a box.  Ports of mobile games can be horrendous and a waste of time and money.  This is not the case with The Room, it is polished and well worth the couple of hours it will take to complete.","August 15, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's masterfully situated in that golden zone of puzzle games, where it's difficult enough to be a challenge but not so obtuse that it's unfair. Each puzzle has a completely logical answer, and when you connect the dots correctly there's a fantastic rush of accomplishment. I'm also really pleased with the hint system; I for one hate it when "hints" go so far that they basically give you the answer, but the hints in The Room are exactly that. It's just a little nudge in the direction you need to focus on. The controls are simple, the music is intense, and the graphics have that great quasi-90's feel. If you're a puzzle fan and you DON'T play this game, you are doing yourself a great disservice.","April 5","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The awards this game received... The 'overwhelmingly positive' Steam reviews... The Room is the best puzzle game I have ever played and I've been playing them since the 1990s. It's puzzling in its most basic form. There is no real story, you just tackle one big puzzle, although it's divided into five chapters. It's hard to describe in a few words why this game is so good, but simply put: it's fun! And playing The Room feels exciting and rewarding. They just got "it" right - "it" being everything a game like this should be, while being a completely unique experience unlike any other puzzle game I know of.\n\nMaybe just a few short additional notes, though, that may help you decide whether to buy The Room if you're still not sure:\n- it's a short game: it takes only about 3 hours if you take your time, so you may want to pick it up when it's on sale\n- it's a rather easy game: for me the game was just challenging enough but if you're the sadistic kind of puzzler who only likes being challenged to the point of migraine, you will not find that here. On the contrary, there is a hint system in the game so if you feel stumped at any time, you can click a button to give you some pointers.\n- the Steam Achievements are the most basic: one achievement for completing each chapter of the game.\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone, not just to people who like playing puzzle games. It's really that good. But since it's a pretty short game, you may want to wait until it's on sale to buy it.","May 30","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What are your specifications?"\n\n"I want it completely unbreakable."\n\n"Then you've come to the right place!"\n\n"And I want a hidden compartment on the side in which to hide the key."\n\n"The... uh... key to the safe?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Won't that be a security risk?"\n\n"Hmm. Good point. In that case, I'll have to build another compartment for my actual valuables and we'll put the key to that compartment in the safe."\n\n"That's not... really... I don't think..."\n\n"Shush, Wilkins! I'm on a role."\n\n"Okay, to be extra secure, we'll put my valuables in a lockbox before locking it in the safe."\n\n"Ah! Now you're talking. We make lockboxes of the strongest steel and locks consisting of..."\n\n"Steel? That will never go with my furnature. No, the lockbox must be made from pure walnut."\n\n"Couldn't a thief just cut it open?"\n\n"Cut open such a work of art? It'll cost a fortune to make. Who would break that? Think, man!"\n\n"A fortune? On second thought, I think we can..."\n\n"Yes, yes, yes. The lockbox will contain a machine that projects a film displaying the password to a keypad that opens a trapdoor containing the key to the monkey cage containing a trained monkey that uses charades to tell you the name of the book whose first chapter contains the combination to the safe in which we'll store the vibroslap on which we'll inscribe the instructions for locating the hidden screwdriver which can be used to unscrew the compartment containing the valuables."\n\n<long pause>\n\n"What if they brought their own screwdriver?"\n\n"Don't be daft! What sort of ruffian would carry a screwdriver to a robbery?"\n\n"And you'll, uh, go through that every time you want to get to your stuff out?"\n\n"No. My butler will. I hate that guy."\n\n\nThis is a hidden object puzzle game. Most gameplay consists of rotating an object in the center of the screen to locate a secret button or compartment which unlocks the next secret and allows you to proceed. I know some people love hidden object games, but others may be turned off by the fact that the entire game consists of searching for something you can click on.\n\nThe game's biggest weakness is its mouse controls. Clicking and dragging the mouse across the entire screen is normally not enough to completely rotate an object, so you'll often be dragging the mouse back and forth across your desk several times to see the other side of something. Clicking is unresponsive since it ignores mouse input every time it animates anything... and it animates everything.\n\nAs I suggested in the above dialogue, the objects themselves are a bit ridiculous and don't really make any kind of real-world sense. The key to this sort of puzzle game would normally be in trying to figure out what a mysterious object was used for and drawing logical conclusions about its function. However, when the objects themselves would serve no internally-consistent purpose, the game reduces to randomly prodding the object until the next puzzle activates.\n\nThe good graphics and atmosphere don't make up for the poor puzzle design and controls.\n\n\nTo make it worse, the game is bugged. The epilogue contains a puzzle where you're supposed to drag a gem to the center of a maze that rotates in three sections. However, when I get the gem right near the exit, it stops responding to mouse input... making it impossible to finish the game.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page here\n\nView my other reviews here","May 5, 2015","false","3.0"," 93 of 182 people (51%) found this review helpful 158 people found this review funny","51","93","182","158","11"

With Hints that don't tell you EXCACTLY what to do when you need them, This game perfectly challenges your mind with out being completely impossible each are easy to understand. The Difficulty is perfect the graphis and textures are beautiful the atmophere is GLORIOUS, it easily captures your attention while being attractive ut not distracting but also keeps the mysterious curiosity intact keeping you hooked on the one question of the game. "WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX?"\n\nFor you long readers:\n\nAtmoshpere:\nThe games Music keeps the mood going and the visuals keep the eyes from wondering where you want to look but also leaves room to explore with out distraction or unjustified confusion on direction. You play the game at your own pace and the puzzles all reveil them selves to you no matter what order you decide to take certain actions. the game gets more complex the further you go with out exeding understanding and difficulty. the dark area around the working area keeps your eyes from wondering into whats not important but with cleaver lighting to kep you focoused on whats important and whats needed. the desgin of each puzzle is different and doesnt disapoint keeping you captivated but with out over whelming you.\n\nDesign:\nThe designs of this is captivating mavoulus and just plain absolutely wonderful it keeps you in a steady mood and will leave you wanting more. This game is crafted to the smallest detail and hard work is easily the puzzles have their themes and they stick well to these themes while still keeping mood and tension with that wonderful snese of need to fufil your curiosity of finishing the game. this game is completely surrounded solely to the player.\n\nGameplay: VERY interactive the wonderful detailed motions turns and interactions really make you feel like you are in the game physicly touching the box, and leaves plenty of room for thinking its abosolutely fun and can easily be picked up and played even with out the tutorial.\n\nCons:\nSadly dispite everything being said, the game can e easily guessed, thwoing in random answeres for the puzzles can easily be done and almost leaves no room for errors, but atmosphere and music make up for this by keeping you captivated and making you want to explore. it's best to play this game only if you really want to solve puzzles and not just to beat the game. its meant to be taken slow and enjoyed so the best to do is to not rush through it.\n\nyes i have a short hour timer on this.. i played this before buying it. Honestly the games quality is amazing and i wish to give more money to those who made it. its a masterpiece.\n\nIn conclusion. I give this game a whoping 10out of 10. but its not hard to impress me. but its deffinately worth the buy.","February 2, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it on sale (80% off @ $1) and would recommend it to anyone interested in brain teasers, puzzles, or problem solving. This game is visually pleasing (it actually got my GTX 980 Strix to get warm enough to turn on it's fans) and has a great art style. It's relaxing, too. You only use your mouse when playing (no keyboard input) so you can kick you feet up and play.\nThe biggest downside to this game is that it's short; 5 chapters of different puzzle boxes. But if you can pick this game up for cheap (again, I only spent a dollar), it's worth your money.\nLASTLY, the only bug I found was if you play on a monitor above 60Hz, the sliding blue gem puzzle near the end will be unsolvable. You need to lower your Hz setting on your monitor OR switch your game to windowed mode and move your window to a monitor that IS on 60Hz, and then you can solve the puzzle.","November 16, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love a good puzzle game and it doesn't get much more to the point than this. Quite easy, so you souldn't have trouble finishing all the levels in one sitting. Also, the hint system is very aggresive, so if you want any challenge whatsoever turn that off right away. Visuals are quite nice if a bit sterile, and the sound design gives a nice sense of atmosphere.\nAlso of note is that this was originally an ipad (and iphone? Can't be bothered to look it up) only title. The port is quite nice and hasn't suffered too much from the change over, and it's clear at several points the puzzles have been tweaked to make up for the different interface.

I got it on sale (80% off @ $1) and would recommend it to anyone interested in brain teasers, puzzles, or problem solving. This game is visually pleasing (it actually got my GTX 980 Strix to get warm enough to turn on it's fans) and has a great art style. It's relaxing, too. You only use your mouse when playing (no keyboard input) so you can kick you feet up and play.\nThe biggest downside to this game is that it's short; 5 chapters of different puzzle boxes. But if you can pick this game up for cheap (again, I only spent a dollar), it's worth your money.\nLASTLY, the only bug I found was if you play on a monitor above 60Hz, the sliding blue gem puzzle near the end will be unsolvable. You need to lower your Hz setting on your monitor OR switch your game to windowed mode and move your window to a monitor that IS on 60Hz, and then you can solve the puzzle.","November 16, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very fun puzzles with amazing graphics with smooth animations and controls. For sure worth the $4.99.\n\nThe story is very intriguing as well. Somewhat lovecraftian in a sense. I was expecting a pretty calm and relaxing puzzle game and what I got was an engaging and tense puzzle game. The atmosphere and music combined with the story told by notes left by some guy (not going to give spoilers) all make the game feel kinda creepy. You want to know more about what the guy has hidden away in the intricate puzzle boxes but as you go you feel like you dont wanna know. That this is a secret that should be kept away. But you keep going because its fun.\n\nI highly recommend this. I'd love for Fireproof Games to make the rest of the series for the PC. For those that dont know, this game is a re-release of a mobile/tablet game. There is already a second game and a third on the way. I don't know if they plan on making the rest available for the PC but I'd be very happy if they did. I'm not much of a mobile gamer and I don't own a tablet. Plus I feel like it would be a much better experience on the PC with better graphic capabilities and such. Plus they'd be able to add much more than what they'd have to fit into an app.\n\nMy only criticism about it would be that the puzzles felt a little to easy. Difficult enough to be enjoyable but I think they could have been a little more challenging. Either that or make more chapters. The game felt pretty quick and I completed it in a few hours. But other than that I very much enjoyed myself and highly recommend it to anyone who likes fancy puzzle boxes and/or creepy lovecraftian style sci/fi.","December 8, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xoxsubzeroxox/recommended/288160/","xoxsubzeroxox","Edgelord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xoxsubzeroxox/","760 products in account","This is a magnicifent puzzle game, and that's coming from someone who doesn't generally care much for puzzle games and dislikes point-and-click controls, which this game has. It feels much more interactive than the average point-and-click, and is nowhere near as tedious.\n\nI don't want to explain too much about this game since every aspect of it just has to be experienced, which makes it a bit annoying to point out what I like about it. In short, it's just really satisfying to play because it has original and varied puzzles and the box, vault or table you're trying to open is constantly evolving as you progress. I've never played a more dynamic puzzle game than this one, which is ironic because you can't even move away from the puzzle, just rotate around it.\n\nI'm going to make a comparison to a genre that's so vastly different from this, but I feel like it makes sense. You know satisfaction you get from the fake sense of progress in clicker games where you keep clicking and make "progress" or get "rewarded"? This game felt like that in a way, but with actual progress and more content to reward you with. The puzzles are built up so that you can do or find plenty of minor things and still progress or trigger other things on the box, vault or table you're on. In a way I got that kind of satisfaction from this game when solving parts of the major puzzle. The puzzles are also not overly difficult and don't require you to think of extremely far-fetched solutions that you would never have guessed were the right ones or where you just don't know how the game wants you to think, but you might still have to look around for a while and re-evaluate what you've done to figure out how to progress.\n\nI also really appreciate the effort the developers put into the PC release, considering this was on mobile devices first. The textures are way more high res and when you zoom in on puzzles they'll be very detailed and actually look good, with great lighting to boot. The click-and-drag mouse controls are a direct remnant of the touch controls the mobile version had, but it works really well and makes it feel quite interactive.\n\nEven though it's not saying much because I don't play that many puzzles games, The Room is one of my all-time favourite puzzles games because of its unique design and dynamic gameplay.","March 16","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, not everything is what it seems, sometimes you need to dig a little deeper even if you think you've got all the information one item can give you.\n\nWhile the puzzles are quite often complicated, every now and then, they throw in something so ridiculously obvious and easy that you waste so much time assuming it's 10x harder than what it truly is.

But I digress!\n\nThe game was actually quite enjoyable! It felt very reminiscent of Myst, how you can move around an object and observe it to find hints and clues to solve puzzles. But I blame the original Tomb Raider games for teaching me to always observe and keep an eye out for anything suspicious and notice...subtle hints.\n\nThis game has plenty of subtle hints! One thing I quite liked, was how there was always more than what met the eye and kept me going.\n\nSadly, I finished the game in 3 hours...Its a good brain teaser and puzzler if you want something new and challenging! It has a multitiude of varying puzzles and one or two had me stumped for a few minutes..\n\nOverall, i'd give it... 7/ 10.  The missing 3 being how most of the puzzles are quite straight forward, and how it's a generally short game.\n\nHopefully the devs will impliment a mod system to other users can create their own models and puzzles for others to play?

In my opinion the difficulty is very well tuned: It is easy enough that it remains accessible to many people, but it still requires enough mental effort for the puzzles to be satisfying to solve.\n\nI was particularly impressed with the sound department; the satisfying clicking, grinding and rattling sounds that the structures in the game make are very convincing and together with the lovely music manage to sell the game very well indeed.\n\nAlthough the importance of graphics in a game like this is not to be overstated, The Room features some excellent visuals. Not only is it a feast for the eyes to play through, but it makes the search for small notches and buttons within the puzzle much easier. Graphics are crystal clear, the lighting is moody and appropriate, and I could detect barely any aliasing while playing: Very nice.\n\nThe story manages to loosely tie the puzzles together, but becomes at no point more engaging than the puzzles themselves, something I was quite happy about. Completing the game took me about 2 hours, which I thought was a very reasonable. I couldn't help hoping there would be more puzzles after the credits came rolling in, but for 5 euros I definitely got my money's worth. If Fireproof were to release any sequels on the PC, I would no doubt pick those up too.\n\nIn short, an excellent short puzzle game, accessible to both new and experienced puzzle game players.

There's no arguing about that.\n\nFirst, the game looks amazing and the animations are fluid. It just feels satisfying to even look around the puzzle to figure out what to do next, and it's very responsive with very few problems of control.\nAnd speaking of the puzzles, there are challenging but not excrusiating : the difficulty is well balanced with a healthy progression. They were also very well thought and put together, giving a good sense of progression and investment in it. It was enjoyable to bits.\nThe atmosphere of the game! Another great point. Great graphics added to great background music/noises gave a seriously enjoyable atmosphere. The more you progress, the more the room you're in (with the spot lights and walls) dissapear and you slowly seem to be drained into another world (well, before it becomes litteral of course).\n\nNow, for the bad sides, I'd say it was a little short. Of course it can be long if you struggle with the puzzles, but I wouldn't have minded a few rooms in more. And here's just a minor, meaningless complaint : when a new hint is available, the hint symbol should at least blink or get highlighted, because sometimes the noises around make it hard to hear the faint sound of the new hint being unlocked. But again, just a minor complaint, nothing too bad.\n\nIf you like a good puzzle game, it's one to be bought without any hesitation.","December 20, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my opinion the difficulty is very well tuned: It is easy enough that it remains accessible to many people, but it still requires enough mental effort for the puzzles to be satisfying to solve.\n\nI was particularly impressed with the sound department; the satisfying clicking, grinding and rattling sounds that the structures in the game make are very convincing and together with the lovely music manage to sell the game very well indeed.\n\nAlthough the importance of graphics in a game like this is not to be overstated, The Room features some excellent visuals. Not only is it a feast for the eyes to play through, but it makes the search for small notches and buttons within the puzzle much easier. Graphics are crystal clear, the lighting is moody and appropriate, and I could detect barely any aliasing while playing: Very nice.\n\nThe story manages to loosely tie the puzzles together, but becomes at no point more engaging than the puzzles themselves, something I was quite happy about. Completing the game took me about 2 hours, which I thought was a very reasonable. I couldn't help hoping there would be more puzzles after the credits came rolling in, but for 5 euros I definitely got my money's worth. If Fireproof were to release any sequels on the PC, I would no doubt pick those up too.\n\nIn short, an excellent short puzzle game, accessible to both new and experienced puzzle game players. Would recommend.","October 3, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each of the five stages is its own contraption and you must reveal its secrets! The real thing that sets it apart is that it feels natural. It feels like someone could have made these things and you get to prod and fumble to figure them out. While the conundrums the game poses are challenging, they are fair and not obtuse.\n\nGraphically, it is soothing to the eyes. Again, it looks like these devices could have been made and that is largely because of the well done textures in this title.\n\nThe worst thing I can say is it is short. I conquered the game in 2.5 hours. That might just be because I am pretty damn good at puzzles. I only paid 2.5 US dollars though, so I feel pretty good. I would have bought the game at double the price knowing what I do now.\n\nReally hoping that Fireproof Games produces more games like this. The ending does tease that a sequel is not out of the question.","November 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An interesting "story" throughout, cool looking boxes that have neat contraptions in them, and kind of dipping into the occult makes for a short yet sweet experience. My only complaints are that as already mentioned, the game is too easy and too short. However, this game was ported from the Ipad and for that I have to say it's pretty intricate for what it is. My other short complaint is that the ending was disappointing seems like sequelbait- just as things were getting interesting and mechanical the game halts to a stop and tells you "There are many more rooms to discover". However, if there was a "The Room 2" with way harder puzzles and a less annoying hint system, I would definitely grab it as soon as it came out.\n\n8.5/10","April 26, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It feels much more interactive than the average point-and-click, and is nowhere near as tedious.\n\nI don't want to explain too much about this game since every aspect of it just has to be experienced, which makes it a bit annoying to point out what I like about it. In short, it's just really satisfying to play because it has original and varied puzzles and the box, vault or table you're trying to open is constantly evolving as you progress. I've never played a more dynamic puzzle game than this one, which is ironic because you can't even move away from the puzzle, just rotate around it.\n\nI'm going to make a comparison to a genre that's so vastly different from this, but I feel like it makes sense. You know satisfaction you get from the fake sense of progress in clicker games where you keep clicking and make "progress" or get "rewarded"? This game felt like that in a way, but with actual progress and more content to reward you with. The puzzles are built up so that you can do or find plenty of minor things and still progress or trigger other things on the box, vault or table you're on. In a way I got that kind of satisfaction from this game when solving parts of the major puzzle. The puzzles are also not overly difficult and don't require you to think of extremely far-fetched solutions that you would never have guessed were the right ones or where you just don't know how the game wants you to think, but you might still have to look around for a while and re-evaluate what you've done to figure out how to progress.\n\nI also really appreciate the effort the developers put into the PC release, considering this was on mobile devices first. The textures are way more high res and when you zoom in on puzzles they'll be very detailed and actually look good, with great lighting to boot. The click-and-drag mouse controls are a direct remnant of the touch controls the mobile version had, but it works really well and makes it feel quite interactive.\n\nEven though it's not saying much because I don't play that many puzzles games, The Room is one of my all-time favourite puzzles games because of its unique design and dynamic gameplay.","March 16","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I digress!\n\nThe game was actually quite enjoyable! It felt very reminiscent of Myst, how you can move around an object and observe it to find hints and clues to solve puzzles. But I blame the original Tomb Raider games for teaching me to always observe and keep an eye out for anything suspicious and notice...subtle hints.\n\nThis game has plenty of subtle hints! One thing I quite liked, was how there was always more than what met the eye and kept me going.\n\nSadly, I finished the game in 3 hours...Its a good brain teaser and puzzler if you want something new and challenging! It has a multitiude of varying puzzles and one or two had me stumped for a few minutes..\n\nOverall, i'd give it... 7/ 10.  The missing 3 being how most of the puzzles are quite straight forward, and how it's a generally short game.\n\nHopefully the devs will impliment a mod system to other users can create their own models and puzzles for others to play? I see this as having great potential, especially how its a point and click game that revolves around in 3d space, quite rare to find!","August 29, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ending puzzles were disappointing but a sequel is directly implied at the end credits.

It's about a box/safe that you have to crack open and discover the secret within, but the box is quite complex and made of various switches and locks that you have to learn how they work togther. Some of the tricks to unlock the various parts require solving puzzles that are fun to work with.\n\nI don't want to spoil the review for you because the game is worth playing. There is a story that you can follow as you progress from one chapter to another, where the boxes become more complex and harder to solve, and the game takes a super-natural turn, although nothing really scary.\n\nThe game is beautifully rendered graphics-wise, and this is very important as you need to carefully inspect all corners and sides of the boxes and tables you handle as you walk around them, paying attention to details and trying to figure out how everything fits togther. The difficulty wasn't that hard for me as I have played harder puzzle games than this, although later in the game I was feeling tired and wanted to finish the game before going to bed to I had to use some of the tips.\n\nI would have loved if the game engine allowed more freedom in the movemeet so I can zoom-in freely anywhere I wanted around the room and not just on the box/tables, but overall it's an enjoyable puzzle game.\n\n10/10 I would enter The Room again and open more boxes if the developer chooses to release a sequal.","February 7","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, if you like puzzle games, where you have to use your brain a little (that's it, you need only brain, no mathematical skill or anything), then this is very interesting game. 1-2 hours of gameplay is enough to finish this game, with all achievements (but if you want steam cards as well, you have to play it a little longer). For 5 euros, i think it is  great buy, but with -75% (1,25 euros), it is "must" buy. Amazing visuals, interesting sounds, great gameplay (yeah, it is "port" from iPad game, but that doesn't matter, it is really that great). Lots of interesting puzzles, some are easier, others are harder, but you don't have to worry, there are also hints, if you are lost. And the story? I don't like these kind of stories. I was trying to follow it, and was expecting something bigger, but. It isn't there. But this is not a story game, you can enjoy it even with ignoring whole plot (or at least most of it). So yeah, game is worth, even with no story or just some background story, and it is kinda short, but hey, you can't expect 20+ hours of gameplay from this type of game. Also, there is no reason to play this game again (you know, puzzles are identical, nothing will change), but if you just want to work out your brain, you can play it once per year or so :) But yeah, it will not be that magical like for the first time :) Those machines and mechanisms are truly amazing. Yeah, you start with "only" one safe. But it is not just some random safe. It's like 5 puzzles in another 5 puzzles builted in safe (or table and box later in the game). So, you've heard some pros, some cons, you can see overall reviews. What are you waiting for?

I had no idea it had been optimized for PC, but now that I have discovered it, I decided to play through it again for giggles.\n\nHaving said that, it does seem to be almost identical to the mobile version, so if you've played it on mobile... you've played the game, don't expect a different experience from the PC version.\n\nBoth mobile and PC versions:  The graphics are gorgeous.  The story is full of intrigue.  The puzzles are challenging, but not so challenging that you want to pull your hair out and/or quit the game.  There are hints available if you get stuck, on both versions.  The music is also fantastic... overall Fireproof has created a beautiful, immerisive game.\n\nIt's quite short, but for $4.99 you get more than what you pay for.\n\nMy only criticism is, it could have been slightly more optimized for PC.  Scroll wheel support, for example.  On mobile, I understood double tapping the screen to zoom.  On PC, it feels more natural to use the scroll wheel.... BUT, that's me being very picky.\n\nIf you like puzzle games... play the game.  You can slap me if you don't like it.\n\n(Disclaimer: You cannot actually slap me.

I've beaten this game, the 2nd, and the third all on my iOS device, and the difference in graphics is amazing! Going from that little handheld version to this PC version, incredible. The puzzles in this game are amazing in design and I love solving them. It's been long enough that even I still need to figure out things with each puzzle box. I just started a series on my channel if you're interested in seeing just how well this game preforms. Granted, I'm running on a GTX970, but I'm pretty sure this game will be beautiful on almost any graphics card for gaming out there.

It's like Myst in a way, except the exploration doesn't happen with caves and islands – it happens with tables and safes.\n\nIn this first-person puzzler you're searching for the two dozen secret nooks and crannies on each piece of furniture, along with a breeze of the supernatural and for lite narrative via letters.\n\nWhat bugs me the most is how ridiculously overloaded each level is, which results in a very laggy experience *and* unresponsive controls. It seems like the FULL level is loaded completely at the beginning of each chapter, with all the secret drawers, compartments, switches and items. And all that stuff has to be handled by the CPU with each new camera angle. Why is the polygon count so high? This is just a puzzler? Why does the game need to load the small ball of the final puzzle part when I haven't even opened the box in the box yet? It's way too convoluted!\n\nOh, and it's way too short.\n\nBut other than that, this game was mindblowingly satisfying for me.  And there are sequels, too?

Faint light is creeping in through the window and there’s a big spotlight revealing the room’s centerpiece. It’s a safe. A mysterious note on top encourages you to open the safe which will contain the answers you seek. There is also a small brass key. But it’s not the key to the safe. So you inspect the safe from all angles and find a small keyhole hidden behind a panel. It’s a secret compartment containing an eyepiece which reveals things not seen by the naked eye. There’s also another riddle. You solve it and find another key.\n\nLet me get this out of the way – The Room is amazing. It so effortlessly taps into that primal urge of curiosity and intrigue. Solving a puzzle in The Room evokes a childlike wonder. Mysterious clues and secret compartments will provide items and shed light on the inner workings of the box and your pupils will dilate every time you activate an ancient mechanism that will get you one step closer to figuring out how it all works. It’s gripping on such a basic level.\n\nThe controls are delightful, you will use the mouse to push, slide and otherwise interact with objects pretty much in the same way you would with your fingers and hands. You don’t just click on something to open it, you slide that panel and turn that key. Just like everything else in The Room, it’s simple yet oh so effective. The puzzle design is absolutely spot on. It’s clever and varied, not too easy and it won’t cause you to bang your head against the wall either. If you get stuck for a bit, the game will provide little clues in order to nudge you in the right direction.\n\nThe production values are fantastic. The art style is wonderful and the sound design is superb. The way that the light reflects on all the various surfaces and the little crackling sounds coming from the dark corners of the room is just amazing. Considering that you’re doing nothing but solving riddles trying to get into a mystery box, the fact that the game is so atmospheric is an astonishing achievement. My only complaint about the game is the sub par attempt at storytelling with a rather unsatisfying ending.\n\nThe Room is a fantastic showcase of clever game design. It once again proves that you don’t need a huge budget or a big list of features to create something truly wondrous and engaging. All it takes is a good idea and masterful execution, something The Room has in spades.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","November 8, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Room is dark and the only source of light is a faint glow from a window and a spotlight on a stand. My gaze moves to the middle of the room and I can't help but notice the massive safe. On top of the safe I notice a letter which I proceed to open merely to find a key enclosed with a very peculiar note. After reading the note I'm left completely perplexed. I look at the key I was given but I quickly begin to feel helpless when I search for a keyhole somewhere on the magnificent safe.\n\nThe key doesn't seem to fit into any of the strange openings or contraptions I spot on the safe. I start thinking less of the key and more of the safe. I begin to study the safe closely and analyze every tiny nook and cranny I can find. Suddenly, success! I found something! A tiny panel the size of a matchbox slides open...\n\nThe Room really shines in my world. I love a good puzzle game and this title certainly gets the job done. As you start the game, you notice the soundtrack playing right away. The soundtrack doesn't feel repetive and still manages to support the atmosphere it wants to create very nicely. Besides the sounds, the puzzles are fun. When you face a seemingly impossible lock with nothing but mystery, The Room challenges you to think outside the box and solve it's many riddles. The Room gives  you a nice feeling when you solve a puzzle and coupled with very neat and detailed graphics, it feels genuinely satisfactory to solve a puzzle.\n\nWhen playing The Room, it's important to savor every bit of the atmosphere as it's a semi-short game but surely worth playing and spending time with.","July 30, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

With this, it feels different from any other puzzle game, think of it as the portal gun. The game starts you off in Chapter 1, which is the tutorial. There are 5 chapters, making this game very short and can be beaten in a few hours if you know what you are doing. You are not given much background besides notes left by a mysterious man named AS. I highly suggest you take your time to read all seven, or the ending may confuse you. These notes make up the game's story, which if you think about it the story is 7 pages long. These notes leave you with many questions, such as... Where am I? Who am I? Whats my goal? This kind of relates back to Portal, such as you don't have much background to what your purpose is. Although the game is very short, I did find myself enjoying it, I just wish this game was a bit longer or had some sort of sequel in a different timeline. And for the low price, it is definetely worth it, and just remember, when you beat that solar system castle dot puzzle, you are a god. 8/10, souly lost two points for being a bit short. If it was a bit longer, 10/10.","April 7, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also I agree with some other reviews in the fact that you should take your time with the game. Explore and savour every little carving and engraving you'll see. It's absolutely worth it.

Let yourself be frustrated when you come up to a "head scratcher" (there are not many). It takes two minutes of thinking to find the right solution and at least you'll feel a little proud that you did it on your own. The puzzles follow a simple formula: Click this, get a piece which helps you solve this, put it here, click this.... Oh, and click everywhere.

At first I was impressed. The graphic was nice, and the game was athmospheric. Even the challenges was appealing at the beginning. However the absense of story, or as many others would say "deep", could be decent if it was completed, instead, the ending promises more "The Rooms" game to finish the story. But for me the story was not interesting enough to wait for possible sequels.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, it got boring after about 20 min. The game is relatively short, but due the cheap price that is to be expected. But after completing the initial stages of the box, you get tired of repeating endless chores of just looking for clues rather than thinking for yourself as other puzzle games such as Portal demands.\n\nAfter getting half way the only motivation was to complete the game for the sake of the story, which was dissapointing. SPOILERS BENEATH. READ AT OWN RISK:\n\n\n\nNothing. There was nothing at the end. A mere vision of a doorway was the end.\n\nTo conclude, I can not recommend this game due to lack of replayability, lack of story, and rather tedious gameplay. Athmosphere is nice, and graphics as well, but the puzzles are boring.","July 31, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You gradually unlock each of them and thus dig a level deeper. The puzzles themselfes play a lot like the puzzles in HiddenObject games, meaning they are quite easy and there is a hint system if you need help.\n\nThe presentation of the game is great, good graphics with plenty of animations. The ease of the puzzles also allows the game to flow really well. Only thing I missed was a bit of voice acting, instead you get text popups.\n\nOverall it's quite a well made game and fun to play, so why the thumbs down? The ending. Like many other mystery games this is also just a pointless tease. None of it amounts to anything and the game doesn't even have an ending cutscene, just a lazy "Game Complete" screen which feels really out of place compared to the otherwise polished game.

I think putting everything in such a small location, leaving many mysteries at the start but fewer as each puzzle goes on, really builds a sense of progression toward the completion of each puzzle box, making it more satisfying than just solving a sequence of unrelated puzzles. The game is pretty smartly designed, too; nothing is really moon-logic to figure out and there's not really any repeated puzzles; everything feels fresh all the way through.

At first I was impressed. The graphic was nice, and the game was athmospheric. Even the challenges was appealing at the beginning. However the absense of story, or as many others would say "deep", could be decent if it was completed, instead, the ending promises more "The Rooms" game to finish the story. But for me the story was not interesting enough to wait for possible sequels.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, it got boring after about 20 min. The game is relatively short, but due the cheap price that is to be expected. But after completing the initial stages of the box, you get tired of repeating endless chores of just looking for clues rather than thinking for yourself as other puzzle games such as Portal demands.\n\nAfter getting half way the only motivation was to complete the game for the sake of the story, which was dissapointing. SPOILERS BENEATH. READ AT OWN RISK:\n\n\n\nNothing. There was nothing at the end. A mere vision of a doorway was the end.\n\nTo conclude, I can not recommend this game due to lack of replayability, lack of story, and rather tedious gameplay. Athmosphere is nice, and graphics as well, but the puzzles are boring.","July 31, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of the puzzles were rather straight forward instead of being an actual puzzle in my opinion, but it was still a good little brain exercise.\n\nHowever, the amount of puzzles was a bit of a letdown. But to compensate, the puzzles were MUCH longer than what you see in average flashgame puzzles. For me it took almost 3 hours to complete the game. May not seem much, but you have to remember that there are "only" five chapters, then that puts my average time to roughly 32 minutes per chapter. I should also clarify that each chapter consists one big puzzle made of several smaller puzzles.\n\nAside from the puzzles themselves, despite the fact that there wasn't much aside the puzzles, the atmosphere made it somewhat thrilling. As the whispers began to show up, it first made me feel like I should stop as I felt like there's going to be something eating up my face. Then they started to resonated with the emotion of wanting to find out what's behind all the puzzles, a kinda of a "What's in the box?!" -feeling. A very interesting set of emotions. And as for the quality of the graphics, it was just beautiful. Only the hardest zooms were able to break the quality as it became too obvious that I was actually looking at a flat surface, but that's just because of the way how some of the textures are made.\n\nTL;DR: Puzzles made of puzzles, quality over quantity, not for those don't like puzzles and gem for the rest.\n\nHoping to see more to this game, maybe new puzzles via updates or DLCs.","December 30, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwathdring/recommended/288160/","gwathdring","Gwathdring","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwathdring/","410 products in account","The Room is beautiful, inventive, and dull as a door-knob. Which is to say not entirely dull, not without charm and interesting little bits and bobs inside that make it tick yet ultimately simple and unmysterious. This is not a puzzle game; not really. It doesn't ask you to invent clever solutions or solve difficult mysteries. I began the game taking notes, hardened by years of advanture games, room escape games, and so forth. It turns out the game never asked me to do anything unexpected. There were a few genuinely clever puzzles but only a few in a game that is entirely built around this sort of thing. That's a real shame---I find it's a bit odd to approach difficulty in these sorts of games because what is obvious to one is not obvious to another; suffice to say what challenge this game does have is primarily observational--it rarely tests your memory or your problem solving or your abilitiy to make hypotheses or logical leaps. Merely your ability to notice. For my part I found it easy and a bit boring. I kept hoping it would surprise me and prove fiendish but the only difficulties I ran into were moments when I knew I just hadn't clicked the right one of about ten things I knew I could click yet.\n\nIt's a shame because games like this really shine when there are multi-lateral puzzles; multiple paths you can start moving down at once that feed back into each other, sure, and coallesce to a single point but that nonetheless allow you to move back and forth in a slightly less linear fashion, creating both a greater sense of journey and baking in the "let's take a break and see this from another angle" phenomenon that is so key to solving a puzzle so the player feels invested in the puzzle the whole time rather than needing to yank themselves out of it to gain that perspective. The trouble of course is that one designers leap of logic is another player's bloody-stupid-"who-the-heck-would-have-thought-of-that-nonsense?-that-doens't-make-any-sense!"\n\nThat acknowledged, I think The Room should have pushed much further into that territory. It wasn't a challenge and the puzzle was never interesting. The movements and animations certainly were ... but there were so many points when it could have used expansiveness to make it's simple solutions more challenging--but once you leave the large safe you leave it for good, progressing ever forward and never looking back to do intersting things with old, familiar objects. Failing that, I wish it had been a little more weird.  A little more "clever" and illogical such that the puzzles felt more difficult to me more frequently. It's effort to remain sensible and understandable, I feel, undermines it's function. Forget for a moment the idea of being a puzzle and leave us with exploration--the exploration of the device was not quite alien enough or mysterious enough for the fictional premise. Our guide assured us our intelligence would see us through but all that saw us through was explicit codes written on the box in UV ink (close enough). No clues, no riddles no references as promised by the tutorial sequence. Even taking this game as a breezy secret-box sort of thing rather than a true puzzle, I feel it wasn't inventive enough in the right way to meet it's own mini-fiction square-on.\n\nIt's a lovely object but not worth the asking price. For the .99 it costs on tablets and smart phones? Perhaps! It's quite pretty and certainly outsrips a York Peppermint Patty for entertainment value for me. I've played games that walk the lines this game walks in more interesting ways, though, and some of them cost nothing. I cannot, then, recommend it in terms of relative value but in terms of absolute is-this-99-cents-worth-of-cool/fun/whatever I can certainly recommend it at it's original price.","July 29, 2014","false","2.5"," 59 of 121 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","59","121","4","0"

A few mouse control snags, but nothing that can't be ignored.\n\nUnfortunately several strong 'themes' in its puzzling seem to repeat enough to venture well into 'the same thing over and over again' category.

Just switch off and play the game.\n\nI also now see that the "fine individual" who recommended this to me has just 0.1 hrs on record.

There is no real mental challenge in this game which I think is a serious defecit. The only challenge there is is to find the next thing you will have to click or drag. (Yea well not totally true, you have to "reason" that a key fits a keyhole and a screwdriver turns screws etc., but that's it).\n\nThe story is aswell kinde unfinished, unpolished and way to linear.\n\nTo sum it all up: At no point during the game have I felt surprised, challenge, intruiged or anything really. The only emotion the game made me feel is annoyed if my lulled senses couldn't find the next thing to click.\n\nIf you want a game that provokes you to think; this is not the game you are looking for.\nWell, frankly, I believe "The Room" is a waste of time rather than a waste of money. It may very well be that I am to harsh with this game since I just played "The Talos Principle" which competes at a totally different level. Though i would not recommend "the talos principle" for its normal price (i think around 40€), I would still recomend it as an alternative to this game. It still has a way higher entertainment/price ratio than this game.","April 7, 2015","false","4.0"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","1"

Unfortunately, the feeling faded quickly as I found myself breezing through each chapter. I was hoping for an increase in difficulty at some point along the way, but was disappointed that it never happened. Mindlessly clicking my way through the game eventually became a real chore. Despite this, I do not think The Room is a bad game--it just wasn't what I wanted out of a puzzle game.

Both the visuals and sound are just beautiful, an amazing job, but aside from that I don't think this game has much more to offer.\n\nI found the puzzles quite easy in general, and as you play you realize they are kind of repetitive since most of them follow the same patterns, something that's just terrible for a game as short as this. Also, even though there's some sort of "plot" going on there, it's not as developed as you would expect. It seemed to me that they were trying to create some sort of story in order to get you more into the game, but what you get is just a poorly-developed plot instead of something that really hooks you and intrigues you, or at least something with a decent level of development. I don't think they put much thought into the story, it's clearly just a dispensable extra.\n\ntl;dr: easy, repetitive puzzles, and a poorly-developed "plot".\n\nJust my humble opinion (?)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpanish:\n\nLa verdad, aunque no puedo decir que no me haya gustado, no sé si lo recomendaría.\n\nEl punto fuerte del juego es sin duda la atmósfera que logra crear, porque los elementos visuales y de sonido están muy, muy logrados y son geniales. La escenificación es hermosa, por así decirlo. Pero a parte de eso... no sé qué mucho más tiene el juego, la verdad.\n\nLos puzzles me parecieron muy fáciles, y más aún cuando te acostumbras a la mecánica del juego. Además, a medida que juegas te das cuenta de que son bastante repetitivos los tipos de puzzle que hay, y los patrones que siguen. Nada que te haga pensar realmente, en la gran mayoría de los casos. Además, aunque parece haber algo de trama, no está nada desarrollada, parece simplemente un pequeño extra para lograr engancharte un poco más, en vez de ser un eje central del juego. Da la impresión de que lo pusieron por poner, para ver si ayudaba a hacerlo más interesante, pero claramente la historia no está nada lograda y se nota que está por estar.","November 2, 2015","false","4.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

As that is definitely what you'll have to do. Wait for scenes. Wait to zoom in. Wait to zoom out. Wait to be able to be rid of text boxes with 3 words. It's all the content of a puzzle that could be done in one sitting, but it forces you to take an hour or more for each chapter ONLY because of the waiting. And they try to hide non-existent clues to what's next as being 'a challenge'. I turned off the hint option and it would go from obvious to "How the **** could I have known that without a hint or walkthrough?" instantly. I love puzzle games more than any other type of game, but this. This was fun for two of the five chapters. I beat it already because it's so short, and that's not worth $5 to me. In one chapter (the last one) you complete a puzzle merely to be shown a long-winded cutscene of the room's machinery turning on. It's nothing that helps the puzzle move forward. It's just filler. Over half of this game is nothing but filler and showing off (example, parts of the boxes opening and then closing once you've finished that piece of puzzle, though its not a needed thing.) Sometimes wearing the lens will spin you all over the place, as well. And the ending was utterly unsatisfying. I am completely disappointed in this game and it's entirely over hyped.

Having the double click as a zoom is disappointing because I feel like it lessens a lot of the mystery. Can't zoom into something? Mustn't be important and hence can't manipulate it. That itself just leaves me cold to this, feels like some of the mystery is left out and hence less interesting.

Some of the puzzles are hard to do simply because of the controls.

I like the theme a lot and there were a lot of nice touches, but the PC port is just too jacked up.

The graphics are absolutely stunning, the detail put into the woodworking of the constructs would make any carpenter have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The music is atmospheric without being overbearing and the clue sound effect is noticeable without being annoying. The controls are fine. That being said I do ave a couple of issues and complaints:\n\nTwo puzzles I completed solely by accident. One involved four coloured orbs whose orientation was affected by your perspective. I started moving the camera around to see if the orbs rotated in any particular way... and I solved the puzzle. I don't even know how.\n\nThe clues can be downright useless and borderline condescending.  For example, in the puzzle I mentionned earlier, after moving the camera about for a few seconds to see how the orbs reacted I get a clue saying that the orbs are affected by my perspective. No ♥♥♥♥ sherlock I realized that already. Another clue on another puzzle told me to look at the right side of the structure. The structure was a cylinder. I'm not sure if a cylinder has sides (aside from the top and bottom of course) but with no way of knowing what was the "front", being told to look at the "right" side doesn't help much.\n\nPlot. Without spoiling it too much another character leaves you a series of notes regarding his discovery of a fifth element (as in earth, fire, water and air. Also no relation to the movie) called Null. It plays an active role in two puzzles but it's sort of forgotten after that. There is a plot but it seems that the writer fell asleep or went for lunch and the devs published the game before he returned. There are passing references to alchemy, but that's about it. Maybe I'm just dumb. Maybe it'll all be explained in a sequel.\n\nI'm not sure if I can honestly say I recommend this game, however I got it for ~$5 on a steam sale. If you like puzzles, buy it.","January 28, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics really are amazing.  I never expected such intricate details and textures in a "simple puzzle game"!  The objects just look real with the shadows, reflections, and wood grain, etc.\n\nPuzzle-wise the game also delivers.  The puzzles are numerous, unique and logical.  None of the "random connections" of some "point-n-click" animated puzzle games.  Whenever I completed a puzzle that stumped me for awhile (with only a few hints from the in-game system) I always looked back and thought to myself "how'd I miss that" or "I should have gotten that" and never once did I have a "What? That makes no sense!" reaction.  Great puzzles that are sometimes challenging, but certainly doable.\n\nThe only two minor "negatives" that can really be said is 1) it's short, which leaves you wanting more of this amazing world, and 2) it's not replayable -- but that's the nature of this type of puzzle game and I accept that.  So those aren't really negatives.  However, even though I wasn't that interested or care for the mystical story-line, it also didn't interrupt or detract from the puzzles or the beautiful environment at all.\n\nDespite being on the short side, it's an absolutely fabulous puzzler not to be missed!  10 out of 10.","January 3, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I definitely enjoyed the challenge and depth of each puzzle. I wish the game were longer, or finished on the story arc it started. This was originally a mobile game and converted for PC with better graphics. I believe there are sequels on mobile. Fingers crossed that they will get the same treatment. The story unfolds slowly, through hidden slips of paper and the complexity of the machine puzzles you are unraveling.  This is not a game where you are trapped in a Room trying to escape, but more like someone has pointed you to a table with an alchemical puzzle box and left you alone to figure it out for yourself. Camera effects are minimal, and usually transitional between puzzles. The audio is also haunting and beautiful.","January 4, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is just interesting enough to keep you invested, but the real draw is the genuine curiosity derived from the extremly well-made puzzles, each just challenging enough to test your brain but not enough to impede your ability to progress. The physics engine gives the player the feeling of actually turning keys and opening doors, and the music and atmosphere give the game a nice final touch to keep your curiosity at its peak.

There’s some variety but that’s essentially it.\nWhat makes this game a joy to play is watching the clockwork compartments whiz and unfold once you’ve found them.  Every detail of this game is stunning visually and many puzzles employ the use of a spyglass that allows you to see hidden glyphs overlaid on surfaces from (presumably) another dimension  which is insanely cool.\nVisually this game is spectacular, however I found the puzzles quite easy and rigidly linear, serving less as the point of the game and more as an incentive to examine the crafted boxes from every angle.\nIn this respect I’d probably liken it more to a walking-sim such as Dear Esther than a tricky puzzle game, where the intent is for a relaxed, atmospheric play through rather than anything competitive or challenging.\nIf you’re looking for head scratching puzzles, this is not that. However if you’ve ever stared at the inner workings of a watch and thought it was cool, then you’ll love every minute of this game.","December 12, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While you're unlocking all these puzzles, you're following the story of someone who tried to do some crazy alchemy business. Well, spoiler... you don't really find out how it ends.

The rendered environments are beautiful and the puzzles are 100% logical with no fluff. Broken up into six, self-contained chapters, the game has a good pace that lets you take it a bit at a time if you want. Sure, there's a fantastical element to it, but the puzzles can all be solved by simply thinking about the environment and doing actions that you might try if you were really there.\n\nThis is no point-and-click adventure game. This is made of pure logic puzzles. Combined with the appropriately eerie music and gorgeous graphics, this is a refreshing change from the point-and-click and hidden object games that are all over Steam.\n\nThe only negative that I can attirubte to this game is that the developer has said that there are currently no plans to port the sequel over to Steam. :(","January 2, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What a fantastic game.\n\nOne of the best and most entertaining puzzle games I've played. I found the puzzles were exactly as challenging as I would have liked them to be; some thought required, but no pesky pixel hunting or cheap tricks.\n\nIf you ever get stuck on something, clues are unlocked based on the time you spend stuck on a specific part of the puzzle. I admit to using them in three or four places where I was beginning to feel confounded, and found they helped guide me immensely without giving me any information I didn't already have or telling me what to do (e.g. "I think I've seen that pattern before", "What else is this shape?", that sort of thing).\n\nI would love for it to be longer, or for there to be a sequel (which I understand is planned?), but for the low price and high quality of the puzzles, graphics and atmosphere, nothing else even comes close.

This is the sort of game I'd like to come back to in 5-10 years when I've forgotten the solutions just so I can go through it again with fresh eyes.","August 15, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are very well put together, challenging enough that you'll feel like you've achieved something after solving each one, and with plenty of variety.  I was gripped enough to play it through in one sitting, despite only sitting down to have a brief go and see what it was like!\n\nThat being said some of the puzzle types can become a little repetitive, but not enough to spoil the experience.  Also, I played this on a laptop with a touchpad and kept getting cramps from having to move the cursor a particular way, but that issue disappears if you use a mouse (and isn't a deal breaker as it is).\n\nAll in all, splendid visuals, appropriate music and sound effects and an atmosphere that will really draw you in.

Loved the design of the game and very pretty in my opinion. Purchased this game on the PC first and then bought it on my tablet for £0.69 but I will say that I much prefer it on the PC than on the tablet and for the price differences of PC and Tablet, I would still recommmend the PC Version. The PC version is much more detailed in design and much better graphics and found the PC version much more easier to play than on the tablet version as I found the tablet version can be cheeky and mid game you will sit there for hours trying figure out how to move something when all you had to do was tilt your tablet from side to side. I would definantly recommend this game to puzzle lovers. They have also made The Room 2 that at the moment you can only purchase on app stores and would really love it if they could convert this also to PC as I wish there were more levels inthis game as it only took me 4 hours to complete but hey... guess it started as a app game.

Trully a feast for the eyes.\n\nThe music and other sounds? spine tingling good, sometimes I thought this was a horror game, thanks to the music. It just builds pressure and conveys mystery.\n\nThen the concept. really, nothing wrong with it. They place a closed box in front of you and say "don't you want to know what is in there? okay, then use your brain to get in there!". And we being ofcourse want to know what is in the box (if you do are not a person who wants to open their birthday present right away, then this game is  not for you!).\n\nNow the meat of the game, the gameplay.\nIt is an simple puzzle game, but that does not mean it is easy! Have a pen and some paper nearby, because you are going to need it! You have to do almost everything  and that is strangly nice.   You do not just pop the key in the hole and hoppa! the door flies open! No, you have to turn the key, and open the door, unless it is a overly complecated contraption, which , to be fair, the whole box is. The puzzels are varied and well thought out, some are easy as long as you find the right combination. Some seem really hard untill you remember "Wait, that eyepiece should work!" and a patern will pop up. And some just need many, many parts to work. Theoretically you could luck your way through a few puzzles (I sure as heck did).\n\nStory.\nThere is not really a real big story in this game (what did you expect). Some one you knew, dissapeared and left you a closet in his house. You may have what is inside, if you crack the safe/closet/box/room. in the first few chapters it seems like a weird technological wonder, but it becomes more magical, the further you get. The game is devided in 5 chapters, in which little to no story elements are dropped, all you have are the letters signed with an "A", which tell you a bit about its former owner. End the end is something I will not spoil.\n\nVerdict 8/10 if you like puzzle games. For the price of 5 euro's or how many dollars it might be, it is a must buy for anyone who wants to be ammused for a few hours.","April 7, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does loop around a bit, but you really cant hear it when you consentrate on the puzzle before you. Playability? Awesome. Replayability? Not that awesome because the puzzles do not change everytime you reset the game. But the point here is this.

I guess you can wait a while before playing again, but I don't think that'll work completely.\n\nDefinitely get this game if you're up for a small puzzle game with some good atmosphere. I'd say catch it on sale if you really want it. It goes on sale quite a bit.","April 7, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have also made The Room 2 that at the moment you can only purchase on app stores and would really love it if they could convert this also to PC as I wish there were more levels inthis game as it only took me 4 hours to complete but hey... guess it started as a app game.

You are in fact following in the footsteps of a friend or colleague who has disappeared. Hidden in the box is a treasure that is also the answer.\nThe puzzle stages themselves require some mystical paraphernalia and solving them can invoke some mild paranormal drama that makes the stages feel satisfying. It is this gently sinking immersion that pulled me in and made me a fan.\nThe puzzles themselves involve checking over the beautifully crafted box itself for hidden mechanisms and codes that require concentration and deduction but are thankfully not frustrating. The graphics are beautiful and intricate so this type of exploration is a welcome part of the experience. The controls and camera viewpoints work well which is essential for this kind of investigative mystery. Optional clue flags pop up to help guide you if you want to click on them.\nIt is clear that the game is crafted to take you on a (relatively short) journey of discovery rather than present a series of difficult brain-teasers. In this vein, the puzzles are really just invitations to look deeper through a glass darkly, so to speak. This game is absolutely worth a look.","April 10, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Room is simply one of the best puzzle games ever.  Basically recoded from the ground up from its original 2012 Ipad version The Room is a visual and cerebral enjoyable experience from start to finish.\nThe game consists of 5 chapters and close to 50+ puzzles to solve(totally guess). Each chapter begins with a mechanical box on a table that by using your eyes and a special monocole you will click, drag, push, pull, twist and manipulate objects that will open or reward you with objects for solving the puzzle. There is a story that is told through notes that open and are littered throughout the chapters but it is forgettable quickly.\nThe puzzles themselves are not overly difficult and i like that its streamlined so you have to solve a particular part before starting another. I only had to look up one solution and it was the size of the object i had misinterpreted that caused me to fail that particular puzzle.\nI always have a lot of respect for developers of these type of games becasue i think they are the hardest to create. Its a genre that does not get a lot of attention but if there is one that is worthy of the spotlight its easily The Room.\n\nPositives\nStunning visuals, attention to detail\nPuzzles arent overly difficult but will make you think\nSuper creative\nPerfect length(5-6hrs) but i would not have argued with more content.\nGreat for the couch and laptop\nAll the answers are right in front of you, you just have to look\n\nNegatives\nYou cant tell a story with just a few lines\nThe Room 2 and 3 not announced for PC\n\n","November 7, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a puzzle game, reminding me of the Myst series. It's way smaller, though, but also way cheaper (given that Myst launched as full-price-titles). I really liked the look of the contraptions you're working on. Yep, that's a difference. You always work on a single, if very detailed, object filled with small puzzles. To me, it was worth both my time and my money. The story is not too bad and doesn't distract much from the puzzles. It fits, but doesn't leave you on the edge of your seat, waiting what might happen next.\nThe negative reviews aren't all wrong, though. The puzzles aren't that hard, hardcore puzzlers might be disappointed. And you don't have to write anything down. The hardest things to memorize are five-letter-words, three-digit-codes or patterns of Xes on a 5x5-square. What I can't understand is the complaint about the game being too picky concerning how you arrange certain patterns. What happens is: When you have to arrange a certain pattern, it has to be visible for a little while so the game knows you didn't create it by accident. That's it.\nSo, to sum it all up: Buy it when it's on sale, you can't go wrong and got yourself a neat, short, beautifully designed, not too hard puzzle game.","November 2, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(And, by the way, it is much better)\nFor those of us that are a tad analytical, this is the Mother Load.\nThere isn't any Character Development, Drawn out plots, Pixil hunting, or Hidden object nonsense. 'The Room' is just a logical analytical experience of just trying to solve a major complex puzzle that can best be described as: "How do I open this puzzle box".\nGranted, there are many puzzle games out there. So you may ask: "What makes 'The Room' so special"? And the answer is easy. This puzzle is Real. It is logical.\nFar too many puzzle/adventure games are So Ridiculous that you feel cheated once you realize that the puzzles are so contrived only a leaked walkthrough can get you through the mess. Not so with 'The Room'.\nIf you liked 'Myst' and 'Safe Cracker', you are probably going to Love The Room.\nI just hope that the British Team at Fireproof Games create a Room Two, Room Three, etc. etc. for the PC.\nOH, I almost forgot, and what else?

You are in fact following in the footsteps of a friend or colleague who has disappeared. Hidden in the box is a treasure that is also the answer.\nThe puzzle stages themselves require some mystical paraphernalia and solving them can invoke some mild paranormal drama that makes the stages feel satisfying. It is this gently sinking immersion that pulled me in and made me a fan.\nThe puzzles themselves involve checking over the beautifully crafted box itself for hidden mechanisms and codes that require concentration and deduction but are thankfully not frustrating. The graphics are beautiful and intricate so this type of exploration is a welcome part of the experience. The controls and camera viewpoints work well which is essential for this kind of investigative mystery. Optional clue flags pop up to help guide you if you want to click on them.\nIt is clear that the game is crafted to take you on a (relatively short) journey of discovery rather than present a series of difficult brain-teasers. In this vein, the puzzles are really just invitations to look deeper through a glass darkly, so to speak. This game is absolutely worth a look.","April 10, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You basically tinker around with a box which is laid out in the middle of the room. The game really should have been called The Box.\n\nYour objective is to figure out how to open The Box. You are required to complete one puzzle to gain access to another puzzle which is positioned somewhere else on The Box. I world not go far to say it is highly challenging. The hints in the game practically gives you the answer. If I had known this I would not have had them on the default on setting. There where two occasions were I did get completely stuck and I needed to rely on a game guide within steam. This was towards the end.\n\nThe graphics are highly detailed for what is a simple puzzle game but it does add atmosphere to the environment of the room. This is the only mention of the room you are going to get.\n\nSound effects again are highly detailed and brings The Box to life when tinkering around with it.\n\nHighly recommend this game in a Steam sale.

The Room is simply one of the best puzzle games ever.  Basically recoded from the ground up from its original 2012 Ipad version The Room is a visual and cerebral enjoyable experience from start to finish.\nThe game consists of 5 chapters and close to 50+ puzzles to solve(totally guess). Each chapter begins with a mechanical box on a table that by using your eyes and a special monocole you will click, drag, push, pull, twist and manipulate objects that will open or reward you with objects for solving the puzzle. There is a story that is told through notes that open and are littered throughout the chapters but it is forgettable quickly.\nThe puzzles themselves are not overly difficult and i like that its streamlined so you have to solve a particular part before starting another. I only had to look up one solution and it was the size of the object i had misinterpreted that caused me to fail that particular puzzle.\nI always have a lot of respect for developers of these type of games becasue i think they are the hardest to create. Its a genre that does not get a lot of attention but if there is one that is worthy of the spotlight its easily The Room.\n\nPositives\nStunning visuals, attention to detail\nPuzzles arent overly difficult but will make you think\nSuper creative\nPerfect length(5-6hrs) but i would not have argued with more content.\nGreat for the couch and laptop\nAll the answers are right in front of you, you just have to look\n\nNegatives\nYou cant tell a story with just a few lines\nThe Room 2 and 3 not announced for PC\n\n","November 7, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ultimate objective is to uncover the truth about scientist's big discovery by opening boxes within boxes...it's more interesting than it sounds.\n\nThe big plus is the aesthetics. Visually, it is well-polished, and the design of the boxes themselves are intriguing.\n\nThe big negative is that the ending is disappointing, all that build-up for not that much.\n\nThe puzzles were mostly easy, the difficulty in the game was finding parts to an objects that allows you to find an object and progress. There is a little unfair frustration figuring out what part goes where. For example, there was part of the puzzle where  you have to attach a rubber band to two gears in order to connect them and get a clock to function.  Since I didn't click  in the precise right spot, I thought that wasn't the right thing to do (it was), and I wasted 30-45 mins. on that part.\n\nOne notable game mechanic is the eyepiece you put together in the first level. Wearing it reveals important information and hidden puzzles.\n\nOverall, buy and play this game on a discount, if you want some puzzles to solve and don't care too much for the underlying story.","April 28, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles range wildly from absolutely brainbending in a few scenarios to painfully obvious in the immediately following one. Standardized, step-up difficulty is not a thing here. I have to agree with some of the negative reviews here in that the game is -very- picky sometimes and unless you have it -exactly- right, you won't get credit for doing something properly.  I never had an issue with doing things out of order, but I guess it could happen... If you're any kind of cryptography nerd, some puzzles won't be hard for you at all, given you have any idea what a brute force attack is.  I completed this game in almost exactly two hours.\n\nOn the other hand, the game is -very- pretty, and the lack of any serious contiguous storyline means that the puzzles become the theme of the game.  It's a good game to Zen out to.\n\nOver all, if you manage to pick this game up on sale (as it is right now, for $1.24), you really will be getting a decent game for your cost.

It's puzzles are fun and challenging, forcing you to look over every single inch of the contraption in front of you. Although there are only a couple puzzles, they are complicated enough that the amount of time you spend on each one will vary greatly. It looks great, and has a great atmosphere, but the story is a little weak, which isn't that much of a loss. The controls are intuitive and rarely malfunction. The one major downside being that one of the puzzles is super linear and not that fun. There is a hint mode, but I never used it so I don't know how helpful it is.\n\nA+\nI hope "The Room 2" comes to Steam soon!","November 1, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun puzzles, intruiging story, nothing too hard that people should rage, just need a lil memory and it goes pretty smoothly, 9.5/10.

For a ridiculously small amount of money, you will lose at least an hour of your life, probably a bit more. This game is immersive enough that it gives you the genuine sensation of pawing at the myriad contraptions throughout the game, figuring out their individual uses and how next to progress.\n\nSome people will lose patience with this game quite early. This game is not for the impatient. It's an enjoyable game with an excellent concept, beautifully executed in the new PC re-release. The 3D Anaglyph perspective puzzles are sadly disorienting at times and may cause issues for people prone to headaches, but they aren't too numerous and aren't too difficult to overcome. The cardinal sins of this game is it's relative shortness and the longing it evokes in the player for more of the same content. That said, the game is short and sweet, an excellent taste of what many might hope to be a continuing series.\n\nAdditionally, if you're inclined towards satisfaction from overcoming adversity, turn off the hints. A lot of the difficulty in my <2 hour playthrough came from simply forgetting about a puzzle I'd meddled with earlier in the game and decided it wasn't yet time to fool about with it, followed by me entirely forgetting about them. Your mileage may vary but the time for a blind playthrough would be anywhere ahead of an hour, depending on the individual. For the current price, well worth it.","April 8, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to solve not so difficult, yet very clever puzzles taking all the time you want, while seeing this beautifully designed gimmick boxes unfold before your eyes in a really satisfying and relaxing experience.\n\nIn every level you're working on a table, so there aren't so much objects to render, but the designer's work can amaze you in many ways: the fine details, the unfolding shapes and secret compartments, the overall mystic environment and the beautiful animations astonished me.\n\nThere's not a big variety of background music, but it's placed at the right moments so it actually fits nice with the gameplay and positively enhances the overall experience.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that the game itself is fairly short (took me about 2.4 hours to complete), but it makes up by being amazing.","April 8, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty short though, probably between 2-4 hours depending on your individual skill (or how heavily you abuse the hint system). But, man, every second spent with this game is incredibly captivating. They revisit a few tropes a couple of times (perspective puzzles, sliding marble puzzles) but look at these as a break from the more obtuse parts of the game. And the story.
