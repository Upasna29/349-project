Then as the depth of the game developed I slowly slowly learned to actually like it. I have to say that this is one of the most graphically stunning games I have gotten off of steam.  It would be extremly nice if there were more games that catered to low system specs. I personally have been drooling over eve online for ages. But it is just out of reach for my system. From what I know of that game this game has allot to offer. The skill system in particular was very very interesting. Each character had certain abilitys the could trigger in combat. However these abilitys have a timer attached and can only be used so many times per mission. Anyway I have rambled on long enough, ohh and the ending wasn't as bad as some reviewers would have you believe. Granted it wasn't a 20 minute long cut scene or anything, but it did provide a measure of closure.","December 6, 2013","true","17.8"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

It copies most things from the old game and invents a single new idea of one "free to explore"-map. This idea combined with the technical problems breaks the game, therefore my advice is:\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!\n(Btw, dunno why i spent 12 hours on this, maybe i searched for "something" good in this game, but well, couldve played it through in 8 hours or less...)\n\n+ RPG Part -> Copy from SW1\nSkill/Perk system is not very complex but functional, various paths can be used for skilling the characters. The different paths lead to a slightly different gameplay approach. Could be more complex, but works nice and is motivating.\n\n- Fighters and Equipment\nOn of the highlights in the first game, is now one of the problems. The "natural" progress is gone, you will start with Tier2, grind around some time and -tada- then you will be Tier 4. Natural progress? NOPE.\n\n- Combat\nYou would expect this to be the same as in SW1, but you have more KI problems, less designed missions and nearly no enemies. Boring.\n\n- Story\nThere is nothing you can call story. Just some "main missions" without any sense. They look like the random missions. Not much difference. You cant compare this to SW1, it had WAY better missions and story.\n\n- Presentation and Controls\nStill like the old but way more problematic...\n\n- Bugs\nWay more problems then SW1 - For me personaly it only crashed one time but had alot of KI bugs - Funny as the space is nearly empty compared to SW1...\n\n---Free galaxy\nA system you can freely explore sounds good? Well, if all sub-systems are nearly empty its just plain bad. Usually 1 trading station (buy/sell gear/fighters) and 0-2 other stations per subsystem (they are only used for the random missions). If you are lucky also 1 trader or a wing of fighters. But usually all subsystems are empty...\nStill you have to fly around for this stupid random missions. There are only 3 types: Patrol, Destroy and Deliver. The involved subsystems are always random. For example, after you take the mission in a trading station:\n-> Fly to subsystem XY to start the mission(= you have to cross X maps usually without enemies)\n-> Mission is started, fly to subsystem YZ and kill/patrol/deliver (= again X maps, sometimes with a single random attack)\n-> If its kill/patrol, you now get your random encounter (you dont even need your figthers, mothership is way to strong)\n-> Go back to subsystem XY for reward (OMG).\nThe good? thing, some of this missions (without enemies, just long, boring travel on empty maps) give 500k, so you go on highest tier pretty fast...","December 28, 2014","false","12.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

And the main quest is probably worst of it. No much story to speak of, and when it was fially finished the main indication of the fact was that you were thrown bac to the starting screen.\n\nOverall, skip this one and go straight to SW3","July 5, 2015","false","27.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The story is sparse, the systems require a lot of unnecessary travel through relatively empty/dead zones, and the progression to earn better ships/equipment is not as smooth or fun as in the first.

I only got a few missions in due to this game being a buggy mess. My pc is a mid-tier running windows 7, played many games (old and new) via steam and this is the first one that I found unplayable.\n\nStar wolves 1 played alot smoother. This game also offers very little improvement over the first one (even recycling alot of character portraits etc). It offers an open world via portals, replacing the end mission rewards page with alot of unnecessary travelling to and from each mission/trader. The dialogue is also very offputting, comically so. Every line is delivered without emotion or emphasis; jovial banter or life and death threats are delivered the same way. Other than this, it plays just like the first.\n\nI could not recommend this game, it is a gamble as to whether it will work, if you'll get game ending bugs or just minor ones. (The bug which affected me prevented mission objectives from triggering and somehow this affected every save file since the start of the game). If you enjoyed the first game it might be worth a gamble, but this game offers no improvement over the first.","October 9, 2014","false","6.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It is really sad for anyone who liked the first episode that when it came to inventing tasks and story line, the only thing that has landed on paper is one exquisite ♥♥♥♥.
