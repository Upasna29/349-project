Especially in case you want to experience a platformer like Super Mario 64 or Super Mario Sunshine. What I enjoyed the most was jumping and running around through the levels collecting coins and exploring places on higher levels. I can't say how much time you'll need to beat the game - that depends on your personal motivation, but with 40 cubes to collect (comparable with a "star" in SM62) and some secrets to find you'll need your time! The difficulty varies from level to level and mission to mission from "very easy" up to "hard" (to put it into my words). The game has some smaller issues which might be patched away - but I can overlook them since back in the 90's, which platformer hadn't some? I can overlook small camera and colliding issues. The game is a nice experience nonetheless! If you're a fan of the forgotten genre - I recommend this game!\n\nI played a pre-release version for many hours and now spend some time in the final version.","December 10, 2015","true","183.9"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","21","31","2","0"

It is a collecthon, I've found two main collectibles along with just regular "coins". You leave the world after collecting one of the "stars", and you can mostly collect them in any order that you wish, except for certain event ones, like how you couldn't race against Koopa the Quick when you chose Battle on Bo-omb Hill. Several moves like the somersault, wall jump, and dive work similarly to sm64, except that you can chain dives and the somersault covers way more distance. The number of collectibles though isn't techinally the same amount, there seems to be 40 "stars" and 80 "star pieces", with 10 of those giving you one star. Since you don't leave the world when you collect the star pieces, I can say you could probably complete this game faster then a run of 64 if you're very familar with platformers and "collectathons." I do recommend this game a bunch, though, as it is a great 3D platforming collectathon.","December 10, 2015","true","4.3"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

However, the game has a cool little feature that allows you to take a photo of moving objects using your camera, which will freeze them on the spot. Gravity doesn't affect them, and you can use them as platforms. It's interesting, and doesn't feel like a cheap gimmick.\n\nYou can access multiple different worlds through the hub world. As you progress by grabbing collectibles, you get access to new areas. Worlds are quite large, and allow you the freedom of choosing where you want to go, and what collectible you want to try get. The entire thing really reminded me of Super Mario 64. There's a good variety when it comes to getting collectibles. There are different types of things to collect, as well as multiple ways of actually getting said collectibles. You might be required to kill a boss, complete a platforming challenge or race someone.\n\nThe graphics and worlds look vibrant and cute. At times I felt like maybe some of the objects placed were a bit too random, but most of the times it wasn't a problem. The music feels very authentic, and does a very good job at sounding like the soundtracks of games you played in the good ol' days.\n\nOverall, it's a real joy to play. I never really encountered anything that was really problematic, and the dev seems to be constantly improving the game, which is good. Solid gameplay, colourful worlds, and awesome soundtrack that do a great job at capturing the atmosphere the game was looking to replicate.

It's gameplay is sort of like Super Mario 64 combined with Super Mario Galaxy, and it has a great artstyle that seems quite inspired by the latter. Although the camera and controls can sometimes be a bit off, they don't interrupt the game much and are easy to get used to. The worlds/levels look beautiful and have loads of secrets to find and bits to explore.

Skip to bottom for conclusion.) ;-)\n\nBack in the good, old days, we had classic after classc like Super Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, Crash Bandicoot and Beyond Good & Evil. Then... nothing. Super Mario Galaxy was great, but it was also the last, awesome 3D platformer. We could debate whether SMG2 was better, but personally, I felt it was more a SMG 1.5, or expansion to Galaxy 1. It wasn't exactly as new and refreshing as SM64, SM Sunshine and SM Galaxy were. But nevermind that. Way off topic, sorry.\n\nEver since Super Mario Galaxy, I've wanted a new 3D Platformer, but no one has delivered. Mario was scrapped, returning to his 2D roots and the semi-2D Super Mario 3D World. Banjo was abandoned. Crash, uh, crashed. But just when all hope seemed lost, we got a game called FreezeME. True, the title is a bit generic and off-putting, and yes, it's an indie game from people you have probably never heard of. The main character doesn't even have a name, and the story is something generic like a dog being kidnapped. Something tells me it might be in another castle... hehehe.\n\nBut get past all that and take the game for what it really is, and you'll be well rewarded. We're talking a 3D platformer in the style of Super Mario and all those, and it's pretty darn good. It might no be the *best* game out there, and it's not the longest game out there. But what it is, is a very old-school, excellent 3d platformer with a whole lot of style, and, even more important, a whole lot of love put into it. This isn't a quick cash grab from greedy publishers who don't know what makes these games popular. This is a game by gamers, for gamers. A game that really shines with love. These guys aren't just games like you and me. These guys really love their games, and most of the time, it feels like this is a game by them, for themselves. A love letter to themselves, in a way. We are just fortunate enough to get to take part in this and enjoy the game for ourselves.\n\nToo long, didn't read? Mario, Banjo, Crash, FreezeME. 'nough said.","January 6","true","1.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Between all of its influences, the most noticeable are Super Mario 64 and to a lesser degree Super Mario Galaxy.\n\nInstead of Gold Stars your main collectibles are Gold Cubes, there are 40 distributed around the game's 4 levels.

The boss battle aren't really that great, but they are passable. The music is pretty on point to other entries in the genre.\n\nOverall I had a blast playing it and it really helped with that 3D platformer dry we've all been experiencing the past years.

Thats what makes it great Its the kind of game we need on PC and the potential for a Modding community and Level editor could make this game Sky Rocket into one of the best 3D Platformers on the PC.\n\nMain Mechanic:\nAt First i didnt Think i would need the camera freezing but i found myself using it way more as i played and it works pretty well. The only Gripe i have about it is the controls for it. it plants your feet right where you are at and can only Freeze whats right infront of your it doesnt turn you around or anything. Small Issue for me at least.\n\nControls (Xbox ONE Controller):\nThe controls are Pretty stiff when it comes to movement You WILL find your self Jumping and diving through the entire game because the Speed R (thats the main characters name) runs at is Pretty slow.\nThis only becomes a problem when you have your sound on be cause each time you jump theres one sound you character makes and every time theres ONE sound you character makes.\n\nSights and Sounds:\nFor a game made in Unity its Beautiful. I never had a gripe about what something looked like i just took it all in.\nThe music In the game is really good, a bit repetitive but its nothing annoying. The sounds of most of the enemies have a sound they make is straight ripped from Dispicible Me. Some of the sounds in the game are WAY too Loud. Which im sure are going to be fixed soon because I did mention them on a stream with the dev Present.\n\nFor a dev team made of only 1 person, FreezeME is pretty great i can't wait to see what else is done with this game and what other games he releases in the future.\n\nTL;DR/Pros Cons list\n\nPros:\n- Super Mario 64/Galaxy Clone On PC\n- Good Graphics\n- Open Levels Without feeling empty\n- Dev Is Open to almost anything\n- After the first final boss fight you unlock something super SICK\n- Music is Good Surprise\n- Only $14!\n\nCons:\n- Some SFX volumes are Wonky\n- Stiffish controls\n- Quicksand F Quicksand\n\nFinal words:\nThis game NEEDS Modding / Level editor it would take this game to Super high heights.\nI Give this game a 7 out of 10\n","December 17, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The worlds are big, bright and colorful with puzzles/tasks spread across each of them. People who have played Super Mario 64 will be familiar with completing individual tasks and being rewarded with a star for their troubles; it's the same premise with FreezeME but instead of stars, you're rewarded with golden cubes. The scope of the worlds is impressive with individual planets (al a Super Mario Galaxy style) reached by launching R from a cannon.\n\nI was at first hesitant to make my purchase after reading other reviews and thoughts about the control system and mechanics. Controlling R certainly feels "heavy" and not as fluid as controlling Mario in Super Mario 64. Jumping and landing can be sporadic in places but controls, at least in my case, have began to grow on me and fortunately, it hasn't deterred my enjoyment from the game. The camera work is also not as refined though still adaptable with free reign to adjust camera options and predictability in the settings. I personally use an Xbox 360 controller's right stick to control the camera and hitting the "Y" button to center the camera behind R when needed.\n\nThe soundtrack is very bright and colorful; I'm fondly reminded of Grant Kirkhope's Banjo Kazooie effort and Koji Kondo's Super Mario 64 score. In no way does it grate on you and it's pleasant to listen to.\n\nTo conclude, FreezeMe is a good effort from an indie developer and while it certainly lacks the polish and fluid controls I had come to expect from Nintendo and Rareware platformers, you can't go far wrong with FreezeME for its price-point.\n\n7/10.","February 10","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

FreezeME is a full Super Mario fix and plays well on the Steam Controller.  Would I say it's perfect?  No, but there's a lot it does right:\n\nPros:\n-Surprising amount of professional polish to: area designs, menus, animations, etc.\n-Great game layout as far as traditional Super Mario like game goals go.  With bonus/challenge areas, revisiting same locations to get more challenging gold cubes, etc.\n-Captures that Super Mario platformer "themepark" feel pretty much spot on.  Where you can see all the challenges around you that makes you want to keep exploring more.\n-Lastly, GREAT VIEW CAMERA.  It doesn't try and get too smart and most importantly, it lets you flip the axis to what you like.\n\nCons:\n-Freeze Camera aiming is a little weird/takes some getting used to.  A more intuitive control scheme where the view stays in 3rd person, but auto locks onto the freeze camera target and back again might work better.  Or t least make it a check box, so you can have either/or, depending on what works for the player.  To me, it's weird moving a little tracer line around from whatever side angle your view happens to be at when you bring the camera out.  Also, the aiming is a little dicey, it needs an acceleration curve or some kind of smoothing.\n-Wish there was a sprint feature where you would start to run a little faster outside, like the LEGO games do in open world exploration areas.\n-I wish the main character had a little more personality, the black haired glasses thing is fine, just a little too "Plain Jane" to stick in your mind and remember.\n\nOverall though, I'm very happy with this game as a pretty good Super Mario fix, of which there are not many this true to form on Steam.  I paid full asking price and would do it again.","December 13, 2015","true","7.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

However, I was quite disappointed by the experience. Despite playing for only a short amount of time, what I had played was very off-putting.\n\n\nMy impressions of the game:\n\n1. The controls and "feel" of the game:\n\nGrowing up I played a lot of other 3D platformers such as Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, Super Mario, etc and I strongly believe that one of the reasons they are so highly acclaimed is because of their control scheme and character movement. In FreezeMe, I constantly became frustrated by the clunky movement and "heaviness" of the character. Perhaps this is intentional, but I found it both tedious and annoying. Good luck trying to perfom percise jumps with ease and fluidity.\nAlso, when trying to move the "Camera" to freeze objects or enemies, the inversion of the joystick made it so much more difficult than it should have been. There is not a fix to this as far as I know.\n\n2. Level Design:\n\nYes, FreezeME is definitely a bright and colorful game with large environments to explore. There is no doubting that. However, I wouldn't say that numerous floating squares and other shapes in the sky that must be jumped on to progress is good level design. That, coupled with poor movement, left me pulling my hair out as a missed jump meant falling all the way back to the ground and having to restart my climb.\n\n3. The Camera:\n\nThe game camera in FreezeME can be finicky at times but after messing around with the settings, I found a workaround.\n\n4. Music:\n\nFrom what I experienced, the music was well composed, but it was easy to see how the repetitiveness of the track (the first one at least) could get annoying.\n\n5. Artwork:\n\nAs previously noted, the artwork of the game is quite enjoyable with bright, cartoony colors.\n\n\nOverall, this game has the potential to be great but as the reasons state above, I cannot reccommend it at this point in time. If you were looking for the next Crash Bandicoot, Banjo-Kazooie, or Spyro, you, much like I, will be disappointed. I hope that these problems will be fixed in future updates.\n\n5/10\n","December 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","1"

Some things may have been patched by the time you play this.\n\nPLEASE READ: I have collected every collectible and 100%ed the game save one possible health container. This review recommends FreezeME with some caveats, however. There will be very minor spoilers in this review (I will try to be vague). If you don't wish to read them you can skip to the last paragraph.\n\nFreezeME is a 3D Platformer Collectathon in the same vein as Super Mario 64. I grew up on games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie and I've been looking for a Collectathon that would scratch that itch.\n\nIn FreezeME you play as R, a girl with a camera that when aimed at certain enemies and certain parts of the environment you can take a picture of them and freeze them in their place for a limited amount of time. The time varies with each enemy. The game features 4 worlds, a hub world, and a few challenge levels that are accessible through the hub world.\n\n\n-Story-\nFat the Cat kidnaps R's dog and R has to get him back. It's a simple story but I don't think anyone will be playing this for the story.\n\n\n-Character Design-\nThe characters, except for a few, are all rather plain and dull. Most of them are cartoony pigs with a shperical body and lacking back legs so that they presumably bounce to get around but that is almost all of the NPCs. The enemy designs change every level, though they are really just reskins.\nThe main character, R, probably has the most interesting design in the entire game.\n\n\n-Collectibles-\nThe game throws you in and only tells you how to jump (which we should really all know how to do). The things it doesn't tell you about are the unique parts of the game such as the collectibles and their purposes.\n\n\n-Controls and Camera-\nThe running and jumping is obviously inspired by Super Mario 64. This is not a bad thing. Everything feels fairly good. It feels like it would be at home on the Nintendo 64 which isn't entirely a compliment. One thing that the N64 platformers all failed at was having a good camera. FreezeME fits in with them perfectly in that regard. The camera is awful. While walls will make the camera zoom in (which is how it should work) once you move away from the wall the camera doesn't zoom out to its previous position which can become very annoying if you are in one of the few places in the game with lots of walls. In some parts of the game there are alternate gravity sections not unlike Super Mario Galaxy. Due to the stubbornness of the camera I am of the opinion that the game would have been better without them. You can't have these gravity sections with an un cooperative camera.\nI must also mention swimming. There aren't many opportunities in the game to swim which I see as a good thing because it isn't very fun due to how inactive it is. You hold the B button and that's it. And aiming underwater is made more needlessly difficult due to the camera.\n\n\n-Sound-\nThe music is nice enough, though I don't think I would listen to it outside of the game. None of it is very catchy or inspired but it's fine as it is. There are green statues which exchange Cubes (think Jiggy or Power Star) for 10 Green Pig Coins. When you walk up to them they emit a very loud and irritating laser sound. If the volume was lower it would be bearable. I would like to believe that the devs left it at that volume on accident but it's so loud I find it difficult to believe that.\n\n\n-Level Design (SPOILERS)-\nThe world are all very nice and colorful and easily distinguishable from one another.\n\nThe first and second are fine as they are. There are no major problems with either of these two worlds.\n\nThe third is where some problems begin to seep in. It has both ice and quicksand. The ice wasn't that bad. Mostly annoying. I know it's supposed to be hard to pick up momentum on ice at first but this made it hard to get off the ice if you were on the edge between ice and ground but the ground was higher than the ice. You would try to jump on the ground but without momentum you wouldn't move forward and would just land where you originally jumped from.\nThe next problem was quicksand mostly for the same reasons. You would try to jump out of it and sometimes you could but sometimes you would be stuck and then you would get sucked beneath and die.\n\nThe last world looks nice but I think the implementation and design completely lacked forethought. The world suffers from a stupid difficulty spike and if you fall in the lava down below you're as good as dead. Each time you touch the lava you take damage. There are no invincibility frames so you have a chance to survive. All of a sudden you have to make these incredibly precise jumps, thankfully there are plenty of teleporters so you don't have to do it all at once (I forgot to mention teleporters, didn't I?).\n\nTeleporters make traversing each world a lot more convenient. The only real problem is that you have to wait for each teleporter to cycle through the list of teleporters.\n\nWe can't forget the Challenge Levels, can we? They are difficult but fun levels (one even gives a not-so-subtle but funny nod to Super Mario 64). The biggest problem is that you can't just automatically restart and you have to wait to die in some cases. Depending on the height you're at this can take up to 10 seconds and because of the difficulty you're going to die quite a few times. A quick restart option would alleviate some of the aggravation.\n\n\n-Boss Design (SPOILERS)-\nThe bosses are rather boring. If they all had more character to them I think I might have a different opinion. The first one is simple enough once you get a feel for the game and is fine for a first boss.\n\nThe second is where it gets frustrating. Not because it's difficult but because of the diversion the boss tells you in the beginning that he 'just mopped the floor' and if you look you can see the refection of everything in the floor. You, him, and the precariously swaying chandelier. This was a failure to implement the famous "Chekhov's gun" principle in the game. You think that you're supposed to pay attention to the floor. You think that the reflection matters in some way. You think that maybe you have to make the chandelier fall on him. Nope. You hit him. 3 times. And then 3 more times. That's all.\n\nThe third boss is where I started to have trouble with them. Not because it was particularly difficult but because the boss has no 'tell' as to when it is vulnerable. And then when you do hit it sometimes it takes damage and sometimes it doesn't even when you did the exact same thing.\n\nThe fourth boss is the same way. Sometimes he takes damage and sometimes he doesn't. Another thing is that he runs around and is much larger than R. This means that sometimes you will get caught in front of him and can't escape and that's it. You take damage like every half second. You're dead.\n\nThe fifth boss suffers from basically the same problem as the fourth but the main problem isn't the boss but the gauntlet you have to pass before the boss. This could also be included under level design. Most of it is fine and after a few tries I had no problem getting to the last part but on the last part it locks your camera so that it would play more as a sidescroller which would have been fine it also made it so that you could only move on one axis. This results in you accidentally tilting up or down (and you don't know because of the camera's distance and your lack of control of the camera) and you end up walking off the edge and into the lava below. And you have to start all over.\n\n-Conclusion\nIf you absolutely love the classic 3D Mario games then you're sure to find plenty to like in FreezeME. If that's not your style then I'm not sure I can recommend it for you in particular.\n\nWith all this said, I can safely say that I am looking forward to FreezeME 2, presuming it is better than the first.","March 21","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I grew up on 3D platformers and love one-man dev team games. There is just too much that is broken about this game to like. Even after getting all 150 red pigcoins, all green coins, along with all cubes in the first two levels I somehow managed to miss a screw. Getting one in the third world, I backtracked to the second to unlock the catapult and can now no longer progress in the third world because I fall off the gravity ring and need the now broken catapult. Note, I didn't miss an important power, just one measly screw in one past level that has kept me from moving on at all in the further level. They don't give you a counter for total screws per level either, so where might it be? Who knows. The hit detection on the bosses are bad, and the final boss is the worst offender. There are physics glitches, including you "Wall sliding" down the air above a platform you're trying to grab the lip of. My favorite happened today when I jumped on a normal moving platform, the game thought it was a spring, and sent me up so high I got to skip the next two platforming puzzles.\n\n\nThere are great things about this game. The music is splendid, the art is wonderful, and the jokes have charm. The first half of the admittedly short experience, I raved about it on high and recommended it to as many people as possible as a true return to form for 3D platforming. For those who bought it at my recommendation, I'm sorry. Take a pass on this one, at least until some patches are released and some things are reconsidered.","December 15, 2015","false","7.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","5"

Played enough to see 3 full levels and 4 single-action levels. Great level design, it could be a really fun game. Unfortunately, that "COULD" is based on two very simple things that have gone wrong.\n1. Controls, particularly with a gamepad: The keyboard mappings are fine and make plenty of sense; however: any wall-interaction movement is appaling. Try to walk near a wall and you'll end up grabbing it for no reason, and when you want to grab it you'll keep running past the wall. Getting a wall-jump to register correctly is a test in patience (provided there's a floor for you to start again) and many platform jumps which look like a sure-footed landing may turn into a ledge-grab, or you just may fall off and have to backtrack a significant amount. Small movements to rotate in place to set up for a series of jumps don't seem to exist. In 2D sections (particularly single-action levels) 3D controls still rule; you can miss a wall jump very easily because the game things you're slightly moving in/out of the plane of movement. Which for purposes of a 2D level is impossible. I could go on\n2. Camera. Requires a lot of manual moving as you play. Navigating small spaces, and the camera doesn't show you any hazards, falls, or anything around you; just a lot of environment that obstructs you.\nGosh. It could be a lot of fun. I really want it to be. But until the controls get cleaned up, the game feels like more of a chore.","February 27","false","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are so many bugs with this game, that its incredible it has ever been released in the first place. I dont know where to begin to be honest. so lets just start.\n\nCONTROLS: Barely Working\nThe slide doesnt work almost at all, you will get stuck in a animation if you use it in spot.\nThe dive blasts you off at 200km/h, and is pretty much the only movement option that has any speed. Which means 80% of the time you will be diving then jumping into diving again until you get where you need to be.\nThe walljump is sticky, and you have to wait a bit before it actually works.\nThe Camera: Its a mess - I have never been closer to throwing up by playing a game. To top it off, this game tries to include Mario Galaxy elements, which this game cannot handle at all. Do not play this if you get easily sick - You will throw up!\nIf you want an example of this, try out the challenge map you unlock early on (It should unlock within 2 hours so you can still refund), its a clear example of how hard it is to just control\nThe camera the character holds: Its apparently one of the main points of the game, but its actually rarely used, and when it is used, its impossible to point with. In the 2 hours i played, i maybe used it once, or twice. And thank god for that\n\nThe Worlds: They're messy as hell.\nYou often have to trigger something in the map, to open something in the other end of the map.\nIts also often cluttered with the same textured and shaped boxes and circles everywhere, so when you look up in the sky its just a load of random objects.\nThe Intro sequence in each map rarely explains where you even have to go, so its incredibly hard to do some missions if you havent played the map before.\nThere are barely any enemies in these maps. Its just so huge its rare you ever encounter them, and theres no incentive to fight anything.\n\nThe Soundtrack: Its vomit-inducing. I swear its royalty free music or something. It sounds like 3-6 notes repeating all over again. The most joy i got out of this game was when World 1 finally ended so i didn't have to listen to its song anymore.\n\nThe enviroment itself is so boring and lifeless. There are barely any characters, those that are there  are just pigs with no personality. The worlds are just as lifeless as well. The 2 worlds i played were normal looking ground world, and "Frozen Chilly Cold Mountain"\n\nNow guess what "Frozen Chilly Cold Mountain" has as theme\n\nIts a Horror/Ice Theme. Yes i know, they have 3 words to describe the ice theme, and none for the horror theme.\n\nEverything is so wrong about this game. Its like the developer put in all the content but none of the love. If i am missing anything that needs to be added of how big a mess this is, feel free to add that as a comment.\n\nIf you ever brought this game, make sure to refund it, just as i did. Literally the worst game i played this year\n\n2/10","December 10, 2015","false","1.8"," 20 of 44 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","20","44","2","0"

I was glad to see they finished the game and released it. I was also glad that they supplied a drm free copy (which also came with a steam key). I figured I'd try out the steam copy so I could leave a review.\n\nIt's a fun game. It's reminiscent of mario 64 and at times mario galaxy. The levels are big and fun to explore. I enjoy collecting and exploring so it suited me quite well. I thought the first two worlds were quite fun but the last felt a bit disjointed. The controls are ok, certainly not as tight as a mario veteran would want but they are fine. The music was a bit bland but not annoying. The track in the second world was very suitable!\n\nSome glaring flaws are 1. the hub world. It's pretty big and empty and tedious to traverse, expecially since the character doesn't run particularly fast - I ended up having to perform forward dives to get to places faster. 2. It's buggy - sometimes the camera can go funny, the hit detection can be flake, your jump can go wrong etc. and it doesn't feel like a player fault. When I beet the final boss for the first time he reappeared for some reason, it glitched my game and I had to re beat him - which was annoying because the last level is tough, requiring precise platforming that the previous faults make difficult.\n\nThat said, I'm willing to look past a lot of the flaws knowing well that it was a small indie team who crafted the game. I imagine they just ran out of time and cash and needed to get the game out. It's clear they put a lot of love and care into it. It's absolutely worth a try if you enjoy N64 like platformers. I think a team like this could make something really nice with a bigger budget and more time. It has more soul in it than many bigger titles that came out this year.\n\nI reckon I'll play this game again in the near future.","December 27, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Core platforming is good and the worlds look decent enough. It still feels like some bugs need to be fixed though. Most of my complaints are minor nitpicks:\n\n-crouching is clunky and slow to exit\n-the camera mechanic doesnt use or allow a first person view for some reason?\n-the spin kick attack looks a bit weak\n-some vertical gaps your character can fit into are actually walls\n-glasses don't teleport in with you correctly? I guess them remaining while teleporting out could possibly be a joke\n-some objects have the exact same color and end up blurring together\n-glare is too strong on some objects like coins and spinners\n-ledge grab doesn't work at times when it seems like it should\n-fall damage impact doesn't look appropriate\n-not sure why I am kicked out of the level after getting most gold cubes\n-arrow when using the catapult appears to point straight up?\n\nThere are also some more major gripes I have that are more frustrating and probably should be addressed:\n\n*special platforming sections where you cannot control the camera have the camera spinning too much when it is overhead and I am trying to make jumps. The result is me flying off into different directions. If the camera is going to be overhead, it probably should not turn at all (ran into this for the 2nd cube in the 1st world)\n\n*the third world has more islands/plantetoids. when running around the green "gravity noodle" near the bottom, it is possible to run off of it into the air when you run around it. It almost seems to depend upon the angle of the camera from what I've seen. When trying to jump up the grey walls/"beads" on there, I ended up leaving its gravity and falling into oblivion. I don't know if this is intentional, but I don't feel like it should be.\n\n*In the third world, trying to use the catapault to launch to the desert looking island caused me to hit something above me, fall and die.\n\n*I got to the ice island in the third world, and the "ice" there seems broken. Changing directions seems slippery as intended, but releasing the control stick causes you to stop quicker than on normal ground. Also running and jumping seems to kill any horizontal momentum you have. Trying to jump onto land from ice next to it is almost impossible without a big running start.","January 10","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
