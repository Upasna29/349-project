Even when they did adhere to the Steam guidelines.\nThe developer also attempts to hide it and lies about it, saying that he welcomes criticicsm: http://s9.postimg.org/jxierjee7/lies.jpg\n\n\nPros- It has Steam achievements.\n- It has trading cards.\n- Erm... It has half naked girls?\n\nCons (first version of game)- Maps are extremely poorly made. The developer is certainly not anywhere near an experienced RPG Maker user. See also this example to illustrate that the developer did not even spend 10 minutes on his maps: http://s21.postimg.org/7q55xtm2v/chosen.png\n- Around 98% default graphics where used. If you include the unused files that were shipped with this game, over 99%. No(t much) money was spend on this game aside from some character busts and 1 single custom battle background and maybe some free music.\n- I explored the game-folder because I was kind of surprised why this is over 300MB. Seems the dev did not even bother to clean up the project. It has LOTS AND LOTS of unused files... Also no proper compression and no proper file-formats used. All just default.\n- Combat is basic. Just some plugins from other people thrown together. Looks half finished, unbalanced and feels static. Also the enemies you encounter all came default with RPG Maker. The dev did not even bother to create or adjust the enemies himself. Because that would actually take a few hours of time...\n- Most of the music is also default. I have heard it a 100x before in other games. But not all.\n- The prologue does not have a background it's just a black screen. This could be okay in some cases but not here. Also it's unskippable, It can be speed up a tiny bit though. It also has spelling mistakes. And the rest of the game also has plenty of spelling mistakes.\n- Using names like Kami (Japanese for god)... Well, it beats Kitsune I guess.\n- Lots of events where SFX seem absent or may have been forgotten.\n- Didn't use any different dialog-backgrounds to indicate that people are thinking instead of speaking.\n- Half the positive reviews here of questionable nature. The only review that has a lot of (up)votes is a negative one. Some of those people that claim this game is awesome have logged 0.5 hours. Then thereafter they played many other games instead.\nAlso people who can't find a single positive point aside from "I really dig the music" and still upvote the game. Not to mention their indirect ties sometimes to the developer. It all looks of very 'questionable' nature.\n- Menu is 100% default. Just like the rest of the game it's very minimalistic and it feels as if it was made in just 7 days time.\n- Some maps allow you to exit by touching the edge of the map while other maps require you to use the markers.  Sometimes the same area has sections where you can do this and sections where you can't do this. This inconsistency is insanely annoying and extremely bad game design. You can clearly see this in the 2nd area (forest south west of the starting town) where this happens randomly everywhere.\n- Random texts appear telling you where to go so now and then. There is often no story behind it at all. And you better not forget it because the game won't tell you twice.\n- It goes on sale for 40% off right upon release.\n- The story is AWFUL. You visit your mom's grave "Hey mom". Then shortly after "I better get back to the village". Why? Because the dev did not include a reason for you to go to places where he wants you to go. This goes on and on.\n- I can't name my characters. I can't even name my characters in a RPG Maker game?\n- Etc. etc. etc. You get the idea.\n\nAnd this is where I stopped playing.\nA shameful game, with an even more shameful dev. Shame on both for releasing such a poorly made game. And shame on Steam for allowing this. Maybe I should also release games like these. Maybe like 2/week or so and ask 2 bucks for them with a perma 50% discount and some half naked content to attract some attention.\nAnd those reviewers claiming that it is only a few bucks, it's a few bucks totally wasted and spend on a developer that does not deserve it.\n\nThe dev told me that the reason the game is still good despite all the 'lies' I wrote in my review: "But it's only like 1$"...\n\n\n\nUPDATE: My response to the developers response to this review:Every perspective is biased, lets not pretend there is some magical thing called a 100% objective review.\nAs a developer of the game you're also heavily biased, to all the faults and you ignore the truths (which I can proof and some I even did proof) of my review. But you keep denying them and keep calling us liars.\nIf you really want to convince the critics, just address the arguments on its face. Attacking me instead of the review/criticism all the time. Except the majority seem to agree with me not you.\n\nMaybe come back with actual substance... Addressing the issues instead of attacking your (potential) players it's simply not cool. Perhaps you could fix the mistakes in your maps, improve the things we pointed out, reverse the bans and apologize and I will be so honest to rewrite my review then. Which, you can not delete&ban, only Steam can and Steam does not believe I violate any rules/guidelines.\n\nI mean Silver only ever played Chosen for 20 minutes, after already telling us how terrible it was.While my review has extremely low game hours, so did a lot of positive reviews, so why not criticize and possibly ban them just as much as me? Or is it because they agree with you?\nGraphics&maps are a "visual" experience, it requires no gametime to make a judgement based on it, I can watch a gameplay walkthrough and still have an opinon of the developers mapping skills and level of polish.Clearly though Silver knew exactly how long it took to make the maps that he/she had not even seen yet.And like I said many times before: I did see it before I criticized it in the screenshots/video YOU SUPPLIED pre-release and I showed you proof in the other review already. But keep saying it often enough maybe someone will believe you...\n\nRegarding the ban reasons:\nFirst reason: "crazy criticism & violating Steams guidelines". Note that I did NOT violate Steam's Guidelines (yes I wrote Steam support about it). Later he changed it to "You have been banned because you criticized my game without even seeing it". But again, I did see it on the screenshots and on the demo video the devs SUPPLIED pre-release and ended up (unaltered&unpolished) into the final version.\nAlso other people got banned for the same criticism. Later he changed the real ban reason to along the lines of: "I thought that you're another developer who is jealous of my work trying to make me look bad"... If anyone is jealous of this work... Then that person must have a hard time finding a job in the game industry for sure.\n\nThen he proves even more of what an amateur he is by publicly arguing with banned users in a review (another review, not this one). And when I complained about spelling mistakes he said something along the lines of "but your review does too"... I never in my life saw a developer respond like that.\nA prologue should NEVER have spelling mistakes, since that is the first impression of your writing they get, and will demonstrate the judgement they will be biased in. But to shift blame like that is a new low that I have never seen before.","February 5","false","0.4"," 327 of 358 people (91%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","91","327","358","19","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImpalaPUA/recommended/434420/","ImpalaPUA","Impala","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImpalaPUA/","261 products in account","My Impression:\nI usually steer clear of RPG maker games, but I was interested in the fact the description compared it to Chrono Trigger. It is nothing like Chrono Trigger. It's a very generic JRPG with a generic storyline. I beat the game with all the achievements in 4 hours, including the hidden items.\n\nPositive:\n+ Character art is pretty nice, not sure it's original (also, there's no nudity like the tags suggest)\n+ RPG maker combat is always nice, its a throwback to the past\n+ It was just long enough that I finished it without saying this game is just too bad\n+ Music was pretty decent\n+ Hidden "quests" if you want to call them that add something nice\n+ Trading cards with nice backgrounds\n\nCons:\n- A lot of bugs, maps you go up into will start you at the top for instance. Ultimate weapons are not named correctly. Balancing issues caused by not testing enough. Another bug is that some of the bosses don't disappear and you can re-fight them over and over again, and one of them you can accidently refight just based on the positioning of the objects.\n- Very linear\n- Pay attention to where you are supposed to go, they mention it once after each major event, easy to get lost\n- Story is pretty generic\n\nBelow Average Game: 4/10\n\nI got the game for 40% off, and I probably would recommend it at <$1.00 to anyone that wants to beat a 4-5 hour generic JRPG.","February 4","false","4.5"," 250 of 292 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","250","292","12","16"

However, to be clear, the only reason I would go back to it because it is hilarious. That is, hilariously bad. It'd almost be a parody of stereotypical JRPGs if it didn't take itself so seriously.\n\nAnd the bugs. Just in the first half hour, without trying to find them, I saw at least three graphical errors and an NPC that gave me speech based on events that had not happened yet.\n\nI paid less than a dollar for this game, and that's all it's worth. I've used RPG maker, even with just the base program you can do much better than this. Buy it on sale if you want to laugh at the cliches, but otherwise steer clear.","March 14","false","0.6"," 98 of 113 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","98","113","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/434420/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","To be honest, I was hoping that there'd be more of a game under all the cheesecake, but unfortunately, what's there just isn't very good. It's an RPGMaker-born game, and oh boy, does it show. I think the gratuitous skin is to distract from the fact that this game really, really isn't ready for much of anything resembling launch. It needs more than just a spit-shine; it needs rebalancing so very badly- some of the moves can simply allow you to cheese the game. For example, we'll look at the most egregious example: Serenity's "Tackle" skill.\n\nMost RPGs have several different status effects- you know, poison, paralyze, slow, etc.- the usual ones that we all know and loathe. Chosen introduces us to a new one: off-balance. Essentially, a target affected by off-balance cannot take another action until they are no longer off-balance, essentially turning them into a punching bag for the duration. It usually wears off after a turn or two, but you can essentially just layer it every single turn if you get lucky enough. It's game-breaking: believe me when I say that nothing in the game is immune to it- not even the final boss. Yes, as long as you keep Serenity alive during the final battle, you stand a darn good chance to just wreck him by abusing the cheezburgers out of her "Tackle" skill. The only saving grace is that it requires ten tech points to use, and the only way you can get those is by either attacking the enemy, or being attacked. You get five per successful attack... and, of course Serenity gets two attacks a round right off the bat and, of course, TP is figured per strike rather than per command.\n\nIt means that, well... you can alternate Tackle every turn with the regular attack and eliminate plenty of difficulty from the game, because "Tackle" is the first technique that Serenity learns. You'll have it before you're finished with the first dungeon. Every other technique that she learns is outshined and not even needed. Other abilities are overly costly, others are just useless. You can simply use three abilities aside from regular attacks (Edge's "Strong Attack", Serenity's "Tackle" and Trinity's "Aura Blade" (has a chance to silence the target) along with a decently-sized nuke from Myste) and not use another attack pattern, apart from using Trinity to drop item heals on targets that need it.\n\nThe game is unfinished- there are missing walls that are not coded in (most observable in Volcano Village- in which there is someone living in a tent, where you can walk past the boundaries of the tent and all over the screen without hitting an invisible wall. The exit was programmed in, the invisible walls were not. The text is making my inner English major throw a fit worthy of my three-year-old niece, and I wholeheartedly say that she could have done a better job on editing the script than whoever was hired to do it. It's full of errors that a run through spellcheck would have caught, and there's no real excuse for something like that.\n\nAll in all, it appears the dev is hoping that plentiful cheesecake will distract from the myriad of shortcomings, errors and mistakes currently present in the game- while I have nothing against cheesecake, you can't just hide the fact that this game's nowhere near done and really shouldn't have been released in this condition without much more time in development.\n\nThe only real thing the game has is the cheesecake, and if that doesn't float your particular boat, I honestly can't recommend this game.  I'd pay no more than fifty cents for this clunker of a game- I hope the dev takes note and does better with the next installment and irons out the mistakes and errors.\n\n2/10.","February 9","false","3.0"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","67","77","2","0"

It's embarassingly unpolished with graphical errors all over the place and uses inconsistant, mismatching default RPG Maker elements for the mostpart. Gameplay is aggrivating with most "quests" having you visit and re-visit the same areas multiple times in order to talk to someone who simply tells you to go somewhere else and talk to someone else.\n\nI honestly don't know how I finished it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/434420/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","This game is too cheaply made to really be worth your time. The story is cookie fodder -- early -- Final Fantasy fare, the chosen hero has to save the world yadda yadda yadda.\nThe only unique feature which tries to set it apart from other RPGMaker games is the cheesecake portraits of female characters, which heavily feature in the store front screenshots.\n\nThe main problem is easily seen in all the random battles: there is absolutely no art consistency in this game. Backgrounds are pixel paintings, player characters are minute chibi sprites and as for the enemies, they are without exception several times larger than the player sprites and of various differing art styles, ranging from generic slime to highly detailed soldier. Battles use RPGMaker default rules and there isn't even a selection cursor showing just which of the many enemies on screen is 'Soldiers A' and which is 'Soldiers D' -- note the plural.\n\nThe game text has multiple grammar and spelling errors, and even complete novice errors such as referring to a DESCENDANT of someone as ANCESTOR.\n\nOther problems include the complete lack of indicators on sprites that are affected by status impairments such as poisoned, while with player characters there is some indicator in the battle screens, there is no such info for enemies. Combine with the lack of identification of individual enemies and you have to remember which enemy has which status...\n\nThere is also no health bar for enemies, or even any indication that they may be close to death. Fortunately (?) they are all very easy. Without grinding, I only died once during the entire game, and that was a scripted loss. Even the optional bosses are extremely easy to beat.\n\nOn top of all that, the game ends on a clfifhanger with a 'to be continued'.\n\nAll in all, if this were a free RPGMaker game I'd be supportive of it as the game creator does have a good idea of what makes a decent oldschool RPG game, but for a commercial release that is sold for money, I expect more. So I just can't honestly recommend it.","February 14","false","7.3"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","0"

There's just so little going on here. This game has a very low price point, which I suppose is the only true saving grace about it, but that's literally it. I suppose I should say that as a first effort, it's THAT bad, but it's pretty forgettable as a whole. Keep in mind it also ends with a bland cliff hanger and a 'to be continued...' screen, but more attention should have been paid into making this one rather than any intent on going to a sequel. There's not much to recommend.\n\nDisappointments about Chosen:\n1. Possibly the most generic RPG I've ever played. Forgettable non-personality characters with run of the mill anime names (Edge, Serenity, Akuma). Tired order versus chaos storyline. Even the 'twist' at the end is utterly predictable.\n\n2. Super easy. I never needed to grind. Enemies, including the special bosses and the final villain, all hit like wet socks. Had decent gear by the end, but not anything great, nor did I need anything better. A quiz at the end of the game has no penalties, you just keep answering different things until you get it right. A few pushing boulder puzzles that I could do in my sleep.\n\n3. No character has any personality. They speak a few lines, but they're all honestly interchangable and faceless. Only the main character has anything that can be described as a motivation. Heck, one of the party members even shares the same image as her ruler's full image, except the latter has a dress and a tiara.\n\n4. Lack of a navigation system. There's no map feature and if you miss or forget the quick blurb between story events about what direction to go to, good luck. The overworld has limited defining features at best. They're just empty islands with one, occasionally two enterable places at best. I spent more time wandering around between playing sessions trying to figure out where I was supposed to go than anything else.\n\n5. The whole experience... it's just lazy. Words running off the screen, with frequent grammar mistakes. Incomplete maps, numerous empty traveling screens with no monsters or anything to do on them. Generic bikini clad party members for quick eyecandy sales. If you want some cheesecake, play Huni Pop, because you won't see much of anything beyond the screen shots above. Numerous NPCs in the last town don't speak whatsoever, unlike ones from previous towns. Oh, and the last area? There's no wandering monsters. In fact, you can pay gold to literally buy experience points.\n\nA couple of acceptable points...\n\n1. The aforementioned low price point. Mind you, this was also on sale when it came out...\n\n2.

Weapon and armor upgrades are plentiful and often found for free just by searching, often better than what you can get in stores making most purchases there pointless.\n5. Plot is linear and will give you the tools to progress out of nowhere. "Oh no, the big bad is on the southwestern continent! How do we get there? Let's go back to the village for clues." You go back to the village and there's a new generic NPC at the entrance who says "Use the boat to the southwest".

Many things are left unexplained.\n\nGameplay\nThe biggest problem of the game.\nFirst off, NO QUEST LOG. There is no quest log to see the game objective. The objective is hidden within the conversations between characters. If you clicked too fast during conversation, that's it, you will not know what to do at all.\n\nSecond, Random encounters of monsters. The same mechanics as Pokemon games, but WORSE, everywhere other than towns, you encounter a monster every 10 seconds of walking, and there is no such thing as "repel". YES, this reason is enough for you to ignore this game.\n\nThird, EXTREMELY BAD GAMEFLOW. There is no map in this game. You will reach a point where you can go to the final boss place straight away, and get rekt by the wild monsters there when you still don't know what happened. Boss fights are not obvious. This is very frustrating, see the next point.\n\nFourth, Save system. I am aware that RPG Maker game cannot do autosave, Due to the bad gameflow which you may die anytime, you literally have to save the game every 10 minutes. You can only return to your last save-point if you died. This is god damn frustrating. And the game ends without letting you save, this means no sense of accomplishment after completing the game at all.\n\nFifth, Combat system. I'm fine with turn-based combat, the one bothers me is the elements. There are fire, water, ice and etc in this game, but they got literally no impact to the game. You can't see the damage difference between them. The same goes to physical atk/def and magical atk/def.\n\nCharacters\nEverything is ♥♥♥♥. ZERO character development.\nLook at all the characters in the the trailer, that guy is in fact 17 years old (wtf?).\nAll the almost-naked girls (or ♥♥♥♥♥s) randomly join the party for no reason (to save the world, like that? wtf?).\n\nVisual and Audio\nMeh.\n\n\n2/10 much hate(originally 1 point, +1 point for cheap steam cards and achievements.)","May 7","false","4.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Since this game was only $2 I didn't expect something amazing from it, but anything can happen. What I remember about the protagonist is one thing. His mother is dead. That's all I remember, because this game is very empty. This game lacks pretty much everything to make a RPG good, or just okay. There is no indication of where to go when doing missions. There is no map to guide you around the world, so it's frustrating to roam until you finally found your objective. Most of the missions are just going back and forth; this makes it so tedious. Now, is the story good? Story-wise, it's boring and pretty dull.\n\nIn ConclusionI see that there wasn't much effort in creating this game, and no creativity. I feel like this game wasn't finished, and it was just put on the store for easy cash. Please developers, you can do something better than this. The only thing saving this game are the half naked girls, but that's it. Most of this game is made with basic stuff from RPGMaker.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menacia/recommended/434420/","Menacia","Menacia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menacia/","204 products in account","Disclaimer: I was given a key for free!!\n\nThe Chosen RPG is a casual old-school 16bit era JRPG style made with RPGMaker VX Ace that despite it doesn't bring anything new to the genre and won't probably stand out much from other more impressive RPGMaker games, still manages to  keep the player entertained over the course of it's short length.\n\nThe story focuses on Edge, the main protagonist who  becomes the Chosen one to fight evil. While on his quest he teams up with some scantly dressed girls (no, this is not an eroge, or erotic/porn game). Due to it's simplicity the story doesn't drag on nor the dialogues get to long and/or boring, but the way forward is always clear and the player will always know where to go to next and what to do.\n\nBattlesystem too, works very well.  Turnbased battles are fairly easy and don't require you to be on your guard all the time. As the characters level up the will eventually unlock more specials skills and/or spells in tradition RPG manner.\n\nOverall I can recommend The Chosen RPG to  JRPG beginners, casual players and fans of the genre who are looking for a relaxing not too engaging short focused experience. Considering it's price tag and the fact that it is not broken (yes there is a small glitch that lets you fight a boss over and over again, but since this may easily be used for level grinding it isn't really a drawback, nor is it actually game breaking) The Chosen RPG deserves a recommendation. You get what you see advertised in the video and the screenshots!","February 8","true","3.4"," 22 of 46 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","22","46","0","2"

Yes, there are definitely some annoying bugs, and I would love an objective screen and a map, but it never gets to the point where the game is unplayable due to a lacking feature.

Moving slowly in games like this can be tedious.\n• Easy achievements if you're into that (can get all from <3 hours of play)\n\nCons:• The speed bubbles can take some time to open/close if you're impatient like me.\n• There is a minimal glitch that has a flickering screen if you load with full screen, simply toggle between non-fullscreen and fullscreen to fix instantly.\n• Although it does have an open world aspect, the game is still a bit linear in the sense that certain locations can only be entered/opened once achieving something in the storyline.\n• The bosses havent been difficult, although I have ventered into areas seemingly too early and died very easily, which is a harsh punishment as my last save was an hour ago.. But if you face bosses // stages when you're meant to, theyre reasonably easy to beat (some you dont even need to heal)\n\n---\n\nThe game is what you'd expect overall, if it is something you're looking for, then you'd obviously enjoy it.\nDo not expect a massive 40+ RPG because you will not receive it.\nIf you're looking for a simple RPG that will interest you throughout its short-average lifespan, then this is a good buy for sure.\n\n\nHowever, if you're looking to burn a few hours on a decent story that is set up to continue, and support a good game from some indie developers, then give it a go, I know I definitely enjoyed the game and more or less played it through and through :)","February 4","true","3.7"," 47 of 99 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","47","99","5","21"

This game is worth far more than the full price of 2.19 and will no doubt become the new best seller like Bad Rats.

The game itself is really fun and I like how you can travel using a boat to go to different places or environments, whatever you call them. I'd recommend using a controller for playing the game since the game really fits well when you use your controller. The game has a gamepad designed for controllers. Also there is one thing that I find really weird about this game. Warning: This is a spoiler of the game! Once you go to the Snow Temple to get the God's Wing and defeat the Ice Queen. There is an exploit that you can kill her again. To do this, finish the conversation with all your four teammates, Edge, Trinity, Serena, and Mystic, once they're done talking. Then you'll see the Ice Queen is still there. When you talk to her, she says the same thing that she would say when you battle her. Then here's the weird part you get to battle her again. I've been doing this exploit for like 30 minutes and pretty much overleved my characters. Normally, my characters were lvl 17 when we faced her. The result after the exploit, my characters were lvl 30. So if you're looking into trying out this method, I'd really recommend doing it if you're having trouble killing bosses like Akuma and the dragon boss.","February 5","true","2.0"," 18 of 41 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","18","41","3","0"

It's actually a pretty decent, if simple, RPG. I got it with a coupon, so I paid something like 70cents. That's pretty good for a game that I got a solid four hours of gameplay out of (my registered time is much higher, I played this mostly during work). The art is nice and the music is fine. Yes, it could do with some more world expanding, but there were a fair amount of enemies and enough 'quests' to keep from getting repetative. The small map was disappointing, but it did pretty well with the limited space. The story was your generic JRPG-style plot, but there's nothing wrong with that.

You will like it if you are into the old school RPG's and can handle anime girls with nipples popping out.  Very simple mechanics and often times unforgiving.\n\nImportant Stuff:\nCan’t remap keyboard, controller is recommended.\nMade with RPG Maker\nMissing many current features found in RPG’s made in the last 2 decades.\nSave Save Save\n\nGood Stuff\nOld school feel and charm\nGood Story\nNo tutorial\n\nBad Stuff\nConfusing at times, example the first quest is to go to the graveyard. The graveyard is a tree on the map.\nNo quest log or helpers\nCombat is very standard 90’s JRPG.\nOverdone anime girls.\nNo auto-saves, I lost 5 levels the first time I died because I only saved once way back at the beginning.\n\nReview\nHop in your time machine and come back to 1995 with me. When RPG’s did not have hour long tutorials and there were no guides on the internet on how to play.  This is the time that The Chosen One is living in.  Is that a bad thing? Well it depends on what you like in your RPG. If you enjoy learning a game by playing it and having to read the text to figure out what to do next, then this is for you. It is rough around the edges in many places. I know I am hilarious, that’s a pun since the main characters name is Edge.  Many people who have never played an old school RPG will feel like it’s missing a lot of key features, which by today’s standards is true.  It also has a lot of little quirks that are annoying but not game breaking. However it does possess a certain charm and so far the story is decent (2 hours in).  It does remind me of ChronoTrigger, which is dear to my heart. With that said my mom would of gave me a very stern look of wtf are you playing if she would of walked in while one of the anime girls were on the screen in this one. I wish they would have just left that out its not needed.

The usual. There'll be half-naked chicks along the way, of course.\n\nGameplay: Standard. Fights consist of a lot of clicking enter. Click, click, click until you win. Sometimes pause and change up your approach because your party is taking too much damage. Then, keep clicking to attack.\n\nYou move with the directional keys, access your menu with x, and interact with things via enter. Not entirely sure if this has gamepad support or not. Anywho, there's random encounters and skills and level progression and items and equipment and.. Well, everything you'd expect when you think "RPG." Not much else from what I've seen.\n\nGraphics: Standard. This is a minor gripe, but the enemy in-battle sprites  look much, much better than the playable and NPC characters' sprites... Not sure why. The graphical differences between you and what you're fighting threw me for a loop at first. The character portraits are nice (and more on par with the enemy splash art), though I'm not entirely sure why the girls are always half dressed. Marketing ploy, I suppose.\n\nSoundtrack: I'm really digging the music. In-battle or out, it's nice. I think this is the game's strongest point.\n\nBottom line: Really, there's not much else I can say about such a generic presentation of a "role playing game." For the price? Sure. Give it a shot. You won't find anything new and interesting here, but it does a servicable job as a standard, generic RPG. And, hey, there's cards :3","February 4","true","1.9"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","8","25","0","0"
