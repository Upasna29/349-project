I really enjoyed it! Anyone who loves animals, the ecosystem and a good, a bit complex and difficult economy/strategy/simulator/magement game to play or have kids and wants to play something on the PC with them should buy this game as soon as possible and buy the whole collection!\nPS: You need to own Wildlife Park 2 to play but for the Missions/Quests  & Different Starting Screen to appear you need to launch the according game icon, for example for Marine World Missions you need to launch Marine World but for Wildlife Park 2 you need to launch Wildlife Park 2. Whatever the case they will both share the animals so you will still have marine world animals in the Sandbox mode of Wildlife Park 2 but not in all the missions of Wildlife Park 2.","October 28, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I like to imagine the fishies as businessmen and the sting rays as mobsters. Makes things more exciting that way.","December 30, 2014","true","0.8"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","14","25","6","0"
