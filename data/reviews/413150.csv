"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bexyish/recommended/413150/","bexyish","Bexy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bexyish/","702 products in account","This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.\n\nFarming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.\n\nFishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\nMining and combat. Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)\n\nSocial. Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.\n\nMain story. The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you "complete" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!\n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.\n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.\n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into "oh no it's time to sleep".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.\n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to "escape" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.","February 28","true","491.3"," 1,968 of 2,041 people (96%) found this review helpful 186 people found this review funny","96","968","2","186","87"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/413150/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\nStardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.\n\nIn essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.\n\nThe freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.\n\nTo date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.\n\n\nPros\nCharacter Customization - Always good, always wanted.\nVisuals - In the style of the SNES. They're colorful detailed and a delight.\nGame Pace - Fast, slow, or somewhere in the middle. It's your call to make.\nContent - There is a lot more to do than I first imagined. There are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline.\nCons\nCombat - It's a tad basic since that isn't the core of the gameplay. A single hack/n slash mechanic\nCitizens - I'd love to see more citizens (even temporary ones during the year) come and go to make the town feel more "alive"\n\nOverall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!","March 8","true","15.4"," 937 of 970 people (97%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","97","937","970","45","20"

It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.\n\nThe progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.\n\nI'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played.","February 26","true","60.6"," 940 of 981 people (96%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","96","940","981","43","29"

The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.\n\nThis game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.\n\nYour farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!\n\nI can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Astrobia/recommended/413150/","Astrobia","Astrobia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Astrobia/","1518 products in account","So this is a fantasy farming town life sim in the ilk of Harvest Moon so rather then beat around the bush, how does it compare?\n\nFarming: On par with Harvest Moon (HM). Some extra details (need for scarecrows, fencing etc.) but it's also missing features like the ability to selectively breed superior levels of crops over multiple generations. There are some balance concerns but being a PC game those can actually be patched.\nLivestock... lacks variety and some complexity but is more realistic in some respects. For example there's no animal taming, just purchasing. Breeding is in but you don't breed better livestock it just replenishes numbers (and is gender blind). Grooming is more detailed but less hands on. The one noteworthy improvement is conceptually allowing and rewarding field rotation.\n\nRelationships: Superior to HM and It's a Fantasy Life (FL), but inferior to Rune Factory (RF). I say superior to HM but really it's about on par in terms of the mechanics but with more romance options (including same sex). It falls behind in terms of character variety, depth and interaction compared to the RF series but updates could easily catch up.\n\n(Note RF improved on the HM formula is pretty much every way so will be comparing primarily to it now)\n\nMining: On par with RF, Behind FL. One area it is behind in both respects is variety of ores divided by regions. Stardew Valley has 2 locations you can really go mining. They have a lot of levels, which are divided into different biomes and there's some RNG in ore availability on any given trip into the mines but it's still overall more simplistic terms of layout and progression. Where it really lags behind is the actual mining interaction. It's just click on the rock, it breaks, RNG loot.\n\nLumberjacking: This ones complicated as it's been mixed with the concept of Foraging. Lumberjacking by itself it close but still behind RF and way behind FL. Foraging also adds features such as getting tree seeds off trees for immediate replanting, finding seasonal wild plants (which you can in turn get seeds for and farm, eliminating the wild foraging once you've completed that seasons set), and at certain times of the year collecting berries. The other titles has these features (coloured grasses and fruit trees etc) but they weren't tied to a skill you could improve. Much room to improve here, especially in terms of the mechanics.\n\nFishing: Ahead of RF, Close but still Behind FL. Something that must immediately be pointed out is fishing difficulty isn't staggered so there's an easy progression curve. Where as in the other games the seasonal fish in the locations you have access to at the start are easy to catch & get harder as you unlock more areas and progress to later seasons, Stardew will throw you in the deep end right at the start before you have any skill. Plus the RNG will throw top level fish at you to kick your butt again & again. Practising the skill and improving equipment alleviates this over time but a lot of people think fishing is impossible starting out as although there are easy fish to catch to start, you aren't directed to them and RNG can still screw you. The mechanics themselves work well once you are on top of them but still more depth that could be added to compare to FL, but otherwise quite good.\n\nCombat: Behind RF and FL. There's no real depth to the combat. 3 noteworthy weapon types (and you'll mostly just use swords) plus bombs (which you wont use in combat), no spells, no special moves (right click does do an alternate thing like block or ground slam, but it's not effective and you will never do it), no companions, no real footwork, just move close and spam attack over and over until enemy dies. The only tactical considerations are more frustration with the controls then strategy. Enemy variety is lacking compared to the others. First 80 levels there's only 3 varieties of enemies, those who passively stand there, ones that charge you (grounded or flying), and ones that charge you but occasionally block (one that burrows to do so). For all the above the strategy is pretty much the same: Maybe dodge, hit them before they hit you, keep hitting. Then they add enemies that shoot at you, same deal. Much room for improvement. That said the RNG nature of the dungeons leaves a lot or potential open for this to be developed further if the dev decided to so.\n\nCrafting: Way behind RF and FL. No weapon/armour crafting at all. Equipment upgrades handled by a shop. Cooking and deco pieces are just click to create. Super simplistic and uninteractive. That said, there is one area of it where it is ahead of both RF and FL.\nDecoration... In addition to the ability to lay fences, paths etc. you get to prepare and place the foundation for additional farm buildings rather then the usual fixed locations when you unlock them. Except your house & greenhouse. You are free to place a large amount of functional and decorative furniture both (craftable & collectable) largely anywhere you want on the farm & to some extent all over the town as well. Doesn't compare with say Ultima, or a Minecraft/Terraria clone (omission intentional) but it's a big step up within this genre.\n\nFestivals: Far behind RF. Once you've seen them once most the time you want to skip festivals in Stardew. They are mostly just low interaction cut scenes that waste your entire day (even when the festival says it will end at 2pm, you'll get home at 10pm, day over). You can't give gifts, go shopping or otherwise really interact with the townsfolk in any meaningful way on most festival days and very few of the festivals will attending offer any kind of benefit. The townsfolk don't really acknowledge your prowess or even if you attended at all or not.\n\nStory: Behind RF & FL. The story is very simple and very lightly applied. The one interesting aspect of it is it seems to make a social commentary on small town independents vs corporate growth culture... But it's doesn't seem to penalise or judge the player regardless of which they favour, it just complements two different playstyles respectively.\nThe plot really boils down to if your characters presence improves the lives of the other townsfolk in any noteworthy fashion over the course of 2 years or not. The hands off approach is great if you don't want the game jamming plot events down your throat while you want to focus on the farming sim, but it means when you are looking for context it is relying entire on the depth of it's character interactions, where it is sadly lacking compared to it's rivals.\nThese aren't shallow characters, but the arcs are short and arbitrary and there is very little individual interaction throughout. Some scripted events are cool but like the festivals the characters have no real self awareness of how they went down after the fact.\n\nCollection: On par or better then RF/FL. Behind Animal Crossing. :-P\nGood potential here. Museum collection will be expanded in updates too.\n\nArt/Music: Subjective but good quality regardless.\n\nOverall: If you are looking for a story based game with more interactive gameplay mechanics It's a Fantasy Life is a better choice. As far as farming sim specifically goes Rune Factory has more depth and still stands as personal best in genre. I haven't mentioned polish until now as although Stardew is behind all competitors this is day 4 since release and there have been no less then 4 patches fixing most major issues and many smaller ones. When you consider this game was made by one person with no production studio to cover exhaustive QA it's unsurprising launch has been a little shaky. But regular patching will fix this. An advantage of a PC release. Do I recommend it? Absolutely. It might not be best in genre but it's a solid entry, has the potential to improve and is definitely already the best on the PC platform and by extension steam.\n\nIf the genre appeals to you, get it. Easily worth the money.","February 29","true","87.9"," 820 of 884 people (93%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","93","820","884","24","25"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/calaeyo/recommended/413150/","calaeyo","calaeyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calaeyo/","49 products in account","I won’t hesitate in saying that I was one of the unfortunate people that had absolutely no idea that Stardew Valley existed prior to its Steam debut. I literally stumbled across an article on PCGamer about the upcoming launch. Within the first paragraph it mentioned something about a comparison to Harvest Moon, and that’s where one of those weird feelings hit me where I stopped everything I was doing and just thought ...is this for real? and the reason I say that is because as a kid I absolutely loved Harvest Moon: Back to Nature. I have a collection of childhood games that I couldn’t and wouldn’t ever forget. Truth be told, the game deserves more recognition then just a comparison. The reason being is that not only is this game better than all my original feelings towards Harvest Moon, but it is easily the best indie game I have ever played.\n\nSome of the core basics, it’s a natural farming simulator at heart. You become the recipient of a small farm located in an area known as Stardew Valley, the farm formerly being owned by the player’s grandfather. The plot of land is overburdened with trees, boulders and weeds, but over time through work & dedication you’re able to clear the fields and begin your farmer’s life. You’ll be tending crops, handling livestock and investigating new ways to generate revenue in order to flourish and to further expand the farm’s buildings & facilities. In other words, you’ll be working long and working hard to reap the rewards. What you put in is ultimately what you will get out in return.\n\nI’ve delayed writing this on several occasions because I wanted to give this game the time it deserves, in doing so I was hoping to be able to weigh up the positives to the negatives and review both sides. To my absolute amazement, this game has no flaws. I am genuinely stunned. I’m close to 100 hours into this and I still have plenty to do, it’s almost like I feel compelled to do everything in the game in a way of saying thank you to the developer. And that’s the next area I wanted to talk about.\n\nA game that sits in the 98% positive bracket, with over 16,000 people giving it a thumbs up – all within the space of 5 weeks... This is a seriously impressive feat. The developers must feel extremely happy with how the game has thrived in its launch… wait, did I say developers? It was just the one person. One person! One damn person. I still can’t quite believe it. One person morphed my kid memories of Harvest Moon into something more beautiful, rewarding & charismatic. Looking at the stats of steams “top rated games” (steamdb.info) Stardew Valley is already sitting at a comfy 11th position. If you were to then modify the readings by filtering it to, say, “popular” games that have made the same amount of likes or more then Stardew Valley (that being 16000 and over) then that makes the game sit in 3rd place... of all the games, ever, in just the time period of 6 weeks. One guy. 10 hours or more a day for the last 4 years. Speechless! It is selling more than the triple AAA games released in the first quarter of 2016. What more can I say!?\n\nI cannot rate this any higher, and hopefully if you haven’t had the opportunity to pick this up yet, this review gives you an incentive to do so. I have never had so much fun from an indie game. It will remain installed & played in my library for a long, long time. I’m looking forward to seeing what updates the game has for the future, and I am waiting in anticipation for the 4-way multiplayer that is soon to be included. On a personal note from me, thank you ConcernedApe for this absolute masterpiece!\n","April 10","true","101.3"," 423 of 435 people (97%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","97","423","435","19","17"

Obviously you can see that from the 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews here on Steam, so I will keep this short and try to focus on negatives and things you may overlook in general.\n\nStardew Valley is what PC gamers have been looking for to scratch that Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing itch. If you like that type of gameplay, just buy this. Don't overthink it. It does it all, and more. What puts it over-the-top is the customization level and modular building ability a la Minecraft/Terraria style. And oh boy is there depth.\n\nPlus, multiplayer is coming!\n\nPros:\n+I mean this was made by one guy?!?\n+Beautiful artwork that has attention to details. I mean it even changes dramatically with the seasons. Its incredible.\n+Music is absolutely a treat. And once again, changes with the seasons!\n+Controller support works ok (I'm just glad it exists).\n+Character customization (male/female, sliders for colors, your appearance changes with different gear, etc.).\n+You have a large farm to work with. The world in general is a good size. There are 28 NPC's all with their own schedules and agendas. The pixel art for their faces is outstanding.\n+You can have a pet, and get married (I haven't even done anything with the latter, yet).\n+There is mining and fighting monsters, although the fighting is casual and isn't even completely necessary.\n+I could go on and on here really.\n\nCons:\n-*Sometimes* the controller support part *feels* glitchy until you learn how to use it (mainly the part with the right stick). Nine hours in and I'm still figuring out nuances.\n-It would be great if the hotbar were longer so to minimize going into the pause button to juggle things.\n-The bin you put stuff in to sell each night should show all of its contents. Why not allow the player to retract items put in right up until they go to bed? Its not a dumpster, so things don't get 'tainted'.\n\nLong-story-short - this is beyond excellent. I can't get enough. If you like this genre, this is a no brainer.","March 2","true","52.0"," 652 of 696 people (94%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","94","652","696","37","23"

A formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell.\n\nBut there is something Stardew Valley has over Harvest Moon, and that's a heart. The intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable. I sympathized with my character right off the bat. I think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind, and in a funny kind of way, this game does that.\n\nA moment I felt that the game truly had a soul was when I was walking to the mines on a rainy day, when suddenly I was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon Abigail, my romance interest, playing a flute next to the lake. It's a very quiet scene, with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing. After some dialog, my character (who is a silent protagonist by the way) pulls out a mini harp and joins Abby in a duet, something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene. It was a bonding experience, and it felt incredibly real, memorable, and touching. I'll always remember it.\n\nAnd when you realize that there are TEN love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them, man, that's an intimidating amount of content.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't be saying that Harvest Moon doesn't have any heart at all, but when it comes down to it, this is the game that I'm going to remember more fondly in the end. I made memories with Harvest Moon as a child. Now I'm making memories with Stardew Valley as an adult. You should too. The game is worth full price and then some.","March 18","true","117.0"," 493 of 520 people (95%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","95","493","520","29","17"

Somehow I have been able to amass 15 hours in the game already... after 2 days... during a school week... And there seems to be tons left to explore and unlock.\n\nFrom mining, to fishing, to farming, and just exploring and having fun--I always feel like I have something to do, and with the wide variety of things to do, even if I get bored of one activity the other activity is so different that it becomes completely enjoyable again.\n\nThe gameplay is deep. You feel accomplished when you plant and water crops for the first time. You feel excited when you finally get to harvest the crops you've watered every day. Pulling up a big fish is equally satisfying and getting to the next level in the mines is fantastic.\n\nTalking to NPCs isn't particularly exciting as there aren’t gobs of dialogue, but there's still a pleasant amount to keep me wanting to talk. Getting an NPC to like you makes me feel happy though. There could be a bit of polishing in this way, I've noticed a couple of spelling errors in the dialogue and sometimes wish I could know more about a character, but I'm still pleased with what there is.\n\nI've never played Harvest Moon or Rune Factory, which I've heard is what this game was inspired from, so I can't say how similar it is to either, but since this is my first time playing a game like this, it has been awesome not knowing what to expect. But if you've played either game before and liked them I would assume this would be a great updated version for you.\n\nAlso, this game was never in early access and was made by one developer, which is such a pleasant change from what has been.\n\nThe Good and The Bad\nPros\nSimple, diverse, satisfyingly enjoyable gameplay that is hard not to love even after hours\nUnique, lively characters and a beautiful world to explore\nInteresting developments in the story and characters that helps fill in the occasional slow parts of the game.\nA lot of high quality gameplay. Spent 15 hours playing thus far and it seems like I've only scratched the surface.\nBeautiful graphics for a pixel game\nWell suiting music and sound effects that fit well into the mood of the game\nGreat map that might seem small at first but has a lot more depth to it than first thought\nCons\nNPC dialogue could be better in my opinion\nA few very minor bugs that don't affect much but should still be brought up\n*spoiler maybe* You have to replant after each season, causing you to lose any currently planted crops (excluding a couple crops, like corn). It would be nice to know this ahead of time (or at least make it clearer) as it was quite frusturating for me to wake up to all my cauliflower that would have been ready in a few days now wilted... I know this may be obvious to HM players but to players new to the genre like myself, it would be nice if this was mentioned. EDIT: Players now receive a letter two weeks before end of spring stating that this happens. Thank you, dev!\nThe map showing the location of your character needs improvement, as it is now it just gives you a general idea of where you are, which isn't that bad, but I would prefer if it showed the exact location.\nNight lighting could be improved.\nTLDR;\nStardew Valley is an amazing game, and going to go on my list as one of my favorites. Its intuitive, unique gameplay is fresh to see. I would say that it's probably not for everyone, but I think everyone could enjoy at least a part of it. Well worth the $14.99 price tag and excited to see what the developer has in store.","March 1","true","56.6"," 511 of 556 people (92%) found this review helpful 530 people found this review funny","92","511","556","530","12"

It isn't about the 3D graphics that makes this game genre great but rather the gameplay and the amount of content this game comes with. This game is a piece of gem among indie games and I rarely say this when it comes to indies since there is so many. Might not be your cup of tea if you do not enjoy that type of series but then again that is unless you also own a console. If you never tried this series before take a look below or try it. Will be creating a great guide for new players to be the best farmers and to understand the mechanic. Will also update the review as new contents/ multiplayer releases.\n\nVideo Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGjsM6nJYg\n\nPros + The game offers resolutions, bindable keys for keyboard, controller support (Xbox controllers),  and even Rumble support, insane!\n+ 4 seasons of gameplay and years with weather system and natural disaster surprises\n+ Game mechanic is great, 1 min for an hour ingame, energy bar to control what you can do in a day, and a punishment system of losing gold if you tire out, fail to sleep at 2 am, or even lose all your health.  With so much things to do you feel like you never have enough time as an illusion even though you really are playing quite a bit from 6 am to 1 am.\n+ Great music, sound effects, and good looking 2d art which are funny and cute.\n+ Multiple dialog answers to certain people at certain times.\n⦿THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENTS SUCH AS⦿‣Exploration\n-Explore desert, sewers, and a mine which acts as a sort of dungeon with over 80+ floors! while upgrading weapons and a bit of armor killing monsters. Tons of secrets to find and explore\n\n‣Making Money\n+being able to do farming assortments of vegetables during certain seasons and being able to grow trees, take out sap etc so much more\n+Growing a livestocks and being able to benefit from them, LIVESTOCK EMPIRE with chickens and cows\n+Forage items in the forest from woods, stones and plantlife. Just randomly picking up random things\n+ Mining and adventuring to make money is addictive.\n+ Fishing is included which is tough a bit but gets better as you progress\n-+Crafting mechanic in game to craft aesthetics, useful house addons, or even machines and devices that makes life easier which are witty and then being able to place them.\n+ You can cook and be Gordon Ramsay by learning recipes from TV or level it through discovery.\n+ So much questing, helping townspeople and taking request quests from the boards which helps earn some pocketchange and also increase relationship with the people around you besides giving them gifts.\n+ Encounter events that comes with cutscenes with the ability to skip them too if you seen them which is a nice feature for multiple replays.\n+ Being a friend to the local museum and donating to them to great rewards you can also do rewards wait until the community town hall opens for even more rewards!\n\n‣Use of money!? -\n+ Expand your house, have people check your crib when you get your kitchen etc lol.\n+ Upgrading your gears to go in the mines. Shoes, Rings and even Weapons such as daggers, swords, clubs and slingshot.\n+ Upgrading your farm to add various buildings and special buildings for livestocks etc.\n+ Interacting with community and gifting them to progress.\n+ Taking part in minigame festivals that are seasonal and plenty.\n+ Getting married to the bachelors available, whichever sex you want and whoever is available with thier own unique content, choice is yours.\n\nThere are a ton more stuff but I won't spoil them and my words are limited, so limited that I cannot even LIST IT ALL FOR YOU, There are tons of items and special secrets to discover, Plenty. There is always more each time you accomplish something, something else opens up.\nMultiplayer comes later because this was released to let the people enjoy the SINGLE PLAYER. Possible content later on? Hopefully!\n\nCons - The fighting mechanic could definitely be improved on, standing around spamming clicks to swipe enemies can get tedious at times.\n- More emphasis on the pet system, you can only choose dog or cat but after that you don't really do anything with them except ignore them running around the farm. Give them water sometimes but no food.\n- Bugs in the game that can cause entire restarts to your game because of no manual save since the game is newly released.( The dev is fixing it up as they pop up and already has dedicated time into this be warned ahead of time!)\n- Lack of tutorial for new players ( game expected that players recognize the rules from games such as Harvest moon, rune factory, animal crossing etc. (I am working on a super guide for you guys on this)\n- The GUI (interface) could be much better with drag and drop features so you have to click and being careful on not reselling items you bought by mistakes or even pressing escape because you click too fast, I have resold my 50 seed bags by mistakes DOH! or rebought the same gears.\n- Alot of systems can be a bit more in depth later on to add challenge, such as vegetables rotting etc. Would be nice! (not really a con but nice idea to add more challenge)\n\n\n⦿Conclusion⦿These are just some of the things listed in the content becuase that was what important while playing the game, The sheer amount of content created by one person was mind boggling. This game is really special and sometimes it might be or might be your cup of tea but if you take your time and dive into one of the listed content above and really try it out you might be too late for that refund.\n15 bucks for hundreds of hours here and also multiplayer coming later on. You tell me if thats worth the value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/recommended/413150/","GetOutNowDontStayLeave","Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/","605 products in account","Welcome to the "Game of the Year," seriously. This game is honestly the best game I have played in years, like I can't express how much this game is so heartwarming, loving, feels amazing, fun, replayable and the list of adjectives that I could use range on and on and on and on. This game is literally the best game I've played in ages, and if you don't do yourself the pleasure of playing it; at LEAST watch videos on it because this game deserves the most attention and most amount of love towards it!\n\nStarting off with the story, you are an office worker who works for the "Joja Corporation," sitting in front of your PC and rotting away along with the life around you. The amount of people you see in the starting intro who are wasting their lives away is honestly quite depressing and doesn't even match the tone for the game at all. This game uses the form of a "Tonal Shift" which basically starts the game off with such a dark tone, but enlightens it when you get to your bright, vibrant and amazingly joyus farm. The story of the game is that your grandfather gives you an envelope to only open when you need a break from your rural life. Thus the game begins.\n\nYou are introduced to your farm by the lovely Robin. She tells you that the farm looks kinda trashy and laughs at you. She may seem like an evil girl now, but she turns out to be such a lovely girl. Now, whilst I'm talking about the people I think it is a good idea to talk about the townsfolk. I honestly feel such a bond and an actual care between all the villagers and all the people that you encounter. They all seem unique and some of them seem to have such a troubled past and many have dark secrets which may be discovered as you progress through the game.\n\nThis is yet another amazing example of how the game makes you feel like you fit in and bond. You talk to the villagers and have the option to gift them 2 gifts per week, the villager may love it or they may despise it, and will make it quite apparent if they hate it. As you go up the heart scale, you will unlock cutscenes between the villagers and they may send you meal recipes in the mail. Me, myself, I have never fit in well with people. I would be the person in school (and I still am) the person who would get left behind or be forced to walk behind the person in front. Jist of the story, I was never popular. You're probably wondering where I'm going with this; and well, this game has made me feel like I fit in and that I am actually part of a community of people that care about me. It's a heartwarming feeling and makes me feel so happy and just makes me feel a feeling that I've never felt in a video game.\n\nEnough of the sappy stuff, let's talk about the basicness of this game. Yes, the basics. I know the basics of some games may be quite boring but this game just does it. This game starts you off with tools and just lets you live off the land and allows you to remove the trees, rocks and other forageable items which may be lying around your farm. This game is literally your big, fat sandbox and it allows you to do whatever the hell you want to do with it! The game makes me feel like I am free and that the game isn't restraining me to doing anything and isn't stopping me from doing anything. Stardew Valley does an amazing job of letting you feel like this is YOUR house so YOU can do what YOU want. This game is all about you and making you feel like it's your farm and you can do it. I may be sounding repetitive, but I need to enforce that this game is your oyster.\n\nSo, you've probably heard that this game is like a cross between "Harvest Moon" and "Animal Crossing," and it really is. This may sound like it's a bad thing, but if you've played either of those games you'll realise that those games are extremely good and make you feel like you're free and have the ability to do anything. Planting your crops (will get into this soon!) is extremely relaxing and is just such a great time waster. Everything in this game just feels so amazing and is just, I'm at a loss for words without repeating myself.\n\nOnto what it's like to actually plant the crops. Planting crops is a great way of making money in Stardew Valley, be if for your own personal use or be it for money. You use your hoe on the ground to till the land, you then place some sort of seed into the tilled land and then water it. Proceed to water it every morning and soon you will have an amazing, bountiful farm filled with delightful looking crops and more colours than the eyes can make out. You don't have to farm in the game, unless you want to actually follow the basic premise of the game, duh. But there are other alternatives which I cannot for the life of me remember right now.\n\nSo, there's fishing in this game. Are you surprised? Does the word fishing strike fear into your veins due to other games having such dastardly and terrible fishing minigames? Well, release your fear. The fishing minigame in this game is actually bloody brilliant. The fishing minigame is where you control a green bar and keep it on the fish. If you keep it on the fish for a certain amount of time, congrats, you've caught you're first fish (and probably not your last!) If you manage to not keep the green bar off the fish, the bar will decrease and will soon stop the fishing. That is about it. Oh, also, you have a chance to catch a treasure chest which can contain something really good or something, well, something. You can also build "Crab Pots" which can capture unique types of fish (and trash!)\n\nThere's so much in this game that I need to talk about, so I hope you're sitting comfortably and are ready for this to go on and on and on. Onto energy and how that works. Energy is vital in this game, and can sometimes be such a crippling factor in this game. You require energy for literally everything you do. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but I'm saying that you need to make sure that you can manage your energy and ensure that you don't overdo it. Overdoing it will exhaust you and you'll have to go to sleep; if you don't sleep you will fall asleep and someone will leave you into your house. You'll wake up the next day with a letter in the mail telling you that they found you out cold and left you back home.\n\nThe game allows you to experience it at your own pace. If you want to play slow and take each day as it comes, do it. You're allowed. You want to play the game fast and wild? Do it, you're allowed. You want to just play the game and not worry about how or what will happen? Do it, you're allowed. At the end of the day, as I've said before, you can do whatever the hell you want and you are free to do what you want. You are literally the owner of this game and you can do whatever the hell you want. This game is about expressing yourself and letting you be the controller of the game.\n\nStardew Valley has a museum system which allows you to donate your found artifacts and other little gems that you find throughout the game. Finding these things will allow you to get rewards which can decorate your house or unlock a whole new place to visit (OoOOoOoO foreshadowing!) This game rewards you for playing it. It rewards you for being you. It also rewards you in so many ways and just lets you be you. You can also find "Geodes" in the land which the Blacksmith may open up for you for the small price of 25 gold! Within these, you can find things to donate to the museum, or if you want to take the monitary approach to it you can sell the things you get from the Geodes.\n\nFinal words (I ran over the word limit!!!) I adore this game. I adore ConcernedApe. I adore this game and this community.

It really does feel like an old school harvest moon, but brought up to date.  The gameplay is pretty much exactly what you would expect out of this type of game.  The combat is a little wonky but still fun.  The game does kind of chuck you in without much of an explanation, and those are honestly the only two downsides I could give it.\n\nThe pros more than outweigh the cons, I haven't been this hooked on a harvest moon-esque game since the original.  But, to me the largest selling point is the one person developing this game, actually cares.  The first 2 days the game is out, there has already been 4 updates fixing issues everyone asked to be fixed.  The game has been shown an amazing amount of love even after everyone had already paid for it.\n\nA+ Developer, and a lot of fun, all there is to really say about this game.","February 28","true","33.7"," 232 of 242 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","232","242","11","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/413150/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Live out the farming life you’ve secretly always wanted.\nStardew Valley is a farming and social simulator developed by ConcernedApe. In Stardew, you decide to quit your boring job in the city to move out to a farm you recently inherited from you grandfather, just outside Pelican Town. The farm has been overrun by nature after it being left empty and unloved for many years, your job is to turn it around and start making money out of it. You’re not alone in Pelican Town and you’ll meet many of the townspeople in the first few days, Pelican Town rarely sees new people moving in so it’s a big deal when you turn up.\n\nI’ve never played any of the games Stardew is compared to, Harvest Moon and the like, and so I took a bit of a gamble when I bought this game. Thankfully I was not disappointed and after playing twenty-five hours in just four days with no sign of stopping anytime soon I couldn’t be happier with this game. The game does throw you in at the deep end though so the official wiki is probably going to be your new best friend: http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki\n\nThe visuals of the game are similar to Terraria and Starbound but that’s where the similarities stop. Anyway, it’s a great looking game if you’re a fan of pixel graphics but even if you’re not, you shouldn’t write the game off. Everything in the game is well designed and fits in nicely with the style, it’s also a very colourful game making all the nicer to look at.\n\nSo, as you’d imagine, the main gameplay comes from farming. Each of the four seasons (which consist of twenty-eight days each) see a wide variety of different crops and flowers available for you to grow and you’ll be planting most of your crop at the beginning of the season. Some crops, like parsnips or melons, can only be harvested once before you’ll need to plant them with new seeds while others, such as corn and cranberries, will continue to produce fruit/vegetables for the rest of the season. Once the season ends, crops specific to that season will die and you’ll have to clear them away before planting new crops. You will want to plant a variety of crops, mainly for the Community Center bundles (more on that later) but it’s worth remembering that the more expensive the seeds are, the more valuable the end product will be. There are also fertilizers you can use before planting your crops which will increase the chance of high quality crops (you have basic, silver star (more valuable) and gold star crops (considerably more valuable)) as well as fertilizer that increases growth speed. It doesn’t end with planting them though, you’ll need to look after your crops by watering them each day (unless it’s raining in which case you don’t need to) as well as building scarecrows to keep crows away. You can also harvest or make artisan goods, such as honey or maple syrup which is done through special machines that you’ll need to unlock and then build.\n\nUnlocks come with levelling up your five skills. Every time you increase a skill (skills are increased by simply using the skill so, for example, your fishing skill is increased by fishing) you’ll unlock new machines to build as well as increase your proficiency in that skill. Once you hit level five and level ten, instead of unlocking something to build, you choose a profession which will boost a certain area of that skill such as 10% faster crop growth for farming or +1 ore per vein for mining.\n\nSpeaking of mining, there are other things to do in Stardew. Mining, fishing and foraging are the main alternatives to farming but there’s also social things to do as well as restoring the Community Center. The first three are pretty self-explanatory but I’ll briefly talk about fishing. Fishing is the main part of the game argued about in the forums, personally I really like the fishing mini-game but many don’t. It consists of trying to keep a green bar behind a moving fish icon and for larger fish it can be quite challenging. However, as you increase your fishing skill and you yourself get more used to the mini-game it does become quite fun and a little less challenging, it’s also a great way to earn extra money when your farming chores are complete. The social side of things mainly consists of doing little quests for other characters, such as catching a certain fish for Gus (the Saloon owner) to use in a new recipe, but you can also give gifts to other characters to make you like them more. Giving enough gifts to one of the ten bachelors/bachelorettes in the game to get to ten hearts will let you propose to and then marry them, opening you up to the possibility of having kids in the game. The last thing here is the Community Center. The Community Center has long since fallen in to disrepair and once the Mayor unlocks the door for you you’ll be able to start building it back up by completing bundles of items. Each room has several different bundles for you to complete, completing each bundle will unlock a small reward and completing all the bundles for a given room unlocks a big reward, such as fixing mine carts which can be used for fast travel from three locations. The bundles are mainly for four items though some only require two and other require five.\n\nThe last big thing to touch on is house upgrades and livestock. There are two house upgrades that you can buy which will make your house bigger as well as unlock something new to do, the first upgrade is a kitchen which means you can cook food and the second upgrade adds child beds to your room which you’ll need if you want kids. To purchase these you’ll need a fair amount of gold as well as a specific amount of resources which the carpenter will ask for. You can also pay the carpenter to build you what you’ll need for keeping livestock, ranging from chickens in a coop to cows in a barn. Keeping livestock seems to be a lot more work for a lot less gain than farming crops but you can still get goods from the during winter while you can’t grow anything during winter (unless you’ve repaired the greenhouse through the Community Center). It is also possible to sells the livestock for a profit if you get them up to five hearts but I haven’t figured out how to do that yet.\n\nFinally, the save system. The game automatically saves when you go to bed at the end of each day and there’s no way to manually save. This is another thing a lot of people have complained about, it also happens to be what makes the game so damn addictive. I often find myself doing a couple of things in the morning of a day before I turn the game off before realising that I’ll have to finish the day to save my progress. Since the first thing you’ll do each morning is chores you’ll find yourself, like I have several times, playing the rest of the day just so you don’t lose that progress. It can be frustrating if you need to go and don’t have time to finish off a day but it’s a clever way to keep players playing the game.\n\nVerdict\nStardew Valley offers players an incredibly relaxing and enjoyable experience through its farming simulator style gameplay, though there is more to it than that. Whether you’re a fan of similar games or you just want to try something new, I cannot recommend Stardew Valley enough!\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","March 3","true","51.9"," 273 of 297 people (92%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","92","273","297","14","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frithra/recommended/413150/","frithra","Frith Ra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frithra/","148 products in account","First a couple of admissions. This game gets compared a lot to the Harvest Moon series which I have never personally played. Couple that with the fact that I have also never played a farming sim before and this is pretty much as pure of an opinion on the game itself as you can possibly get.\n\nNow to the point. Stardew Valley is incredibly fun and has managed to hold my interest so much that I'm playing as much as I can lately. There is a bit of a learning curve if you are not familiar with anything from the Harvest Moon series. Friends I know who have played that series and then Stardew Valley clued me into a lot of little things I didn't know about and likely wouldn't have figured out until I read about it somewhere later. But what makes this game even more impressive to me is how a single dev took so much inspiration from something he clearly loved, mixed in loads of player feedback, and built something truely special. I wish I had been one of the people that learned about this game early on so I could have watched it grow (no pun intended).\n\nI also can't help but love the retro art style of classic RPGs, yet with the modern polish and bright colors that make it stand out as still being something new. I can't help but wonder if Chucklefish helped Concerned Ape out with some of that considering how much it reminds me of the art style used in their game Starbound. But either way it's got a surprisingly good level of detail to it with lots of character. As far as how the game plays, I found myself loving the simple yet challenging approach of levelling your five core skills and learning the best techniques to maximize the efficiency and profits of your farm. You start off struggling to make everything work in that first year and by your second you really start to feel like you know what to do now.\n\nThe story is also simple but with a lot of charm. Even though Pelican Town is small it always feels like there is something new to discover about the people who live there. While it can take a lot of time and effort to befriend everyone it becomes worth it to see how they all interact together and how much of an impact your character can make in their lives. It's the ultimate expression of a lively small-town community and looking out for your fellow man. Something I think a lot of us lose sight of sometimes in this digital age. But let's not forget the symbol of modern change that takes form in Joja Corporation, a megacorporation looking to monopolize Pelican Town. You can either decide to help them out (for a price) and increase the town's reliance on Joja Corp, or instead work to restore the town's community center and promote local business and interaction, declining Joja further business opportunity in the area. It's a powerful underlying message to the whole game and something many can feel passionate about one way or the other.\n\nLastly I need to mention the price. For all the hours I've sunk into this game already and will likely continue to add in the future, the $15 price tag feels like a steal. I can't help but highly recommend this game at full price because if you are a fan of this type of sandbox RPG farming sim you will easily justify the cost twice over. I actually bought the game for a friend because it was affordable and something I could recommend to anyone and I knew my friend would enjoy it. While I'm sure it's bound to end up on sale when the initial hype dies down, please don't be someone that waits specifically for that to happen. This game is worth every cent and doesn't cost any more than a month of game time for any MMO out there. If you are sincerely interested and have the money, don't wait.\n\nTL;DR: This game is freaking amazing and you should get it.","March 11","true","119.1"," 196 of 204 people (96%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","96","196","204","16","7"

Boy, am I glad I did. The first time I played it was for around 10 hours straight and I only stopped to sleep.\nIf you're a Harvest Moon/Rune Factory fan then I can't see you not liking the game as it has everything those games had and more. 28 main town NPC's for all your relationship building needs, a HUGE farm (I'm not kidding, it's massive) for all your crops (and there are loads), as many coops and barns as you want for your fuzzy little animals and so. much. crafting. Also, mining, fishing, festivals, random events, casual monster combat, minigames and so much more. Also, Multiplayer is coming!!! I'm 50 hours in an I'm showing no signs of stopping.\n\nThe fact that this was made by one person should also be noted. There was no Early Access bullcrap. No endless Alpha/Beta, just the game which I'm glad of. Any bugs that have been found have been quickly patched and the dev is STILL part of the community and still listens to the ideas of his fans.\nI personally can't find many reasons to fault the game. There have been bugs but so far I only encountered one and didn't lose more than ten minutes play in reloading which wasn't much hassle to me but I can see how it could annoy some people.\n\nSo if you like this genre, just go for it. Stardew Valley is ConcernedApe's love-letter to Harvest Moon, and it's one worth reading.","March 2","true","70.1"," 186 of 197 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","186","197","9","1"

That's not very helpful. I never played Harvest Moon. I never heard of Harvest Moon (unti this game came along). I was playing computer games when it came out but the SNES was never my cup 'o tea. If you're like me, this is the review for you.\n\nWithout knowing what Harvest Moon is, I'm coming into Stardew Valley with a fresh set of eyes. And what these eyes have beheld is pretty magical. The one word I'd use to describe Stardew Valley is enchanting. The game play revolves around building up your farm, fighting / mining in the mines, fishing and bribing the townspeople to like you. It frankly doesn't sound like much but it's much more than the sum of its parts.\n\nFirst of all, the farming is deep and entertaining. There are many crops to sow, groves to plant, animals, sap and a host of artisan-type improvements to your basic ingredients. There's simply so much to do here it's tough to see it all. And if you're creative, you can construct some beautiful farms so they are visually pleasing along with productive. It's not easy though - you need to slowly clear your farm, build up your money for seeds and you'll need raw ingredients from elsewhere (mainly mining) to truly become productive and self-sustaining.\n\nOther areas are simple but rewarding. Mining doesn't sound like fun, but each level of the mines brings new challenges and rewards. Fishing can be challenging and even frustrating but as your character levels that skill you'll find you're able to haul in even the most challenging catches. It doesn't seem like the Valley is very large but as you complete challenges in the Community Center new areas will open up, each with it's own unique style and bonuses. You'll forage through the landscape and acquire more resources that way.\n\nThe townspeople deserve their own mention. They seem like they're the standard tropes - the jock, the vain girl, etc. - but as you get to know them you'll find they're unique characters and somewhat memorable. The villagers have their own schedules and you'll have to work around those schedules to get what you want.\n\nAs for downsides, probably the most annoying thing is this "bribe people to be my friends" aspect. I'm not a fan of the limitations and I'm not a fan of the message that sends. But that's a minor problem with what is just a great, fun, relaxing and entertaining game. I'd recommend this game for people from 8 to 80 (I'm on the older side of that scale). It's simply a wonderful product.","March 19","true","100.6"," 190 of 214 people (89%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","89","190","214","22","0"

The art and pixel style threw me for a loop, and while I loved Harvest Moon style games and Rune Factory 4, I wasn't too sure about spending money on this game. I've been burned before and I was wary of trying it. It was about... I think a day of or after the release and I noticed it had a small sale and I figured, "Well, I just got paid, and it might be a good distraction until I find another game to play."\n\n...So, uhm. You might have noticed I have 71 hours of playtime. So I figured I'd better write my thoughts on why I love this game.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nEveryone knows that what helps make a game great is the music it has. I was immediatly sucked in by the music, it reminded me so much of the Harvest Moon games I played that had such amazing music! If there was a soundtrack available (maybe there is) I would be willing to drop money on it.\n\nControls: 7/10\nThe controls of the game are not the worse I've encountered, but I feel it could be improved a bit. Honestly, if I hadn't found the control options this would have had a 5/10 review instead. The 'show tool hit location' was not automatically selected so it led to some frustrating moments just trying to till the ground. The combat was a bit frustrating since you had to turn your character in order to swing the sword in the exact direction it has to go in, but after some practice I've ironed out the kinks.\n\nStoryline: 12/10\nOh my god guys. This, this right here helps make the game for me. Its honestly what I have been sorely missing in other farming games like Harvest Moon. Its not just "till the land, plant the seeds, make the cash." No, this is much more then that. I would love to go into detail, but I don't want to give anything away to people who want to come in blind.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\nThese loveable characters have their own flushed out hopes, fears, and dreams. They have their strengths, their weaknesses, and their own personality. Not one character is the same, their life experiences make them what they are and their background helped shaped them. But at the same time they grow, they adapt, they change. The more you interact with them the more impact you have on their lives. Its amazing.\n\nCharacter Customization: 10/10\nWhat many Harvest Moon games lacked until recently was being able to customize your farmer. However Stardew has by far the best I have seen. Around 30 different hair styles, over 100 different shirts to chose from, skin color, eye color and hair color. You want to make yourself look like the hulk? Get your green on and hulk up for some farming! Want to be a vampire? A demon? You can be anything!\n\nI would add more but honestly I am a little under the weather as I'm writing this and I'm rapidly running out of energy. So a last few tid-bits for you guys and gals considering this game.\n\nThis game does not end in an XX amount of years. You can keep playing for as long as you want.\n\nIt doesn't matter what gender you are, you can romance ANY of the 10 available. Are you a gal that likes other gals? Yep, you can woo, date, and marry them! Are you a dude that wants to smooch, woo, and marry other dudes? You can do that too! Guess what else you can do? If you're unable to have kids the traditional way you can ADOPT! You can have a family! Or if you don't want a kid you don't have to have one (at least, I'm pretty sure you don't have to).\n\nAll in all, 9/10 game that I plan on playing for a very long time!","March 7","true","391.0"," 131 of 137 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","131","137","13","0"

Swords! Killings! Murder spree!\nGreat original soundtrack.\nCostumise your farm layout - we're talking about barns, coops, stable and not just crop plot location! Unlike Harvest Moon, you can choose where you build the mentioned buildings so your farm is more personalised. Not to mention the different flooring and wallpaper you can choose for your house.\nUnconventional livestock. A fan of mallard ducks (yes, the meme)? Cute bunnies? Truffle-finding pigs? Sure, the game has it all! And no, no bacon, sorry peeps!\nCrafting system. A D.I.Y mechanism that positively encourages you to be creative and not lazy. Need those precious bee house, scarecrow, keg, furnace? Go and build them yourself!\nLet your livestock graze outside and feed on fresh, luscious grasses. It will make your farm look nicer and it's a win-win situation (happy animals and happy you, since you don't have to have to feed them hay).\nPersonalised play style. There are skills in the game (i.e. farming, mining, foraging, fishing and combat) that you can level up, so you can focus on particular skill(s) if you are interested in it/them. Plus, it gives you *secret* perks when you reach certain levels.\nThe Baddies\nMain character's movement and animation sometimes feel clunky.\nSome would argue ethat the character's movement is too slow, and factually moves slower when you walk/run diagonally.\nVery minimum quest direction, which can make it harder for players to notice that they have to go / do / have a certain thing to trigger the quest event reaction.\nThe Uglies\nLike similar themed game, Stardew can be tedious (especially in the beginning), repetitive and even frustrating at times. But it does not take away the fun!\nThe 'assumed knowledge' game is strong with this one. A large proportion of behaviours in the game follow Harvest Moon system (for instance, seasonal crops wilting when the season ends, talking to people/animals increase the affection meter and the only save point being when your character goes to sleep).\nThis is NOT a negative feature, but it does make it a tad more difficult for new players to pick these things up. Worry not though, you'll still have fun and you can always look up information anyway!\nThis is just an odd thing to see, but none of the building has an increased exterior size when you upgrade them, when it obviously gets more spacious inside.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/413150/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Stardew Valley is an indie farming simulator game releasing on PC in February 2016. The game was developed by ConcernedApe, and published by Chucklefish Games.\n\nStardew Valley is heavily influenced by the Harvest Moon series. At the start of the game, you are left a plot of land by your grandfather. When you arrive at this land, you will find it overrun with weeds, trees and rocks. Your aim is to clear this area and restart a farm that will make you money. There is a heavy focus on character interaction too. Allowing you to converse with plenty of NPCs around the town and develop relationships which can sometimes result in marriage. This has benefits to your farm as the NPC will also help out around the plot too.  As you grow your farm day by day, you will unlock new ways to generate money, whether it is from simply growing crops in the fields, selling fish, or your livestock. The game also has a questing system which will also generate extra revenue for you as well.\n\nThe game’s day night circle is really a key feature in the game too. You will soon realize that there are just not enough hours in the day to get everything done. Not only are you battling against time, but you are also up against an energy meter too. I wasn’t that keen on the energy meter because literally everything you do burns the meter down fairly quickly. When you start out the game and are just clearing away weeks, you will perhaps get 5 minutes’ worth of clearing done before your character is out of energy and has to go to bed in order to regain it. You can regain your energy in other ways but the conventional way is just to head to bed and wait until the next morning.  The game’s fishing system is also a little cumbersome too, it’s a small mini game when you head out to the waters to catch some fish; I personally found this a little too unforgiving but some may find the difficulty on the fishing feature to be a nice addition rather than just pointing and clicking.\n\nNormally I am not a fan of this style of graphics, but Stardew Valley has just the right amount of character to make this work for me. The game’s vibrant colours and beautiful sprites just make everything click together. It really does remind you of the Harvest Moon series of games, but has its own unique charm to go along with it.  The sound track for this game is also exquisite too, so much so that you can purchase the sound track individually too. The game’s ambiance sounds are wonderful too. This is one of the few games where I think not having voice acting worked in its favour, because if it had been done wrong, it could of spoilt the whole game for me.\n\nThis isn’t a hard game as such; it is just a time management game, and a waiting game for the majority of the time. You can get yourself in a situation where your farm will almost fail like I did; spending all my money on seeds, planting them, and then a storm coming over night and ruining them all, resulting in me not having enough money to buy more seeds. That is the hardest moment I have found in the game, building you up again after a really big knock back. But if you are happy to put the work in, you will succeed with flying colours in this game.\n\nI have been playing Stardew for a little under 20 hours so far. I have been primarily focusing on building up my farm and growing my empire; I have yet to touch many of the quests and NPC interactions with plenty of content still to see, I anticipate at least another 15 hours or so before I grow (no pun intended) of this game. What I am most excited about is the possibility of a four player co-op mode being released. This will make the game an absolutely epic experience in my opinion.\n\nTechnically, as expected the game runs perfectly fine, with 60 FPs 100% of the time. The game has full controller support, but I found playing with keyboard/mouse to be better in this instance. There is a fairly comprehensible menu with lots of options to change should you choose.  I will give the devs props here; they are a very active community member with plenty of hotfixes being released, not to mention the mod scene is increasingly becoming more and more popular with this game.\n\nStardew Valley is a game that you will either love or hate. If you go into this game expecting plenty of action and fast paced game play, you will be disappointed. If you want a peaceful, slow paced experience, then you will definitely want this game in your library.  There were times that I was sometimes just playing mindlessly and the thought of “am I actually having fun here?” kept popping into my head, and sometimes the answer was no, to which I quit the game, but low and behold, 10 minutes later I felt my self-compelled to load it up again just to farm that one last batch of crops I have growing. It is a very additive game that kept me coming back for more and more every time.  At the moment I am going to highly recommend Stardew Valley; if the devs follow through on the multiplayer addition, that will quite possibly tip it towards the must play side of the scale.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Can you ever finish the game?  Would you ever want to?  For reasons that are hard to explain, this is one of the best games I've ever played.\nThis title is about nothing except escapism.  You will trade your life, ideally on a temporary basis, for the life of your self-designed character in Stardew Valley.  In the game, you escape your boring cubicle job to live a simpler life as a farmer in a close community that is struggling to stay relevant in an increasingly conglomerate-dominated western society.  The game manages to argue an anti-corporate-America "Wal-Mart is bad, but not inherently evil" agenda in such a real way that is impossible to ignore; all the while providing you the opportunity to choose for yourself; and unabashedly encouraging you to embrace capitalism to maximize the value of your labor and intellect.  The game succeeds in this alternative reality in much the same way The Sims captured so many gamers' hearts.  In Stardew it seems you are able to achieve things that perhaps you cannot achieve in real life.  However, you will leave the game feeling happy, uplifted, and hopeful.\n\nBeneath this existentialism is a day-to-day deluge of strangely addicting activities.  Mine, farm, make friends, help the community, cook, craft equipment, manage your finances, fish (oh how I love to fish), forage, ranch, etc, etc....  By providing more structure, than say Minecraft's survival mode, the game succeeds in guiding us something much more fulfilling.\n\nThe aesthetic, think of it as an improved 16-bit Legend of Zelda, you will soak it in.  It is my phone's background.  You will learn to love the bright colors and simple sprites while despising the grittiness of real life.  The music, it's so simple it should drive you mad, but it's so happy it will soothe your soul.\n\nReading discussions, you will hear of gamers who are self-treating their anxiety, depression, mental illnesses.  There is something very special about this game.  There is something very important about this game.  It will brighten your days and provide you with a measure of joy.  The saddest part is, I feel like I might be ready to move on.....","May 8","true","99.7"," 127 of 135 people (94%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","94","127","135","16","2"

Also it unlocks things later on I think, and you get free goodies for doing it.  But if you side with Joja mart they will tear it down to build a warehouse.\nMini-Quests (check the postings outside the town store for reqeuests villagers have, like fetch me a radish, or kill 6 slimes in the mines, etc.  You get gold for these and the villagers will like you more.  2 day time limit, though.)\n\nOh, and you get either a dog or cat, but they don't anything productive, just wander around and sleep.\n\nNow that you know what you CAN do, I'll tell you what you HAVE TO do.  Which is nothing!  No time limit.  No pressure.  Well, sure you should grow crops in the beginning so you have money, but you don't have to socialize and marry if you don't want to.  You don't have to forage or fish or mine.  Do whatever you want, whenever you want.  Though you don't get all the blueprints of everything you can bulid until you level up to certain levels.  It's not like Terraria where you can build whatever as long as you have the materials.  You could have the materials but not the blueprint yet so you can't craft it.\n\nI think the key addicting thing about this game is the save point.  It only saves at night while your character sleeps.  You can't save whenever you want.  Which is good if a day is going badly, just back out and start that day over.  But bad for getting sleep in real life.  "Oh, I'll just take a peek outside my house and see how my crops are doing."  And I end up playing another day....and then another...!  The time of day moves quickly.  It takes a hour just for me to run down to the beach looking for stuff that washed up then over to the little plank bridge area for those pink things and back to town.  Shops close at 4 or 5pm so it's a race to get where you want and still forage along the way.  If you stay up past 1am you faint and lose some money or items or something.  I try not to have that happen.\n\nThe artwork is very detailed.  Check out the inside of some of the houses: posters on the kid's walls, different furniture and wallpaper in the living room. Trees, plants, flowers are beautiful in all seasons.\n\nMusic is pleasant but does not distract.  Honestly I don't hear it much of the time because I'm concentrating on what I'm doing.\n\nPrice is right.  You get a lot for your money.  The replayability is huge.   Choose this girl to marry this time, choose a different one in another playthrough.  Or be single.  Choose to rebuild the Community Center in one playthrough, go the JoJa route in another.\n\nHighly recommended.  There's something for everyone in this game (unless you hate 2d games to begin with).  Parental warning: so far there's only been one questionable thing if you want your kids to play.  There is a slight reference to someone having an affair with a married person.  You're asked to find something and that item is in another person's room!  Oh gee, how did that get there?!  So far that's the only thing, other than the gay thing, that parents might be leery of for their young children to play this game.\n\n**** Addendum ****\n\nOver 200 hours into this game now.  Feels like 50.  I swear this isn't a game at all.  It's actually a space/time bubble trap built into the game to make time in the real world move faster. So you think you've only been playing for a little while but actually it's been hours, and you realize your throat is parched because you ran out of drink and couldn't tear yourself away from the game to get a refill, and also you realize you're about to pee your pants.\n\nThis game is the first thing I think of when I wake up.  Before I even get out of bed I'm going over a mental checklist of things to do.  Even worse, I get confused about what day it is in real life, and even what month, what season.  I see things in real life that remind me of the game, like a patch of tall grass and I'm like "Oooh, I gotta switch to my scythe and cut that stuff down".  Then a second later, "Oh, wait, that's in the game, and I'm in real life."   Or on Friday I think "I gotta visit the Travelling Merchant some time today" and then "Oh, wait, that's in the game".\n\nBottom Line, tl;dr version:  Run, don't walk, RUN AWAY!!!  As fast as you can before you too get sucked in and it's too late.  A black hole's got nothing on this game.","March 3","true","377.0"," 125 of 139 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","125","139","4","3"

It's an addictive, creative, relaxing, and absolutely fantastic experience with a lovely, uplifting and rich atmosphere. It seems simple at first, but it surprises you with its depth (especially that of the characters' personalities and personal histories). It's so much fun and very easy to sink many hours into, and for good reason!\n\nIt offers a colorful world populated with heartwarming moments, fun gameplay mechanics and surprisingly endearing and adorable townsfolk (who become even more interesting if you take the time to get to know them, which offers a needed break from the routine of farming sometimes). While it's a bit rough around the edges (a few bugs here and there, it feels a bit aimless after Year 2), it's hard to believe this game was developed by just one person! That's quite an achievement. The attention to detail is pretty impressive and I hope we'll see more from this develper soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydrogens/recommended/413150/","hydrogens","tulkas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydrogens/","316 products in account","Do you remember harvesting carrots in 1997? The glow of SNES Harvest Moon on a Yamaha tube television warmed your face as you toiled under a friendly Spring sun. Behind you in the kitchen, your parents exchanged urgent whispers -- you couldn't catch much, but it was hard to miss "When do we tell him?" and "It's treatable," amidst your mother's tears.\n\nYou got a Gameboy that Christmas, which proved a welcome companion to every roadtrip in your family's faded red minivan. Harvest Moon GBC allowed you to keep harvesting carrots and picking flowers throughout 1998, the hum of wind against the passenger side window accompanying the game's serene soundtrack as you were driven around town to various doctor's offices and radiation treatments (which your mom promised wouldn't turn her into a lizard-person, even though you thought that would be okay. Lizards were strong, and their tails grew back -- what was wrong with that?)\n\nIn 1999 you got a Nintendo 64. You tried hard to smile when you opened it, even though you didn't feel that happy. Your mom wore wigs now, and even though you still thought she was beautiful she always disagreed when you or your dad told her so. Somehow, petting a cow and harvesting more carrots made you feel a little bit better about it all.\n\nIn 2003, you graduated high school. Your mom was too sick to attend the ceremony, but you knew she was proud of you. You unwrapped your graduation gift on the foot of her hospital bed, inside lay a used Gameboy Advance and Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town. You spend the rest of the night crying under your bedside lamp and planting carrots. College and all the changes it brings is only one season away -- but at this point, you figure more change can't possibly be bad.\n\nWorking your way through college, you graduate in 2008 -- a semester late, and a delay which you chalk up to life's constant ability to surprise us. Who could've guessed that your hand-me-down minivan would need a new transmission and new brakes just two weeks apart? Despite all the challenges, you graduate with honors. After the procession, you find your father waiting for you in the parking lot. He gives you a big hug and makes a joke about how today is the last day anyone in your family can wear a dress in public. Even though it's a graduation gown, not a dress, you humor him with a chuckle.\n\nOnce you get home, Dad slips you a small box adorned with red string tied clumsily in a bow. "It's not much, but it's all--" you cut him off, assuring him it's perfect. You don't even have a Nintendo DS, but you find one listed cheaply on Craigslist and agree to meet the seller in the parking lot of the local Dairy Queen. You bring the gifted copy of Harvest Moon DS: Island of Happiness along with you, so you can make sure the console works fine -- which it does.\n\nThree hours later, you realize you're still in the parking lot of Dairy Queen -- choking back tears as you struggle against the game's poor implementation of the stylus and sluggish movement speed. Maybe you were wrong, maybe more change meant things getting worse and not better. You shove the DS into the glove compartment where it rattles for the entire drive home.\n\nOver the next 8 years, life continues to surprise you. You meet a girl in the lobby of your office building. You offer to share your homecooked lunch with her the next day if she shares her homemade apple pie today. She reluctantly agrees. Two years go by, you give her plenty of flowers and take her on plenty of dates. You ask her to marry you. Again, she reluctantly agrees.\n\nYou find a new place and move in together. Your old red minivan dies and you buy a new car together (well, the car was used -- but it was still new to you.) You get a promotion. She quits her job. You start a garden in your backyard to spend more time together on weekends. She buys twelve types of herbs for her side. You plant carrots. Lots of carrots.\n\n\nBefore you know it, it's 2016. Your daughter just celebrated her third birthday. She finally fits into the blue dress Grandpa gave her for Christmas -- you send him a picture of her wearing it with a message that reads "Looks like I won't be the only one wearing dresses in the family anymore." He responds, "What?" -- but you call him to remind him of your conversation back after your college graduation and he laughs. You swap fond memories of mom til your wife appears in the doorway to ask you for help tucking Lucy into bed. After reading a bedtime story, you decide to hop on Steam and play something before you hit the hay yourself.\n\nStardew Valley pops up on the front page. You buy it on a whim and start a new game. The screen fades in on a sickly family member lying in bed, handing you one final gift before they depart. That gift is a deed to an old farm and a new life. You take a survey of the land and begin farming, exploring caves, and harvesting carrots. It's as if Harvest Moon has changed again, only this time for the better. As you toil under the Spring sun once again, you finally feel at home.","February 28","true","63.2"," 71 of 73 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","71","73","9","11"

There's not a single track that I haven't enjoyed so far and a lot of it is very remniscent of an older era of SNES games.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure if I would enjoy npcs in this game but they really have a way of growing on you even if a lot of their personalities can be slightly offputting at first.\n\nThe entire game has a way of drawing you in and not allowing you to set it down. There are alot of things you can do even if you don't neccessarily want to focus on farming/ranching. Alternatively there is a lot of fishing and an entire mine you can explore.\n\nI've played about 100 some hours as I'm editing this review and I still haven't done everything there is to do in the game.\n\nI would highly reccomend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/413150/","rankmenotplz","ReadingLies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/","2044 products in account","Introduction\nAt first glance it might look like a simple 2D clone of Harvest Moon, but the game gives more than meets the eye. As someone who has been immersed with the gameplay for almost a week now, the only thing that I could say is to bid farewell to your personal life and have fun.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe game starts off with you talking to your grandfather and him handing over a letter that will give you the chance to change your lifestyle in the future if you ever so desire.\nYears later on, you are living in the city and working as an employee of a grand corporation named "Joja Corporation", but feeling empty inside. That was then when you remembered what your grandfather left you and took the chance to start a new life with nature.\n\nWelcome to Stardew Valley!\n\nIn this game, you play as a village farmer who inherited the land from your grandfather. After the introduction, you will also start with the basic version of tools that you need for growing and maintaining your farm (which can be upgraded with the required items and money through the town's blacksmith) and some cash to purchase the things you need (which is basically money to buy seeds).\n\nEach season will cycle on a 28-day basis, which also has you limited on the crops that you can sow and harvest (aside when growing them inside the greenhouse). Weather also changes depending on the prediction from the forecast which will help you on planning the tasks you need to do as the game progresses.\n\nAside from the farm, you can also interact with the other villagers (NPCs) by either helping them out from a certain request or by giving them gifts, which will help you in befriending them or even be intimate (only for those who have the [single] word below their icon on your list) if your relationship level is high enough.\n\nBut not only that! You can also fish, mine ores, find and donate artifacts, raise farm animals, turn your crops or goods into products, forage fruits and flowers, or even explore dangerous caverns and mines and become a true adventurer!\n\n\nThe Pros\nTons of Content - There are tons of things to work on this game aside from farming. May it be socializing with other people, fishing, excavating and exploring the mines, etc. This attribute pretty much sums up most of the great things this game as to offer, which also contributes to the second factor.\n\n\nImmersive Gameplay - I am not really certain which feature is the most prominent factor that makes this game addicting, but I am confident to declare that each and every single one of them works in harmony to bring out the best for its players.\n\n\nGreat Audio - The soundtracks made for this game really fits the theme of each and every scenario it has to offer. Not only the soundtracks but also the ambience effects really make up the feel as a whole. The sound of the animals, the rustling of the plants, and flow of the water are just some to enumerate.\n\nThe Cons\nMinor Bugs and Game Errors - Though it might not be game-breaking, the game still has a fair amount of bugs and errors that could be a point to improve on. Some of the bugs that I have encountered are showcased on my screenshots so feel free to check it when you have the time.\n\nToo Immersive Gameplay - You might think that this portion is a joke, but I am dead serious about this. For someone who works on a daily basis, I really don't have the leisure of playing games like before when I was still studying. I already spent my leaves for this month and cancelled a few meetings with friends and colleagues, and I am expecting worse to come. This game WILL take your TIME and if you don't have the WILL to sacrifice it, then at least stay away until you have some kind of long vacation.\n\nRepetitiveness - This is most likely the nemesis of every simulation game. After every year, there will be small additions to the cycle of the game to make it fresh as long as possible, but it is still inevitable that you will reach a stage where you can say that you have played enough.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWell, I'll just save you the time and get straight to the point. If you ever had that one bit of interest when you saw this game, DO NOT HESITATE AND GET IT.\n\nRating - 9.8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","April 3","true","342.9"," 71 of 79 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","71","79","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/recommended/413150/","Azralynn","Azralynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/","472 products in account","Stardew Valley is a farming simulator RPG game with its core gameplay taken from Harvest Moon. There is A LOT to do, so you need to manage your time well as you tackle everyday farming life.\n\nCheck out my Quick Review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anKqHAdTbyM\nThe gameplay in Stardew Valley is open-ended, and each day, when you wake up, you decide what you want to do with your time. Before you do anything though, you may want to check out the bulletin board for any job opportunities, as well as the calendar for upcoming events. You will also need to be aware of your energy level. If you run out of energy, or it gets too late at night, you will become too exhausted, and you will pass out, only to wake, and find gold or possibly inventory items missing. Your energy is consumed when you perform most tasks. As you do the same tasks repeatedly, you will gain proficiency in that skill, which allows you to unlocks bonuses, such as crafting recipes. You will need to earn gold, and gather resources to build up your farm.\n\nEach year in Stardew Valley is 4 months long and lasts 1 month per season. When the season changes, all of your seasonal crops die. As you progress in the game, you will also be able to build new farm structures, upgrade your home, your tools, unlock new areas, and maybe even get married and have kids.\n\nYou can farm the lands to grow crops, or raise and breed animals. You can also go fishing or if you’re looking for an adventure, you can head to the caves, and mine for precious minerals, but watch out for the monsters that live there. If you die, you will lose gold and random items from your inventory as well, so be mindful of your health bar! You can replenish health and energy by eating food, or by going to sleep.\n\nYou can also head into town, and socialize with the locals. By giving them gifts each week, and especially on their birthday, you earn friendship with each one person. All of the characters throughout the game have their own unique personalities and routines. As the friendship improves between you, you can learn new things from them, and experience different events with each character, in addition to the seasonal town events.\n\nPros:controls are fully customizable\npixel-style graphics are done very well. The characters are cute, and everything looks great\nbackground music is beautiful, and all of the sound effects fit perfectly with each part of the game\nopen-ended gameplay with a lot of things you can do, when you want to\nthere are lots of mods for the game that take care of most of the things listed in the “Cons” section\nCons:to raise friendships can take a long time because you are limited to how many gifts you can give to each person per week\nfishing mini-game can be annoying to do\nwith so much to do and explore, there were several things I wish I knew a lot sooner (I highly suggest reading the things people ‘wish they knew before playing’)\nlosing items randomly if you die can be very punishing, and you may wish to restart your day from that mornings auto-save\nThe story in Stardew Valley starts off with you moving out to the farm, left for your by your grandfather in order to start a new life, and build something for yourself. The story, its characters, all of the character interactions, and relationship developments are realistic, and believable. You really feel like you have purpose, and a chance to really do some good, not just for yourself, but for everyone else in the community.\n\nThere is so much to do, but you have limited time, and energy each day to get things done. The game is very enjoyable, and very addicting! I often found myself saying “just one more day,” only to look at the clock, and realize hours had gone by.\n\nAs far as replay value goes, each game can last days of real time, and you can keep playing the same game and constantly be upgrading, and improving. I can’t see wanting to replay it, but that’s because you get SO MUCH out of it in the first place and you don’t want to start over from scratch. So far, I have over 40 hours played, and I am not even finished all that there is to do.\n\nThe price for Stardew Valley is very cheap for what the game has to offer. With how much time I have put into the game, and how much more there is still for me to accomplish. I could see myself paying twice what what the game costs, and still be perfectly happy with the purchase. The game is so well done in every aspect. So much passion, thought, and detail went into everything. The fact that this game was done entirely by one developer blows my mind. It’s truly an amazing game, and I would highly recommend this game to just about everyone.","March 15","true","45.8"," 85 of 101 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","85","101","3","2"

It’s best compared with Harvest Moon, as that is basically what it’s going for. ConcernedApe worked tirelessly for 4 years on this indie hit, somehow managing all components; the core coding and gameplay design as well as the music and visuals.\n\nIf you enjoyed the Harvest Moon series (the good ones on GB/SNES), I can assure you that you’ll enjoy this as well. For others, I’ll highlight what makes this title so great.\n\nPros\n+ A developer that is currently updating the game daily; fixing the small bugs that are there, while also changing and expanding the game based on community feedback.\n+ Online multiplayer is coming soon (This will be epic)\n+ Cheap price tag of only 15$/14€, vs many AAA titles that have much less content.\n+ Huge time sink. Depending on what you decide to do, you could easily pour in a hundred hours if not more.\n+ Visual character customization. (Male/Female, Eye/Hair/Pants color sliders, tons of hair styles, etc. And your appearance can continue to change with equips found throughout the game.)\n+ Home interior decoration; move furniture wherever you like, apply flooring and wallpaper, etc.\n+ Farming simulation done right. Plan and design your very own farm, raise your crops, take care of your animals, etc.\n+ Buildings freely placeable on your farm; no fixed positions.\n+ The world feels alive. NPCs have their own schedules (going to different places at different times of the day), weather effects, and all sorts of small animals to stumble upon.\n+ Ability to get socially involved with the townspeople, even going as far as marriage.\n+ Lesbian/Gay marriage and love is possible; you can even adopt kids!\n+ Venturing deep into the mines, combatting monsters on the way and find ore to improve your farming equipment.\n+ Crafting and Cooking (Craft equipment that improves your in-combat abilities as well as your farming activities with over 100 recipes. Scarecrows, furnaces, bee hives and even dishes that temporary boost your skills.)\n+ Skills improve over time based on what you use, similar to Skyrim. Use the various mechanics often to increase your skill levels, with passive abilities to unlock at lvl 5 and 10.\n+ Awesome fishing mini-game that’s both challenging and rewarding, with swappable bait and tackles.\n+ Basic combat system with 3 equipment slots. (Reminiscent of Secret of Evermore and Secret of Mana, but without the charged attack.)\n+ Interesting and fun seasonal festivals to participate in.\n+ Find and donate artifacts to the local museum to get rewards (mostly special furniture).\n+ Over two hours of well suited original music that changes with the seasons.\n+ Xbox (Xinput) controller support, though keyboard and mouse works better to be honest.\n\nCons\n- Mechanics aren’t explained very well, and there’s no real tutorial. Unless you’re following a guide of some sort, you’ll likely even end up restarting after getting a handle on all of the game’s nuances.\n- The game is very slow to start, mainly because of a lack of gold, though it does pick up later on.\n- Fast day/night cycle. It’s potentially too fast for some wanting a calmer experience, but mods can tailor this to your liking.\n- Limited energy for actions can be frustrating, primarily at the start when you don’t have much food on hand.\n- Minor bugs (The developer has fixed most of them)\n\nI hope I could help with your purchase decision!\nIf you have any more questions, feel free. ;)","March 3","true","93.8"," 61 of 66 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","61","66","2","0"

I've put in too many hours,  lost a lot of sleep and messed up my social life up more than it already was with no end in sight.\n\nThere's different kinds of farming in the game including ranching. You can make your own artisanal goods including wine, beer, jellies, jams, cheeses etc. and eat them yourself, give them as gifts or sell them for a profit. You can forage for different types of plants in the wild. You can fish all you want in rivers, lakes and the ocean. You can go deep into the mines for ores needed to upgrade your farming equipment, just be careful of monsters and bring a sword. There's even an experience system so you can level up and choose professions that better fit your playstyle, be it for livestock or for your fields, fishing or trapping and so on. And if all that wasn't enough, there's close to 30 people in town you can interact with, each with their own little events and stories. Marriage is an option too with 5 bachelors and 5 bachelorettes to choose from each with their own unique personalities. There's so much more and it's just amazing to me that this game was made by 1 guy and not a team.\n\nFor me, this game came out of nowhere and has become a surprise hit. I recommend it for everyone. Even if you don't think it's your kind of game, try it anyway, you can always refund it within 2 hours provided you don't lose track of time.","March 11","true","144.2"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","58","63","9","0"

Since this review will contain minor spoilers, stop reading now, just buy the game, even at the full price, and spend the next dozens of hours in Stardew Valley!\n\nThis review is based on an incomplete experience, I did not even get to the first winter yet. I have only 30 hours in the game, as I write this, and that is nothing. Still, after almost three months after the release, it is time to make this review. And yet, this is not an ordinary review, it is more like a love letter.\n\nStardew Valley is a farm simulator. Calling it a Harvest Moon clone, however, would be like calling Quake a Wolfenstein 3D clone. The game takes elements from Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, mixes them all together, and presents us with a small world to explore that holds its mysteries.\n\nThe story is simple at first: You work for Joja, a huge company, and get tired of your life there. So you move to a farm that once belonged to your grandfather. You arrive there with a character you created yourself - boy or girl - and start your new life. You meet the townspeople, start seeding and watering your first crops, and soon notice that Joja also has a business in town. Your first real conflict comes from the Community Center. Will you help rebuilding it to its former glory, or will you assist Joja in expanding their company? After a few days, you discover that an old mine has opened, and you can start mining ores to improve your farm tools. Eventually you can build more farm buildings and work with animals or even slimes. You can fish, you can forage, and you meet more people, unlock a few more places to visit eventually. You can even fight and sell monster remains, or use them to craft things.\n\nGameplay:\nWell, the gameplay follows very much the Rune Factory formula. The controls are fine, but you should enable the option that makes you see what field your tools will work on. Like in Rune Factory etc. you run around and can converse or use tools with a simple click. As said above, there are many things to do - would you rather grow crops, forage shells, fish or mine? Or all together? In each profession you level up and unlock new blueprints that you can craft, including better sprinklers, so you will want to specialize in everything sooner or later. But the progress often comes naturally, just as you play. And then you have the mysteries to unravel: What are the mysterious creatures in the community center? What does the wizard know? Where are the mayor's pants? Umm, okay, I solved the latter one, but let us just not talk about it. Anyway, the quests, awkwars as they might be, often help giving personality to the characters, of which you also have 10 marriage candidates. And yes, you DO have the homosexual options. Although, to my (hetero male) taste, there is maybe only one or two male candidates out of the five possible ones, that are appealing at all. As for the women, the ones I would love are not relationship options... here's looking at you, Robin.\n\nOne word of warning, though (as I said, minor spoilers): It is possible to lose animals to wolves or something. As there is no option to make manual saves, this was a gamebreaker for one of my friends who could not find the heart afterwards to go on anymore, and instead played other games again.\n\nMusic:\nThe music is great, it really fits the game.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are held in a style that reminds of console games, but run absolutely smooth. The world has a distinctive yet familiar look, it feels like a 1990s SNES RPG. I mean, just look at the screenshots at the store page.\n\nRecommended: Yes! Even at full price! In fact the game is so good, I even bought another copy at full price to gift it to a friend!\n\nOh, and did I mention that this masterpiece was made by one guy alone? That's right, ConcernedApe, as he likes to be called, has created the graphics, music, game code and everything else alone! Kudos!\n\nNow stop reading and start playing the game!","May 24","true","30.3"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","51","53","4","1"

I have a lot of games but for a long time now I have had a problem figuring out what to play, or when I did, I haven't played for long. This game changed all that. It has been a long time since I've actually had that "just a few more minutes, that then turns into an hour and another..." feeling. I have 19 hours already and I've only had the game a few days.\n\nIt's been said a thousand times, but if you enjoy Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, do not hesitate to pick this up. It is well worth the $15 and then some.  There is so much to do. Whether you want to walk around finding stuff, fish, farm, tend to animals, fight, etc., it's all here.  There is a storyline, but frankly, this game is more than the storyline and for the first time in a long time, I don't even care about the storyline. I'm more interested in the process.\n\nThe graphics harken back to the days of SNES. Not to say they're horrible. They're perfect for the type of game this is. The fact that this was done by a one-man shop blows my mind. It's a great game and if DLC is done, I won't hesitate to pick it up.\n\nI could talk about the game all day, but really you need to do yourself a favor and try this game for yourself. You won't regret it.\n\nEdit: I have 129 hours in this game in less than 4 weeks. I'm not the kind of gamer to invest this much time in something unless it is really enjoyable. There is so much to do. It's the perfect blend of time management, RPG, and farming.  This is easily one of my favorite games of the last 10 years. It's that good.","March 14","true","354.1"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","44","48","5","2"

One day you can stick to organizing and cleaning up your farm, the next day you can go fight in mines and collect a ton of different ores and useful materials, then you can go fishing to become a better fisherman.  You get to also raise your own barn animals once you construct more buildings which require every day attention. (Sounds repetitive but it's fun)\n\nThe game goes by seasons, starting in Spring with each season having 28 days, and each season having different crops you can harvest (Winter has practically 0 crops). Every season can take hours to complete, and you may not even realize that you spent hours playing.\n\nBesides from fishing, mining, farming (and more), you can also befriend the people of Pelican Town (Town in which Stardew takes place) and if you become good enough friends with some of the other citizens you can eventually marry them! I'd say its important to befriend everyone in town because they may send you gifts in the mail if you have good chemistry with them.\n\nOverall i'd give Stardew a solid 100 based on the endless hours of entertainment and the amount of activities you can do in the game. Would highly recommend that if you have 15 dollars to spare, give this game a shot.

This one deserves it.\n\nI can remember of my sweet childhood... When I used to have a PS1, and I could play Harvest Moon: Back to Nature on it. Yeah, I was pretty addicted to the game, but... Unfortunately, one day, my console crashed. I felt bad, and... Ugh... I didn't want to play anything anymore.\n\nSo, when I got a computer, I discovered the magic world of the emulators. Then, I realized I could revive the good ol' days playing Harvest Moon: Back to Nature. I downloaded the stuff, and started to play the game (with a controller, to make it more nostalgic). Too bad it hasn't the same taste as before. I didn't want to play it with the same vigour as before.\n\nSo, last Monday (03/07), a friend that I made at my new college, recommended this game. He said I could buy it without any regrets. And you know what? He was right. I sold some of my most precious TF2 items in order to buy this game... But it worth the risk. I got something way more precious: this game. And now, I can have some of the taste I was looking for since my PS1 crashed long time ago.\n\nSo, if you like an "old-school" game with a countryside thematic, like Harvest Moon, I strongly recommend it. I gurarantee you won't regret spending your money on this game. :)","March 11","true","100.1"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","37","42","3","0"

You'll sink 20 hours into it before you notice that it'll take at least another 80 to get to the point that you set at the very beginning. Each activity holds a certain challenge and each one of them (there are at least 7 that I can think of right now) takes a huge chunk of your time. There's just so much to do and all of it feels rewarding.\n\nThere are a few things that aren't that great. The fishing for example can be quite frustrating and it doesn't get much easier the more you do it. The fighting mechanics as well as the farming ones aren't exactly great. In the overall scale those things are a minor nuisance though.\n\nThere's a lot to discover past the limits of your farm and the more you get yourself involved in the events and people of Stardew Valley, the more the game drags you in.\n\nExpect to put a lot of hours into this game and then the 15$ seem like very little for how much fun you get out of this gem :)","April 19","true","186.9"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","34","38","5","0"

While the fundamentals are really similar to Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing, there are quite a few overhauls as well as subtle nuances that make Stardew Valley feel more complete in a sense.\n\nThere's a ridiculous amount of depth even in the seemingly basic framework of what the game is focused on.  The game's visuals, whilst catering to the retro style of its predecessors, will still drop your jaw. Just as you're taking time to appreciate that, the game's soundtrack comes and blows you away while still staying very cohesive with how the game's art style feels.\n\nMechanically, the game is quite intuitive to play and functions quite well. You're plopped into the setting and expected to find your own way. There's enough instruction to help you get started immediately, but the game is designed so that you're supposed to learn the in and outs as you go through experience. A refreshing taste compared to the overencompassing handholding that comes with many games as of late.\n\nThe one gripe I have is regarding how the combat is fleshed out since you can only look in the 4 cardinal directions and it's sometimes difficult to land hits on mobs coming at you from an angle.\n\nAll in all, Stardew Valley feels like a very refined, appealing, and morbidly addicting game (I've literally eaten,slept,and Stardew-Valley-ed the last 2 days) that lives up to the hype and surmounts any negative assertions that it's just a boring rework or farmville on Steam. The epitome of what a farmlife RPG should be, Stardew Valley is surely a game you'll want to have in your library!","March 1","true","73.4"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

Hunt slimes, raise crops or just have a thousand free range goats...\n\nThis game has a lot of charm and holds a lot of enjoyment for something created by a one-man team. Great music and cute 16bit-style art, too. If you've ever played Rune Factoy, Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon, then you have a nidea what you are getting into.\n\nStory: You inherit a farm from your grandfather and decide to move there. Here's where it gets interesting: your character isn't really forced down any particular path. There are 5 skills to level, hundreds of ways to earn a living, and if you want, you could just ignore your farm entirely, forage for food and fight monsters in the endless dungeon, or perhaps you'd like to raise 200 ducks instead?\n\nThe townsfolk are what you'd expect--talk to them, do them favors (ranging from serious like "bring me some flowers" to silly "help me I lost my purple shorts somewhere") and bring them gifts to raise their friendship and unlock marriage candidates. They have lots of unique dialogue and you'll enjoy getting to know them.\n","February 26","true","138.3"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","38","46","0","0"

I was skeptical about the price at first and figured if I didn't like it I would refund it. Well, 52 hours of gameplay later, I'm writing this review. This game has the same addictive quality as one of my favorite other games, Civilization 5. The graphics look so simple but there is so much to Stardew Valley that you haven't tapped into yet. It's an amazing game that surprisingly was only made by one guy.\n\nPositive:+ Relaxing Game\n+ Story that's simple but turns into so much more\n+ Detailed character creation\n+ Endless amount of stuff to do, much more than just farming\n+ Dating sim added into the game\n+ Quests to keep the addiction real\n+ Entertaining events and seasons with different items to collect make for a lot of stuff to do\n+ Very large map\n+ Music, music is surprisingly good, it's atmospheric and relaxing\n+ Steam trading cards\n+ Developer is very active in the community\n+ Developer seems to still be adding new features to the game, including coop\n\nNegatives:- People say bugs, but with the developer so active in the community, he's fixed everything the day they were posted\n- Save feature could be improved, but I honestly do not have any complaints about the game\n\nVery very good Game: 10/10\n\nI was skeptical about the price, but looking at my playtime, I can say it was justified (not finished yet). The developer is also planning on adding more features. This is a must buy for any gamer in my opinion. After seeing the different types of streamers that have played this game, I would say they cover large categories of different genre's of games they play. All had extremely positive feelings about this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/intelekt/recommended/413150/","intelekt","Intelekt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/intelekt/","502 products in account","Stardew Valley is at first glance a farming game with some sandbox building and RPG elements. What it is on the inside is an addictive and unbelievably deep RPG with some farming elements. I have been playing the game for over a week and it’s very difficult to put down as manifested by my steam account showing I’ve played 56 hours of it in about 12 days. The fact is the massive popularity and positive feedback for this game are already apparent in game news and media so I just want to share my perspective and support for this amazing indie masterpiece.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nFinally Here – The best thing about Stardew Valley at it’s surface is that it finally brings the game play style of Harvest Moon or Story of Seasons to the PC platform. This seems like an oversight by developers but it hasn’t been done (well) before. The amazing thing about having an experience like this on PC is that mods are easily built and shared to really extend or customize your game to suit your preferences. This style of game on a handheld system has been fun but the popularity of Stardew Valley thus far shows there was a clear need for this sub-genre of game on PC.\n\nGrowth Chart – The first year in Stardew Valley is filled with learning experiences which will shape the rest of your game. One of the most pleasant aspects of the game is that you can see your progression in many different areas of the game as you play. Your equipment, home, accessories, furniture, weapons, armor, jewelry, farm buildings, and various farm equipment are all upgraded over time and make clear improvements to your life in the game. I found the depth of the progression to be incredibly well thought out for a game which seems at first glance to be about solely farming, it’s actually a deep RPG set in a great retro style.\n\nMystery Abundant – I have played through an entire year of Stardew Valley and I still can’t tell you what certain things like the random statues are. I understand there are likely guides and wiki pages to spoil every last bit of it, but I keep learning by simply playing. I find regularly that there are unknown aspects which may unlock or take certain events to figure out. During my first winter a meteor hit my land and my pick ax isn’t currently strong enough to break it, I am thrilled to see what might come of it. It’s a deep game with a substantial amount of thought and content put into it. I haven’t enjoyed a new IP this much possibly since Minecraft, and for many of the same reasons.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nTime’s Passage – While all games have some mechanic tied to time generally built in Stardew Valley is built on time’s passing to some extent. I know this model from the games mentioned in the “Finally Here” paragraph and it’s one I don’t quite embrace. There is something about starting your second year or third year that often makes one ask “Am I going to do this again?” I will certainly play more of the game but with less regularity than my initial “verging on addiction” style sessions. The other aspect of this type of time passage in games is that you often find yourself saying “one more day” and playing another 20-30 minutes each day, leading to some late nights or long sessions.\n\nOverwhelmed to the Helm – There is a vast amount of content in Stardew Valley. I will not be so bold as to say it’s too much but I certainly feel often like there aren’t enough hours in the days to get all the things done needed. Once you become more established it seems as though some automation might help but essentially I found myself with more and more to do daily as I progressed. I enjoyed the game overall but I dislike this very real life notion that I don’t have enough time to get everything done.\n\nThere are not many games at the $15 price point you can say have 200+ hours of quality playable content. Stardew Valley is already incredibly popular and the reason is that it’s both fun and fills a void that I think many PC players didn’t even realize was missing until this game was released. I can say without a doubt that you should have bought this game already and if you haven’t, do it. It’s a single developer who clearly has a passion for games, don’t wait for a holiday sale on this one.\n\nScore: Buy it now","April 30","true","56.4"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

Now?  The same fate.\n\nI have never felt such... genuinely emotional feelings playing a game for quite some time now.  Ive been playing for a quarter century by now.  The writing feels genuinely alive, the seasons feel genuinely alive, the characters feel so genuinely alive that I swear Ive known some of these people from real life, it is a game that warms my heart like a cup of hot cocoa on a cold rainy day, given to me by my loving wife.\n\nI cried during some of the events, my hearts melted at others.  What is this game like?  Well, you need to play it to find out.  Do not expect the game to rush you though.  Oh no, this game wants you to know you can relax and take it easy.  You can pause anytime you like, getting in and out is a breeze.  Everything from the mechanics to the story can be taken slowly and easily one at a time.  And in an age where quantity often rules over quality, I find this to be a well crafted piece of cookery done by ConcernedApe, a chef who apparently knows, that sometimes, a good recipe takes time to stew.\n\nCheers to you mate, for all the years waiting. :)","March 2","true","82.1"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","1"

I love this game so much, and am so into it, that I had to pry myself, almost physically force myself away from it just so I could write this review, because I believe the developer deserves it that much.\n\nI first played Harvest Moon on the SNES when I was a boy. I had always wanted a hobby farm, or to live my life in or around nature, and playing that game was a virtual taste of the type of lifestyle I had always wanted to live. It was a great game. It seemed perfect at the time.\n\nWith me, as with most Harvest Moon fans, the love of the game never left me. There was always a dream that existed within that made one want to live in the country, tend to a farm, see green trees and grass every day. Smell the scents, see the beauty of the mountain and the forest. But for most people that isn't a reality. They are stuck in someplace removed from that idyllic dream...\n\nNow I'm grown up, and I work with computers, and I work in a grey, lifeless company (not denying that the story for Stardew panders to me a bit, maybe that's part of the appeal), and when I played this game the old feelings of escaping the modern life, getting back to nature, they were revived. I mean, we could go into the joy of tending to your farm, and the importance of that to one's life, and the pain of being removed from it, but that's Grapes of Wrath stuff and delving way too deep into the industrial era psyche...\n\nLet's just say that whatever Harvest Moon accomplished, this man (I still am not sure I understand that this is one guy who made this??) has taken everything that was good and beautiful about Harvest Moon, and added everything that anyone could possibly desire in a new Harvest Moon, and he has created a labour of love, a truly beautiful work of art which cannot be denied. I have played a lot of games in my life, but I am saying this truthfully. This is the best game I have ever played. 10/10 would play the best game I have ever played in my life again (and going back to playing now).","February 28","true","74.2"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","24","27","3","0"

Still it's realistic and the Wiki can help you if you need to look where someone'd be at a given time/ day\n\n-combat works, but it feels a bit clunky\n\nCONS:\n\n-can be a bit cryptic when it comes to tutorials, I think reading a few guides and keeping the Wiki at hand would be a very good move for most players\n\n-livestock pathing can be a bit poor sometimes\n\n-object selection when several people/ objects are near can be a bit annoying\n\n-some menus are a bit unclear or fiddly when it comes to displaying information or searching through different items\n\n-certain rare fishes/ artifacts can be quite frustrating to get\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=648169767\n\nAfter 50 hours with the game I'm not even halfway through year two, and I still have a few things to do before I finally complete the Community Center and tackle a few other things and achievements I'm interested in: the game is simply big in terms of overall content and things to do and requires quite a bit of time and research to be enjoyed properly. For those that pour enough effort in it Stardew Valley is a very rewarding game that is sure to repay your work with something, maybe a new tool, a farm building with new animals, a Museum reward or the option to make your love interest move in with you at the farm.\n\nThere are a few blemishes here and there but none of them get in the way of the fun and it's easy to lose yourself in the game so much you realize a couple hours have passed only when you look at a clock. The sense of novelty eventually wears off from the second year onwards as you've seen the festivals, you know how to reach the goals you're missing (give gifts to this NPC, grow this crop, make sure to keep this item etc), and have automated the crop watering process: still while it'll feel a bit more like organized work and less like the adventure of your first year there's still enough to push you forward for at least another one before you'll have seen most of what the game has to offer.\n\nIf you love the farming sim genre Stardew Valley is a truly great game and is sure to provide a lot of bang for your buck even at full price: the fact this is the creation of a single dev makes it even more impressive.","March 21","true","58.9"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

What if those two games were blended together? Well, thats basically what Stardew Valley is and its perfect. I love both of these games and having a game that takes great elements from both and puts them into one game, and releases it on PC no less, is a game I'm all in for.\n\nIf you don't know what those games are, or how they work, I'll explain stardew valley for you. Otherwise, you should pick up this game, its great, and you'll love it if you love either or both of those. Basically your just a person that farms and lives in a town with lots of activities and collectables to participate in. You can build relationships with townspeople, adventure in a mine, explore the forest, fish, raise a family, and obviously, farm. Its a very relaxing game and probably isn't something you'll play for 12 hours in one day, unless your super in love with it, but to me its more of something I'd pick up for one or two hours a day, tend to my farm, talk to people, progress in the world, and put it down for the rest of the day, basically like animal crossing. But a benifit to this game, at least to me, is its not real time, it has its own game timer, so you can progress through multiple days and build your farm over one game session.\n\nThats basically Stardew Valley, there isn't much more to be said about it, its a great simulation of living on a farm and meeting new people. I'm glad to see this game doing so well and with the price of 15 bucks I think its definitely worth it, even if you don't like it you'll know by 2 hours in and you can just return it. Honestly though, if your into simulation, farming, RPG elements, or exploring you should pick this up. Great game that came out of nowhere for me.\n\nBuy At Full Price","February 27","true","55.7"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

To this day I would go back and play the GBA version for a few hours every year, if only to remember good times.\n\nI have to say, that I really did not know about this game until today, when it was released. I saw a lot of chatter about how it was like Harvest Moon and that if you enjoyed that, than this would be up your ally.\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes, I seriously wanted to cry from nostalgia. This game is... everything I could ever want. The developer did an amazing job. Any fan of old school NES games will love this game. The art, the music, the sound effects, the dialogue-- I mean, this is a masterpiece. I'm a few hours in, and I don't want to stop. I want to quit my job, regress 20 years, and be a kid again. The thing is, the story is not a kid's story. It deals with adult stuff, like the loss of community, the Sisyphean struggle that is our society, and more. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nMy friend told me the story about how Harvest Moon inspired him to start his own garden when he was a kid. That lasted like 6 hours of work, and he abandoned it. With Stardew, I'm afraid I might spend a few years trying to start a farm-- it has quite the impact.\n\nThe RPG elements of Harvest Moon have been expanded, there is combat, crafting, homebuilding, relationships... It's got it all. For $15, I feel like I am robbing this guy. It could be $40, and I'd tell you that you were crazy for sleeping on it. If you are on the fence, just pull the trigger, because honestly, a game like this is once in a few years.","February 26","true","61.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

I've been waiting to play this game for so long, but I had recently re-found it while browsing the internet trying to find games similar to the Harvest Moon franchise.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome and will immerse you into the life of a farmer.\n\nGraphics are top notch (For this type of genre) and it reminds me of the days when I would just play Friends of Mineral Town everywhere I went.\n\nThere's a quest system and it really enhances the gameplay. It's never in your face and it works more as a journal to remind you to do something, if you aren't doing something already.\n\nThe pacing of time is fantastic. It gives you enough time to talk to the villagers, and do some errands on the way.\n\nMy only complaint would probably be that running around can be a little tedious, especially if you forget to store something at your house along the way. But I forgive this after years of playing Harvest Moon. (Maybe adding a bike would fix this?)\n\nOverall, I rate this 10/10. This is the kind of game that I've been looking for a while. If you like an awesome farming simulator, with some new mechanics along the adeventure, I highly recommend this game for you.\n\nPS, this was before of my knowledge that the quest book was actually called a journal.\nAlso I didn't know there was a horse.","February 26","true","35.6"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

The music, the retro art, the beautiful world that you find yourself in. Its all great stuff.\n\nThe game was designed to use mouse and keyboard so when I use a gamepad (my preferred style) it feels a little awkward (you use one of the two analog sticks to control the on-screen mouse cursor) when you're planting crops or trying to select things on the screen. But that's to be expected when the control method is designed the way it is. Using a controller is totally feasible, albeit a little odd.\n\nI really enjoy the fishing, so far. I didn't quite understand how to do it, at first, but figured it out within a minute or so and can definitely see myself spending a good deal of time doing it to make money.\n\nShould you get this game?\nAbsolutely.\n\nIts a true work of art and stands far above many games released lately, for its aesthetic, music, and charm.

The best way I can describe it is it's like putting together the farming in Harvest Moon, the relationship system in Animal Crossing, and the simplified combat in Recettear or Secret of Mana for the SNES.\n\nThe game is really simple: you start off wondering whether you made the correct choice in life stuck in a soulless office cubicle, but grandpa offers a way out. Eventually you find yourself in the countryside with a piece of land, and it's up to you to do what you will with it. This village has its uniqueness in that you have different festivals with different requirements every season.\n\nYou are gently eased into planting certain crops, diving into the mines for ores (beware monsters), or getting to know the locals better, or fixing the old community center. Whether you want to do any of this, or how you do this is entirely up to you. Of course, different seasons come with different limitations. There are plenty of secrets to find, and the wiki (the actual one, not the Wikia one) has a lot of information on most aspects of the game, like crop prices.\n\nRecommendations for new players: Each season is 28 days, and plants die outside of their season. Try to plant as much of the highest-yielding crop you can (your cash crop), but be sure to have at least some of every other crop available in the season as you need them for other purposes. Dive into the mines early and often and keep all the quartz you can get, as you need them to make the good sprinklers later on. Sprinklers save you from having to water the plants yourself so you can use that time to do other things.\n\nAs a heads up: this game is the fruit of the sustained effort of a single person (programmer, pixel artist, music, writing and all). The only other games I know which are made this way are Dust: An Elysian Tail and the Evochron games. The amount of effort these developers have to put in is unimaginable; even Microsoft's XNA framework, which Stardew Valley and Dust happen to be built upon, has been discontinued since April 2014. This gives you a sense of how long these projects take. With that much investment and pride on the line, you can be sure that if these games are fortunate enough to be released, they would release only in the best possible state.\n\nIf you have problems starting the game, try heading to your installation folder (steamapps/common/Stardew Valley) and install the XNA Framework 4.0 under /_CommonRedist. That solved my problem.\n\nExpect multiplayer to be added in the future. The developer simply released the singleplayer part first, which is not missing anything other than the ability to play together with other players. I think there was a Q&A involved with the closed beta group behind this decision, but don't hold me to this.\n\nFully recommended, both the great game and the developer (Eric Barone).","March 1","true","94.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

The developer stayed very true to those games when it comes to gameplay features, and graphics.

You will have no problem  enjoying StarDew Valley.\n\nI highly suggest this game, even with single player. Don't let Single Player hold you back, as there is still a lot to be learned for when 4 player co-op comes around.\n\n\n10/10 A++\n\nFantastic job ConcernedApe, can't believe the time I can finally enjoy this fantastic game is here.","February 26","true","226.9"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

I impulsively bought it and I was starting to regret it whenI I gave it a go, and to be honest they seem the 15 bucks better spent this year.\n\nIf you're doubting whether to buy it or not, my advice is, go ahead. You won't regret it. Moreover, it's totally worth full price.","March 22","true","18.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","15","17","9","0"

Very cute, colorful, and filled with detail.\n+ Has a ton of charm, I would say it's like Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, and a bit of Terraria/Minecraft although in my opinion Stardew Valley is much better as far as a single player expeirence.\n+ Surprisingly has a TON of things to do. It seems like every single day there's "something" new going on in the world, and the game constantly gives you new goals to work torward while opening up new mechanics consistantly without overwhelming the player.\n+ Extremely addicting and filled with loads of content, many people will invest 20-50hours+ into this game\n+ Lovely relaxing soundtrack\n+ There are full-on retro-styled games within the game. "Mini-games" if you will, but I was completely surprised at how good they were. I spent over an hour playing "Journey of The Prairie King" which is one of the arcade games in the Saloon which to me was a load of fun.\n+ Loads of quests and events\n+ Player choice / branching story. I'm not too far into the game at this moment, but you are able to support "Joja Mart" which is like an evil Walmart corporation trying to take the towns business, or you can choose to support the town instead by building up the community center and so fourth.\n+ Many different ways to earn money, you can farm, raise animals, fish, mine, quests, forage or "explore" and find all sorts of items to sell, and so on.\n+ There is even a combat system where you fight monsters in the mines, and can get new weapons, equipment, and earn many rewards.\n+ Relationships / Friends / Children! You can even have a gay relationship, and adopt a child if you wish!\n+ Crafting / Upgrades, you can craft a large variety of items, and unlock more as you expand your house, level your skills, and advance through the game. Many of which are optional, but give benefits like sprinklers to water your crops for you.\n\n- The only real issue I had is a lot of the information you need is not given to you, and you will have to use a guide/wiki in order to find out a lot of things in the game.","May 30","true","11.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","2"

I was younger at the time and now I've come to appreciate that this game is the balance that is needed,\n\nYou're never caught up just tediously waiting for your crops to harvest since there's actually more stuff to do, in-fact it's entirely possible to get caught up in a different profession and leave everything else behind.\n\nDon't want to farm? try fishing, go mining, go forage, be an errand boy, the choice really is down to the player.\n\nThe farms feel pretty customisable and you get as much as you put in so you don't feel like you're being cheated out of time,\n\nMoney never becomes an abundance so your playstyle always shifts as you budget yourself, do you really need the deluxe barn or should you build a chicken coop?\n\nThe seasons last the perfect length of time, with the soundtrack switching for each of them, Winter being my personal favourite.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is cheerful, it's happy, it doesn't get boring after 20 hours and even if you're not a fan of Harvest Moon or you never even touched the game,\n\nTHIS IS GOOD.\n\n9/10.

I played the SNES game like obsessed, and this game reminds me of it so much, but it's better. You got way more to do, more crops, more crafting, more of everything! The Pixel Art is so detailed and lovely it's amazing. The soundtrack is relaxing and pleasant, i spent a whole day sitting at the lake fishing and listen to the music. Talking about the fishing, the mechanics are not as that bad as some people say, it's a little simple minigame and to be honest, i have seen worse in other games.\n\nSure the game has it's flaws, but regarding the fact this was made by one person, this game is a masterpiece. Some bugfixing is needed at  this point, but i have faith in ConcernedApe to do his best to keep the players satisfied. And all in all it's running good.\n\nAlso the humor of the game gets me. There are so many details which made me grin on some points, like the alcoholic living in a trailer or the legendary Zelda dialogue.\n\nI just spend 8 hours in the game at this point and i guess i have to discover much much more, but this game is already one of my favourites of this Year.\n\nSumming it up i can recommend this game to everyone who had fun with the Harvest Moon games, which were obviously a huge inspiration for that game. But beware of the only-one-more-day-virus, it will get you.\nThe price is more than fair for the amount of time you will spend in Stardew Valley, and you support a very talented person with your purchase.\n\nThank you ConcernedApe for making such a wonderful game, keep up the good work.","March 3","true","86.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I'm not gonna waste any time here and instead just say it right off the freakin' bat: I love Stardew Valley. I really, REALLY do. If my opinion means anything to you, BUY THE GAME. Seriously, do it. It's not expensive, and for the substantial quantity AND quality, it's well worth the full price.\n\nAnd THAT should mean something regardless if you care about my opinion, since 95%> of all my Steam games were bought for BELOW full price, to some varying degree(s).\n\nBut, and this is a big one, what makes me love SDV may not be what you want in a game. So I'll lay out the cards here.\n\nFirst off, it's a very niche game. ConcernedApe has done a lot in terms of bringing a wide palette of flavours to the game, but it's not some Hivemind-esque be-all-end-all title. This game is not for everyone. It's that simple. I honestly wouldn't have it any other way, 'cause as some dude once said: A game where the player can do anything is a game that focuses on nothing.\n\nBut I digress... SDV has more than enough variety that it never truly gets boring, but it's never so exciting that it gets tiresome, hitting a hitherto unexplored sweet-spot between "relaxing" and "entertaining" that just lets you play for hours without ever feeling over-saturated, but also never feeling unsatisfied.\n\nOne issue, if you can call it that, is that Stardew Valley is EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE! Seriously, if you're gonna take away one single thing from my review, let it be this. It has that Sid Meier-esque quality, "Just one more round" or "Just 10 more minutes". This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can be troublesome, 'cause göddämn it's hard to stop playing once you get into it!\n\nI once caught myself playing SDV for over THREE HOURS longer than I had intended, simply because every new in-game day had the promise of something interesting happening. Maybe the new chicken coop will be ready tomorrow? Maybe the corn stalks will have regrown tomorrow? Maybe one of the seasonal festivals will happen tomorrow? This makes the game utterly addictive.\n\nFortunately, it doesn't that Animal Crossing nuttery with having to wait real-life time for stuff to happen, so plowing through a whole season in one sitting in Stardew Valley is very much a possibility.\n\nNext up, there's the fact that it's VERY time-consuming! This is NOT a game for anyone who expects instant pay-off and immediate gratification. If you're so hell-bent on that crap, you can jolly well rove off, mister! Yeah, that's right. Go back to your braindead CoD's and Cünny-Strucks!\n\nNo, Stardew Valley caters to people with some actual sense of PATIENCE. People who aren't afraid of sitting down and PLAYING the game before getting some form of reward for their efforts. Which, in my opinion, is a 100% good thing, since in this day 'n' age with freakin' microtransactions and shït like that, even in SINGLEPLAYER GAMES, seeing something that won't you have your cake NOR eat it without workin' for it, is definitely a pleasant change of pace!\n\nHowever, there's quite a lot to learn for newbies in Stardew Valley. What crops are most useful early on, what gifts are the best for certain people, what spots are most "productive" when fishing, etc. etc.\n\nFrankly, you'd be forgiven if by this point you were thinking or even stating out loud: "Is this bloody joker recommending this freakin' game or not?!"\n\nAnd to which I respond: "Yes, I bloody am, you nitwit. Didn't you read the literally first thing I wrote about it?"\n\nSimply put, Stardew Valley isn't for everyone, because it is after all a very niche game. But if that niche appeals to you, then I cannot stress this enough: BUY IT. PLAY IT. LOVE IT. 9.7/10","March 11","true","78.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","0"

It's so similar that it's a little bit scary.. But it's a more developed and exciting game in my opinion. The original elements are still there, like marrying the nicest man or woman you adore, having a farm and more, but it has been slightly upgraded with features like exploring the mines and fighting monsters and so on.\n\nIt's a game that will, just like HM Mineral town, get you addicted with all of the surprises that gets the story going through the years. What ever you want to go for, you can do it! If it's fishing, farming or mining, you can do what ever you want basically.\n\nAnother difference that's an improvement is that you can choose which gender you want and add some personality features. They added hats (yay for us tf2 fans) and other cute things. Also, I am very happy that it's possible to marry almost whoever you want, the gender doesn't matter. The most important thing is that you know what the best gifts are for your certain someone ;)\n\nTo sum it up.. I really like this game. It takes me back to the good ol' days but it also adds some new secrets and quests that makes it stay very exciting and intriguing. I seriously recommend it to anyone that likes Harvest Moon, Terraria and Minecraft since it has farming, fishing, mining, crafting and social elements in the game.","March 18","true","69.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","2"

So there's that!\nI'd estimate I have around 25-35 hours, as of writing, but thats a rough guess.\n\n--\n\nNow I've never played any of the Harvest Moon games, which I believe are what inspired Stardew Valley - however I can say with certainty that I would have loved them. Stardew Valley is a wonderful mix of relaxing and fast-paced gameplay, and I know it may not seem like that at first glance. The game at its core revolves around managing farmland in your little corner of the valley (its actually quite a lot of space!), designing and planting crops, filling barns and coops wth animals, and keeping it all running day by day. Beside all this management gameplay there is alot an exploration element which involves fishing, mining or foraging for things to eat / cook or sell, and deciding whether to farm or do these various side activities adds a layer of complexitity to the game wherein you must manage time and energy, as both are limited.\n\nChoosing your activites day by day is one option, however if you prefer a slower, less pressured play style you can simply enjoy the game for what it is, and do whatever activity you desire. There is no consequence aside from perhaps lost profits, and you will never be fully bankrupt thanks to foraging or the other activities. Stardew Valley does have a sort of story to it, in that you can try to rebuild the town's community center (or take a darker path), which consists of placing predefined items from the game and from all the activities into their respective bundles in the center. This will take a lot of time, and I wager I still have a long way to go yet. The few bundles I have completed fully have given me very helpful bonuses such as shortcuts through the valley, and opening entire new zones which have their own benefits. All of this is taken into consideration each day when deciding what to do, which makes day planning a very fun and interesting thing to do.\n\nFinally there is a social aspect to the game with the townsfolk, allowing you to court and marry select members, which is (as you would expect) a fairly egregious process, however quite satisfying to watch. The game also features festivals and events each season, which are a tonne of fun in and of themselves.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this game if it looks in any way interesting to you. I can't believe what a work of art this is, and I commend ConcernedApe for his love and hard work.\n","March 6","true","16.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zarradeth/recommended/413150/","Zarradeth","(IO)Zarradeth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zarradeth/","727 products in account","This game is everything I ever wanted in a Harvest Moon game and more. I've been following development for years now and am glad it finally released. During development there were a lot of things that worried me (crafting, combat in the dungeon/mines, and other stuff) because I felt like it would feel out of place in what I wanted this game to be (which was essentially Harvest Moon on the PC). I'm glad to say that after trying all this stuff out it feels great, it feels like what a modern Harvest Moon game should (but probably never will) be. All of these extra mechanics are well thought out and really add to the game without taking away from what the core 'country life' gameplay.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is how much polish, love, and thought was put into this game. This is what makes this game stand out- while playing you can see all the little extra details that were put in to make the game feel great (which is something that, seeing it now, was always missing from Harvest Moon games). The weather effects, the falling leaves, animals running around and hiding, birds flying around, fish splashing in water, etc. All these little details add up and make the game feel alive and vibrant.\n\nThe last thing I will mention is something that I feel Harvest Moon has always lacked (at least the older onces, which I prefer) is stuff to do. Harvest Moon, for me at least, has always quickly ran out of things to do- wake up, take care of your animals and crops, chop wood, maybe forage, then what? You can talk to people around town but that's usually not very rewarding. It quickly becomes a daily routine and then a struggle to find stuff to do until night. Stardew Valley on the other hand has always had something for me to do- and it's usually different from day to day (maybe with the exception of Winter since there is so much less going on). I'm about halfway through winter of the first year, and while I do think I will eventually run into the same problem as Harvest Moon, I have yet to have it happen and I can't see it happening anytime soon either. There are meaningful collections to complete (giving the player reason to mine, fish, farm, and more), exploring the mines has purpose and rewards, becoming friends with villagers is rewarding and feels meaningful, you can customize your farm and make it look however you like, you can upgrade your skills to get better at things, you can get materials and craft to help automate/improve your farm. There are so many things you can do, and all of them feel meaningful- especially compared to Harvest Moon.\n\nI love this game, I love that it's on PC, and I love the support its been getting. This is what I always wanted Harvest Moon to be but never knew it.","March 1","true","106.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Being made by an indie dev that doesn't answer to a large publisher has allowed for a lot of improvements.\n\n-Faster game progression and less grinding. But still has a good balance of the slow and steady gameplay.\n-Building relationships is much less tedious and easier, but still requires effort. Instead of daily gifts, you give your "friends" 2 gifts a week. And the social tab keeps track of who has gotten their presents and how many.\n-Crops eventually get automated in terms of watering, if you put the work in to get the equipment. This is something i've wanted for a long time. This makes the later parts of the game less tedious when you want to go on adventures, spent time with your spouse, or explore other skills, animal keeping, fishing, and so on.\n-The return of the mines. Something that has been lacking the later installments of Harvest moon. There is some adventure aspects to this that I enjoy a lot. And the mine has a check point every 5 levels, which makes progression much more steady.\n-You can now marry any of the suitors no matter what gender. Which is a huge bonus for people who are either bi and have a hard time deciding and don't want to restart. Or people who are gay and want to play as a gay character. And no matter who you marry, you have the option to have babies.\n\nThe great thing is the dev is constantly updating the game to fix minor issues. Unlike with harvest moon where you just had to deal with bugs forever.\n\nOverall Stardew Valley has streamlined the harvest moon experience, while still maintaining the magic of the farming/life simulation genre.","February 29","true","92.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

Quality sprinkles are also pretty overpriced, just so you have to manually water all your crops everyday...\n- Game got a good longevity, I'm almost 20 hours in, and only now I'm starting to make somewhat decent money.\n\nCons:\n-The game starts assuming that you've played Harvest Moon before, so it doesn't provide information that it thinks is taken for granted.\n- Farming could use a bit more of complexity, like humidity levels, how much of water should certain vegetable get everyday and etc.\n- Some NPCs talk nonsensical things after you give them certain gifts.\n- I find it really frustrating to have to walk the whole map, everyday. I know there's a horse that you can buy, but the horse is really expensive and more like an endgame item, it's gonna take ages to get it.\n\n\n===========================================\n\nI'll update once I get to see more of the game, I'm just at the beggining.","February 28","true","49.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Stardew Valley starts almost the exact same way as the original Harvest Moon does. After the intro, you start right outside your front door with nothing. Your farm is a wreck and all you have are seeds. Now this is where the two games differ in a big way. Stardew Valley offers infinitely more to do at this point than any other. I started exploring the farm and clearing land. The first thing I noticed was how little time had passed before I was done. You will notice the Stamina Bar depletes considerably from working long periods of time but there are tons of ways to replenish it.  I had a nice little area cleared and plowed for the seeds I had. I walked east to the town and began exploring. You run into a few cutscenes but I enjoyed watching them. You can always skip them if they arent your thing. Eventually you end up back at home and go to sleep. The next day you get up and keep working on your farm. This always leads to doing something else like, grabbing a notice off the board, fishing, exploring the mines, getting lost in the town and cursing having to backtrack. But once you learn your way around, it isnt so bad. There are never a shortage of things to want to do. Plus it helps that each activity has been polished to perfection. The level of care that went into perfecting each activity and combining each of them into progression, handled every day after you sleep, is masterful.\n\nIf you grew up with games like Zelda or Harvest Moon, you will love Stardew Valley. I have followed this game for years and watched as it took shape. It truly is a masterpiece.","February 29","true","55.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","4"

As an Asian kid, I was raised with Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon Series. However, this years I realised that I've been playing games without any story lines at all. Like Counter Strike or GTA V, sure these games are great and all but it is not family friendly and the graphical violence is gruesome. This game is really addictive and it has really sweet, I mean really sweet soundtracks, characters and graphic designs. I am a man who got bored of GTA V and Assassin's Creed Series, but this game is some how special and unique from them. I feel like I am talking in circles soo...\n\nPros\n-Brings back old memories with old gameboy and Nintendo\n-Appealing graphic designs\n-Unique characters\n-Lots of contents that you can do(Not joking, more than GTA series)\n-Sweetness, you'll know if you play the game for an hour\n\nI am really suggesting this game, I am safe to say that this game is near masterpiece.\nI think it is better than Harvest Moon as well...","February 28","true","58.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riolis/recommended/413150/","riolis","Riolis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riolis/","961 products in account","Haverst moon done right and more.\nI've always dreamt to play HM on PC ever since I played my first HM on the emulator. Those are great but you know it lacks some of the fun of playing it when they are not made for PC and unable to use your mouse. Years gone by, and the only way to get your HM fix is to own a multitude of consoles that are made by nintendo, and being someone from where nintendo device will cost upwards to a month of your full salary (or more), you had no choice to just keep on dreaming of it.\n\nFortunately after being burnt by tons of rpgmakers crap that are advertised as HM insipred/clone which don't even come close. This gem came out of the woodworks after being in developement for 3 years.\n\nNote that I am only 6 hours in. And this is what I can say for that hours, I don't have enough hours to review marriage, festival, livestocks, adventure part and the other part that I might not even experienced yet.\n\nPositive\nCutscenes and options!\nIn the typical HM games, Cutscenes is mostly consist of linear scripted scene, with your character as a bystander, watching as the thing plays. In Stardew, you are part of the cutscene, and you will be offered a choice and able to choose how the cutscene goes. This is effing great, as the cutscenes shows the personality of the said character, and give you a choice on how you would react to their personality.\n\nAnd it seems like there is plenty of those cutscene around, maybe for every character maybe? All the NPC that I befriended with 2 hearts seems to trigger an event, and if my assumption is correct, This game is EPIC. and all of it is uniquely different and entertaining.\n\nFarming plot\nis Huge! With the great object placement system, you can make the farm as how you want it. There is nothing else to be said about it, It just great the space you have to grow and customize.\n\nMeaningful map\nMap is large, but it's well sized, and meaningful, and unlike some other game, you can auto run and IT WONT DRAIN YOUR ENERGY (which is great!). But it is not large enough that you have to spend most of your in-game hours running, when you want to go to the store or when trying to find where any NPC is. And it is small enough that you can meet up more then a few in 1 area, which make the town feels alive.\n\nAlso the areas are uniquely different from 1 area to another, which is very refreshing.\n\nGifts\nHearts goes up much faster, and in a meaningful way. You are not forced to spam gift every single day and after 30 days of doing it, only able to increase it by 1 heart. Give a proper present at the right time. Huge bump on the relationship meter. Meaningful!\nPlus you are limited to 2 gift per person per week. Meaning you don't have to spend your time spamming gift, rather you can just choose the best gift, and only gift it anytime on that week. You can concretrate to farming, livestock, talking, exploring, adventuring, figuring out on how to make most money and such, while still have meaningful relationship with other character without grinding meaningless gift over and over again every single day. Brilliant!\n\nDialogs\nAnother thing I found refreshing is the dialog and how it is done. The NPC will only talk to you a few times and they won't talk to you anymore until tomorrow. Which make the dialog more valuable. Less is more, nay? You don't need to spam the NPC hoping to find out if there is anything new that he or she will say after increasing their relationship meter. If there anything new, he/she will say it out straight, one time and done. You can move on. No need to hear the same dialog over and over and over again.\n\nLess spammy in every way = great game.\n\nNegative\nFishing\nI can't seem to get myself to like this clickfest of a system. The bar is way to sensitive, holding or releasing for way too long will accelerate the bar upwards or downwards. So you are stuck with clicking your mouse nonstop so that the acceleration would stop and the bar would stay in one place.\n\nClick fest is not fun. Clicker is not fun, which is why people created auto click apps for those type of game. You have almost a zen-like feel throughout the game, and when you start to fish, the game pace changes dramatically. You don't have to click as much when you plant or water (which is a huge massive improvement from the typical HM games) why? oh why with this clicky nightmare. :(","February 27","true","73.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

But depends on how you play the game ofcourse.\n\nThe game is big 28 characters(alot to learn about them and no hand holding about that is neat, stimulates the brain in a positive way) or so and no hand holding! :D But info like this (*) would be alot helpfull if the game could tell by ingame book or ingame mail would be nice.\n\n*"The contents of this post are mainly by AndroidJazz and Astrobia. As we come across useful informaiton while playing the game we will post it here, feel free to contribute and we'll add your tips and tricks to this post.\n\nTips\n\nCrops:\n\n\n* Starter kits, strawberries and blue berries do not need to be replanted as they regrow during their season of growth , it is recomended you plant them at the start of the Season for maximum value for money. This is a good strategy for when money is short near the start of the game, however they will wither at the end of the season.\n\n* Pierres is cheaper for seeds than Joja Mart.\n\n* You can refill your watering can by going over to the pond on your farm or a body of water and right clicking.\n\n* Use rainy days to go meet people , give gifts and to do shopping since the rain takes care of watering your crops.\n\n* If you acidently hoed a bit of ground you did not want to hoe. use your pick axe to undo it or if you wish to save some time and energy just wait for it to return to normal.\n\n* At certain festivals you can get certain seeds, sometimes these festivals are in the middle of the season and these crops can grow all season long, the problem is you miss out on half of the season because of the date the festival is on, we recomend keeping these seeds for the for the same season during the next year or using the glass house once you have it to grow them.\n\n* Use a scare crow as Crows can steal the seeds you planted, Scare crows have a radius of 8 tiles, with a diameter of 16.\n\n* You can grow any crops year round with the glass house.\n\n* Walking or running over crops will not damage them.\n\n* As your harvesting skill improves you will have a chance to get a better crop yield.\n\n* A good way to water crops until you get a sprinkler is to stand in the middle of a 3x3 square of crops and with the watering can equipped hold down the left mouse button and zigzag through the rows.\n\n\n\nFishing:\n\n* Fishing is a great way to make extra money at the start of the game while you wait on your first few harvests.\n\n* Fish are used for the best fertaliser later, so if you find a low value fish and get a lot of them, stockpile them.\n\n* There is an increased chance to fish up treasure and higher level fish if you see a disturbance in the warer. Fish will also bite faster. You'll know you landed in the god spot when you see blue sparkles as the bobber lands.\n\n* Fish can only be sold in your farm box or at Willys store.(note: Willy pays the same as the box.)\n\n* Rainy days are a great time for going fishing because there are better fish out as a result of the rain, so make sure you go fishing on a rainy day with a full energy bar.\n\n* Keep the junk you get while fishing, it has a use later in the game!\n\nMining:\n\n* Stairs to get to the next level of a mine are under rocks, you need to keep breaking rocks until you find them, sometimes all the monsters in the cave level you are on need to be killed to reviel the stairs.\n\n* Getting to the mine is much faster if you go via the North exit in your field\n\n* Every 5 levels you unlock a floor on the elevator, which makes navigating the mines much easier.\n\n\n* Follow mine cart tracks, there is sometimes coal in a minecart at the end of them.\n\n* If you see a moving rock bash it with your pickaxe first and then use your sword once the rock is broken to kill the crab which was under it.\n\n* When you reach level 2 in mining you can craft your own stairs to place in the mines for 99 stone.\n\n* When upgrading your tools at the blacksmith, make sure you do all of your shopping and geode breaking first, otherwise you won't be able to do anything else at the black smiths until he finishes upgrading the tools.\n\nForaging:\n\n\n* You can get seeds from using your syche on the dark green weeds . Sap from cutting down trees, Sap can be used to make fertalizer later on, Trees also drop seeds.\n\n* Foraging alot of stuff? Craft a chest to hold your extra stuff to free up room in your inventory. A chest costs 50 lumber.\n\n* The type of plants and shells you can forage changes with the seasons\n\n* if you see a bush with barries click it to pick the berries.(Note: if your colour blind you may not see the berries)\n\n* After it rains there will always be new stuff washed up on the beach\n\n* Spending 300 lumber on repairing the bridge on the beach will lead to another beach which has valuable items to forage.\n\nForestry:\n\n\n* Trees fall away from the side you cut them on, so aim the tree into a clearing, walk to the side as they are falling. to pick up the wood as the tree falls.\n\n* If you cut down a tree and leave the stump, it grows back in 10 days.\n\n\nFriendship and relationships:\n\n* You get your pet on a random day in spring.\n\n* Suspicion: Marry abigail as her dad owns the local store, it might bring discounts or something along those lines later. please don't do this unless you like her or want to confirm my suspcion, I'm going to marry her and see what happens, although rasing your friendship with Pierre might do the this also.(Pierre is Abigails dad)\n\n* Mousing over buildings on the map tells you who lives in them and also the times which shops are opened and closed at. (note: it will not tell you who lives in the stores)\n\n\nMiscellaneous tips:\n\n* The game does not end after X amount of years.\n\n* Check the games option menu as there may be stuff you want to tweak.\n\n* To open doors and chests right click.\n\n* Shift - click to buy 5 items at a time.\n\n* Exiting the game does not save it, be sure to sleep first to save your game.\n\n* Use stuff you forage to give as gifts to people you wish to build relationships and it will cost you notting.\n\n* Check your tv daily for the next days weather, new rescipes and for your fortune, your fortune repersents your luck for the day, by right clicking it.\n\n* You can pick up chests by standing beside them and using your Axe.\n\n* If you see a message about a train and get to the station fast enough, items fall off the train as it passes by, which can be picked up, if you do not make it on time. there will be no items there for you to pick up.\n\n* Harvest and mine on days the fortune teller tells you, you will have a little extra luck, it is also worth going to the black smith and cracking geodes on these days.\n\n* Grow atleast 2 Jazz flowers or Tulips with each batch of crops if you wish to make alot of friends sooner rather than later to supplment foraging for flowers and shells to give as gifts.\n\n* Always use left over energy and time to do things like clearing your field or to go fishing ect. You can do this stuff up to 1am at the latest, you will faint at 2 am and be charged a doctors or Joja fee.\n\n* You will wake up with half of your energy if you stay up until after 12am\n\n* Check the trash cans in the town left from your farm once a day, they contain random items like food and metal bars of various kinds, however just do not let people see you do it as they seem to react negetively.\n\n* Unequip tools when walking around so that you don't acidently use them and waste energy, its worth getitng into the habit of not clicking unless you have to."","March 12","true","30.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

This indie dev did an amazing job.\nThe price of the game is also incredibly low, I like to value my time on games for 1$ = 1 hour at the very minimum. This game's blown it out of the water, and "AAA" games sometimes don't even hit that mark.

I had been anticipating its release for some time. I am not going to write an exhaustive review as there are many other great ones already. Just know that this game is a great mix of Harvest Moon / Zelda / Animal Crossing.\n\nAs a big fan of those games, this scratched that itch and more. I often worried because of the small developer I would see shortcomings or glaring flaws, not at all. This game is stellar in every way and vastly improves upon systems in all the games it was assumedly inspired by.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone that ever enjoyed games like Terraria, Harvest Moon, Zelda, and Animal Crossing.","March 9","true","64.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

You'll be saying that a lot.\nThis is my fist experience with a game like this, so there are others that could better describe exactly what sets this game apart from a gameplay perspective. However, what I can say is that I'm already completely in love with this game. It's extremely addicting and very easy to lose yourself in. There's an infectious charm just oozing out of it. You can really see and feel the love that went into this over the past 4 years. I still can't get over the fact that was all done by one guy.\n\nThe art is beautiful and deceptively detailed. The music is amazing and fits the game perfectly, and the sounds design as a whole feels spot on. The writing is also great so far with many interesting characters to meet, all of which have various interests, background stories, and personalities that range from the outlandish and quirky to very grounded and "real". The relatively detailed protraits of each of the townsfolk do a great job of showing emotions during dialogue. Mechanically everything feels very satisfying. There seems to be a ton of gameplay and story progression. There's significantly more to this game than I was expecting. It's a bit of a slow burn, mainly at the beginning, but I feel like the pacing of the game greatly works in its favor.\n\nThe only issue I've had with the game in my ~13 hours so far was a bug when I first started where my character glitched out during the opening cutscene. I restarted the game, there was a patch  waiting to download, and when it loaded back up everything worked perfectly.\n\nThe guy behind this game has been pretty incredible so far. He's already pushed out 5+ updates & hotfixes over the past few days, and doesn't seem to be slowing down. He has been very active in the community on Steam and Reddit. He also said recently that he's going to keep adding new content to the game, including things suggested by the community. Four player co-op is right around the corner too. There's already a seriously impressive amount of stuff to do as is. I'm having a hard time thinking of better things to spend $15 on if this type of game seems even remotely appealing to you.","March 1","true","40.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It has all the elements I love from HM, but with a more interesting world to explore, better combat, better conversations, QUESTS! and you can actually reach your plants to water them (bonus!)  And yes, quests, quests for the little dudes in the house and quests for the villagers.\n\nI wish the chest that you put your stuff in was bigger.  Good thing you can craft multiple chests to sore your ♥♥♥♥, no inventory limitation on the hoarders.  However, I now have about 8 chests and I have no idea what's in each one.  I have to look in each one to remember where I stored my wood.  I wish adding more chests just added to the inventory volume or something, and opening them would result in you being able to sort and see everything you own collectively.\n\nThe only thing I wish was that it was portable,  I played HM on my Gameboy's all over the place, on the train, on the bus, waiting for the doctor.  Now I'm chained to the PC.  But I'm also glad it's here on PC as this is the reason this game is so much better than HM or Rune Factory or any other game of this genre.  The screen means the world can be bigger, the interface can be more useful.\n\nThis game is cheaper over on GOG than here on Steam....\n\nYou won't regret getting this game, but your family might.\n\n10/10 would forget to feed my IRL kids again because I'm busy trying to shag an angry Joja worker who turns out isn't single.\n\nGame.

But what if you never got into those games or never experienced them at all?\n\nOk, this is a farming sim, BUT in a very loose way. You aren't so much focused on farming mechanics such as watching plants grow.\nYou plant them, water them, and then go about your day. What does your day entail? either you gather resources to build things, make social connections within the town, fish, play mini-games in the saloon, or dungeon crawl in the mine fighting monsters as you go.\n\nYou get to create your own character. Male or female, customized as much as a pixelated character can be. Which is pretty awesome. Already you see people doing fanfiction and drawings of their created character.\n\nTech wise, you can run this game. Trust me. Unless your computer is made of cardboard with parts from the early 90s, you can run this game. Not to mention a 300mb filespace. I mean, really small file. And YET, there is a LOT in this game. Totally surprised me.\n\nIf you want a relaxing game that has both RPG elements and farm-life simulation, then try this out.

When he died he left you a letter that you could only open if you want to change your life. After a few years you do open it, and inherit a (neglected) farm. You decide to buy a buss ticket, quit your current job and head to the farm.\nOnce there you will have short introduction of 2 townfolk visiting you. And then you are left to fend for yourself.\n\nWhen you start you will most likely clear out the land a little bit, and plant and grow some crops that you can sell when they have finished growing. After 2 seasons or so I had some more money to spare, and I decided to buy a small coop.\n\nIf you buy an animal houses, or expant your own house you have to go to Robin, who will make one for you. In exchange for money and materials. After a few days she will be ready with it, and then you can go to Marie to buy some baby animals. Who you can raise in the barn.\n\nThe animals have a happy stats bar, the more happy they are the more products they will produce. Also animals that are more happy can be sold again for a nice profit. Animals will get happy when they can go outside and if there is enough food for them. If you have a silo you can also store hay in it, then animals still get enough food in winter and during rainy days when they don't want to go outside.\nHay can be obtained by cutting grass in the field.\n\nNext to being a farmer you also have skills for mining, fishing, combat and foraging.\nIf you walk around the world you will find items you can gather for selling or eating. There is a mine where you can get resources like copper and iron to upgrade your tools to make them more efficient, and to craft new farm products. But also beware, in the mine there could be other creatures hiding as well.\n\nAlso if you have upgraded your house you could use your own farm products and start cooking, making better meals for yourself or other townfolk.\n\nDuring the game you will also interact with the townfolk yourself, and build a relation with them. You can become friends with them, and if you do they will open up more to you. You can even go so far thet if you befriend a single character, then you can even fall in love, marry, live together on your farm, and have a baby.\n\nThere is so much to do in this game, it can keep you occupied for a while.\nAnd also don't forget that there is a real season and day/night cycle, and even the weather changes every day.\nNext to that, strange things happen around the farm and the town. Strange noices, strange notes etc. Something fishy is going on, and the mystery thickens as you progress in the game.","March 19","true","60.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

Aside from being a rock solidly designed farm sim with bright vibrant pixel art graphics and endearing music, there's a lot of heart underneath every conversation and a lot of love oozing from every design choice.\n\nIn addition to all of that, the depth of the game and complexity of its sytems is stunning and nearly overwhelming. You can stay as shallow or go as deep (literally) as you want. The goals are there, the rewards for being vigilant and fast are there too, but you can also just relax, slow down, and drink deeply from a game catering to people who want a different type of experience from your typical popular title.\n\nThe stories that you suss out of the town's residents are the stories of all of us, the highschool jock trying to get go pro and leave behind his tiny town, the full cadre of desperate citizens worried about their lot, their children, their place in the world, the weary local government who remembers a time when community meant something, the mega corporation trying to undermine it all.

No formal review needed, but I guess I'll run through every aspect.\n\nGameplay - really intuitive, and it works great through all aspects. The combat is a little simple, but I'm just happy to see combat in a game like this. the UI sometimes interferes with gameplay aspects, such as interacting with your farm animals. If two of them are close to each other, you can only interact with one of them until one moves, and running into them doesn't get them to move 100% of the time.\n\nSound/Music - Sound design is completely original, and the music was done by the sole developer himself. All of it is incredible, and If that doesn't scream dedication then I don't know what will.\n\nValue - As of 4/4/2016 I've clocked over 100 hours into stardew valley, and I'm far from accomplishing everything there is to accomplish in the game.  Very absorbing.\n\nGraphics? - Look at the screenshots. If the art style doesn't appeal to you then oh well. It fits the game like a glove, and the experience is better because of it. Older gamers who played Harvest Moon will appreciate the style.\n\nNPC Interaction - Widely varied. It will take a long while for you to exhaust all the dialogue in a single character, as they have more to say as you improve your relationship to them. Just for reference, I've yet to have a maxed out relationship with even half of the characters, so I've got a lot of interactions to go. Also, each character has a distinct personality. If you simply read the text of a character without knowing who spoke it, you'd have a good chance at guessing who it was.\n\nWriting - On that note, is the writing any good? Well, since I praised the NPC interations for being varied and detailed, the answer is yes, yes it is. My only wish is for an much larger bank of conversations to be had with the person you end up marrying\n\nIn conclusion, and repeating my earlier statement: buy this game.","April 4","true","120.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You can be a simple farmer, a full Keg Production Baron or Diamond Production Baron. (You gain a LOT of Money this way but kinda spoils the point of the story as to why you left the City)\nThere is not really many bugs/glitches that I have encountered.

I don't normally play RPG style farming games, mostly FPS in the recent months, and this game has turned my eyes to a new light of gaming. Stardew Valley is much more innovative and intuitive than other games in its genre, and I hope that the dev team continues to work on this game in their best efforts so that everyone can experience the 4 player co-op sometime this year. (My original plans were to wait until the multiplayer came out to give it a try, but I didn't have anything else to do... Man was I happy I tried this game early!) Everyone... Even if you don't normally play this kind of a game... PLEASE give it a chance!

You know, the ones that reward you for lazily mulling around and enjoying the scenery, the ones that don't briskly shove you into anything or rush you along. Stardew Valley lets you move at a pace of your own choosing. There are so many things to do that even 11 hours in, I feel as though I've still barely scratched the surface. I've loved every Harvest Moon game that's cropped up (no pun intended) and I expected Stardew Valley to be akin to those games. It's better. It has the Midas touch of a developer who has truly devoted countless hours into polishing, pored over every detail and considered every possibility. It exudes the passion and dedication that was put into it.\n\nPROS\n+ Endless hours of gameplay.\n+ The fishing. Some people are going to disagree with me, but I love the occasional challenge it presents.\n+ It is visually gorgeous - every tree, building and shrub is perfect. The water is mesmerizing.\n+ Unlike other farming-focused titles, it has combat! I'm down with any game that lets me murder happy slimes.\n+ Complete creative freedom to build your own farm as you want it.\n+ The soundtrack is catchy and fits beautifully.\n+ I could just about write "the game in its glorious entirety" here, but it'd make my review pretty short.\n\nCONS\n- Not so much a con as a personal preference (read: it's really not even a con, to be honest), it can sometimes be difficult to track down NPCs when you need them. I'd have liked to see icons on the map or some other way to more easily locate people to complete jobs and romance them (mostly Abigail).\n- You move slowly. Not glacially, but still slowly. The horse is expensive and at the end of a long list of things that I feel need to be prioritized over it (again, this is more of a personal preference). I think a pair of boots that increases speed a little might be a nice idea.\n- When items have been donated to the museum, there isn't much of a write-up for each object. Not a big deal, but it'd be nice to see more information about the trinkets you pick up.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a fan of the genre, growing parsnips or just stealing breadsticks out of people's trash and haven't bought the game yet, it is SO INCREDIBLY CHEAP for the countless hours of enjoyment it offers.

Stardew Valley is truly the game that any Harvest Moon fan has been waiting for.\n\nThe controls are fluid and responsive, the sound effects match everything that is happening, the music is relaxing and well-written, it's easy to resize the window to fit your needs, the art is pleasing to the eye--I really could go on and on... My most favourite thing about the game, however, is how immersive it is. Sometimes you'll see frogs hop by, or birds that fly away when you run past them, and the NPC's even greet each other when they pass one another, and for a game that was crafted entirely by one person, it's astonishing how in tune to the fine details the dev was.\n\nMy only gripe is while the controls are responsive and make sense, they do take some getting used to, it's easy to fumble up your finger placement and open up your inventory when you're trying to walk. But, I suppose that is something easily fixed in the options. Also, the running speed is a tad slow, if you find yourself uncomfortably holding shift for too long, you can actually turn running on automatically in the options, which is a fantastic option... but it still takes a while to get around town compared to how quickly time can go by.\n\nNot only is the game itself fantastic, but the dev is as well.

I would say its in my top10 of the 2016.\n\nIts just improved Harvest Moon in every way, what not to love. There is a lot of content , up to 3 years + you can play infinitely. But you don't really need to hurry, some objectives can take a very long time. Not everything is perfect though.\n\nYou can go full min&max or casually enjoy the game, this game is very enjoyable and not stressfull.\n\nExperienced 0 crashes and 0 FPS issues, only few bugs which were very quickly fixed by the Developer.\n\nNow some stuff that needs to be improved:\nGame lacks with the post-marriage and family events. I kinda hoped that my daughter/son will grow up and everyone else in the town will also grow up and new local marriages between Bachelors will happen. They could also have kids\nCooking is not really fleshed out, it could use a new skill-tree focused on the cooking so you could cook and sell dishes etc. Also you should be able to discover recipes by yourself , by trying random things. ie "what if I put tomatoe into the mixer?, oh I got ketchup" Harvest Moon did a cooking little bit better. Right now you are stuck with the recipes, which is not bad but allowing the player to discover recipes by themselves would be better.\nSkills and perks, its a nice feature but some of the skills are really not good. Before I got to level 10 mining perk I already had so much money so I could buy coal directly from the shop. No need for skill that improves +2 coal drop\nLack of proper tutorials, it took me a while to figure out the fishing system. But once I got it to work its really sweet part of the game that actually rewards the skilled player.\nEconomic balance. This game needs a supply&demand because you can simply cheat and spam 1 plant type and earn tons of cash. Just make it that the more you sell of the same crop = you get less money. It would force player to use more variety of crops to balance the market prices.\nNeed more gold sinks\nMore events that need you to actually participate , like horse/dog race, animal showcases, cooking events etc\nNPCs could use also a little bit more variety of dialogues, they get a little repetive after a while.\nIt looks like I gave too many minuses but I just pointed out features that needs a improvement and it does not hamper your experience in any way.\n\nFinally we have a PC exlusive Harvest Moon ,   just one more day syndrome","March 4","true","60.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Don't wait for a sale! This is the Harvest Moon game you've been waiting for!\n\nDeveloped largely by one man, Stardew Valley takes the genre's best mechanics and wraps them into a perfect little package. The creator, Eric Barone, has clearly put in his time with the Harvest Moon series. It really feels like he mixed & matched the best features from games like HM: Friends of Mineral Town and HM: A Wonderful Life.\n\nOK, so there's the standard storyline: Tired of city life, you move out to your grandfather's old farm. From there, it's your job to repair, replant, and reap the rewards. The town people are nice, with much more realistic dialogue than typical. Look, I haven't played too far into it yet, but I can say for certain I never want a refund on this. As of this writing I have a little under 2 hours logged, but it's good and can only get better!\n\nIn other news, the port is good with room for improvement. There's support for oodles of resolutions and all three screen modes, including the coveted Windowed-Borderless Mode. A minor issue I encountered was my mouse cursor moving to the top left-hand corner of the screen. It only happens when you talk to someone so it isn't a big deal. I'm betting it will be fixed soon.\n\nThank you Mr. Barone for making such a wonderful farming game!\n\nOh, and thank you (the viewer) for reading this! =D\n\n\nEdit 2/28/16: The cursor problem was fixed by removing my xbox controller.","February 27","true","27.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is perfect, and the developer is one of the most attentive in the entire business right now.\n\nGaming would be completely different if only there were more people like him.\n\nIf you're wondering whether or not this game stands up to the hype - it exceeds it. 3 years in the making and it genuinely shows, this game beats ANY other one-man project that has ever been created, absolutely and completely.\n\nThis is the best game I've ever played in terms of the level of work that has gone into it. Simply outstanding.\n\nIf you only buy one game this year, buy this.\n\nIf you want to support a developer who is wholly dedicated to his craft, someone whose love for games really shows through in his creation, someone who actually cares what his audience wants and needs, buy this game.\n\nGo on, buy it now. Do it. You won't be disappointed.\n\nAnd if you're wondering: the verdict among everyone who I've spoken to, friends and strangers, is that this game beats EVERY SINGLE Harvest Moon there's ever been in terms of depth, gameplay and fun. That's no small feat for a single developer held up against one of the most popular and talked about series of all time. This is truly something incredible.\n\nGames and developers like this don't come along often at all; few will ever be able to produce something as strong as this game no matter how hard they try - ConcernedApe has proven he is the pinnacle polymath when it comes to indie developers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/413150/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","THINGS THAT ARE EXACTLY LIKE HARVEST MOON:\n—Seasonal plants\n—Buy seeds, plant them, water them, harvest them, put them in the box, etc\n—Give NPCs gifts to make them like you more (note: unlike harvest moon, their affection doesn’t increase by just talking to them, so you don’t have to spam the same stupid conversations over and over… gifts is the only way to boost their affection level)\n—Chop logs, mine ores, forage for edible/useful things in the wild\n—Take a hot both to recover energy\n—Buy cows and chickens to sell eggs/milk or convert them to cheese, mayonnaise, etc\n—Have a pet to watch over your farm (you get your choice of cat or dog)\n—Buy a horse\n—Go fishing\n—Special holidays where the townspeople gather together to compete in contests / mini-games\n—In short: It has everything harvest moon has.\n\nBut it DOES add some stuff or tweak some stuff.\n\nDIFFERENT FROM / IN ADDITION TO HARVEST MOON:\n—SV has a crafting system that lets you build new tools of various kinds. For example, you have to build a furnace to conver your ores into bars, but the furnace requires coals, which can be mined, purchased, or you can build a kiln that converts wood into coal. Crafting is also how you construct fences, gates, scarecrows (yes, the crows really WILL attack your crops), fishing traps, and all kinds of other things. My personal favorite is that you can build sprinklers that will automatically water the plants around them within a certain range every morning. One of my least favorite things about Harvest Moon is f***ing around with keeping the little gnomes happy so they will start to help and continue to help. But in this game you just build some sprinklers, set it, and forget it until harvest time. (Obviously you can’t build these right away, as the materials are more advanced.)\n\n—Despite the crafting system, there are still shops, and they are vital.\n\n—Fishing is actually interesting because it actually involves a mini-game. Instead of just waiting for the “!” and pressing a button, as Harvest Moon has you do, SV makes you go through a mini game where you have to keep a rectangle centered over a fish that’s moving up and down a meter shaped like a fishing pole. The rectangle feels “heavy” though, and I think it is supposed to represent you balancing the strength of your pull with the line tension. Anyway, it’s pretty difficult starting out. Different fish have different difficulties as well. Some fish just roll over and let you reel them in, whereas other types of fish make you grit your teeth trying to keep them on the line.\n\n—The mine is waaaaay better. In harvest moon you just break rocks. In this game, the mine is also full of dangerous creatures, so you have to take a pickaxe AND weapon along with you. So it’s a combination dungeon/mine. You get ores and minerals from the mining, but you also get special drops from the critters you slay in there. Harvest Moon makes you start the mine over from the first level every time you go in, whereas SV has checkpoints that let you take an elevator down to a certain floor you already visited and continue from there.\n\n—You get lots of “missions” in SV that are tracked on a mission list. Sometimes NPCs will claim to have lost a personal possession and ask you to look for it. (These are not time-sensitive, so you just have to keep your eyes peeled while you go about your usual business). Sometimes they will ask you to bring them a certain type of plant or object. Sometimes you’ll have to craft a certain thing, or place X number of a certain type of object, etc. You usually get paid 250 to 600 range for completing one of these.\n\n—You can be male or female in this game, and you can choose male or female romantic partners. You also get to customize your hair, eyes, facial accessories, clothing color, etc when you first start the game.\n\n—Is more like an RPG in certain ways. In addition to improving your basic equipment (e.g. wood, copper, iron, etc), you also have skills that level up the more you use them. So the more you farm, you level your farm skill. The more you fish, you level up your fish skill. Leveling up your skills makes doing that job easier, and if you level them up enough, then at two points you are asked to pick a bonus. For example, if you level up foraging enough it asks you to choose between: Bonus A: all foraged plants sell for 10% more, Bonus B: every time you forage a wild plant, there is a chance you’ll get an extra one for free. Something similar with all other skills.\n\n—Has a museum and a community center, which are sort of two versions of the same idea. Basically, the museum is a place that asks you to donate rare items in exchage for occasional monetary rewards or unique prizes you can’t get elsewhere (e.g. special furniture for your house and so on). The community center is an abandoned building full of strange little creatures that challenge you to complete certain collections for them, which basically means bringing them one of each item under a certain category. When you complete a collection, you get a prize, and it’s usually a pretty good prize. It incentivizes you to explore all the game’s systems (farming, foraging, fishing, cooking, mining, etc). But if you’re the kind of person who just wants to farm and that’s it, the game does have a workaround that lets you get all the same bonuses without completing the community center challenges. (Something to do with buying a membership at the evil supermarket conglomerate in town.)\n\n—Build your own storage containers and place them anywhere you want, unlike Harvest Moon which gives you only a certain number of storage units (albeit nearly bottomless ones) and doesn’t let you choose where they go.\n\n—In addition to the harvest moon thing where you pay the carpenter to upgrade the size of your house, you can also go to a different shop to buy other customizations, like windows, paintings, wallpapers, floors, furniture, decor, etc.\n\n—Unlike harvest moon, you don’t have to remember or write down all those damned recipes. If you hear a recipe on tv, buy it from someone, or hear it in conversation, etc, the game just adds it to your recipe list in your kitchen so you’ll have it forever.\n\n—Personal opinion: NPCs are more interesting and have more well-defined characters/personalities than in Harvest Moon.\n\n—One thing that might throw you off at first: Unlike Harvest Moon, SV does not stop time when you are inside of buildings (but it does stop time during dialogues). So that takes some getting used to if you are used to leaning on that like a crutch. But SV has much longer days and gives you much more initial energy to work with, so in the end it shakes out fine.\n\n—The town/wilderness is much, much, much bigger than Harvest Moon.\n\n—You don’t start with a barn, coop, and stable. You have to pay to have those constructed, but the carpenter makes you pick a plot on your farm where you want it to be built (yes, you get to choose!) and the plot has to be clear, so you have to make sure you chop down all the trees and crap before you go all the way to the carpenter’s place. Also? You can buy more than one coop/barn/stable if you want to.\n\n--It seems like such a small thing, but it is very nice that you don't have to rush to beat the pickup guy to your dropbox every day. Instead, all your stuff just gets sold as soon as you go to sleep, regardless of when that is, so no more missing the pickup guy by two seconds or wondering if it still counts if you put items in while he's standing at the box, etc.\n\n--Also, it it is TREMENDOUSLY nice that after you fall asleep each night, the game gives you an itemized list of everything you sold and how much it sold for. This is so much f***ing easier than Harvest Moon where you have to go try and look it up at the library.\n\nThis game made me stop playing Fallout 4.

It is very cathartic, as you do everything at your own pace. There are no real deadlines, just guidelines. There's no 'game over'. Just enjoy yourself and figure out what you want to do today.\n\nThings I liked:\n- Very relaxed gameplay. Do what you want to do, no more, no less.\n- Art style is charming.\n- Plenty of different things to do to appeal to different tastes or moods.\n- Characters have nice designs.\n- Game is very easy to mod to different tastes.\n- The wonderful and dedicated dev, ConcernedApe, really put his heart and soul into this, and is great about listening to feedback, bug fixing, and adding things to the game.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n- As a personal preference, I don't like really 'grind-y' games. So I got some mods that helped me with that aspect of the game, problem solved. No need to change this about the game itself, just go find mods that suit your play style.\n- The characters are quite one-dimensional, even the ones that change over time. I don't really feel connected to them at all, they all very heavily rely on tropes just like the Harvest Moon characters.\n- Post-marriage life is definitely an area that the dev has not gotten around to expanding on yet, but he seems to be working on this. I especially dislike the jealousy aspects when I simply want to become friends with all the villagers.\n- The sprinklers, scarecrows etc that have an 'area of effect' radius do not show you the radius when you are placing them, which is quite a hassle.\n- I do not like that the mayonnaise machine, ore furnaces, etc. do not allow you to put multiple batches in and just run it in the background; I would prefer that over having to replace the coal and ore every single time it makes one jar/ore bar. It is very, very tedious and not my thing.\n- Harvey has a dumb mustache, y'all.

Your game CRASHES. You try to go back in the game and EVERYTHING is GONE and you have to do everything ALL over again but apparently your "luck" runs out and you don't find all the awesome stuff you found earlier. Just complete madness.\n\nPlease, Chucklefish, I love this game, I really do, but please make it so that we can save our game on the fly.\n\nI'm sorry to those people who judge other players of "Save scumming", but I bought this game for me to have fun and to, hopefully, support the developer that made this game, not to be judged that I'm playing the game wrong because seriously, this is a video game, not a chore.\n\nWhoever invented that term 'Save scumming' is no better than real-life 'bullies'.","April 17","true","21.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","6"

I only saw it on Steam, not hearing a thing about the new RPG farming simulator until a few days before its release. Now, it’s all I seem to hear about in all my newsfeeds – not that I’m complaining. Developed by one-man powerhouse ConcernedApe and published by Chucklefish (the same fish that brought us Starbound), Stardew Valley is often likened as Harvest Moon‘s spiritual successor. That comparison only scratches the surface.\n\n[...]\n\nI got right to work on the first day. I cleared some land immediately around my house and began to till a few plots for those seeds. Normally I get bored quickly with crafting-based games, especially if I’m by myself. There’s only so many rocks I can collect or trees to cut down before I lose interest, regardless of how many cool recipes and blueprints there might be. But there’s something satisfying about starting with virtually nothing and turning things around through hard work and elbow grease. Well… at least, for your avatar. As I went about my chores the following few days, I soon learned that Grandpa was right: this was refreshing.\n\nThere’s more to Stardew Valley than just farming, though. With an intricate crafting system, you can process raw materials into decorative objects like cobblestone or wooden walkways, or useful equipment like scarecrows to protect your crops or a furnaces to melt down the various ores you stumble across. After a while, you can even cook food from the crops and various flowers, herbs, and seeds you find as you explore Pelican Town nearby and the surrounding countryside.\n\nI think what surprised me the most was the amount of depth that’s gone into the game’s universe. Each of the townspeople have their own schedules and even birthdays, with opportunities to befriend and romance them if you’d want. If you don’t want to schmooze, you can always go fishing, delve into monster-infested mines and go exploring, or make nice with the local wizard. Seasons pass, featuring festivals and varied weather that you can use to your advantage. For example, you don’t need to worry about watering your crops when it rains – or at all, really, if it’s winter. If you have a hard time figuring out what to do, your handy journal will keep track of your quests and point you in the right direction. The game also features a sort of Pokédex of vegetables that shows all the various crops and objects you can find, assuring Stardew Valley‘s success by preying on gamerkind’s rampant OCD.","March 7","true","24.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is finally the amazing creation in which I had hoped it would be.\n\n- If you enjoyed playing harvest moon than this game is absolutley for you.\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful. Ive listened to every song and I have to comment how well every track is composed.\nThe art style is awesome. This colorful yet simple pixel art style is one that I just simply love. With sprites that are animted just a little here and there to give the characters a feeling that makes them sort of alive.\nThe gameplay - its everything I didnt expect. Its a certainly new take on the "Farming" (?) genre. Combining a type of sandbox with a little bit of creativity at your fingertips and dirt on your hands as you work. And with Mutiplayer just around the corner (Or if its out when you read this) Its double. No, Triple. No, Quadruple the fun with up to four people.\n\nThis may not be the most helpful review but I would like to personally say, Thank You so much and Congradulations Concerned Ape. You've created a beautiful game that thousands of people will enjoy and continue to enjoy for years to come. Thank You for putting so much of your time and effort in to give us this gift.","February 26","true","23.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

To say that the series has gone downhill since the glory days is an understatement. There have been ups and downs, but mostly downs. My favorite games in the series are Back to Nature, Friends of Mineral Town, Magical Melody, HM64, and Animal Parade. I never cared much for the Rune Factory series, and I was never convinced that Harvest Moon needed a combat system. But then Stardew Valley was announced and I immediately started paying attention... yet I remained cautiously optimistic.\n\nSo if my story sounds a lot like yours, then let me say that you should NOT hesitate to pick up Stardew Valley RIGHT NOW. This is the laid-back, charming farm simulator you've been waiting for. There are tons of events, crops, villagers, recipes, decorations, etc. It's MORE of what you want with a new twist: COMBAT! Now going into the mines offers an extra layer of challenge that really sets this game apart from the HM series. And with the quest system, museum collections, and Community Center challenges, you have a ton of things to occupy yourself with while earning awesome rewards. I'm only scratching the surface of Stardew Valley, but I can already tell that it's going to give me at least 100 hours of entertainment.\n\nAND DID I MENTION THE SOUNDTRACK?

The game is fun, the sprites look great, and it has kept me interested and eager to play for the 2 hours I've been able to put into it.  My one biggest gripe is movement using a xbox 360 controller. Diagonal movement is very sluggish and slow. I tend to move my character on a grid by going in straight directions to go anywhere. This is mostly an annoyance but I would like to see it addressed.  I also wish there was a way to travel a bit faster near the beginning of the game.  This may be old age speaking but I hate the time wasted walking into the village and back when I wish I were farming or interacting with villagers.  I know animals can be used as a mount but maybe a bicycle?  For all I know this already exists and I just haven't reached that point, but if it does I wish it were available sooner.\n\nSo this is a quick and dirty review just to say I'm loving the game and highly recommend it to all. I'll chime in later with an update after I have some more time invested.","February 26","true","68.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is both right and wrong; it is a farming game where you can raise animals or crops, there is a mine, you can romance several of the villagers... but a lot of these features are more features of the genre. Where Stardew Valley excels compared to games like Harvest Moon is in its' execution. Crops can be placed individually, watered individually, all the little technical niggles that took other games many iterations to perfect, Stardew Valley gets right the first time.\n\nAdd in a stunning variety of crops and animals and things to do, a likeable, believeable cast of villagers to befriend or romance, sprite art that is full-fledged rather than lazy micro-pixels, and a soundtrack I wouldn't mind listening to again and again, and you have an amazing game-- in a genre that is practically nonexistant on PC.\n\nShould you buy this game? Absolutely. I won't say it will convince you on the genre if you don't like it, but if you're even neutral about farming sims, Stardew Valley is worth your money, and more importantly, it is worth your time.","February 27","true","61.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was instantly attracted to the game which reminded me a lot of one of the most played games of my childhood, Harvest Moon 64. At $15, I figured it was worth a look.\n\nAfter spending around 30 hour with the game, I can honestly say that it's been worth every penny and more. It is clearly influenced by the aforementioned Harvest Moon series, and that's a great thing. The developer has taken everything that I loved about those games and has improved upon them with Stardew Valley.\n\nThe game mechanics are very simple and easy to use. There are a lot of things to do in the Valley and they can all be done at your own pace. It offers a very relaxing experience where the player is free to do as they choose.\n\nThe people of Pelican Town all have very distinct personalities. As you get to know each citizen, not only will they provide you with items and useful information, but they will sometimes give you "quests".  One of the first of these quests I was given came from Mayor Lewis. He needed me to track down his misplaced purple shorts and return them discreetly. I was very surprised when I actually stumbled upon them.\n\nI'm about midway through my first winter and am having a blast with Stardew Valley.

It's nostalgic while still adding a fresh experience enough to keep even the most veteran of moonies happy. As someone who's been playing them for years, I haven't found one I could really sink the time into since those days of old. A New Beginning and Story of Seasons tried but they were just sort of missing something..\n\nStardew brings a little bit of everything I love to the table, like a light mix of Rune Factory, Harvest Moon & happiness. The characters are all really cool in their own ways, they all have their surprises, I find myself wanting to talk to them and get to know them as opposed to how I almost auto-pilot through the recent SoS or ANB.. I take my time, I read, I put forth effort in farming..\n\nI think this game has done a great job of capturing the essence of a good casual farming experience with things to work for. Thank you ConcernedApe for everything and all the hard work you've put into this game the last 5+ years.

Everything is smooth until I start hacking rocks apart to find the ladder down to 20 before I run out of energy.\n\n10 hours in and I start piling flowers and gifts on everyone to catch up making friends.  9 out of 10 rejected my gift.   Stanley liked his though.  Stomach bruises are healing.","March 2","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is the game i've wanted to exist for at least a decade. Finally somone has stepped up to the plate and i belive in the end has delivered a wonderful product.\n\nThis game takes what made the earlier Harvest Moon games great and adds it's own twist to the mix. The foundation of this title seems ot be freedom, you are free to play however you wish, in every facet of the game. From how you run your farm, to who you date to your character cutomisation nothing is locked down, this means bearded ladies and same gender marriage are a thing and in the end isn't that what everyone really wants? Freedom that is, the demand for bearded lesbians is much lower and finally satisfied.\nWhether you want to relax on the farm raising sheep and hens, raise your heartbeat fighting monsters in a dark cavern, or even wrestle with a fishing rod at midnight in the rain, this title ticks all the boxes.\n\nIn the end, while the game has some minor quibbles like the run speed being a little slow, and the fishing minigame being a little difficult at first. Overall, in my opinion at least, this charming game is a must have, and a strong early contender for my personal Game of the Year.\n\n10/10.\n12/10 with rice.","February 28","true","59.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The day it popped up on Steam I had to pick it up, and I'm so glad I did. It's a well made game that's so relaxing, interesting, and fun. I've looked at the clock multiple times thinking where did the time go.\n\nIf you're into the RPG genre where you can build relations and craft items and explore mines, then this game will probably tickle your fancy. This game has made me feel and has made me laugh.\n\nShould also be noted that every little detail is perfect from the traits of the villagers matching their portraits and their responses to your dialogue, to the music during any cutscene or area of the map. It all ties in so well together to make a perfect great experience. I haven't once been like "well that broke my immersion."

There’s various ways to play the game so you don’t even have to farm if you chose to: Mining, Fishing, Foraging, and Livestock are all well-thought out options. Gameplay is reminiscent of the classic SNES Harvest Moon in which time-management is critical to play: time in game moves at a break-neck pace, requiring you to thoughtfully plan out your actions each day. So don’t come into this expecting a Facebook farm-simulator, this is an actual game with challenge.\nWhat also makes this game special is its development by a single developer, visuals, audio, coding, music, all done by one person over the course of four years. The amount of sprite variations is daunting given that each sprite can change based on time, day, season, and weather. The entry fee is well worth the gameplay, so low its literally unheard of by indie developer standards.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this game to pure casual players, or players looking for something more than a resource simulator. Stardew Valley faithfully sticks to its core vision as the SNES Harvest Moon everyone wanted but never received. It just took one man’s vision to make it a reality.","February 28","true","50.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is for you\nTaking everything HM style games have done and adding even more depth, stardew valley is a absolutely fantastic game.\n\nPros:\nA interesting crafting system.\nMore interesting NPCs (then most HM games).\nFarm customization is excelent, build paths, fences, sprinklers for auto watering, scarecrows to, well, scare crows and save crops.\nAdventurers guild and combat.\nA veriety of quests both in tutorial form and random ones available daily for extra cash/rep,\n(far more then i could list here in a short ammount of time)\n\nCons:\nFor the most part very few, i have encountered little to no bugs or issues.\nThe only real con so far would be the character speed, when you start out you are slow as hell and considering your limited time in the day you may find your spending a large ammount of time just getting from a to b, though there are items/horse to speed you up eventually,\n\nSo if your new to this type of game or a returning vetren there is no reason not to pick up this incredable game.\n(especially considering hinted additional content drops and possible multiplayer!!!)\nAnd of course if your interested, my playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOCBEcNdfIeWFALJi5nzqRkH9B9Zdf1O4","March 1","true","53.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Calm and relaxing, an easy way to destress. Enough character customizing that I was able to make her feel like my own allowing me to be more invested in what I was doing. Easy pacing that allows me to do things on my own time. And the game itself looks beautiful and interesting.\n\nTo add to it the story and characters are relatable in a way I didn't think a farming RPGish game could be and in some instances hit very very close to home with things I think a lot of us have experienced, without making it so heavy that it brings down the tone of the game. Everything is still very happy and fun and lighthearted with just enough 'real' moments to help you relate to and become close to the characters you're interacting with and the story that's unfolding around you.\n\nI love this game.

Well it is a PC iteration of a SNES series called "Harvest Moon". It is a farm simulation role-playing game developed entirely by, ConcernedApe (Eric Barone). From what I've heard, this game has been programed in C# for approximately 2.5 years.\n\nSide NotesThe game has Xbox One and Xbox 360 controller support.\n\nWhat is so special about Stardew Valley?This was my exact question before actually making a purchase, myself. Stardew Valley is an never ending farm simulation game, but wait there is more to it. It is not only a farm simulation game, but even a dungeon crawler. In short, this game has it's own twist on "Harvest Moon", by incorporating a lot of good ideas from both Terraria and Minecraft. What is even more interesting, this game features a very strategical gameplay. Not only you have to manage your energy and find ways to restore it, but even race against the clock. This is sort of time managing game, you can not do everything at once. However, you can try, but you will most likely fail. Each day you will find yourself doing different tasks. As a last note, Stardew Valley has no real story or linear questing. Therefore, you might feel lost in the beginning, but when you get a hang of the game. Trust me, it is way too big with the time given both in game and real life.\n\nWhat can you do in Stardew Valley?-You can be a rancher, gardener or both at the same time.\n-Buy, plant, water, harvest, sell or gift your berries and vegetables.\n-Build, buy and care for your chickens, cows, pigs, horses or even a pet. (Dog or cat).\n-As you progress gain new skills that will help you forge your way ahead.\n-Invent new equipment that you've gained by leveling different skills.\n-Participate in community events. (Easter egg hunt, dancing contest...)\n-4 different seasons, to make things more spicy. (Challenge cap.)\n-You can be a fisherman.\n-You can be a cook.\n-You can be a gatherer. (Berries and all that good stuff.)\n-You can be a woodcutter.\n-You can work with a wizard and solve the towns mysteries of the abandoned community building.\n-You can restore community building to it's former glory.\n-You can do random quests that you find on the billboard or your post.\n-You can be an adventurer who crawls the mines for epic loot and fortune.\n-You can donate your archeoligcal findings to the community archaeologist.\n-Protect the town from whatever might loom in the mines by joining adventurers guild and performing various tasks for them.\n-You can be friendly and proud community member. (Giving various gifts to locals, talking to them.)\n-You can be a proud family man or woman, and make a living in this small community. Perhaps even get a kid or two? It is your choice.\n-You can side with the locals and make a stand against a big corporation who is trying to overtake the town.\n-You can side with the big corporation for your own goals. Mostly money, though. :Horse:\n-In short this game has no ending or true goals, it might look small, yet it is too big to have an actually ending.\n-You will have at least hundred of hours replayability and challenging progression.\n-More things to come... This is everything that I've so far managed to uncover.\n\nThings yet to come in Stardew Valley-4 player co-op\n-Game patches\n-New content\n\n\nIf this is your cup of tea, what are you waiting for? This game is barely $15.","March 2","true","102.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I am hoping for more NPC development across the years (wouldn't it be cool to see your neighbors grow up and get married, too?) and a future multiplayer option, but overall, this game is solid.

You'll sink 20 hours into it before you notice that it'll take at least another 80 to get to the point that you set at the very beginning. Each activity holds a certain challenge and each one of them (there are at least 7 that I can think of right now) takes a huge chunk of your time. There's just so much to do and all of it feels rewarding.\n\nThere are a few things that aren't that great. The fishing for example can be quite frustrating and it doesn't get much easier the more you do it. The fighting mechanics as well as the farming ones aren't exactly great. In the overall sale those things are minor though.\n\nThere's a lot to discover past the limits of your farm and the more you get yourself involved in the events and people of Stardew Valley, the more the game drags you in.\n\nExpect to put a lot of hours into this game and then the 15$ seem like very little for how much fun you get out of this gem :)","April 19","true","186.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

That is a great testament to how fun and addictive this game is. Having said that, once I hit the 90-95 hour mark, things started to get tedious and I sort of ran out of new things to do and discover. But I was fully entertained every minute I spent playing this game up to that point.\n\nIf I have to pick one word to describe this game, it would be "cute". Everything from the animations, the cat smiley face in the speech bubbles, the diversity of the characters you meet and interact with in the town, the feeling you get when you finally win the heart of the girl/guy you've been wooing for so long, the sounds, the music! Oh, the music. It's really good.\n\nContent wise, I have rarely seen a game this "small" with that much stuff packed into it. Besides the main storyline - you being the rookie farmer, trying to re-establish your grandpa's old farm and make it on your own - there are tons of quests, content/areas that unlock as you progress and lots and lots of secrets to be found.\n\nAbsolutely recommended.","April 17","true","98.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enhshamis/recommended/413150/","enhshamis","Harkus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enhshamis/","504 products in account","Since quite a few people were asking about this game, I've decided to make an early review.\nSo what exactly is Stardew Valley? Well it is a PC iteration of a SNES series called "Harvest Moon". It is a farm simulation role-playing game developed entirely by, ConcernedApe (Eric Barone). From what I've heard, this game has been programed in C# for approximately 2.5 years.\n\nSide NotesThe game has Xbox One and Xbox 360 controller support.\n\nWhat is so special about Stardew Valley?This was my exact question before actually making a purchase, myself. Stardew Valley is an never ending farm simulation game, but wait there is more to it. It is not only a farm simulation game, but even a dungeon crawler. In short, this game has it's own twist on "Harvest Moon", by incorporating a lot of good ideas from both Terraria and Minecraft. What is even more interesting, this game features a very strategical gameplay. Not only you have to manage your energy and find ways to restore it, but even race against the clock. This is sort of time managing game, you can not do everything at once. However, you can try, but you will most likely fail. Each day you will find yourself doing different tasks. As a last note, Stardew Valley has no real story or linear questing. Therefore, you might feel lost in the beginning, but when you get a hang of the game. Trust me, it is way too big with the time given both in game and real life.\n\nWhat can you do in Stardew Valley?-You can be a rancher, gardener or both at the same time.\n-Buy, plant, water, harvest, sell or gift your berries and vegetables.\n-Build, buy and care for your chickens, cows, pigs, horses or even a pet. (Dog or cat).\n-As you progress gain new skills that will help you forge your way ahead.\n-Invent new equipment that you've gained by leveling different skills.\n-Participate in community events. (Easter egg hunt, dancing contest...)\n-4 different seasons, to make things more spicy. (Challenge cap.)\n-You can be a fisherman.\n-You can be a cook.\n-You can be a gatherer. (Berries and all that good stuff.)\n-You can be a woodcutter.\n-You can work with a wizard and solve the towns mysteries of the abandoned community building.\n-You can restore community building to it's former glory.\n-You can do random quests that you find on the billboard or your post.\n-You can be an adventurer who crawls the mines for epic loot and fortune.\n-You can donate your archeoligcal findings to the community archaeologist.\n-Protect the town from whatever might loom in the mines by joining adventurers guild and performing various tasks for them.\n-You can be friendly and proud community member. (Giving various gifts to locals, talking to them.)\n-You can be a proud family man or woman, and make a living in this small community. Perhaps even get a kid or two? It is your choice.\n-You can side with the locals and make a stand against a big corporation who is trying to overtake the town.\n-You can side with the big corporation for your own goals. Mostly money, though. :Horse:\n-In short this game has no ending or true goals, it might look small, yet it is too big to have an actually ending.\n-You will have at least hundred of hours replayability and challenging progression.\n-More things to come... This is everything that I've so far managed to uncover.\n\nThings yet to come in Stardew Valley-4 player co-op\n-Game patches\n-New content\n\n\nIf this is your cup of tea, what are you waiting for? This game is barely $15.","March 2","true","102.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's got dynamic mini games, lots of exploring and a pretty intresting storyline, Great interaction with NPC's and also they do there own thing which is really brought me into this world of fun.\nAnother plus for me would be the dating and "heart events" for characters really made me fall for the characters personalities and differences lets just say it was even nicer when things spiced up ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Lastly but not least the music/soundtrack for this game was incredibly immersive I felt like it was actually winter *brrrrrrr*.\n\nTo sum up my review I would say that buying this game for $15 could be (and most likely will) be a very great investment on your behalf for the amount of hours of entertainment and enjoyment from this welldone farming simulator.","March 14","true","101.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

There is skill tree / profession too in this game for what you want your character to be. A farmer? a fisher? a forester? an adventurer? or you can be all if you want! (≧∇≦)\n\nThe map is quite big, even then there's still some place or facility locked when you first started the game so you have to unlock them while playing the game, some require an upgraded tool, some require events to occur, some need you to complete a quest and many more!\n\nYou can also customize your character, it's pretty simple but it's still nice. You can choose your character gender and what type of clothes your character wear and what type of weapon you want to use when exploring the cave.. you can also buy a lot of cute hats from a cute seller (*^ω^*)\n\nThose are nice things for such game. But my favorite is building relationships with the town villagers. The characters in this game feel alive because if you become friends with them they will change their attitude toward you and they will even send you gift or giving nice tips such as fishing tips, harvesting tips and more!\n\nYou can also find hints at their home by checking their fridge or what they have in their room or what they write in their books, in some conversations they will also tell you their backgrounds and their favorite things so you can learn what their favorite gift is and that makes it really fun to build relationship with them and by them i mean every single villagers.. not your spouse candidate only! how fun is that?? ヾ(≧∇≦*)ゝ♡\n\nStardew Valley is easily one of my favorite game so i'm really glad i get the chance to play it, and when i found out the developer is creating all of this works by himself it really shocked me, i mean one person creating such a beautiful game? i can't believe it. It took him nearly 4 years for him to finish everything like the music, the gameplay, the arts and more so i'd like to give him credit for that, Developer-san you are amazing! ｡ﾟ✶ฺ.ヽ(*´∀`*)ﾉ.✶ฺﾟ｡\n\nthe game is still developing, meaning it's not done yet. So you can expect more stuff in the future and multiplayer is coming too! so if you like Harvest Moon or Rune Factory kind of games, even newcomers who haven't played them. I guarantee you will love this game if you love farming. ♡♡♡♡♡ / ♡♡♡♡♡","March 14","true","101.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is tremendously engaging; the dev really captured the nostalgic thirst a lot have from playing old games like animal crossing, harvest moon, etc. Let me just say: If you are one of these people in question who enjoyed those old casuals and you've been looking for something new to quench that thirst - this is your game. I've been at this for hours (albeit high off my ♥♥♥ whilst) and this is one of the first recent games to have me in constant playmode, not taking a break for anything.\n\nB. IN DEPTH, IN DEPTH, IN DEPTH - this game has hella attention to detail. There is so much to do and learn - it's ridiculous. Not only that, but there's so much you HAVE to do, kinda like an animal crossing or harvest moon whereas you have to do certain (mundane) tasks every day to keep things afloat and if you skip a day of doing something it could severely affect the next day or two. Another key note: this dev has a great sense of humor. I say this because the game has a lot of great moments and even more great little moments. I can't tell you how many dialogues I've had where the character drops the most sexual innuendo ever. Take, for example, this one from the architect gal: "If you hear any banging coming from my hut, it's probably just my hammer" more or less that's what she said. Now look, I might just be really high, but don't tell me a million little dialogues like that doesn't make you chuckle a bit.\n\nC. Totally worth the price. If you can't afford the price, which by the way is for a game made by ONE DEV after four years, then get lost. Don't pirate it, either. This is one of those games where you should feel happy paying that price for what you get.","February 26","true","42.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

I was always disappointed, but Stardew Valley is really what I was looking for: a HM type game with nice new features.\nI also enjoyed Animal Crossing and I find some similarities.\n\nPros:\n-A very nice improved HM game.\n*Gardening, fishing, buying/selling.\n*Can make friends and get married.\n*A very big map.\n-Nice features added:\n*Caves w/ monsters to kill.\n*Proper bar of tools.\n*Crafting system.\n*Item placing (decoration).\n*Can get married to a boy or a girl (being a boy or a girl).\n*A lot more animals.\n*Recipes for cooking/crafting.\n*Stamina bar (Now you can see when you're about to faint!).\n-The soundtrack is very nice.\n-Cool pixel art.\n-The price is perfect.\n-Great community.\n-Multiplayer is coming.\n\nCons:\n-Everything is so expensive! ._. Actually, it takes time to get money, it's a very slow pace game (which I really like, but some people might not like that), you gotta enjoy that genre :)\n-And something that bothers me personally: 1. Can't save, I have to wait until going to bed. 2. Sometimes I just can't find the people I'm looking for, they should stay in one location or leave a letter where they're going to be... 3. The hallways need to be 2 people wide, I have to wait until the NPC moves. Same problem with the pet, it'd be better if you could walk over it. 4. The slingshot is terrible for keyboard/mouse.\n\nAnd some suggestions:\n*Let us see the name of the crops we've planted.\n*Let us save whenever (except for event days).\n*Add a "building" mode, so I won't 'break' the item I just wanted to touch.\n\nI really recommend this game, not because it was developed by just one person, but because it's really fun for people that enjoy this HM genre. Well-made and so much to do!\nI'm satisfied with this game. It's just what I needed.\n\nEDIT: Ok, after a while, you get used to the Fishing system, it's actually fun.","February 26","true","190.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A man that played Harvest Moon and fully understood exactly what needed improving on the formula. A game that didn't need tedium to pad it out but instead opted to not waste the player's time. I was given so many options that I never once found myself turning in to bed early quite like I did in Harvest Moon. There's so much you can do from the get-go that I'm not even gonna bother listing them all. But one of my favorite things about this game is that it respects your time. There's plenty of other reviews singing this game's praises so I'm just gonna add mine to the pile.\n\nOn a final note. Thanks for all the hard work you put into this game ConcernedApe. It's abundantly clear this game was made by someone that's truly passionate about what he has made and also this genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowAngel/recommended/413150/","ShadowAngel","ShadowAngel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowAngel/","753 products in account","So this is like Harvest Moon. Despite being a gamer for over 25 years now, owning consoles and various computers, all i know of Harvest Moon is that you live like a farmer, which is what you do here. So i guess the comparisons fit but i can't comment about wether this is like Harvest Moon. Besides the farming i would say it reminds me more of the classic Zelda games, with Caves to walk through, fight mobs and upgrade your weapons and collect stuff.\nSo Harvest Moon + Zelda or from my point of view: Farming Simulator - the vehicles + Zelda + i would say a bit of Sims thrown in with the ability to decorate and expand your home as well as meet, trade, date and have fun with NPC Villagers.\n\nYou start (After creating your character, gender, look, clothes can be chosen, the name of your farm, your preference of cat or dog as well as your "favourite thing" which doesn't do anything, i said "Beer" and i didn't get any beer...lame) with a simple cottage and a field filled with trees, rocks and debries. Where to go, what to do is the first question. You get some starting tools and you remove some rubble, remove some trees and plant some seeds, you water them, you sell the stuff you aquired from hacking down trees and stones and you wander around, exploring a small town nearby with a colorful array of villagers that basically fullfil all cliches: From Store clerk to purple hair colored video game fan to emo to grumpy old guy, you will meet everything. Some can be dated and later married, others are mostly just there to fill the world with their sometimes wacky presence and to give you quests. "I need a cauliflower", you have 2 days to fullfil, better get it ready to ship or you need them to help your farm grow. Without Pierre's and his useful seeds you won't have a successful farm (unless you go full on animals which is expensive and animals can only be somewhat used, i mean, why can't i turn my big fat piggies into tasty bacon (and we all know every sane person loves bacon!)? Why can't i grill my chickens and sell them locally? Instead i have to grab their eggs and either sell them or turn them into mayonnaise, there are a lot more oppurtunities with animals that aren't realized). Without Clint, the Blacksmith, you can't upgrade your tools or destroy Genodes (you find them in the Mines they contain minerals or archaeological things). This is the first minor annoying point: The NPCs have a regular life and more often than not i went to Pierre's only to find out that his store is closed (Wednesday's) or he stands next to his shelves but you can't shop. Same with the Carpenter who goes out to do some Yoga, so the expansion of that Chicken Shack has to wait. Since the game also has a clock and shops open and close at somewhat realitic times you will get under some stress. "I wanna explore the mine but i also need to buy seeds, i also have those genodes i want to crack open....and i'm running out of time!", that is usually what will happen. Time Management is crucial.\nBut that all not only adds to a somewhat realistic country life but also to some great time management, you have to think what you do at each day. You have to water your fields, you have to tend to your animals, you also want to go to town and shop and that mine wants to be explored....what about the Sewers? The Skull Cave? All those mysterious buildings? There is so much to do you won't run out of things to do. The Seasons also change. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, they change the landscape, they dictate what seeds you can plant, what trees will grow and what festivals the town will have.\nAs i said there's a lot to explore, a lot to discover and at least for the first 1 1/2 ingame years (which are a ton of hours) you won't run out of things to see and do and experience and it will keep you entertained.\n\nGraphic wise this game is another typical "retro" style game with 2D overhead graphics in the style of the 16-Bit Era. Nothing impressive here and as i said it really does look a lot like Harvest Moon. The music is kind of a mixed bag. You have some great atmospheric songs in the Mine or the Skull Cave but the "Overworld" music is rather unimpressive. The controls are my second kinda negative point. Too often you aim wrong and plow down a row of field next to where you actually want to plow down. The same is with the animals: Once you have a ton of animals running around and group together, aiming for that one goat between two sheep to milk you will harass one of the poor sheep (thankfully they don't mind, otherwise my sheeps and pigs probably would've filed a complaint about me touching them in the wrong place) so you have to reallgne your character and aim again\n\nOverall this game is a lot of fun and i enjoy it a lot.","May 4","true","102.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","1"

I was watching the progress for it for the last few years, just waiting and watching and knowing it was going to be an amazing game. Sometimes when you build something up in your mind like that, it can be a let down. Well, I can promise you that this game is not a let down!! I would easily put it as one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nIt has something for everyone. All the different options for what to do in your day are a total blast. If you feel like farming for a long time, go for it. If you want to fish, or mine, or fight slimes, or cook, or tend to your garden and animals, you can just go at your own pace and take your time! You can mix it up if you want to and vary your days as well, there's always so many things to do and not enough time in the day!! Just like real life haha!\n\nThe game has such a great feeling to it, it brings back memories of years past. It's hard to describe, you just have to get it and play it. You will not be disappointed. I wish I could put into words how much fun it is. Sure there's always a few things in games you don't enjoy, every game has something, but this is close to a perfect game in my opinion. My favourite ways to spend my days in game are fishing and growing crops. I have an orchard which I am expanding and I also love to go fishing and find those rare treasures!!\n\nIf you ever played Animal Crossing, or Harvest Moon, this is in a similar vein, but it is better in my opinion. There are lots of townsfolk with unique personalities, some of them are snobby to you, others are much more friendly, but each has their own way of interacting with the world around them. They keep their own schedules and do their own thing!\n\nThere are tons of festivals, secrets, and so many neat features and things to do. I've done 50 hours as of writing this and I haven't even discovered a bunch of places on the map yet, nor found at least half of the items in all the different categories combined. I'm in Summer of year 2 only, and I feel like I've barely started. It's incredible, I am happy to be able to play a game that's mellow but so fun, and isn't filled with violence and blood (not a fan of those types of games).\n\nI'd recommend you pick this game up, you will be so glad you did!! I don't give out a perfect score for many games but this is for sure a 10/10. Also, multiplayer will be coming at some point soon which will add even more depth as you can play co-op with friends!\n\nBlessings to you all as you play, and see you all in the valley!! ^_^","March 27","true","77.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you played and enjoyed Harvest Moon you will enjoy this.\n\nThe first year of in-game time is great, especially considering how small the developer is. As others have mentioned, this game does suffer in the long-term. After your first year or two on the farm there isn't much to do. The game doesn't throw anything new at you and there are only one or two new crops per season and very few new events. Combat is also lackluster, but I wasn't expecting too much in this area.\n\nThat being said, I am 30 hours in and will probably play for at least 10 more over the next few weeks. I paid full price ($17 at the time) for this game and got more time in than most $60 AAA titles so I consider it worth every penny.","March 13","true","40.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Absolutely. If you like any kind of Harvest Moon or Rune Factory games, you'll surely love this one.\n\nHowever, there is one major problem: anyone with a life outside the game is punished for that. There is no save and quit feature. You must either finish the day or lose all your progress. Days last about 20 minutes, so that is potentially a lot of frustration. If you aren't bothered by that, go ahead and buy it; you won't regret it. But if you have kids or other responsibilities that might pull you away suddenly, be aware that this is an issue. As of the time of this review, the dev has announced that he does not plan to add a quicksave feature of any kind, though players are still pressuring him to do so and we will continue to cross our fingers.","February 26","true","56.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The backstory to the character you play as got me instantly into the mind of the character and I liked it. The NPCs in this and the way you can socialize with them is brilliant. The fishing is really relaxing and the mining is a good way for you to get fun when you’re too relaxed.

This isn't a complain, merely something that I think could improve for the better of the game.\nThe save system. This is not PS2 and 2000. We should be able to save anytime we want. But I could see if you aren't doing this because people might exploit it by save and load if things go bad for a decision making time. We could see that happened in Fallout 4 dialogue load. But with this night only sleep.We are at risk of losing data and restarting a day is a bad thing IMO. It  might be an hour a more for the worst. Let's be honest, day 1 game is full of bug although I merely noticed 2. 1 time it crash while in Mine :( and the resolution cannot be changed and it default is also wrong.

The game is very good at giving you suggestions and nudges to help you learn and discover all the different activities.\n\nThe graphics are simple, sprite-based and very SNES. The animations are also simple, but quite charming. There are limited particle effects, including smoke and 'magic' stuff (which I won't spoil). The music is calming and beautiful. The sound effects are PERFECT. Seriously, I love them. From the 'bop' of an axe on a tree stump, to the 'plup!' of plucking crops, they just work. They're addictive. They make you want to keep doing that thing, because it feels so satisfying!\n\nIf you want to do nothing but farm and plant crops, you can do that. Or spend all day fishing, it's no less profitable. Or you can go mining, or simply explore and forage. Every day in the game, you'll be eager to get through your laundry list of important activities, and there's usually just enough time to get it all done before nightfall.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the villagers- they begin as strangers, and over time, given that you give them enough gifts and talk to them often, they become better friends and unlock more story elements- you can even get married (including same-sex) and have children (including adoption).\n\nI'm 9 hours in, and I already feel satisfied with the purchase- and it feels like I haven't even seen 10% of what the game has to offer. If you're on the fence, not sure whether this delivers the 'true' Harvest Moon experience or not, then consider this a gentle shove: buy it, you'll love it. :)","February 27","true","227.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Honestly, it took what I loved so dearly about Harvest Moon and spiced it up. Instead of just writing a massive blob, I will do my best to try and summarise the good and bad.\n\nGood\nSoundtrack is top tier. Honestly one of the best out there period, one of the few I consider buying.\nI dearly love the money system. When you start out, everything is so expensive until you realise it isn't.\nThere is a combat system, which is... Alright, think Minish Cap Zelda.\nThere is a large variety of seeds, and the more veteran players of Harvest Moon know the value of different types of seeds.\nThe atmosphere is great.\nThe progression system isn't quite laid out in front of you, it's a define your own goals sort of game. Think Warframe.\nThe amount of content is amazing for 15$, I can't stress this enough, there is so much content I haven't seen yet it isn't even funny.\nThere is a crafting system in place, and it's pretty good.\nThere are skills, which when you level up gives you more recipes and reduces energy required to use tools.\nThere is a cooking system, where it takes time and comittment to learn all the recipes.\n\nMeh\nHonestly the Fishing system is kind of... Borked. There are flat out fish you can't get without proper gear, which would be fine if it wasn't the top tier fishing pole.\nCrab pots are pretty useless. It's a passive way to get fish, sure, but it's just flat out not worth it.\nThere are a few glitches here and there, but will be ironed out soon.\nThe cooking system is supposed to give you an incentive to make fantastic meals that increase skills, but incresing skills doesn't really do much from what I have seen. I haven't seen any new crafting recipes pop up temporarily, and a small reduction in energy just isn't worth the time and effort to get the skill increasing foods.\n\nBad\nHonestly the only bad thing I can think of is the fact that there isn't a manual save. I can hear you saying "Well that's not so bad right? It must save every so often" No it saves when you go to bed. When you finish a day and hit the hay, you save. That's it. Which means, if you just so happen to crash, you are out of luck. All that day progress is lost. Sometimes the bed doesn't save. I lost three days of progression because it didn't save for three days in a row. I hope this is worked out, or manual saving is added if possible.\n\nOverall I would say this is one of the better games I have played in a very long time. I will be getting a lot of enjoyment out of this game, not just hours played.\nI can highly recommend this to any players that dearly love Harvest Moon. For anyone else, I say look up videos on it and see if you like it. This isn't a kill things to get gear game.","February 27","true","55.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bootyllama/recommended/413150/","bootyllama","bootyllama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bootyllama/","170 products in account","After just a few minutes in, you can tell that this game really is a labor of love from the developer, ConcernedApe. If you don't already know, Stardew Valley draws heavy influence from games like Harvest Moon and Rune Factory. If you've never played them, I'd definitely recommend sinking some time into Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town. A lot of the mechanics you'll see in Stardew Valley mirror the mechanics from this game. While I've only played for a few hours, I think I can safely say that this game isn't just a carbon copy of Harvest Moon. It may have utilized gameplay and story elements as a sort of backbone, but the game feels like it has its own unique personality. There's a large map to explore and numerous events to trigger while playing.\n\nIf I had anything bad to say about this game, I'd say the main UI overlay is a bit large, and I can't seem to find a way to exit to the main menu to access different save files. However, ConcernedApe has shown that he's open to suggestions over the course of development. Heck, you could go to his twitter right now and you'll see him taking reports of bugs and what not. Even if you find a few hiccups while playing, I think we're in good hands.\n\nOverall, I'd gladly recommend this game. It's charming, vibrant, and very addicting. I hope you all can enjoy the game as much as I am.","February 27","true","158.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lots of crops, cute barn animals. You can pickle things, make meals,\nmake jam/jelly.\n* Easy crafting menu.\nLots to craft, and it's not convoluted.\n* Character customisation. Tops, hats, pants, shoes, face and hair.\n* More and more mods are becoming available, with hopefully more stable mod manager soon.\n* Fighting / dungeons (more on this later)\n* A ridiculous amount of things to do\n* Marriage system\n* Interesting story\n* Great and cute graphics\n* Super addictive\n\nCons:* Fishing. The damn fishing.\nWhile it's not terrible, it can become frustrating easy due to some fish spazzing, with basically\nno chance to catch them due to the fishing mechanic.\n* Fighting. I'm not a huge fan of the fighting system.\nIt's very barebones. I would like if the enemies had a healthbar without me needing\nto mod the game.\n* Short dialog with the characters.\n\nOtherwise, 9/10. Love it. Addicted.\nHighly recommend.","March 11","true","36.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I thought I understood the concept of "farming." Then my friend introduced me to Stardew Valley, and convinced me to buy it (he doesn't have it himself, he has a mac xD)\n\nNothing could have prepared me for this game.\n\nMade my avatar. Accidentally gave myself lipstick. Cursed the ambiguity of pixel art.\n\nWatched intro. Almost cried at the beauty of pixel art. I was sold.\n\nStarted up farm. Later met fisherman. Tried to sell him fish, accidentally gifted him some assorted seeds. Fisherman was confused.\n\nRealised girls like flowers. Religiously carried at least 3 daffodils/dandelions in my pack wherever I went.\n\nLearned to despise rain because of creepy wind-moans. Learned to despise wind-chimes because of old abandoned house.\n\nWizard gave me drugs/acid so I could sell my soul to spirits. Never talked to wizard again.\n\nGave pretty girl flowers. Girl was confused. Realised girl was married mom. Ran away in shame.\n\nSame thing happened. Concluded my judgement is terrible.\n\nHad been giving girl dandelions for a week. She mentions she likes salad. Shamelessly looks it up online - dandelions are salad ingredient. Cursed my idiotic waste of materials, and immediately stockpiled dandelions for when I could afford a kitchen.\n\nTalked to girl every day for two weeks. Gifted flowers whenever possible. Dance comes - rejected. Cried in corner and promised to do horrible things to the NPC who did dance with her.\n\nFinished chicken coop. Immediately named chickens Bloodfeast the Extreme-inator and Blackfeather (they're white chickens). Eggs = cash.\n\nCurrently farming enough cash to buy kitchen so I can shower my dream girl in stir-fry and muffins.\n\n10/10 would stay up till 4 AM again\n\nHilarious stories aside, this is an amazingly well-done game with awesome story and NPCs.

The pixel art alone is awesome, and the music is one of the game's strongest points. Perhaps my favorite aspect of this game is the characters, and how unique each of their personalities are. The characters are well-written and have given me a laugh many times. Plenty of quests to fulfill, places to explore, and crops to grow.  The best part is there always seems to be more, giving you plenty of reasons to keep playing. I'm already excited to start a second file, as this game has a high replayability factor!\nMy only word of advice: Do not buy this game in the middle of your college semester because you will end up skipping class, losing even more sleep and neglecting your work (Please buy it)\nHighly addictive and lovely game!!!","March 5","true","124.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played more like 50 hours if you count all my time offline. It's a wonderful game with a fantastic feel. Harvest Moon inspired with a great pixel art aesthetic. All of this from ONE DEVELOPER over FOUR YEARS! Absolutely incredible. I have purchased the game multiple times to give away to people who didn't have it yet, and I don't feel bad about that at all.\n\nPros:\n-RAPID resolution of bugs discovered by the userbase (CA puts out very regular patches)\n-Whimsical atmosphere and pleasing aesthetic\n-Entertaining side-quests and random missions to keep you engaged\n-Edible Amethyst! Abigail, never change...\n-Something for everyone! Farmers, Wine Vineyards, Honey Farms, Ranchers! Want to explore the world and forage? you can do that, too! Dungeons and combat as well for the adventurers\n-Objectives presented in a clean and straightforward manner\n-Endless! The game doesn't end after year four like Harvest Moon!\n-Multiplayer to be added soon\n\nCons:\n-Annoying bugs pop up from time to time, but never gamebreaking\n-certain menus can be difficult to navigate, and you cannot change joystick sensitivity for gamepads\n-It has utterly consumed my life. My family is growing concerned...\n-Character randomly veers off in a direction you do not intend while holding down the A button on a controller\n-Multiplayer isn't here yet.","March 5","true","50.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A lot of people are comparing it to Harvest Moon.  I never played HM, so I don't know if the comparison is appropriate (tho it certainly seems to be).\n\nBased on my experience, this is like Animal Crossing combined with "if Farmville was an actual game."  There are 28 villagers and you eventually get to know them all individually.  The characters have actual personality, and the graphics aid in setting them apart.\n\nSimply put, if you watch the trailers and the game looks interesting to you, then you'll love it!","March 12","true","143.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was great, but there was nothing new.  Stardew Valley is everything you loved with an entire new fresh coat of paint and new upgrades for the new generation of gaming.  You’ll continue to be in love with the charming graphics, fun representation of farm life and a whole new variety of secrets to uncover.\n\nThe development staff have been great with the roll out and have fixed multiple bugs.  If there was one complaint of this game, it’s that the characters seem very shallow.  Building relationships in the game does not seem as fulfilling as in series of this kind.  Most of my conversations with an NPC feels as if they aren’t aware that you’re there or that they’ve ever spoken to you at all.  That’s a very minor thing for this game.  For every “Drawback” there are 10 reasons to purchase this.\n\nPurchase this game at sale, purchase it at full price, heck purchase it at a premium, it’s worth it.","March 1","true","151.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Build relationships with the townfolk - expand and upgrade your farm for better money yields - explore the depths of the mines and see what they have to offer - fish in multiple areas to find wide variety of fish - explore untouched areas of Stardew Valley, or whatever you would like to do!\n\nStardew Valley paces nice and slowly. There is a lot you can do in a day, and little restrictions to how you want to play.  The game is very simplistic but quite in depth at the same time, and I really like that. The player always has a choice and in a simulation game with a lot to do, that is great to see.\n\nThe developer for the game works very hard and it's very obvious. 2 days of release and already 3 patches full of bug fixes, slight balance changes, and popular community suggestions. The game is very fairly priced and the work put into the game is apparent. You can tell the developer has put a lot of heart into this game, and plans to take good care of it. I am happy for his success.\n\nI really recommend this game to anybody that would enjoy a laid back, harvest moon-type agricultural RPG simulation. The game is fun, relaxing, and enjoyable to play, and can well go into hundreds of hours of content. With multiplayer and potentially more content or features being added, I can only imagine the game will continue to grow for the better.","February 29","true","88.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Honestly, it took what I loved so dearly about Harvest Moon and spiced it up. Instead of just writing a massive blob, I will do my best to try and summarise the good and bad.\n\nGood\nSoundtrack is top tier. Honestly one of the best out there period, one of the few I consider buying.\nI dearly love the money system. When you start out, everything is so expensive until you realise it isn't.\nThere is a combat system, which is... Alright, think Minish Cap Zelda.\nThere is a large variety of seeds, and the more veteran players of Harvest Moon know the value of different types of seeds.\nThe atmosphere is great.\nThe progression system isn't quite laid out in front of you, it's a define your own goals sort of game. Think Warframe.\nThe amount of content is amazing for 15$, I can't stress this enough, there is so much content I haven't seen yet it isn't even funny.\nThere is a crafting system in place, and it's pretty good.\nThere are skills, which when you level up gives you more recipes and reduces energy required to use tools.\nThere is a cooking system, where it takes time and comittment to learn all the recipes.\n\nMeh\nHonestly the Fishing system is kind of... Borked. There are flat out fish you can't get without proper gear, which would be fine if it wasn't the top tier fishing pole.\nCrab pots are pretty useless. It's a passive way to get fish, sure, but it's just flat out not worth it.\nThere are a few glitches here and there, but will be ironed out soon.\nThe cooking system is supposed to give you an incentive to make fantastic meals that increase skills, but incresing skills doesn't really do much from what I have seen. I haven't seen any new crafting recipes pop up temporarily, and a small reduction in energy just isn't worth the time and effort to get the skill increasing foods.\n\nBad\nHonestly the only bad thing I can think of is the fact that there isn't a manual save. I can hear you saying "Well that's not so bad right? It must save every so often" No it saves when you go to bed. When you finish a day and hit the hay, you save. That's it. Which means, if you just so happen to crash, you are out of luck. All that day progress is lost. Sometimes the bed doesn't save. I lost three days of progression because it didn't save for three days in a row. I hope this is worked out, or manual saving is added if possible.\n\nOverall I would say this is one of the better games I have played in a very long time. I will be getting a lot of enjoyment out of this game, not just hours played.\nI can highly recommend this to any players that dearly love Harvest Moon. For anyone else, I say look up videos on it and see if you like it. This isn't a kill things to get gear game.","February 27","true","55.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However it has a few irritating bugs, and one (potentially) game breaking bug, that make it a play at your own risk game.\n\n'Introductions' quest is bugged for SOME people where you talk to everyone as per the quest, but it dosen't update so you'll get stuck at 27/28. This is a game breaking bug (potentially) as it's part of the tutorial, and you can't move on with the chain from this point. So it holds up the story quests.\n\nOther bugs i've experieced are money just disapearing when sleeping, or if you pass out outside (you're supposed to lose some, but not all). Getting stuck on steps in the mine after being knocked back during combat. And a few random crashes when sleeping.\n\nGiven the fact it's taken so long to make the game i'm surpised quest bugs are still in there.\n\nAlso the movement in this game is horrifically slow, it takes so long to move around the map you need to spend 2 or 3 days if you want to plan for upgrades. Since it takes you a day to get from your place to the store to find out what you need. Then get back home, sleep, and then return to the store the next day with the mats.\n\nThere are boosts in the game, but you shouldn't need boosts for 'daily' things IMO.\n\nThis game also, for some reason dosen't have a proper save system. No set auto saves, or quick save features, rather it only saves when you sleep in your bed. Which means you can loose a hell of a lot of time if the game crashes, or you need to leave in a hurry. You can't just hit f5 and go.\n\nSo overall, it's worth picking up since it's a cheap game, but go in with your eyes open to the bugs","February 27","true","19.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is exactly what it says to be. It's a farming sim with a town full of people to get to know with eligible bachelors/bachelorettes with some RPG mechanics on the side. This isn't a very "stressful" game. You play at your own pace, playing how you want. You can farm, fish, have farm animals, join an adventurers guild and explore the depths of the mine and much more I haven't seen yet. This was created by one person, and I think that's awesome. A lot of dedication went into this game and there is so much to see and do - it's just not all on the surface. You have to play more and more to see how in depth the game really is.

It's like an old-school RPG, but it's light on the combat elements and heavy on the town-based stuff -- and in a good way.  I could go on, but I want to get back to playing instead of gushing about it.","March 30","true","51.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aozgolo/recommended/413150/","aozgolo","Coelacanth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aozgolo/","851 products in account","An excellent farming RPG that surpasses it's own spiritual predecessors.\n\nThe game is a farming RPG that borrows heavily from the Harvest Moon series of games, but it has inspiration from other great classics as well including The Legend of Zelda (The combat is very similar to A Link to the Past) and even Chrono Trigger (aesthetics).\n\nStardew Valley like Harvest Moon games is very open ended, and lets you progress as you see fit. While described as a Farming RPG, it simply wouldn't do the game justice to say that that's all there is. You can engage in lots of activities in the game including farming, ranching (animals), crafting, mining, combat, foraging, socializing, cooking, fishing, questing, and achievement hunting. I will break each of these down below:\n\nFARMING\n\nIf you've ever played Harvest Moon you will feel right at home, farming consists mostly of tilling plots of land, sewing seeds, and watering crops. Different crops only grow in certain seasons and wilt and die when that season ends. Each crop type requires a certain number of days to grow, some are renewable while others aren't. In addition the basics you can create various types of fertilizer that can increase the quality, speed up growth, or have a chance of retaining water, you can also install sprinklers to automatically water plants and scarecrows to prevent birds from making off with your seeds. Each season has a wide variety of plants and there's a lot to keep you interested.\n\nRANCHING\n\nRaising animals is of course a big deal with any farming game, and this one doesn't disappoint. While in it's current state Ranching is prohibitively expensive early on due to feed costs, it is definitely an interesting and fun mid to late game activity that lets you raise a wide variety of animals including chickens, ducks, rabbits, cows, sheep, goats, pigs, and even slimes each with their own variety of products, some of which can be enhanced with various machines and many that are important components of recipes.\n\nCRAFTING\n\nStardew Valley includes a basic but entertaining crafting system that lets you create various machines to help further refine materials such as wool into cloth, eggs, into mayonnaise, or ore into ingots. Additionally you can build furniture for your house and farm, fencing, pathways, fertilizers, scarecrows, torches, and even teleportation totems. You constantly unlock new crafting recipes by progressing through the game. It is a very intuitive process that makes it easy to know what you need to build something.\n\nMINING\n\nMining is a big part of this game and you will have access to a 120 level deep mine and a quarry that is packed full of various types of ore needed for smelting into ingots for crafting and tool upgrades, as well as a huge number of different minerals and gems that make excellent gifts or valuables for selling. The Mine is full of enemies as well as riches though and combat goes hand in hand with it, you'll fine more than rocks though, as the mine is also full of clay, various types of food, and even barrels and chests full of valuable loot. You will often find geodes you can pay the blacksmith to break open which often contain valuable contents like gems and artifacts.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nCombat and Mining go hand in hand, the Mine being the primary location for enemies (there are others you find later) you will fight progressively harder enemies as you descend deeper in the mine. Combat feels like classic Zelda games, though is pretty basic hack and slash. It works well for what it is and once you get the hang of it, it becomes a fun diversion that is just challenging enough to keep you paying attention without ever becoming frustrating. The enemies you encounter range from a varying number of different types of slimes, skeletons, ghosts, bats, bugs, and other kooky creatures.\n\nFORAGING\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest draws to exploration is foraging. Each season has it's own bounty of natural plantlife to find and collect, there's always trees and rocks to harvest for timber and stone, and certain locations have their own unique items to collect like the beach, quarry, and desert, Foraging provides an excellent supplement to your income, energy levels, and as a last minute gift for a passing villager.\n\nSOCIALIZING\n\nThe town is host to a wide number of interesting characters with their own personalities, some seem little than the sum of their tropes, and very neatly fit into a specific niche, but many of them are very interesting and fun to get to know. The benefits of talking to the townspeople and giving them gifts aren't just for atmosphere, befriend someone and they will often send you gifts in return, grant you access to their rooms, and even share special recipes with you. Additionally you can date one of several eligible bachelors or bachelorettes (regardless of your gender) and potentially marry them and even have a child.\n\nCOOKING\n\nAfter you upgrade your house you will have a kitchen available that lets you cook up tons of different recipes you find in the game, by unlocking achievements, befriending villagers, or watching TV. These cooked dishes offer greater healing and restorative benefits and are often worth more to sell, or as special gifts for your neighbors. You can also craft Brewing Kegs and Preservation Barrels to make Jellies and Alcohol.\n\nFISHING\n\nFishing in the game is a very hit-or-miss sort of thing, The fish you can catch differ depending on time of day and location you are fishing, with a huge variety of fish and even trash you can recycle into other matierals to find. The actual fishing gameplay however is a minigame that requires you to click or release your mouse to keep the fish inside your green bar until a gauge fills up and you catch it, or it empties and you lose the fish. Early on this is a very frustrating and difficult endeavor, but as you progress you will unlock access to better fishing poles, higher fishing skill, and bait which can make the ordeal a lot more bearable.\n\nQUESTING\n\nThe quests in the game tend to be fairly simple affairs that involve either delivering an item to someone, finding something someone lost, or killing a certain number of enemies. You will run across them either on a bulletin board in town, in your mailbox from time to time, and sometimes from other sources. They often reward you with gold and increased friendship levels and are often worth the time to do and rarely feel annoying or grinding (even fetch quests typically only want one of a certain item)\n\nACHIEVEMENT HUNTING\n\nTo be clear, we're not talking Steam Achievements, although the game has those as well. Instead what I mean is Stardew Valley's means of progression. What drives you to continue. In Harvest Moon games there was often some overarching story plot to save a dying town, or win over the townsfolk, or save the Goddess, Here, however we have various achievements that progress the story and unlock new opportunities and areas to explore. There is a community center that tasks you with building bundles of similar type items (spring crops, lake fish, ingots, etc.) and it rewards you with special items and once all bundles in a set are complete that part of the Community Center is restored and a big change in the world unlocked such as access to a new area or a quicker means of travel.\n\nBeyond that there is also the museum where you can donate special gems and artifacts you find for special rewards and to learn more about them.\n\n\n\nStardew Valley is in many ways better than any Harvest Moon game and a lot of love has been put into the game, I highly recommend you try it out!","March 5","true","126.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There were some issues when the game was released, but the developer has shown diligence in solving them.\n\nIt is truly amazing how much the developer connects with the community in terms of improving various features and areas of the game.

There is a win-condition which you can miss by not being efficient enough, but the game allows you to continue past it.  So as long as you don't care about that accolade, you can take your time.\n\nTill soil, plant seeds, water sprouts, etc... Rest at the end of the day to recover energy.  Each 'month' is actually one of the seasons, certain crops only grow in certain seasons, so plant to account for that, etc.  I've barely scratched the surface but the additional quests, crafting (tip: hit escape to access that menu), building, and dungeon-crawling have all been a really intiguing layer over the basic farming.\n\nWatch a Let's Play to check if the style is right for you, but this one's a winner for me.  The ONLY complaint that I have is that you can't save mid-way through the day (only when you end the day by sleeping) which was frustrating the one time the game crashed, and the map is so large that running from A to B and back for a simple chore can tie up hours of your precious day.  Prices for everything initially seem high, until you get your first crop yield and realize that there IS actually money in farming.  These would all seem to be conscious design decisions to try and slow down the pace, though, and make you play a bit more deliberately, so I can't hold it against the game.\n\nGreat stuff. Highly recommended.","February 27","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This isn't a complain, merely something that I think could improve for the better of the game.\nThe save system. This is not PS2 and 2000. We should be able to save anytime we want. But I could see if you aren't doing this because people might exploit it by save and load if things go bad for a decision making time. We could see that happened in Fallout 4 dialogue load. But with this night only sleep.We are at risk of losing data and restarting a day is a bad thing IMO. It  might be an hour a more for the worst.

The developer had been fixing bugs noted by the testing team almost instantly, and it had been so long in progress, I knew it wasn't going to be half done.

The game story begins.\n\nWhats really nice is the little details, my favourite are the squirrels running up trees and rabbits hiding.\nThe idea that you can't enter someones room unless you know them.\nAlso that the original Harvest Moon boy is hanging up as a drawing in Sebastion's room.\nThe TV specials (weather specifically) also look straight from a HM game from 1998!\nIt's a great story so far and I'm really getting into it.

If you don't already know, Stardew Valley draws heavy influence from games like Harvest Moon and Rune Factory. If you've never played them, I'd definitely recommend sinking some time into Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town. A lot of the mechanics you'll see in Stardew Valley mirror the mechanics from this game. While I've only played for a few hours, I think I can safely say that this game isn't just a carbon copy of Harvest Moon. It may have utilized gameplay and story elements as a sort of backbone, but the game feels like it has its own unique personality. There's a large map to explore and numerous events to trigger while playing.\n\nIf I had anything bad to say about this game, I'd say the main UI overlay is a bit large, and I can't seem to find a way to exit to the main menu to access different save files. However, ConcernedApe has shown that he's open to suggestions over the course of development. Heck, you could go to his twitter right now and you'll see him taking reports of bugs and what not. Even if you find a few hiccups while playing, I think we're in good hands.\n\nOverall, I'd gladly recommend this game. It's charming, vibrant, and very addicting. I hope you all can enjoy the game as much as I am.","February 27","true","158.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Plug and play, no issues, cursor control via right stick is brilliant & feels instantly natural, and it doesn't lock up the keyboard so you can still use hotkeys if you want. It even supports rumble. You can tell the dev put a lot of love into this feature.\n\nI might recommend looking into beginners tutorials since some of the features aren't entirely well explained (like where you get your first bits of storage, and general things like not building a coop until you're acclimated. I'm gonna wait until my first house upgrade is complete for that)\n\nI'm not aesthetically into the character's pixel art but their stories seem to make up for that, treading a line between the typical two dimensional dating options in other farming games and something with just enough depth for intrigue. The environments are absolutely beautiful and I can already tell the lighting engine is going to make for interesting house designs. I haven't delved far into designing houses but it already feels like I have more options than other games like this. maybe not minecraft/starbound levels of options but definitely options.\n\nGames like these tend to take a lot of time and I think the amount of time this occupies you is definitely worth the 15 dollar asking price as I tend to buy games like this for around 30-40","March 6","true","62.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll just play for an hour or two and then go to bed, I said. 6.6 non-stop hours later...\n\nWell I was lying to myself then, but I'm not lying to you now... this is a pretty great game with more than meets the eye.\nI looked at it and saw "Oh, cute little sprite farming RPG and it's pretty damn affordable with really positive reviews."\nFarm to make some money to start. And then there's fishing. And collecting things. And quests/chores to do your your fellow villagers. Trees and rocks to clean up on your property. Mines to explore. Foraging. Leveling. Upgrades. And a story.\n\nThe feeling of progression is pretty steady, and once you think the game has laid it all bare it throws another thing at your face. You only have so much energy and time throughout the day. What do you focus on? What do you do? It's hard to choose. I'd like to fish more (the little mini-game is fun) but farming is clearly a more sustainable option for income. But if you're not selling it, the more food you have available to eat to keep your energy up, the more you might be able to do that day. Chopping wood and mining takes a lot out of you... and you need a lot of that stuff.\n\nYou can forage wild grown stuff if you need to and check the garbage cans (don't let the neighbors see, though), or eat the fish you catch, but farming is still the best way to get eats by setting and forgetting (save for watering in the morning). Later, there is also cooking which I expect would have a lot more benefit than eating all this stuff raw.\n\nUpgrades and stuff are expensive, too. (The first House Upgrade with the Kitchen is 10Kg and 450 wood)\nIt's easy to make mistakes early on. You have to spend money to make more money, but you also need/want to buy upgrades, such as the first backpack for 2k or the next teir of fishing pole for 1.8k... and lots of other things.\nThis definitely isn't a game you finish in 5 hours. I expect to sink hundreds.\n\nIf you're not smart about how/what/when you farm you could lose money, also. Seasons matter for crops. (They are 28 days long, so... there's 4 months in a year I guess. :D) So planning ahead is good. Time pauses when you are reading/in menus, so there's plenty of time to think if you need it. I guess you -could- just focus on a particular niche if you wanted to, but farming is still pretty core. The game also only saves when you go to bed, so if you screw up a day somehow and want a do-over, just close the game out and come back.\n\nAnyway, rambled way too long. Maybe a more proper review when I get further into it.\nI've barely scratched the surface but I'm definitely going back in for more. It's really very enjoyable and charming. Highly recommend.","March 3","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LexyJenrex/recommended/413150/","LexyJenrex","April Fools","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LexyJenrex/","537 products in account","Heavily inspired by the Bokujou Monogatari(More commonly known as Harvest Moon made by Marvelous), Stardew Valley manages to be the kind of game that the series should have evolved into following 64 and Back To Nature. With all the old school charm and a mix of modern innovations that make the game an engaging experience. As a long time fan of Harvest Moon, I have anticipated Stardew Valley's launch since it's appearance on Greenlight. Now that it has arrived, it has the same addictive and child-like wonder that I had experienced playing 64 for the first time. Old farmhands and greenhorns alike, Stardew Valley has a lot to offer.\n\nWIth old staples like farming, fishing, mining, befriending villagers and getting married. And new exciting features like tapping trees, panning, gathering electricity, crafting, and so much more; there's so much to do. Customization of the interior of your house, freedom to customize your character, and same-sex marriage so that the LGBT crowd have the freedom to have an avatar that more accurately represents them while still being able to pursue their preferred sex.\n\nConcernedApe has put a lot of love in this game and it really shows. Even after the games release, constantly updating the game, answering twitter, and has always thought of his fans first. Even if a rural life simulator doesn't sound like your cup of tea, mad respect for the man.","March 2","true","100.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It was great, but there was nothing new.  Stardew Valley is everything you loved with an entire new fresh coat of paint and new upgrades for the new generation of gaming.  You’ll continue to be in love with the charming graphics, fun representation of farm life and a whole new variety of secrets to uncover.\n\nThe development staff have been great with the roll out and have fixed multiple bugs.  If there was one complaint of this game, it’s that the characters seem very shallow.  Building relationships in the game does not seem as fulfilling as in series of this kind.  Most of my conversations with an NPC feels as if they aren’t aware that you’re there or that they’ve ever spoken to you at all.  That’s a very minor thing for this game.  For every “Drawback” there are 10 reasons to purchase this.\n\nPurchase this game at sale, purchase it at full price, heck purchase it at a premium, it’s worth it.","March 1","true","151.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a good amount of farming mechanics in this game to keep you busy and it doesn't stray from what the game was meant to be: a farming fantasy. Don't worry, though! Stardew has other things to keep you occupied with it other than abusing your watering can. The game offers you a bit of: mystery and adventure with pushing the main story, simpilistic and nostalgic rpg elements to the mining, some romance if you're into that, an actual fishing system where you don't just cast your line and wait, and cute cows.\n\nI personally love that the game rewards you for fishing, mining, foraging, and/or farming! The leveling system makes you feel like the focus you chose wasn't the lesser choice. There are many pros to choosing to focus on one field over the other. There's time to master them all, but being put to choose a "profession" is what got to me the most as a player. I had to think about what was most beneficial for me as a farmer and player in the long run. I usually storm through HM/SoS games with the same thought: farm crops, get animals, get optimal crops, what is fishing even, and date the girl. With Stardew's profession system/choice, I had to actually consider my time in the game and what I liked doing. It was no longer just a set formula for my play style and that in itself is the most rewarding thing this game has done for me.\n\nAlso, also! I wanted to say the music, character sprites, backgrounds/settings, etc. (everything really) was pretty damned polished. There were some random bugs with characters trapping me at Pierre's bulletin board, but that didn't bother me. ConcernedApe was on the job with all the bug reports and I have mad respect for him for being so attentive. With a developer this involved and working around the clock, it makes it hard not to fall in love with the game a little more.\n\nThere's something so magical about this game and I found it extremely difficult to feel anything other than captivated by the amount of care, love, and work that was put into Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley and ConcernedApe, you have charmed me into addiction. Thank you for not being a letdown to a long-time Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing fan.\n\nTL;DR - if you're into farming, fishing, praying the spirits won't hate you the next day, dating the people, hitting bats to death, cute cows, emotions, pretty things, fun gaming, having a chill time, and feeling immersed into a game's atmostphere almost completely -- this is the game for you.","February 29","true","83.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Stardew Valley is the best parts of dozens of games wrapped up in a wonderful package that's impossible to put down, and at the asking price it's easily the best purchase I have made in the last few years.\n\nThe art and music feel just like Chrono Trigger. There is love in every pixel and the colors while vibrant never aggrevate the eye. All of the characters have a fun and unique look to them and the way some of the physics effects work, leaves, grass, light just make the game incredibly beautiful. The music is phenomenal and I find myself humming the tunes while I'm at work. The tracks masterfully set the mood and atmosphere of the season and the time of the day and I have yet to find a single bad track. Needless to say I will be buying the soundtrack.\n\nThe gameplay is the best parts of the harvest moon/animal crossing/rune factory series, and even though it borrows heavily from these games it stands out on it's own as the best of all of these. I am not exaggerating when I say one man has successfully solved most if not all of the issues with this games predecessors and takes it above and beyond in terms of both content quantity and quality.\n\nI have not completed the story but I am completely enthralled by it, the characters are surprisingly human and react to you as an outsider for the first few months then begin to pull you into their lives. There is also plenty of hidden easter eggs and mystery shrouded in the town. Seriously what is that noise when it rains? What is in the sewer? Whats going on with that bathhouse? The list goes on and on.\n\nThe gameplay unlocks are fed to you at such an amazing pace that you catch yourself saying "Just one more day" and then one more, and then one more. There is so much to do and much to see so there's nothing wrong with taking the backstreet to Stardew Valley.\n\nIf you are remotely curious about this game then pick it up, you won't regret it. Games like this come rarely and while the single player is complete there is the promise of added multiplayer, it can't get any better! Easily the best game I have played in years, can't wait to go home and play it more.","March 2","true","52.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I'll just play for an hour or two and then go to bed, I said. 6.6 non-stop hours later...\n\nWell I was lying to myself then, but I'm not lying to you now... this is a pretty great game with more than meets the eye.\nI looked at it and saw "Oh, cute little sprite farming RPG and it's pretty damn affordable with really positive reviews."\nFarm to make some money to start. And then there's fishing. And collecting things. And quests/chores to do your your fellow villagers. Trees and rocks to clean up on your property. Mines to explore. Foraging. Leveling. Upgrades. And a story.\n\nThe feeling of progression is pretty steady, and once you think the game has laid it all bare it throws another thing at your face. You only have so much energy and time throughout the day. What do you focus on? What do you do? It's hard to choose. I'd like to fish more (the little mini-game is fun) but farming is clearly a more sustainable option for income. But if you're not selling it, the more food you have available to eat to keep your energy up, the more you might be able to do that day. Chopping wood and mining takes a lot out of you... and you need a lot of that stuff.\n\nYou can forage wild grown stuff if you need to and check the garbage cans (don't let the neighbors see, though), or eat the fish you catch, but farming is still the best way to get eats by setting and forgetting (save for watering in the morning). Later, there is also cooking which I expect would have a lot more benefit than eating all this stuff raw.\n\nUpgrades and stuff are expensive, too. (The first House Upgrade with the Kitchen is 10Kg and 450 wood)\nIt's easy to make mistakes early on. You have to spend money to make more money, but you also need/want to buy upgrades, such as the first backpack for 2k or the next teir of fishing pole for 1.8k... and lots of other things.\nThis definitely isn't a game you finish in 5 hours. I expect to sink hundreds.\n\nIf you're not smart about how/what/when you farm you could lose money, also. Seasons matter for crops. (They are 28 days long, so... there's 4 months in a year I guess. :D) So planning ahead is good. Time pauses when you are reading/in menus, so there's plenty of time to think if you need it. I guess you -could- just focus on a particular niche if you wanted to, but farming is still pretty core. The game also only saves when you go to bed, so if you screw up a day somehow and want a do-over, just close the game out and come back.\n\nAnyway, rambled way too long. Maybe a more proper review when I get further into it.\nI've barely scratched the surface but I'm definitely going back in for more. It's really very enjoyable and charming. Highly recommend.","March 3","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

With all the old school charm and a mix of modern innovations that make the game an engaging experience. As a long time fan of Harvest Moon, I have anticipated Stardew Valley's launch since it's appearance on Greenlight. Now that it has arrived, it has the same addictive and child-like wonder that I had experienced playing 64 for the first time. Old farmhands and greenhorns alike, Stardew Valley has a lot to offer.\n\nWIth old staples like farming, fishing, mining, befriending villagers and getting married. And new exciting features like tapping trees, panning, gathering electricity, crafting, and so much more; there's so much to do. Customization of the interior of your house, freedom to customize your character, and same-sex marriage so that the LGBT crowd have the freedom to have an avatar that more accurately represents them while still being able to pursue their preferred sex.\n\nConcernedApe has put a lot of love in this game and it really shows. Even after the games release, constantly updating the game, answering twitter, and has always thought of his fans first. Even if a rural life simulator doesn't sound like your cup of tea, mad respect for the man.","March 2","true","100.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Plug and play, no issues, cursor control via right stick is brilliant & feels instantly natural, and it doesn't lock up the keyboard so you can still use hotkeys if you want. It even supports rumble. You can tell the dev put a lot of love into this feature.\n\nI might recommend looking into beginners tutorials since some of the features aren't entirely well explained (like where you get your first bits of storage, and general things like not building a coop until you're acclimated. I'm gonna wait until my first house upgrade is complete for that)\n\nI'm not aesthetically into the character's pixel art but their stories seem to make up for that, treading a line between the typical two dimensional dating options in other farming games and something with just enough depth for intrigue. The environments are absolutely beautiful and I can already tell the lighting engine is going to make for interesting house designs. I haven't delved far into designing houses but it already feels like I have more options than other games like this. maybe not minecraft/starbound levels of options but definitely options.\n\nGames like these tend to take a lot of time and I think the amount of time this occupies you is definitely worth the 15 dollar asking price as I tend to buy games like this for around 30-40","March 6","true","62.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its super addicting.\n\nI absolutely detest the child-like npc relationship nonsense (but thank god its not done in anime with those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t degenerate anime tropes) but the economic side of the game is absolutely amazing and has hooked me in like one of the great classics have (Civilization, XCOM, etc...)\n\nBrilliant design overall and astonishing that the entire game was made by a single individual. The economic side of the game is a wide open sandbox, giving you a multitude of interesting ways to earn cash to chase unlocks and upgrade your buildings and equipment.\n\nMasterpiece!","March 5","true","55.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I loved Harvest Moon, and this fixes all of the issues that HM had with it.  Stardew is beautiful, a very gorgeous game!\n\nPROS:\n+Beautiful Graphics\n+Music really fits into the game\n+I can have a puppy!\n+28 characters to meet, several love interests\n\nCONS:\n-Music doesn't play often enough, long periods of silence with just the sound of my wood chopping\n-Not a huge fan currently of the fishing system.  That being said, it will probably get better as I level the skill up\n-The woman I gave a fish to didn't appreciate it.  I worked really hard for that fish!  ;)\n\nI definitely recommend this game.  I've only ran into one bug so far, and those are being squished left and right.  Multiplayer coop of 2-4 players should be coming down the road, so I look forward to that.  I don't expect that to be any time soon, but I feel the game has potential to keep me involved for a long time in Single Player.\n\nBuy the game, much better than many $15 games!","February 27","true","34.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On my own personal scale of fun to money ratio, this game gets 200 out of 100 amazing game points. Please be careful, if you like this sort of game, you will be consumed.\n\nI have reached the bottom of the mine, I have farmed for a year and a half, I have gotten married, and still I feel not even half done with what the game has to offer.\n\nMy suggestion to the dev would be to expand the dialog for the existing characters, Plan on expanding the game world, whether its a deeper mine, a boat ride to another map or anything in between. Multiplayer needs to be in the game yesterday.\n\nI would be willing to pay another 15 dollars for a map double the size of the current one. I would pay 5 dollars for any fun and useful add-on or a deeper mine.\n\nThanks for making a classy game!","March 6","true","62.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
