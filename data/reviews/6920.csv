So interesting, in fact, that I would recomend playing the original game, skipping this title completely, and then playing Human Revolution. Anyway, if you care about my opinion, read on! Otherwise, I hope you have a nice day anyway.\n\nAs far as ambiance goes it is reminiscent of the original game. The dark and oppressive cityscape, the futuristic techno music, the neo-noir use of shadows and, of course, the color blue.\n\nThe one improvement this game has over it's predecesor is the ragdoll mechanic. Stuffing the limp bodies of victims into the ventillation grates is more entertaining than the story itself.\n\nThis, of course, leads into the story. I played this game for about five and a half hours. In that amount of time in the first game, I stopped numerous political terrorist plots, took out some nasty drug dealers, saved a girl from a pimp and many, many other things. I definitely felt like I was making a positive difference in the world.\nIn the first five hours of this game, I escaped from a bizarre super-soldier training prison that was under attack from generic religous terrorists and then wandered around for a while fighting mercenaries, killing random gang members, discovering that the terrorists were purposefully religously generic, cheated in some illeagel gambling, burglarized some rich dude's apartment, and wrecked a coffee shop. I felt like a roving psychopath.\n\nIn the first game, I felt torn between the urgency of completing the story missions and helping people by completing the side quests.\nIn this game I felt like there was something I was supposed to be doing, but I had no idea what that thing was or if it even mattered.\n\nThe first game eventually gives you a sense of moral ambiguity; over time you learn more and more about all the factions competing with each other and also that every side does varying amounts of honorable as well as evil actions. Aligning with a certain side doesn't make you feel any better than the other side, but you just feel like you need to go with the lesser evil in order to save humanity.\nThis game gives you an immediate feeling of moral ambivolence. You discover within the first hour that every faction you've encountered has a mixture of good and bad intentions which culminate in stupidity. There is no urgency. These people are just going to fight amongst each other for ambiguous reasons and they want to draw you into it. At that point I figured I'd just go and see if there was anything remotely interesting happening elsewhere. Cheat in some underground mutant lizard fighting betting? Why not. Get involved in a feud between rival coffee chains? Sure! It's more interesting than helping the Orwellian police force fight some self righteous murderers.\n\nLast and perhaps least, we have the player character. In the first game, you get to be the badass JC. Do you think his baggy coat is unnecessary and it's ridiculous that he wears sunglasses at night? He could not care less about your opinion. If you order him to do something he thinks is questionable, he will not blindly follow your orders. He will do what he thinks is right, and he will go about it however he wants. Playing as him, you feel like an awesome futuristic warrior as you gradually upgrade his nanotech and acquire new and better equipment.\nIn this game, you are Alex. His/her character was not developed at all in the time that I played. All in all, (s)he pretty much just lets the different factions tell him/her what to do with very little (if any) question or objection. Truely, a compelling character. Playing as this wimp, you get a bunch of weapons and upgrades almost immediately and not much of anything to do with them.\n\nThis game is not technically good. It is not even that fun. As an experience, it's a mediocre spiral into the depths of a deranged world. The prequel is amazing, and the first game is a masterpiece. This sequel is ultimately disappointing. It is basically just one of the many Godfather 3's of the game industry.\n\nThis is all, of course, just my opinion and I sincerely thank you for reading it. I hope it was helpful. Have a nice day!","September 27, 2014","false","5.4"," 319 of 363 people (88%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","88","319","363","33","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TVPR/recommended/6920/","TVPR","TVPR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TVPR/","88 products in account","The original Deus Ex is one of the best games ever made, so when Invisible War suffers from a bad reputation, I assumed it was undeserved. I assumed that it would at least be "pretty ok", and that its poor ratings were due to people comparing it to the first game. Holy cow, was I wrong.\n\nThis game is atrociously bad, and not just compared to its older brother. It's genuinely a waste of time and money completely by itself. In short: Had I known how frustratingly bad Invisible War was, I wouldn't even have picked it up for free.\n\nSome of the bad parts (no real spoilers):\n\n- The writing. While the story builds on Deus Ex, you get no build-up, no twists (excepting a few incredibly obvious attempts), no suspense, no room for wondering or doubting. You're never allowed to be curious about the world, the backstory or the events of the past, as most of this is just dumped bluntly at your feet. At one point you walk into a bunker, find some high-level people, and out of nowhere these complete strangers start telling you about their deepest, darkest secrets.\n\n- The pacing. At times, people will warn you that "someone has a secret agenda for you", and you can be certain that within two minutes that same "someone" will give you a call to explain their agenda for you, right to your face.\n\n- The level design. Pretty much every single level is a tiny, cramped area. For reference, the 'ton Hotel in Deus Ex is one of the smaller levels in that game, but it would easily fit in as one of the larger levels in Invisible War. This means you'll enjoy a lot more loading screens a lot more often, but it also makes the game feel so much more shallow: When security HQ is 15 meters from the doorstep of the terrorists, suspension of disbelief drops like a rock. It also means walking through four levels blasting bad guys, then walking back through four empty levels.\n\n- The loading screens. Loading time is usually not an issue for me, with a fast SSD in a fast PC. Invisible War doesn't care. Every so often it goes through a complicated series of steps to load a new level, which includes shutting down the rendering engine to flash you your desktop for a few seconds, then going all white for a while as it restarts, and then it starts actually loading, which takes another 10-15 seconds.\n\n- The number of loading screens. In one typical part of the game, you go through a door - loading screen - across a square - loading screen - across a room to talk to someone, then back out - loading screen - around a corner and down a street - loading screen - down some stairs, talk to a guy, and then retrace the whole route with all the loading screens all over again. Steam tells me I've had the game running some 12 hours, but my save game clock tells me I have 7,5 hours playtime. Including a little menu browsing, that means I have likely spent a quarter of my ingame time looking at loading screens.\n\n- The AI. It is so bad it can sometimes be an involuntary source of rare fun. At one point, members of two opposing factions are involved in a firefight, while a couple of guards stroll idly through the crossfire, taking no notice. As the fight ends, the same guards suddenly freak out over the bodies at their feet - "Ah! A body! There's been a murder! You won't get away with this", they exclaim, and then just keep walking. On a different occasion, an NPC shoots another NPC, and then freaks out over the body *which he just made*. "There's been a murder!" - no, really? And that's saying nothing of the shoddy combat AI, nor the incredibly poor search AI. You can actually hide from enemies by standing on the other side of a glass door, or by closing an air vent cover, and they will have no idea where you went.\n\n- Graphics – and I don't mean "it's ugly", I mean it's really poorly designed. Most weapons are close to identical both when equipped and as inventory icons. With a few exceptions, it's hard to tell what things you can pick up in the field really is (except blinky and futuristic). Are those credit chips, datacubes, or maybe weapon modifications? Who knows! Better break into this locker to find out.\n\n- User interface. Of all the compromises made to make this game possible to run for its intended Xbox, this is likely the worst. Honestly, the UI of Invisible War is worse than trying to do internet banking with a broken gamepad.\n\nI could go on for a long time - this is in no way a complete list - but honestly, if you still think it "can't be that bad", go right ahead and buy it. Or save your money, go on YouTube and find a "let's play" video. I enjoyed some 25 hours of fun on my last Deus Ex playthrough. In Invisible War, it took me less than 8 hours to reach the 2nd to last level. Then I just decided I couldn't be bothered, uninstalled it, and would rather just read about the ending than suffer through more.","April 14, 2015","false","12.2"," 235 of 276 people (85%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","85","235","276","38","6"

I am sad to report that this game is a total piece of garbage. Overall, it was a very consolized and poorly designed sequel. Here is why I would recommend skipping this game:\n\n1.  Loading screens.  You will probably spend more time watching loading screens than actually playing the game. The game is set up so that only tiny pieces of each area are loaded at one time so that you have to watch loading screen after loading screen after loading screen just to move through the game. Even the main menu has a loading screen. It is so oppressive that it ruins the gameplay.\n\n2.  Cramped level design.  All the maps feel like you're moving through tunnels. Even the outdoor areas seem very close quarters and boxed in with loading barriers every 15 feet.\n\n3.  Incessant bugs and crashing (which of course leads to more loading screens). This is kind of self-expanatory, but I personally had a particularly bad problem with random crashing and then corrupt savegames. There were also the other classic bugs such as stuff getting stuck in walls, NPCs battling each other when they're not supposed to, buggy objects jittering around the levels, etc. The camera angles during cutscenes were a joke. It's kind of hard to take the game seriously when the camera angles switch between close up of the floor and half a character's face during every cutscene.\n\n4.  Flat characters and lame storyline. The game played like one of those choose your own adventure books with a little target shooting thrown in here and there. The designers really got into this 'choose between factions' idea and took it too far. All the interactions and cutscenes were nothing more than each faction trying to persuade you to join their side with very little underlying plot or consequences for your actions. The characters seemed so dull and one dimensional. The designers tried to get all philosophical with many elements of the game but failed to impress me with the depth of their ideas and understanding.\n\n5.  Crawling in air ventilation. After a while, you start to realize that attached to every room it is a grate leading to a gigantic man-sized ventilation shaft with convenient ladders for all the vertical sections. Not only is this kind of silly, but it becomes annyoing when you spend half the game crawling through these vanilla cloned tunnels. Of course you don't HAVE to go that route, but when the alternative is to waste an item, ammo, or other resource, and vent crawling is free, you are encouraged to spend your time exploring the ducts.\n\n6.  You get all firearms and items way too early. The game essentially gives you every item in the game in the first hour of playing. I had about 10 unused biomod upgrades at the end of the game with all my biomods maxed out. You are loaded up with so much stuff that it destroys all the fun of spontaneously finding a new item or upgrading your skill to a new level.\n\n7.  Side quests for money to buy WHAT? There are quite a few "secondary" goals that typically result in a small cash reward. However, you are already overstocked and a millionaire with nowhere to go and nothing to buy. They add very little to the gameplay because the story underlying each quest is trivial (e.g. go find someone and talk to them to make sure they're ok) and you're so loaded with cash anyway.","November 18, 2014","false","15.8"," 112 of 144 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","112","144","5","0"

However, it is still a very good science fiction title. With a more action oriented approach, IW takes the series further into the future of the timeline. Gone is the ultra gritty setting of the original Deus Ex, filled instead with neon and advanced tech. The gameplay stays mostly the same from the original. Even with more action, the options are still very present. Using stealth or rocket launchers are both viable options. These options are limited compared to the two other entries in the series but are still fun to explore. The story though kicks ♥♥♥ once again. Conspiracy, multiple factions, and heavy choices are all very much a part of the narrative. The endings are incredible.

To enjoy DX2:IW it is best to approach with lowered expectations.  The game play is decent, but reduced from what one will find in the first game.  Where this game shines is the story.  The story is excellent and will compel the player to move forward.   Some other things that are enjoyable are finding multiple solutions to achieve a goal, and being able to explore the connected levels however you wish.\n\nHaving said that, there are plenty of things to complain about here.  The maps are smaller.  The game is shorter.  Even the enemies are dumber and the variety is reduced.  I find it silly that Ion Storm created this game from scratch with the Unreal 2 engine; the game engine from the first game could easily do everything that one finds in this installment.  Guess they really want to get it onto Xbox.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoktorHaus/recommended/6920/","DoktorHaus","Doktor haus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoktorHaus/","232 products in account","Deus Ex: Invisible War is the sequel to Deus Ex, an RPG/shooter hybrid which garnered so much universal praise that you might say its sequel was always destined to be a disappointment. Its followup, released in 2003, received generally positive reviews from publications, although the general consensus was "It falls short of the original." However, the fans overwhelmingly hated it, even refusing to think of it as a true Deus Ex game. Was it a case of inflated expectations or overzealous fanboys?\nIn my opinion, Invisible War is not as bad as its reputation, but the fans still have a point.\n\nThe first problem is it was designed from day one as a console title with mass appeal and simplification in mind. The skills system is gone, every item occupies one space in the inventory and all weapons accept a universal ammo type. That's a big problem because in the final levels, most enemies can be defeated only with heavy weapons, which drain ammo fast, and when you're out, you can't even switch to a standby. Oh, and did I mention there's no way to non-lethally pacify one particular enemy? The weapon mods are no longer a modular increase of stats, but singular installations that have a strategic use like breaking glass silently or dealing EMP damage. The boltcaster replaces the old crossbow, the stun prod makes a return and the baton is also non-lethal and several grenade types are also added to aid the player. The fairly rare noisemaker draws enemies wherever it lands and the flashbomb (you guessed it) blinds enemies for a few seconds. In addition, the gas grenade returns and the LAM (in the form of concussion grenades), the scrambler and the spiderbomb grenade, which spawns an allied spiderbot.\n\nThe levels are much smaller compared to the first game, almost claustrophobic and unsettlingly empty, yet they're even more confusing to navigate. Different areas are broken up by frequent, lengthy loading screens that not-so-subtly re-launch the application, which of course breaks the immersion like Hell. Just getting around can also be a pain because of the physics. For example, jumping on a create is a feat in patience and luck because although the physics are mostly sound, the weight of objects is severely flawed; The slightest bump sends even the massive, unliftable crates flying across the room like they were made of styrofoam.\n\nThe graphics still... technically hold up today. Being designed for the XBox, the engine utilizes dynamic light and shadow, bloom, ambient occlusion, facial animation and more, but aesthetically it's a different story. The world feels very "Jetsons-ish" for lack of a better word, everything covered in neon blue lights. The NPCs have been upgraded from a graphical standpoint, but still stand and animate like the first game, and some of the facial animation is just... Well, some NPCs look like they're perpetually surprised. Installing the unified texture pack massively improves the visual appeal, adding HD textures to almost everything and even toning down the cosmic horror of the facial animations.\n\nThe AI is still dim and will ignore you even in plain sight if you're about 20 feet away. You can pick away at them from behind cover and they may never confront you, watch their friends get blown up in their face and still wander aimlessly and when you're cloaked, they continue walking right into you without attacking. But they can still provide a challenge in numbers, especially the biohazard-spewing greasels and big, dumb, lumbering karkians. On several occasions, my maxed-out see-through-walls aug didn't detect them (yet another flaw) and I waltzed right up to one, getting the **** scared out of me.\n\nThe voice acting is, well... The major characters sound alright, but some of the NPCs just sound awful. Some of the sounds (especially the weapons) can be grating, but others are... kind of nice? The music is appropriately futuristic and retains the aesthetic from the first game, but is much less noticable and eargasmic, less memorable themes than ambient background music to put on before bed. That seems to be the way of this game: a mixed bag; some of it a ham sandwich, some of it stale vomit.\n\nThe story is the best thing about this game. Despite all its flaws, that's what kept me interested enough to keep pressing on. Without spoiling anything, you'll get wrapped up in many conspiracies (Even the coffee shops are part of one!) and be forced to take sides, which you can still switch even at the final moment of the game. That sounds like freedom, but then you realize that none of the choices you make effect the outcome of the game, beyond the last level or two and a pre-rendered end cutscene. But still, sociopolitics, government, privacy, ethics, enterprise, technology, religion, god itself ...politics, bureaucracy, mismanagement... are all discussed at some point. Two factions have a clear motivation, although others (which aren't revealed until late in the game) really don't give you a reason to carry out their bidding. Invisible War also connects with the original game through returning characters, and is set in a world still reeling from the effects of "The Collapse", a combination of two endgame choices the player could have made. Your role takes you through Seattle, Cairo, Trier, Antarctica, good old Liberty Island and of course, several secret bases in between, unraveling a web of deceit over which the player has the final choice. Invisible War expects the player to have finished the first game, but if you read books, listen to newscasts and talk with NPCs, it's enough to fill you in.\n\nBut Deus Ex was all about freedom-of-choice for the player, so does that still hold true? For the most part. You can play through most of the game without killing anyone (unless you side with the wrong faction) and incapacitate enemies from the shadows, or gun down everything in sight, multitool a locked door or coax a code out of NPCs. There are plenty of hacking opportunities and alternate entrances as well. The only thing I hate is being forced to do side missions for extra credits before I can travel to the next level, so take my advice: rescue Ava Johnson in Seattle; she flies you around for free! There are enough side missions to extend the game by a few hours and plenty of rewards for the explorer, such as supplies, weapon mods and rare secret weapons. You can also read plenty of datacubes and books, listen to the news terminals and talk to countless NPCs to learn more about the world you're in. But even if you complete every side mission, explore every area and talk to everyone, it's a pretty short game.\n\nAs for the technical flaws I played through the game until one of the final levels, saved and quit and when I returned, my saves were corrupted. But even though I rushed through the second time, I still felt intrigued to learn more about the story. The game crashed regularly and unpredictably as well, every 30 minutes the first playthrough and only twice the second time. And the second time was with mods!\n\nSo, is this the worst game ever? Far from it; but it is held back by design flaws and cursed by a poor PC port. Deus Ex had flaws too, but they were easily overlooked. With Invisible War, it's much harder. But does it deserve the "Deus Ex" name? In my opinion, yes. The story follows that familiar thread, full of conspiracies and philosophy and despite a shift toward FPS gameplay, it still manages to create that feeling of being an augmented agent, sneaking, hacking, fighting and completing the game in your own style.","December 28, 2013","true","3.0"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","44","57","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/6920/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","While Deus Ex: Invisible War isn't a godawful game by itself, it's decidedly so in comparison to the original Deus Ex - and for that matter I'd guess it's worse than Human Revolution, too. I really, really wish Steam reviews had a 'mixed' option, because I can't recommend IW over those two games except for series completionists or dedicated genre fans.\n\nSeriously, I had to try twice to beat this game. I lost motivation on my first attempt because of how aggressively blah it gets.\n\n\nI'm not one to complain about games being "dumbed down", and the original wasn't exactly an ergonomic masterpiece, but Invisible War was designed for the original Xbox in mind. That means they cut out and/or simplified a lot: skills, aug slots, lockpicks, hacking, keycodes & damage models. With the removal of a lot of what made the original distinctive, IW essentially becomes almost a straight FPS. Small, weirdly-designed maps (albeit with some interesting ideas here and there) & a smaller, awkward inventory - with no dragging even - don't do it any favors either. That's not mentioning the bugs, general instability or handicapped AI.\n\nThe unified ammo system is nice in theory, but in practice it becomes annoying. You can only carry up to around 9 or so clips, and ammo is rather scarce for players who use a number of weapons regularly. If you chew through most of them with one weapon, you might not have enough for another weapon when you need it. That said, it makes ammo and stealth that much more valuable and worth hunting for/investing in, so that's something. Combat controls themselves are a bit more smooth than DX's, if you ignore the floaty mouse movement, but they're not quite as satisfying and the engine makes fights janky as hell anyway.\n\nOn that note, the controls are somewhat more streamlined than the original and yet somehow more clunky to use, mainly because of the fact that it was designed for use with an Xbox controller: again, no clicking and dragging. I missed leaning and I especially missed conversation transcriptions - it's difficult enough following the plot here without being distracted when someone contacts you over your infolink. I'm on the fence about the fact that you can choose any aug from any canister, but that there are also two separate types of canisters. Ragdoll physics are often either dull or hilariously broken. On the plus side, ladder climbing is improved. Automatic pull-ups over ledges are nice too, and the robot control augmentation is splendid to use.\n\n\nFor what it's worth, it's possible to have both cloaking AND thermal masking, albeit at the cost of hacking abilities. Even if I liked being able to simply waltz past enemies and always have the initative, I think there was a reason that both of those augs were mutually excusive in the original DX.\n\nIt's pretty weird and 'convenient' that clubs and mosques and other such places have "codes" that can disable ALL your weapons, even the blunt clubs. It's a rather clumsy implementation of plot-mandated invincibility - you can kill anyone anywhere in this game, so the devs turned off weapons in certain public places to keep players from destroying the plot.\n\nGraphics are plasticine and blockier than the original, and the original was on the blocky side already. I'd say IW's looks have actually aged more. Not good for the game's verisimillitude.\n\nBy far the worst part however is the fact that the game literally shuts down and relaunches itself every time you load a new level, supposedly to cut down on long-term runtime errors in the engine. It breaks the game's Steamworks functionality and it's just dumb as hell considering how small the levels are to begin with & how long the loading times are. I found myself deciding what to do based partially on the number of loading screens between me and my potential destinations.\n\n\nInvisible War has less bombast than the original Deus Ex. While I guess it's a nice change of pace, I can't help but feel that's a liability for a game that also focus on globetrotting power conspiracies.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty damn bland. I like Alex's voice, though - that character's actors seem to have found a comfortable spot to let the character grow his (or her) own snarky, deadpan personality; distinct from yet similar to JC Denton's. Being able to pick a male or female character is also nice, since they at least went through the trouble of doubling the PC's VO work. The dynamic music that changes by location in the same level is a good touch; it's not as distinct or awesome as DX's, but good nonetheless.\n\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD for this game as well as the original. If you want further analysis, you could try watching this Errant Signal video.\n\nI do like how the factions this time around seem to be the most morally ambiguous of any in the series. The actual writing might not be very good - the amount of typos and inaccurate subtitles are also surprising for a game supposedly this prominent - but it's not a complete wreck. The subjects it deals with are still rather unique in the world of games.\n\nBy the mid-game, however, the writers start trotting out characters, plot points and eventually locations from the original presumably for the purpose of keeping players going. At no point are you given any choices or quandaries to rival the original game. JC is essentially retconned into the Helios-merged being from one of the three endings in the original, which might not go over well for those who were really invested in making him their own charater in that game.\n\nOh yeah, all three original Deus Ex endings are canon here. It feels like a cop-out.\n\nI also kind of like the fact that there are four different endings - especially since these include a 'renegade' option where you kill everyone, which you couldn't do in the original. Of course, these ending's aren't really on par with DX's, considering that the outcomes of each ending aren't quite what you'd expect . The renegade ending has the Omar inheriting the planet after baseline humanity blows itself to pieces in revanchist warfare...despite the very idea of nation-states supposedly being weaker than ever.\n\nIt's at least fitting that the factions are merely using you as a pawn in their grand plans. The neo-Helios ending I went for was kind of interesting...if only because it's apparently the least bad ending, and even that one entailed forced evolution and sacifice for all of humanity. Not exactly a good sign.\n\nThe worst part here, however, is how anti-climactic the end really is. For three out of four endings, you make your way to a poorly-rendered recreation of an iconic area from the first game and literally use a computer to select which ending you want. Compare to Deus Ex's sprawling end-game compound, where each ending entailed committing to multiple different objectives. That's not to mention how poorly the real nature of the various factions is handled, especially the early-game ones. It's not the worst sort of black-and-white writing, but it's still pretty shoddy!\n\nLastly, I don't like NG Resonance's music, but her subplot has some of the most interesting writing in the game. All I'll say is that IW predates the Snowden leaks by a decade.","February 12","false","24.5"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","30","39","4","0"

It unfortunately distills what made it's predecessor great down into mediocre banality.  Where computer skill would allow you to sift through people's personal emails in it's predecessor, learning important information, here you only need click on the computer with a hologram of a rotating letter above it - an insulting symptom of dumbing down of the core game mechanics into big signs that the dumbest of people can see, understand and use.\n\nIn fact, gone are the experience points and skill leveling of the first game entirely.  Instead, the only leveling to be done is by biomod cannisters which add and improve abilities (strength, stealth, hacking, etc.) but is so uninteresting and rote in it's implementation that I wish it didn't even bother.  Any "skill" you choose to apply in excludes some others from consideration, but they max out at 3 cannisters each, leading you with a load of unusable biomod cannisters at the end of the game.  Unless you choose to experiment with another "skill" which you won't, because most of them kinda suck anyway.\n\nWeapon modification is worse, because you can only add 2 mods to any weapon and some weapons can't be modded at all, so again, you'll have plenty of weapon mods you can't use.  It's almost pathetically comical that characters give you biomods and weapon mods as rewards in the last several hours of game when you've already settled into the biomod "skills" and weaponry of choice and have modded them all out already.\n\nThe story is mostly a rehash with some of the same characters returning for what amounts to the same end game:  control of a technology for world domination, or freedom, depending on your point of view.  The character conversations are sometimes so insipid I just skipped through them, and most of the choices involve either a "yes" or "no" style answer which has no impact on the actual story, because at the end of the game the ending you get is determined, literally, by which button you decide to press.\n\nI just played through it a second time, completely forgetting I had played through it previously, because the visual tone of the game is so bland, and the endings so bad.  It's 90% values of blue and gray.  Beginning of the game you're in a lab, then you're in a city, then you're in another city, and more labs, and another city, at some point you'll be in antartica and at another on Liberty Island (also looking like antartica).  The palate in this game is severely lacking.  And the 4 different endings are all kind of distasteful.\n\nThis game also had performance issues on every system I've ever played it on, except the Xbox.  Certain areas would have profound, inexplicable slowdown.  I've had similar performance issues with Thief 3, which was developed by the same peeps using the same Unreal engine,...  my guess is they optimized the engine for the Xbox at the expense of the PC versions.  Still, it's worth a play.","May 27, 2014","true","35.0"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","0"

It was a 67 at best when it was brand new; it's aged badly since then. It suffers badly from having been designed for the memory and control constraints of the original X-Box. The levels are cramped and ugly. The field of view is far too tight (and requires using a hex editor to manually edit memory values in the executable to change to something tolerable). The guns are forgettable (with the exception of the gun mod that makes glass windows dissolve instead of shatter, that was mildly amusing) and all draw from the same universal ammo pool. Worst of all the main story is plain old tripe that not only does not hold up well to scrutiny but which commits the sin of trivializing the first game's ending by declaring that all three mutually exclusive endings in Deus Ex 1 happened simultaneously. By watering down and blending three very distinct and different endings they weakened and cheapened the story space for both Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex: Invisible War.\n\nThe three main factions in the game, the Templars (hypocrtical neo-Luddities in power armor), the Illuminati (representing capitalist concerns), and the Dentons (who are trying to properly finish the Helios ending from Deus Ex 1) are all easy to hate. By the middle of the game I was annoyed with all of them. By the end, I decided to actively sabotage everyone, giving me the Omar Trader ending where the world burns in an apocolypse and Russian cyborgs end up ruling the cinders. I was actually happy with that, since the "good" endings required working with characters I had come to despise.\n\nOn the up side, the game does have a somewhat interesting side story about a corporate war between two coffee chains. This was in no way a worthy sequel to Deus Ex 1, and would have been a better game if it'd been divorced entirely from that intellectual property.","February 21, 2014","false","1.9"," 87 of 153 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","87","153","3","0"

This game is made by the same developers as the first game, Ion Storm.\nBut has this sequel live up to it's predecessor or even exceed it? The answer in my opinion is no way. This is a major step down from the first Deus Ex game. Everything has been simplified and compacted. For example the inventory. In the first game the inventory was good. U could fit many weapons in there and some weapons took up more space than others. That's realistic. But in this game, u only have a certain number of slots and when u fill up those slots, u can't pick up anything else. Also they have this system called universal ammo. What it does is that every weapon in the game uses the same type of ammo. This is a ♥♥♥♥ system. For example, when i use a pistol and i use up all the ammo, i switch to my sniper rifle to only find that my snipper rifle is out of ammo. Also the character models look crapier than the first game. If that's even possible. The environments are also very inclosed, quite diffrent from the open world levels we got in the first game and finally, the story is really confusing. I was sitting in my chair a few times saying WTF is going on to myself.\n\nTo Enjoy Invisible War, u have to go in with low expectations.

I avoided Invisible War for quite some time because the fan reception has been absolutely crushing. But since I found this on sale for a little over a dollar, I decided to give it a try and form my own opinion. And guess what? It's really not that bad. Sure, it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original, and I understand if the fans found the initial release in 2003 disappointing, but on its own it's actually a pretty good game.\n\nFor example, the levels themselves might be small, but even then it has a good amount of player freedom to progress however you wish. Violence, stealth, hacking, etcetera. In a way, it reminds me of Human Revolution (albeit in a lesser form). It had smaller levels compared to the original as well (though HR's levels are bigger and more complex than IW's), but it was dense enough to allow multiple ways through with different builds. Even better than both DX1 and HR was the different factions you could side with or do missions for. In the first half this gives it an extra dynamic of player freedom. Doing missions for one faction usually means not being able to complete a mission for the other groups. As a result, it adds a nice touch of choice and consequences, both in the main story and side quests you can complete.\n\nBut there are some issues with it. Most of them you probably already know if you're familiar with the fan reception. First of all, the levels are very tiny in comparison. Most likely due to the Xbox hardware. And because of the tiny levels, you're very frequently being bothered by loading screens. It's not the actual loading times that are the problem, but the amount of times you're looking at a loading screen to enter or leave areas. Also, I didn't find the augmentations ("bio mods") to be very interesting in this game. The Neural Interface is the only crucial one if you want to hack stuff, everything else is very basic. Also, there are some smaller things they've changed, some for the worse. Stuff like universal ammo, no attribute skills (not necessarily a bad thing since DX:HR doesn't have it either and that turned out to be an amazing game), less fleshed out in-game lore, and so on.\n\nIn short, Invisible War's biggest flaw is the lack of ambition. The very same ambition that made the original so loved.\n\nSo. Do I recommend it? Depends on several aspects. Do you already own DX1 and Human Revolution? If not, those two are vastly superior in all regards, so you might want to spend your money on that instead. But if you already own both, then yes, I do recommend you playing through Invisible War at least once. Even if it's just to form your own opinion of it.","February 4","true","16.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I went into this expecting an experience akin to that of arm wrestling with a chainsaw, but I guess that everyone's talk of this game lowered my expectations to unreasonable depths. Invisible War is, while not as good as its predecessor, a good game.\n\nA big complaint I notice is the "consolization", the clear downgrade in many aspects of the overall design of the first game, including large levels, complex controls, dynamic damage, skills, and swimming. (The multiplayer is gone as well.) There is a lack of control options, which correlated directly to removal of leaning, reduced toolbelt size and biomod (augmentation) slots, and an ugly HUD. As for the size of areas, I would chalk that up to incredibly sloppy coding and graphics that were ahead of their time. One might look at the game's system requirements and then remember that this released in North America in 2003. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is still little excuse; The smaller areas force a different style of gameplay, and the frequency and time of the loading screens is just annoying.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, there is nothing wrong. The graphics are great, and the story, a direct sequel, I would say surpasses that of the original, at least in terms of depth. In terms of how memorable the characters are... eh, I don't really have much to say. Open-ended missions change the flow of the game. Rather than being given one main objective at a time a la the first game, the player is given multiple objectives from warring factions that ultimately branch to the end, and make the ending seem like more of a result of the path taken throughout the game, rather than a rushed decision made at the last minute, though the latter is certainly still possible should you enjoy being chaotic in choosing your allies.\n\nSadly, if the story is more open than the original, the same cannot be said for weapons and inventory management. Multitools and lockpicks are now one and the same. Items now only take up one slot each, so there is no need for inventory Tetris, but the small size can only be increased by installing and upgrading a specific biomod. Food can be stacked regardless of the type. Firearms have universal ammo, which I saw to be a self-defeating mechanism. In the original Deus Ex, running out of ammo for a weapon forced me to rethink my entire combat strategy and apply it until I could renew my supplies. Here, run out for one gun, you run out for just about everything else. On top of that, weapons can only take two mods at a time, and mods cannot be removed once applied.\n\nEven with a decent variety of weapons, I found little point to using nonlethal tactics. At least during the first few hours of the first game, you would get reprimanded for it. Here, there is almost never a reason to not just kill enemies on the spot. Even when I do use a nonlethal weapon, the game treats the character as having died, and he or she will not appear again. The small area sizes, while not too restrictive, encourage more aggressive gameplay by giving very limited options as to approach.\n\nThe player has fewer biomods/augmentations at one time. Luckily, many of the classics are here, as well as some new ones to compensate for the ones which were pulled. The best change here is having three to choose from for any specific slot, and the ability to change between them should you have the materials. It's a fine way to keep the player from restarting when he's realized that the combination he's chosen to go with is ineffective.\n\nI'm certain I've left something out, but this review has to end sometime. Even with all of its simplification problems, it manages to cling enough to the core Deus Ex gameplay. I plan on coming back to this sometime in the future, as I'm certain there's a lot more for me to discover, and the mission structure provides a great deal of replay value. Methinks people would treat this game better were it not called Deus Ex, but as it stands, Invisible War is a fine addition to the series.","March 19, 2015","true","10.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The story starts off with Alex, an Orphan, raised by a couple in Chicago and put into a special schoolfor gifted children, where she eventually found her way into the Taurus program, a human augmentation program. You start off being attacked by religious fanatics and are given both sides point of view, with each side trying to persuade you the other is the real threat. Interesting story, I like the concept and it had be playing for over an hour, when I only intended a short demo for the review. It appears to further the Deus Ex Canon, and while it has all the wonderful potential of a Deus Ex game, I will warn you now there are bugs.\n\nFirst of all, every time the game wants to load a new area, It jumps back to your desktop for a a few seconds and the resolution change makes your desktop appear to be supersized. It does this a lot. The graphics are not quite up to par for a sequel to Deus Ex, but it is passable. The game almost has a feel as though it were rushed or poorly ported from a handheld or console. I think it would be a prime candidate for a reboot, as it was interesting. All in all I will recommend it, but only to those who are familiar with the Deus Ex series, so as to acquire this piece of Deus Ex Canon for your collection. Otherwise, if you are looking for a quality game, and don't care about the series, the Original is great, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution is fantastic.

This was the time of a new console generationt and these swallowed a large proportion of the gaming community - and this was one of the first games the developers clearly created with console gamers in mind.\nThis meant that the user interface was oversimplified and blocked half of the view, that the game was not properly optimized for PC, that the creators had to settle for smaller level size or decreased game complexity.\nAll the above meant that in the eyes of most PC gamers DX:IW was an unbecoming second installation to its truly amazing predecessor.\n\nI played it through then halfheartedly, and then again and again with more and more enthusiasm. Now, 10 years later I will summarize my opinion as I see this game today, sometimes in comparison with DX.\nFirst our old grievances:\n- 10 years passed, so the lack of optimization is not an issue anymore,\n- there are community packs to make it look bettter, looks good for its age,\n- smaller levels meant more loading (game settings were broken up into smaller levels) but with today's PCs this only takes a moment - also not a problem anymore,\n- hud can be customized via mods.\n\nBad that did not change (a matter of taste, for You all these can be aadvantagious):\n- still oversimplified: awkward inventory management, less augmentations, no skill system, universal ammo is stupid, less background info through holomail or newspapers, etc,\n- male protagonist looks and sounds like a member of a boy band,\n- stealth gaming style does not always work\n- no-kill approach does not work (in DX it was only one person You really had to kill to advance in the story)\n\nGood that will remain good til the end of times (some of these I have learnt to appreciate only on my subsequent walkthroughs):\n- somehow the writer(s) managed to incorporate all three DX game endings into the sequel, so whichever ending You are familiar with, You will easily find Your bearings and understand the premise,\n- sidequests are fun and inspired,\n- new augs (though fewer) are fun to use,\n- similarly the new weapon mods are useful and fun,\n- great level design means that most of the time You still can choose between covert or guns-blazing approach,\n- one of the best intros of its time,\n- great NPC additions like the OMAR or NG Resonance,\n- amazing places to visit like Antarctica, Trier or Cairo (including an arcology building which looks good and feels right)\n\nAll in all in my eyes funnily enough with age the game got better. It might feel disappointing after playing DX (or liberating, if You like less complexity), but a great game on its own right. Where DX gets A+++, DX:IW is worth an A- easily.\n\nRecommended.","May 22, 2013","true","25.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

For one, it's a sequel to one of the most heavily lauded games ever made. That automatically put it in the position of trying to live up to a nigh-impossible standard. But the game isn't bad, it's just very average. That's it's biggest problem, really: It's an average game that's a sequel to an amazing one. (Well, that and the stupid cover with the guy holding a pistol sideways.)\n\nInvisible War takes place about twenty years after Deus Ex. Events at the end of that game triggered something called "The Collapse", which basically crippled civilization and caused a wide variety of problems that people are still recovering from. In a way, the game implies that all three endings from DX1 sort-of happened: J.C. Denton attempted to merge with Helios but fails, which causes the global network to cease to function, which results in the downfall of national governments and the rise of "city-states". Some people have a problem with this, and while I'll certainly agree it could have been handled better, I'm not sure what people expected. Did they think that the developers would make three radically different settings depending on which ending you picked in the first game?\n\nYou play as Alex D, a nanoaugmented student in the Tarsus Academy. Of course, things aren't what they seem, and just as in the original Deus Ex, you have to uncover a conspiracy and puzzle out what's really going on.\n\nThe game plays out much as the original; you go from city to city performing missions, although in this game you get to choose whether you want to work for the Order (a religious group that springs up after the Collapse) or the World Trade Organization (which has more or less become the new version of the U.N. in this game). Which you choose does affect how the missions play out. However, it ultimately has no bearing on the way the game ends, which is another problem people have with it. I don't want to spoil the plot by explaining this, but I will say that I agree that the ultimate reveal is kind of dumb and renders a lot of your choices meaningless.\n\nAnother story element that some people complain about is how several characters from the first game return, but have radically different points of view than in the first game. However, this complaint seems rather naive to me. First of all, it's been twenty years. People change a lot over that period of time. But more importantly, the characters in question were all directly involved in the events that triggered the Collapse. If your ideals led to a catastrophic event causing untold amounts of death and devastation, don't you think that might change your outlook?\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is very similar to the original, but there are a few changes that were made to simplify things that ultimately work to the detriment of the game. The biomod system is less interesting, the level areas are smaller in order to accomodate the X-Box's memory limitations, but the worst change (and the one you will hear EVERYONE who plays this game ♥♥♥♥♥ about) is the ammunition system. In the original game (as in real life and in most FPSes), each weapon had its own ammunition, and in many cases a weapon had multiple ammo types you could choose between (for instance, shotguns had both buckshot and armor-piercing rounds). In this game, someone decided it would be a good idea to have every weapon use the same ammunition counter. The conceit is that the weapons are using nanomachines to build ammunition, and that your "ammo" is actually the raw material used to make bullets and whatnot. The biggest problem with this is that the amount of this material that you can carry is severely restricted, and heavy weapons take a huge amount of material to fire. If you, say, use a rocket launcher a few times, you may suddenly find yourself having no ammo for your pistol.\n\nLike I said: Overall, it's not a terrible game; it's just not good, either.It's easy to see why, when they made a third game, they chose to make it a prequel. Even if this had been a great game, it's hard to see where the series could go from here. I think the only way we're ever going to get a Deus Ex game set after the first one is if they reboot the original first... which, depending on how it's done, could be pretty cool, actually.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of the original Deus Ex, I would recommend playing through Invisible War at least once to see for yourself what's good and what's bad about it.","July 26, 2014","true","0.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

The gunplay is pretty bad, and it is pretty much impossible to sneak past enemies without being noticed (except if you use a biomod).\n\nOn the positive side, the graphics have been improved and you don't want to miss the story, as it explains what happened after the events in Deus Ex. The core gameplay is the same, and there are still several possibilities on how to complete a level.\n\nAll in all I recommend the game, simply because it is still Deus Ex, even though many things have been executed far worse in this game. True fans of the first game definitely shouldn't miss the story of this game :)","March 8","true","15.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The graphics might improve dramatically as you venture deeper into the experience, the level design too! The alternate routes that are so famous in the series are right there, waiting for you to exploit them, and the combat is satisfying.\n\nA bit of intrigue does exist, and the controls work well. The story is a lot longer than you expect it to be, and the levels really well made.\n\nHonestly, this is a really fun game, even if it is a little previous-previous-gen.

It was never the same as the original in so many ways, but in a lot of unexpected ways it was a little bit better, and it was a really wonderful taster of the potential of the series in a next-gen world, a taster for a the utter banquet that would be Deus Ex: Human Revolution, my favourite game of all time.","May 21","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

DXIW has a good deal going for it - unique weapons, cooler weapon mods, expanded and easier-to-use augmentations - but really pales in comparison to the original Deus Ex.  It's a lot of little things which I could list in great detail - mediocre plot, painfully simple weapon system, endings that feel more like "choose the least crappy one" than "choose the one you like" - that just make DXIW see like a step backward, not forward.  If you were expecting the worthy successor to Deus Ex you will be very disappointed indeed.\n\nNow that said, this isn't a bad game.  If you evaluate it on its own, without the first Deus Ex as part of the equation, it's actually a neat game.  It's certainly entertaining and somewhat compelling, just not nearly as much as the first.  But because so much of the game has to do with its predecessor the comparisons are inevitable.  It's unfortunate, but there you go.\n\nBottom line, it's worth a play.  Just don't go in expecting to be blown away like you were by Deus Ex, and brace yourself for a fair bit of "seriously wtf" when it comes to dealing with characters from the previous game, especially in the endgame.","May 26, 2013","true",""," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MHartman/recommended/6920/","MHartman","MoeHartman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MHartman/","2961 products in account","Video game sequels are pretty serious business. Although the sequel has become popular in nearly all forms of media, gaming is clearly one arena where its reigned supreme. In 2013, only 6 of the top 100 best selling games were entirely original works. Even critics in 2013 showed a preference towards established properties with only five original games scoring over 90 on MetaCritic. As such, there’s a great deal of pressure on developers to match, if not exceed, their previous work, and when a game’s considered a masterpiece, the expectations are magnified even further.\n\nAs such, it’s no wonder that a game like Deus Ex: Invisible War has been so reviled by fans of the initial game, and many of the complaints are difficult to refute. Deus Ex has become one of my personal favorite games, and after having spent some time with War, I must concur with the majority that the first installment is a more complex and smarter game with vastly greater possibilities, but that’s not to say that this sequel has no charms or is inferior to most.\n\nThe most marked change to the game’s core play is the removal of the skills system, which had allowed gamers to customize their play style in drastic ways, giving the cyberpunk shooter a distinct RPG flavor. Invisible War still contains RPG elements, primarily in the dialogue options and in the inclusion of Biomod super powers, but even these seem less malleable than before. Thus it plays in a much more straightforward way. There usually are still several ways to get through an area, but there are fewer times in which creativity is profitable.\n\nLevel design philosophy has also shifted in major ways. The areas the player explores are significantly smaller and more straightforward, which results in a much greater amount of loading screens. This design choice was obviously made to make the console porting process smooth, but for what it’s worth, they cram an awful lot into these areas. In the first game, the areas may have been large, but some of them were mostly empty. The reverse is true in Invisible War with almost none of the filler, inaccessible background areas that plagued the cities we explored in Deus Ex.\n\nWhether this is a welcome change or not could be debated, because it does make it easier to find relevant destinations and exploration was a major draw of the first game, but were this an entirely new game, I would likely think nothing of this decision, and the same could be said for many of the games ‘flaws.’ Take the oft-criticized universal ammo approach. While the ammo can be used in any weapon, each weapon uses a different amount of ammo. I found myself favoring the sniper rifle for it’s accuracy and power, but this came at the cost of conservation, especially later in the game. Though most of the enemies drop ammunition, their clips do not cover the cost of a sniper shot, adding a strategic element that was lacking in the first game with its plentiful resources. Along with this the player has a smaller inventory, making management essential, serving as a stark counter to the comically large selection of weapons a player could carry in the first.\n\nBesides these controversial elements, the game is a major improvement in several areas. Even on release, Deus Ex was criticized for its bland art design and blocky textures, and the years have not done it a favor. Some of this blandness may have been to emphasize the destitute state of the poor, but that could also be a convenient excuse. Invisible War, however, has a vibrancy to it and is fairly detailed in spite of its age of over a decade. The difference in graphics becomes especially noticeable when comparing objects that appear in both games, such as the repair bot, which sports greater detail here but is instantly recognizable. The backgrounds are also better, effectively nailing the dystopian future.\n\nIt’s the storytelling where the game really excels over its predecessor, though. The first game had plenty of interesting political and philosophical ideas, but since it was a longer game, the plot could get rather convoluted. It also featured rather poor dialogue and voice acting, although it could be humorous at times and sometimes even intentionally so. Though this game lacks some of those campy bits of fun, the writing feels a lot more professional and the story is concise enough that every section feels important, and it does this without losing the core debate between utility and freedom that was waged in the first game. The voice acting also has been given a boost. A few of the foreign accents are just as bad as in the first game, but the principle cast has been improved with a few small cameos from the first game thrown in for good measure.\n\nAlong with these upgrades, the approach towards female characters is also laudable, particularly for its time. The first Deus Ex was smart, but it was a game dominated by men with most of the female characters playing in menial, background roles such as secretaries and receptions or in less flattering positions like hostage and muggee. Here, there seems to have been a very conscious decision to level the playing field. Besides letting you choose the protagonist Alex D’s race and gender, there are plenty of female enemies, and the majority of the figures that you encounter through the game from the pop star NG Resonance to your teacher Dr. Nassif to your classmates Billie and Klara to a potential pilot are women, and all of these figures are powerful in some ways or other. Although this sort of thing is much more common these days, it wasn’t the case in 2003, and I would bet that the game’s clear feminism has not received its due praise.\n\nWhether Deus Ex Invisible War is a good sequel is hard to say. It loses some of the things that made the first game such a joy to play and doesn’t necessarily subtract for the sake of its strengths. When looking at the sequel to such a popular game, though, the more pertinent question might be whether it is simply a good game or not, and to that the answer is a definite yes. It may streamline much of what made its predecessor good to such an extent that it becomes barely recognizable, but after all, when it comes to a sequel, who really needs or wants a carbon copy? Invisible War makes a number of bold changes that don’t always pay off, but it’s a must play for fans of Action RPGs and 1st Person Shooters.","February 17, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also the game make use of returning character like I haven´t seen, it really feel like a justify sequel and it really expand of the deus Mythos, the endings tend to go in the absolute route, but at the same time, I though the same about the endings of the first deus ex, and some how the manage to make all three endings canon to this story.\n\nI haven´t played yet Human Revolution, but so far Deus Ex: The Fall is the worst game in the franchise, this one just blows it out of the water, and so far this is becoming my favorite videogame franchise of all time.\n","February 6","true","16.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A paltry mess!\n\nInvisible War could have been so much more. Why this game happened however, and why people thought it was a good idea, are the questions I pose. How could anything possibly follow Deus Ex? It is an utter impossibility for a game often tipped as game of the century. Furthermore, Deus Ex ends with 3 possible endings, and while Invisible War tries hard to tie these three endings together, it does not give the game full justice I feel as the plot feels incomplete. Characters from the first game are dragged back in for cameo roles, and this just feels redundant. Moreover to be questioned is which developer of the game decided to use generalised ammo throughout the game - I could garrote them for that move. I kid you not, I am unable to complete the game with ammunition without entering system files before playing and multiplying ammunition found in the world to 7 TIMES THEIR VALUE. Anything less, and I spend the last few levels of the game running around like a maniac because I have no ammunition at all, and the enemies later on require a lot to kill, and they drop so little ammunition! It just doesn't add up. The game also lacks the choice and diversity that Deus Ex so proudly boasted, and generally falls short in any respect I can think of.\n\nIt is understandable as to why so many die-hard Deus Ex fans do not count this game as being canon whatsoever.","June 28, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The two biggest pains in the patoot being the tiny-as-fudgeknuckle box-shaped locations to explore providing far too many visits to the often broken loading screen and the writing itself heading into the fantastical, away from the recognizable and richly-detailed world of the first DX (gone are all the e-mails and most literature and admirable characters--& Pacotti/Grossman's high-quality dialogue with Australian-Chinese bartenders and hidden AI prototypes are limited to just a few instances like with the NG Resonance AI).\n\nBUT: The game's still addictive; the story's stil strong enough to draw you in, and some levels, most notably the Egyptian arcology, are top notch (if you look past the loading screens); the goofy physics of objects and ragdolls are fun to mess around with; the graphics have held up well; and it's beyond satisfying to snoop around and knock out 2-dimensional villains with one baton swing to the face.","May 24, 2011","true","13.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I like it, but I can't seem to keep enough ammo, or can't find enough clips.  Gonna quit for now, but that I have to have a melee on me, that I can't use an ATM and store anything, yeah, it's a decent story with 2003 graphics that aren't too bad, especially for the time, but someone decided the story isn't to be told, as much as strained by these simple issues that probably kept Invisible Ware from being a more popular title, 2 or 3 darts, each using 25% of the clip, yeah very strained.  I am sure some players have just breezed through this on the hardest mode, more power to em.  I am exploring everything, and with that, it's just expensive for ammo etc., some will tell me to use the baton.  Sure, if it works every time.... Ran into similar problems with original deus ex (so thinking from 199 to 2003 wasn't a big jump, probably same minds involved).  Human Revolution seems to be the one where easy mode means you have ammo etc.).\n\nWould be nice if companies like Eidos who will put out a package of titles of the same name, like the Deus Ex pack, would include a patch for modern day displays.  Tried a few outside patches and they require making a copy of Deus Ex and putting it in with their program, or making settings changes in the ini files that make the screen location where you click buttons move, so the buttons don't work clicking where they are displayed on screen anymore.  I mean, since they put the Deus Ex  games in a package for one price, making the graphics fit modern day displays on all the gams together would make it worth paying 10 bucks instead of the 7 I think I paid for all (after buying the original Human Revolution as pre-order, paying full retail at Gamestop I think it was, which had its own issue with them farming out the boss fights, leading to the Director's Cut, so we pay again...).\n\nRecommended with notice of the above, as it is a good story and overall game.","February 23, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/6920/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","As a sequel to the original Deus Ex, Invisible War is weak, being inferior in most aspects. The levels are much smaller, the the levelling system is massively neutered (you can only upgrade augments, as opposed to additional skills) combat is weaker in many ways.\n\nWith that said however, Invisible War is actually a pretty good game when taken on its own merits. First off, the atmosphere is fantastic. Even though the worlds are way smaller than those of Deus Ex 1, Invisible war uses lighting, music, and visuals to great effect, resulting in a moody world that draws you in, despite being so far removed from anything in the real world. The art direction is really fantastic. Furthermore, the storyline is really interesting. It doesn't start out quite as compelling as the original, but it picks up quickly and has loads of great twists. There were lots of memorable characters, as is series tradition, and it's great to see what became of certain characters from the first game (although I didn't care for what they did with JC Denton). Also, the fact that this game essentially provides closure for the Deus Ex Universe makes it very much worth seeing the game through to the ending.\n\nOne really interesting thing this game does that the first game didn't (and I'd even say Invisible War might be slightly better in this regard) is that you can actually choose which faction to work for during each mission. Invisible War carries on the first game's tradition of having your choices make a massive impact on how the story plays out (I've heard that your choice of character gender actually has an effect on some of what side-missions are available, but I haven't done a second playthrough so I'm not sure what extent this alters things to), and being able to choose who you work for brings this to a whole new level, as it lets you experience the story from different perspectives, and what you do at certain points in the game actually does effect which endings are available (as opposed to in the first and third game, where you essentially choose your ending at the last minute). How you interact with characters is key and your relationships with the characters can affect the gameplay in numerous ways. The dialogue plays out more naturally than in the first game (I do miss how all the random NPCs seemingly had PHD's in philosophy in the first game, as it was cheesy, but also really interesting and part of the original's charm) and the story covers some interesting topics. Interestingly, this game goes into a lot of the same pro-augmentation vs anti-augmentation debates that characters in Human Revolution had (this topic was in Deus Ex 1 a bit, but not to the extent of this game and HR), so it does seem to have at least had some influence on future installments of the series. Overall, the storyline is definitely a strong point, and worthy of the Deus Ex name.\n\nNow, about the gameplay. Yes, it isn't nearly as good as Deus Ex 1, but it's still better than many games. Whereas the original was an RPG played through the interface of a first person shooter, this game is more of a first-person shooter with light RPG elements. Overall the guns feel decent (although the pistol is pretty useless), but the melee attacks lack punch. You'll be progressing through a series of cramped, but surprisingly non-linear levels and are given the freedom to choose your objectives based on what faction you like. There are a surprising amount of side missions, and just like in the original game, you can opt to do a pacifist run. Your augmentations can let you do some crazy, almost game-breaking stuff (Bot Domination is particularly awesome. It lets you take control of enemy robots, and getting the jump on an enemy patrol who was hanging out with enemy robots is both awesome and hilarious), which can lead to some fun situations. Something that's interesting about how this game handles augments is that you can actually replace your augments with a different ones if you find yourself in a desperate situation where an augment you didn't choose would be helpful. This is a last-ditch strategy though, as the new augment starts out un-upgraded, so you'll usually have to carefully weigh your options. Unfortunately, the weight of this decision is lessened a great deal by the sheer abundance of upgrade cannisters in the game. By the time you finish, you'll probably have at least 10 or so extra cannisters laying around, meaning that if you swap augs for a situation, you can often easily swap back to what you had before and re-upgrade it to the maximum level. Swapping is still an interesting and useful mechanic, even though the abundance of upgrades hurts the design.\n\nThe inventory system is a bit awkward. You can only carry somewhat small amount of things, which makes sense from the standpoint that the developers want you to pick and choose a playstyle, but gets frustrating when you just want to pick up a medkit and all of your slots are full. Not too bad, but it does add up over time. Furthermore, there's a bug where sometimes more than one of the same item won't stack, which is especially frustrating for the lockpick multitools, as some doors need a certain amount (so if a door needs four tools, and you have two stacks of two, it won't open), which is incredibly frustrating. The interface of it is also a bit clunky, being clearly designed for a gamepad. It's not offensively bad, but moving an item to be equipped is a bit tedious, as you can't click and drag. Instead, you click the space for the item you want to move, and then click which slot you want it to go to.\n\nThe main flaw of the gameplay is the universal ammo system. Basically there's one type of ammo, and if you run out of it for one gun, you're out of luck for all of your guns. It's frustrating and you run out often, but there are some benefits. It does force you to use stealth in some places and it encourages an efficient style of play (always go for headshots if you can). It also leads to some tense situations (such as you versus 15 armored guys and some robots with little ammo) that force you to think way outside the box and come up with your own solutions to problems, and it was actually during these parts that the game felt the most like Deus Ex 1. Despite these interesting situations, Universal ammo is a pretty ham-handed way of of making these things happen, and the same effects could have been achieved in different ways with better design. For all the neat gameplay scenarios it causes, it also causes a noticeable amount of annoyance (although there's always some way out of your problem).\n\nThe level design is solid (despite levels being really small) and it does encourage you to expore the environment. You still have multiple ways to do things and what you do has a fascinating imact on the story. The real problem with the levels is that they're split up into many separate maps, which means you'll be seeing loading screens a ton. This isn't too bad as today's computers can load things rather quickly, but for some reason the game minimizes to the desktop each time a map loads, and then goes back to normal once everything is up. This is jarring and does take you out of the game abit, so an actual loading screen would have been nice. The levels themseles are densly packed with detail, and there is a great variety to the environments you'll be in. Most levels have a nice kind of back and forth flow, almost reminiscent in some ways of the level design in an oldschool Doom game (in a good way). The game mostly takes place in interiors as opposed to the large outdoors environments of Deus Ex 1, but the levels aren't bad.\n\nOverall, Invisible War falls short in many areas, especially compared to the original Deus Ex, but taken on its own it is a very interesting game that's definitely worth playing. There are a lot of unique ideas, and even though they don't all pan out, it mostly falls on the "good" side of things. Recommended.","June 23, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The gameplay itself is pretty damn fun and comparable to the first game, involving stealth, gunplay, tech equipment, special abilities, etc.\n\nI've beaten both the original Deus Ex and now Invisible War and I must say, besides the changes to streamline certain gameplay aspects, Invisible War is just as high quality as the first. It definitely seemed like a true sequel to me, despite what I've read online. And hell, I'd even say the changes make the game a lot easier to get a handle on, as the first game at times felt a bit overwhelming to deal with. I actually felt a lot more engaged with the biomod system in Invisible War because of the fact that it laid out the details more clearly.\n\nThe main issue with this game is the loading screen issue. Levels are HEAVILY segmented into separate areas that must be loaded individually, and every time you enter a new area, the game minimizes for a few seconds, comes back up and then takes another few seconds to load. This process also occurs every time you load a save, meaning that even hitting quickload (F12) will force you to wait 10 seconds. The original game had instant quick loading, as MOST games do.\n\nIf you are wondering if you should play this after playing the first game, then the answer is yes. Don't let whiny comments about the game being terrible because it was "consolized" fool you. This is a true, high quality sequel to the original Deus Ex.\n","November 20, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Then they looked at the limitations imposed by that console and they made the areas claustrophobically small and mangled the game engine they were using so that the far too frequent load screens take an inordinately long time to load (and bounce you to the desktop while they're doing it just to add to their immersion breaking act). It becomes at some points not unusual to spend 15 seconds traversing an area hitting a loading screen, waiting, spending another 15 seconds moving across the next area, waiting...\n\nSo so far they've mangled the game contents, the interface, the world detail and the engine. Oh yeah and the weird designs of some areas make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Whatever could be left? The story? Surely that's got to be good, after all that's part of what made this series great, right? Well, no. Between the odd character animations (which weirdly make the characters look *less* natural than the first game) and the god awful factions all of whom appear to be filled with entirely awful people who elicit no sympathy whatsoever you are left either having to roll a dice and decide which of the awful factions to join in with or alternatively just running missions for whoever you feel like. None of it really makes a huge difference though as (as per the first) you are offered a nice clear cut choice to get each ending in the end. In terms of the actual storyline, with everyone so unlikable as you learn to hate them all you'll also realise just how thoroughly they have butchered the story of the first game by trying to include all three of the endings from that in the current timeline which is a mistake because it massively reduces the possibilities going forwards, and also completely trivialises the (actually interesting) choice the player had to make at the end of Deus Ex.\n\nIf you enjoyed Deus Ex, don't buy this game. Really. Truly. Just skip it. Read a synopsis or something if you need to know how the story goes.","July 28, 2014","false","35.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is a great underated gem. Did it level up to the hype? No to most. To me, i think it's better than the first. I can hear the fans yelling at me about that.\n\nI will give a basic opening to the story for you: "Deus Ex Invisible War is set 20 years after Deus Ex, and is about the actions of JC Denton in the first game, (using a combination of all three endings from the first game) and how they caused the world to go into a state of war and "economic depression". It is known as THE COLLAPSE. Many factions then became into power, including the WTO and THE ORDER. Chicago gets attacked at the beginning of the game, and that is where you, Alex D, and your friend Billie Adams and others get evacuated to another Tarsus place. That gets attacked too, and you begin by doing side quests and must choose which faction you want to go with.\n\nLet me start with my personal favourite things about this great piece of gaming:\n- The graphics are great. Even by todays standards. It has aged well. (Made in 2004, it looks better than games released today)\n- The characters are fine. Not amazing, but ok.\n- THE BIOMODS! The Biomods are great. They add special abilities to the player for a mild amount of time, such as Cloaking, Increased Walk/jump speed, Increased strength, just to name a  few.\n- The menu's. Something small, but i like them.\n- The  weapons are simple and good, and there is several new weapons.\n- I always love craking something open or taking over something with my trusty Multitools.\n- Many more little tiny things.\n\nNow the bad.\n- The ai is basic, not bad but somewhat mediocre.\n- Some characters are bland, the order asian chick is my prime example.\n- the biomods are somewhat simpler to the first game.\n- Very minor technical hiccups.\n-  THE LOADING TIMES. THEY ARE BAD, THAT IS PROBABLY THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS. THEY ARE NOT INSANE, BUT THEY ARE BAD.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nI freakin' love this game. I look past it's supposed 'SHI*TYNESS'. Back at its release it recieved good reviews, but today everyone hates it. I love it, quite a bit, it's Well worth the price if you like RPG / FPS / Story driven obscure gems.\n\nScarcey Out.","May 25, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/6920/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","As a sequel to the original Deus Ex, Invisible War is weak, being inferior in most aspects. The levels are much smaller, the the levelling system is massively neutered (you can only upgrade augments, as opposed to additional skills) combat is weaker in many ways.\n\nWith that said however, Invisible War is actually a pretty good game when taken on its own merits. First off, the atmosphere is fantastic. Even though the worlds are way smaller than those of Deus Ex 1, Invisible war uses lighting, music, and visuals to great effect, resulting in a moody world that draws you in, despite being so far removed from anything in the real world. The art direction is really fantastic. Furthermore, the storyline is really interesting. It doesn't start out quite as compelling as the original, but it picks up quickly and has loads of great twists. There were lots of memorable characters, as is series tradition, and it's great to see what became of certain characters from the first game (although I didn't care for what they did with JC Denton). Also, the fact that this game essentially provides closure for the Deus Ex Universe makes it very much worth seeing the game through to the ending.\n\nOne really interesting thing this game does that the first game didn't (and I'd even say Invisible War might be slightly better in this regard) is that you can actually choose which faction to work for during each mission. Invisible War carries on the first game's tradition of having your choices make a massive impact on how the story plays out (I've heard that your choice of character gender actually has an effect on some of what side-missions are available, but I haven't done a second playthrough so I'm not sure what extent this alters things to), and being able to choose who you work for brings this to a whole new level, as it lets you experience the story from different perspectives, and what you do at certain points in the game actually does effect which endings are available (as opposed to in the first and third game, where you essentially choose your ending at the last minute). How you interact with characters is key and your relationships with the characters can affect the gameplay in numerous ways. The dialogue plays out more naturally than in the first game (I do miss how all the random NPCs seemingly had PHD's in philosophy in the first game, as it was cheesy, but also really interesting and part of the original's charm) and the story covers some interesting topics. Interestingly, this game goes into a lot of the same pro-augmentation vs anti-augmentation debates that characters in Human Revolution had (this topic was in Deus Ex 1 a bit, but not to the extent of this game and HR), so it does seem to have at least had some influence on future installments of the series. Overall, the storyline is definitely a strong point, and worthy of the Deus Ex name.\n\nNow, about the gameplay. Yes, it isn't nearly as good as Deus Ex 1, but it's still better than many games. Whereas the original was an RPG played through the interface of a first person shooter, this game is more of a first-person shooter with light RPG elements. Overall the guns feel decent (although the pistol is pretty useless), but the melee attacks lack punch. You'll be progressing through a series of cramped, but surprisingly non-linear levels and are given the freedom to choose your objectives based on what faction you like. There are a surprising amount of side missions, and just like in the original game, you can opt to do a pacifist run. Your augmentations can let you do some crazy, almost game-breaking stuff (Bot Domination is particularly awesome. It lets you take control of enemy robots, and getting the jump on an enemy patrol who was hanging out with enemy robots is both awesome and hilarious), which can lead to some fun situations. Something that's interesting about how this game handles augments is that you can actually replace your augments with a different ones if you find yourself in a desperate situation where an augment you didn't choose would be helpful. This is a last-ditch strategy though, as the new augment starts out un-upgraded, so you'll usually have to carefully weigh your options. Unfortunately, the weight of this decision is lessened a great deal by the sheer abundance of upgrade cannisters in the game. By the time you finish, you'll probably have at least 10 or so extra cannisters laying around, meaning that if you swap augs for a situation, you can often easily swap back to what you had before and re-upgrade it to the maximum level. Swapping is still an interesting and useful mechanic, even though the abundance of upgrades hurts the design.\n\nThe inventory system is a bit awkward. You can only carry somewhat small amount of things, which makes sense from the standpoint that the developers want you to pick and choose a playstyle, but gets frustrating when you just want to pick up a medkit and all of your slots are full. Not too bad, but it does add up over time. Furthermore, there's a bug where sometimes more than one of the same item won't stack, which is especially frustrating for the lockpick multitools, as some doors need a certain amount (so if a door needs four tools, and you have two stacks of two, it won't open), which is incredibly frustrating. The interface of it is also a bit clunky, being clearly designed for a gamepad. It's not offensively bad, but moving an item to be equipped is a bit tedious, as you can't click and drag. Instead, you click the space for the item you want to move, and then click which slot you want it to go to.\n\nThe main flaw of the gameplay is the universal ammo system. Basically there's one type of ammo, and if you run out of it for one gun, you're out of luck for all of your guns. It's frustrating and you run out often, but there are some benefits. It does force you to use stealth in some places and it encourages an efficient style of play (always go for headshots if you can). It also leads to some tense situations (such as you versus 15 armored guys and some robots with little ammo) that force you to think way outside the box and come up with your own solutions to problems, and it was actually during these parts that the game felt the most like Deus Ex 1. Despite these interesting situations, Universal ammo is a pretty ham-handed way of of making these things happen, and the same effects could have been achieved in different ways with better design. For all the neat gameplay scenarios it causes, it also causes a noticeable amount of annoyance (although there's always some way out of your problem).\n\nThe level design is solid (despite levels being really small) and it does encourage you to expore the environment. You still have multiple ways to do things and what you do has a fascinating imact on the story. The real problem with the levels is that they're split up into many separate maps, which means you'll be seeing loading screens a ton. This isn't too bad as today's computers can load things rather quickly, but for some reason the game minimizes to the desktop each time a map loads, and then goes back to normal once everything is up. This is jarring and does take you out of the game abit, so an actual loading screen would have been nice. The levels themseles are densly packed with detail, and there is a great variety to the environments you'll be in. Most levels have a nice kind of back and forth flow, almost reminiscent in some ways of the level design in an oldschool Doom game (in a good way). The game mostly takes place in interiors as opposed to the large outdoors environments of Deus Ex 1, but the levels aren't bad.\n\nOverall, Invisible War falls short in many areas, especially compared to the original Deus Ex, but taken on its own it is a very interesting game that's definitely worth playing. There are a lot of unique ideas, and even though they don't all pan out, it mostly falls on the "good" side of things.

This is no exception to that.\n\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, I'm going to do something a little different than what other reviewers do and repeat what I did with the Duke Nukem Forever review. Instead of pointing out the postivies and negatives, I'm going to say that my opinion is more valid than yours and that most of the negatives I see are either non existent or actually positives.\n\n1. The combat is clunky.\nI don't understand this complaint. I played it on the XBox and it was terrible on that system, yeah. But on the PC? It really isn't that terrible and it's more than managable. I think maybe the reason for this is people were playing this like they played the original Deus Ex. In the first game when you first started you sucked with every single ranged weapon ever and had to aim your gun for like 30 minutes before you could actually hit somebody. What I assume is happening is people are doing that in this game, and you really don't need to do that because you actually know how to use a firearm. I'd actually go as far as saying that makes the combat in this game better than in the first game. For some reason, in Deus Ex a highly trained cybernetic special forces operative has no idea how to use a basic handgun.\n\n2. It was dumbed down for consoles.\nWell, yes and no. First off, the original Deus Ex engine was basically a bunch of PVC pipes and calculators glued together. It was very simple and didn't eat up a lot of hardware so you could put a crapload of ♥♥♥♥ in the game and not worry about running out of space on the install disk along with not worrying about overworking the system memory. This game uses a (for the time) modern next gen engine with (for the time) amazing graphics and effects and stuff, not to mention a (for the time) decent physics engine as well. The short length and small size of levels allowed this to be put on XBox, yeah, but it also made it so we wouldn't have to use like 20 discs on PC. Sure, it would have been cool for the game to be the size of the original and use 20 discs, but come on.\n\n3. The story is dumb.\nI agree to some extent. The game is short, and since it's a Deus Ex game there's a plot twist like every 10 minutes so I can't really say much without spoiling like 35% of the story. Basically, at one point in the game you get two huge plot twists at the same exact time, and both of them got completely different reactions from me. The first one I saw coming from a mile away and was so obvious I could have sworn was already mentioned like two hours earlier or something. The second one I didn't see coming from a mile away but felt like a total idiot because I didn't in that it was completely logical. Sudden plot twists, especially of this caliber, are rarely done in such a way that it seems like the perfect conclusion to every single event that preceded. While elements of the story are really, REALLY stupid, for the most part it's very well written and worth your time.\n\n4. Too many RPG elements were removed/Character progression is gimped too much.\nI disagree here in that I like to play both of these games when I have completely different mindsets. If I want to play System Shock 1 or 2 but without horror elements I'll play the original Deus Ex, and if I want to play Bioshock 1 or 2 without the horror elements I'll play this. In my opinion, just because a sequel is different, doesn't mean it's bad.\n\n5. There's no multiplayer.\nYes. This is a complaint I've seen people actually make. The original Deus Ex actually had deathmatch multiplayer for some really stupid reason that nobody but total nerds actually played. My guess is this was just one more feature they could complain about being removed from the game so they'd have another bullet to put in IW's skull.\n\nOverall, I give this game 8 out of 10, Deus Ex 9 out of 10 and Deus Ex: HR 8.5 out of 10.","April 6","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have ruled that out).\n\nI'll still review this game though because I have played it previously on my former graphics card. This sequel, despite not being as ginourmous as the first game in the series, it is still definitely a fantastic game on its own and a game not to pass.  Many people criticized this game for not being able to reach the same level as the first but, to me, this game is just different. Not necessarily worse. It's definitely not as big though. Don't expect the same epic adventure as you had in Deus Ex 1. But don't miss this game! This game is still one of the few games I hold closely to my heart lol ;)\n\nIt's just too bad though that it doesn't work on my current nVidia graphics card (at least that's what I think is preventing the game to launch properly). And it's got nothing to do with this being a Steam version. I have also tried the GOG version and it also doesn't work. And I didn't use to have this issue on my older ATI card so the only conclusion I can reach is that my fantastic (not being sarcastic here) new nVidia card actually is not compatible with this game, unfortunately. I wish there would be some patch to solve this.\n\n\nSo, I would obviously recommend this game but if you're reading this, be prepared for possible incompatibility issues on your new card, especially if it's an nVidia. Mine is the GTX 750 Ti (it's an awesome card). But still, this game is so cheap right now that it's worth the risk. Or you can buy it on sales.","February 19, 2015","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are looking for a clone of the first one than don't look here.\n\nPros: You can kill everyone if you want. Decent graphics for when it was made, especially for consoles.  Fun, yet confusing story that gives you many side quests and a good bit of moral and faction based choices. Many ways to complete a quest: stealth, run and gun, or let the machines do your work for you.  Good choice of weapons along with secret variant weapons that only the dilligent will find. Also has aome pretty cool weapon modifications you can add to your weapons. Decent physics.  The biomod system is fun and has you getting excited everytime you find a biomod canister.  There are also 4 different endings that you can receive depending on how you handle the last mission.\n\nCons:  Allthough the story is fun, it IS confusing.  The universal weapon ammo system sucks balls; so even though you are guaranteed ammo for every gun you have, you still have to ration ammo because some guns use more than others (I myself found myself out of ammo more than once and had to rely on my biomods to get me out of a jam).  Some might say that the religious stereotypes in the Templar and Order factions could be a con (I myself could care less but Im putting it here because someone else might).\n\nI myself thouroughly enjoyed this game even though it did not live up to the expectations of the first.  A great buy for those who want a fun gaming experiance.","November 28, 2014","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I barely left the academy (first level) before I decided to not play this game again. As subjective as my opinion is, I cannot see any way of recommending people to put money into it; and I would be reluctant to even say 'go for it' if it was a free game out of fear I will create personal vendettas against me by wasting time.\n\nFrom the intro alone it has no Deus Ex feeling at all in my opinion; it looks less like a dystopian cyberpunk and more like a bad sci-fi that has none of the charm of the original Deus Ex, if you're pondering on trying the game because it has the name in the title, I recommend looking up the intro on youtube and ask yourself if it's still what you're hoping for.\n\nThe second thing I noticed was how utterly difficult it was for me to even get the game to run at all because of the outdated engine that is damn near incompatiable with anything that has multi-cores (which is to say every modern computer) that made it a pain requiring me to down a few hours in searching for a fix online in various forums; which is already a major nono for anything that gets put on steam, if it's on a platform like Steam asking for money to play it, it should at the very least work by default.\nIf anyone is interested, I'll leave the link that finally made the game run for everyone's convenience: http://yoni0505.blogspot.se/2012/08/deus-ex-invisible-war-windows-7-fix.html\n\nWith the game finally running and having recently finished the original Deus Ex (Revision), I was eager to try the game for myself and see the continuation of the previous game and what effects the events of it would have on the world of the sequel. I knew it was widely hated, but somehow the arguments never quite ran. Small levels and clunky UI sounded like something you could overcome if you were interested in the story, and I really wanted to explore Chicago and Seattle of the future.\nSo the first thing I do is to set the keymapping to be more akin to the original Deus Ex's controls as much as possible for my own comfort and fixing the mouse sensitivity to be lower. Then I start the game.\n\nFirst I get that intro cutscene and realize that exploring Chicago is not really on the agenda here. Maybe I should've read into it more, but I guess it just gets destroyed in the cutscene and welcome to Seattle. Okay, fair enough I think.\nThen there is Seattle where I try to immerse myself and get comfortable with the controls before I get earthquakes shoved in my face; no time to rest there. When I get into my first conversation I experience a rarity for me: graphics cringe. I'm not one to typically care about graphics; I like the old styles such as the original ones over things like Crysis even, but ♥♥♥♥ me they couldn't have made a poorer job with these. This is without mentioning how lackluster and horribly paced the conversations are.\n\nGo to a let's play and check just the first conversation with Billie to determine it for yourself. If it becomes unbearable, save your money to something more productive. Maybe there's a hobo nearby who could use a cup of coffee for the dollar or whatever that Steam wants for the game.\n\nAnyway the next thing I notice is that the criticisms of small levels well, the fans were not exaggerating; imagine UNATCO HQ in the original game from the moment you step into the upper level where Manderley and your office etc is. Know how there is a lower level too? In IW, that lower level would be behind a loading screen; and the upper level doesn't contain the eye scanner or anything of the sort either. That should give an idea of how small the maps are, and I'm even unsure if that's an exaggeration.\n\nWhat kills it for me though is how a game riddled more loading screens than ♥♥♥♥♥ in an elephant's ♥♥♥ seem to have an unhealthy obsession with resetting everything upon a new loading screen; it's like the game restarts itself before the loading screen itself appears, and when it's done loading all the key mappings are reset and all the items- including weapons -are gone. This world of item-vaporizing elevators/doorways becomes especially bothersome if you wanna cap some heads, because good luck getting anything done in terms of combat if you don't have any weapons on you; and weapons aren't in a habit of just laying around everywhere either.\nAt the final bit of the Seattle Tarsus Academy I just gave up and casually ran past everyone in full view, not even caring about getting shot twice or thrice (which took less than half my hp) and just kept going to see if I could at least get value out of seeing Upper Seattle. Some story blocks along the way I didn't care about later and I realized.. Pretty much no.\n\nThe environment is stale and uninspired and conversations don't get anymore interesting from the three or so places in the level that had people. You get more character interaction and personality from a Choice of Games than what I got in Upper Seattle. And that's where I finally lost my last interest and justification for having spent any money on this even at a sale. The only thing I got from that money spent is buyer's remorse; but hey, at least the buyer's remorse is consistent unlike the ♥♥♥♥ing keymapping in IW.\n\n=TL;DR=\nI only played so much, but if you are interested in seeing this game then I would say don't waste your money on it; look up a let's play of someone else who wasted money on it instead and save yourself the effort. If it still looks appealing after an episode or two of said let's play; only then should it ever be considered.\n\n*Poor environments.\n*Poor voice acting and conversation pacing.\n*Poor graphics and character models.\n*No cyberpunk or Deus Ex feeling.\n*Difficult to run on a modern system and requires a lot of system ♥♥♥♥ery to at all get started.\n\nThat's my experience after less than an hour with no real expectation going for it coming in; I should've listened.","May 1","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quickmanx2/recommended/6920/","quickmanx2","/FSnC\ Forte ∅","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quickmanx2/","74 products in account","I spent a long time not believing that this game could be that bad. I'd read countless reviews of how this game was a disappointment, tried to familiarize myself with its flaws without spoiling the story for myself, and made my decision: I would buy it when it went on crazy sale. $1.40 was sale enough for me. I don't regret the purchase, but I don't recommend the game, and the reasons are manifold.\n\nFirst, ignore any review that says "if this game weren't a Deus Ex game, it would be regarded better". No. Even ignoring the Deus Ex aspects, what you're left with is a ♥♥♥♥ poor shooter with a trashy story, ♥♥♥-ugly character models, glitchy gameplay, and poor mechanics choices.\n\nThis game is both figuratively and literally a narrow hallway. Half of the time, you're dropped into an area that has little to no hiding spaces and relatively few alternate paths. What few areas do have alternate paths to your objective are circular and do a poor job of telegraphing that you're going backwards. The area maps are practically microscopic, and you're hard pressed to go even three minutes of normal gameplay without having to load up a new area. This makes exploring a chore, so after the first hour of gameplay I gave up and decided I would just plow through the story and get it over with. Also, just by the way, there's a glitch where the game crashes to the desktop or hangs on a black screen during every loading screen, and upon reaching the final area, it has crashed for me five times with no possible fix in sight. Just a heads up if you really want to try to see this through.\n\nSo, let's talk about the story. Where Deus Ex was a political commentary through the eyes of a conspiracy theorist, Deus Ex: Invisible War is a sociopolitical commentary through the eyes of a gender studies major, and if I let my inner conspiracy theorist come forward, I might just have to say that this is one of the first games ruined by the thoughtless inclusion of female main characters for the sake of having more "gender diversity". Default avatar gender? Female. The Order? Female dominated. WTO? Majority female.\n\nBorderline genocidal maniacs/nazi looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ templars? Male leader, almost completely male dominated organization.  All of that aside:\n\nYou're cast into the world of Deus Ex: Invisible War by being treated to an uncanny valley cutscene the likes of which only 2003 CGI can produce. A faceless terrorist unleashes grey goo on Chicago and later you're told it was fire. That's all well and good though, because Chicago isn't important, you're in Seattle, in what is essentially a high school anime gone wrong. With no warning or buildup, the Tarsus academy is under attack by "the Order", a group of religious zealots who think jihad is the way to go. You can follow orders from these maniacs later, while their second in command tries to convince you that they are indeed a religion of peace by explicitly asking you to murder their targets. Conversely, you can do the bidding of the World Trade Organization, who sits comfortably at the other end of the spectrum at what seems to be Lawful Neutral at worst. Following orders from them doesn't always feel right, but it doesn't make you feel like a sociopath.\n\nIt takes hours of gameplay to be drawn in even the smallest bit, and the writing never really recovers. Even the endings feel halfassed, though if you stew on them for long enough, they're just thought provoking enough to be worthy of discussion if you're bored.\n\nOverall, this game is bad. Not because it's an unworthy successor to much better game, but because it barely stands up as a game. It is nothing more than a seven hour long walking simulator with guns added here and there for flavor.","February 25","false","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A steam sale will likely allow you to grab it even cheaper, and it's certainly worth a play.\n\nWhat's OK or good - story, robot enemy design, voice acting, genuinely different ways to do most things, the game rewards you for exploring, nice weapon sounds, good stealth sections, the odd genuinely amusing line (my favorite was the NG AI's reply to what she's gonna go about her manager), setting Templar bigots on fire from distance with the Hellfire Boltcaster. The game is pretty much worth it just for that last one.\n\nWhat's bad or terrible - It's a whole lot less fun than Human Revolution, the levels need to re-load very often due to the whole "aimed at consoles" thing, making the level management feel older than the smooth transitions of Half-Life, you can't sell things to traders, and there's not really a whole lot worth buying either, you need to have several saves because of the high chance of your latest one going kaput and refusing to load.

The Maps are so small you can cross them in 20 seconds,  and the map design, even in one level varies heavly between nice and uninspired. E.g. in the Deus Ex there was a level where you had to crawl through the vents of an airfield. Then it was totally cool, the version in DX:IW is a pitiful reminisence at best. There are quite some references like this and they all are heavy handedly integrated. The inventory handling is very clunky, combat is boring and undemanding and gets totally destroyed once you get the Mag Rail Gun. The Story may feature some ethical aspects but none of your decisions matters, ever. On top of it, each of the 4 ending sucks. Even more than the totally borked AI and ultra stiff character animation.\n\nThe only good thing about this game is that the devs took care that you can go through it mostly stealthy and none-violent and there are often more intelligent ways to solve a problem than shooting. Exploring is very limit and just sufficient enough to make the stealth manouvers work. But this is not enough to waste you time with this game.

The tubing would allow air for victims buried under the mistaken impression they were dead. In a certain small town Harold, the local gravedigger, upon hearing a bell one night, went to go see if it was children pretending to be spirits. Sometimes it was also the wind. This time, it wasn't either. A voice from below begged and pleaded to be unburied.\n\n"Are you Sarah O'Bannon?" Harold asked.\n\n"Yes!" The muffled voice asserted.\n\n"You were born on September 17, 1827?"\n\n"Yes!"\n\n"The gravestone here says you died on February 20, 1857."\n\n"No, I'm alive, it was a mistake! Dig me up, set me free!"\n\n"Sorry about this, ma'am," Harold said, stepping on the bell to silence it and plugging up the copper tube with dirt. "But this is August.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/6920/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","Deus Ex 2: Invisible War was Ion Storm Austin's first console game and a game that would later be described as having a "troubled development" by its creators. Many fans of the original game were quick to slam this game on release for being a "dumbed down" mess built for the console gamers.\n\nLike its predecessor, Deus Ex 2 is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing Game with stealth elements. Set twenty years after the events of Deus Ex, you play the role of Alex D, a student at Tarsus Academy. After being rescued from a terrorist attack that destroyed the entire city of Chicago, you are woken in your room by an assault on the Tarsus Academy facility in which you live. From there, the plot thickens as you are thrown into a world of corporate, government and ancient global conspiracies.\n\nWriting a sequel for Deus Ex would always be a difficult task because the first Deus Ex has multiple endings depending on how the player wanted to complete the game. All the endings were radically different and so, for Deus Ex 2, they chose to set the game around a mixture of two of Deus Ex's endings, which might not make logical sense given the nature of those two particular endings which I won't spoil here.\n\nJust like the previous Deus Ex, from start to finish, you have multiple ways to deal with any given situation and depending on what you do, the game will adapt accordingly. People will react to how you behave and can affect the course of the game and the only way you can Game Over is if you die.\n\nThe game even offers a bit more flexibility with regards to factions over the previous game. Deus Ex had a few moments where some characters, even though they might have been killable later in the story, would be essentially invincible until their moment of demise arrives. Some might argue that this was necessary to keep the plot going but in Deus Ex 2, everyone is killable as soon as you meet them and the game can adapt with no problems. This is one of the moments in which Deus Ex 2 has an advantage over its predecessor, albeit a very small one.\n\nThe story is also very good. It is not as paranoid or as quirky as the first Deus Ex and in some places, especially at the beginning, it feels slightly rushed and not enough things feel very well explained. All becomes clear in time however and putting the pieces together is just as good as it ever was.\n\nThe game also has a very sci-fi feel to it. The art and sound design, devices you use and the omnipresent blue lighting all make the game feel as if its set further into the future than it probably intended to feel.\n\nBeing made for the Xbox as well as PC, Deus Ex 2 has a few differences in terms of its inventory and its level design. Gone is the intricate inventory management of the first game. Instead, it was been replaced with six simple slots. Each slot can store one object or a group of objects stacked which means that three packets of Soy food take up exactly the same amount of space in your inventory as a Rocket Launcher. Some items such as energy cells and multi-tools also have a problem stacking correctly and there is no way to stack them manually.\n\nThe level design also has undergone a huge change. Whilst the levels in the first Deus Ex were large but void of much detail, the levels in Deus Ex 2, whilst having dynamic lighting and were nicely detailed for a 2003 game, are extremely small in size. The modified Unreal engine they used for the game is butchered beyond belief. You will find yourself bumping into loading zones around every fifth corner. This probably has something to do with the game designed for the Xbox and its measly 64MB of RAM.\n\nThe skill system that was present in the first game has been completely removed and the augmentation system has been replaced with a more streamlined system where you can choose one of three potential upgrades for specific areas of the body. You can upgrade the ability three times or, if you no longer want that particular ability, replace it with another of your choosing, though you'll have to find the Biomod canisters to start and advance your newly chosen skill.\n\nAnd then there's the Universal Ammo system which is, depending in your point of view, the worst or an interesting aspect of the game. All the guns in the game use the same kind of ammunition simply known as Universal Ammo. Different guns use up a different amount of universal ammo per shot so, for example, the pistol will use a small amount of universal ammo whereas the sniper rifle will use up a bigger amount. Weapons can be modified to use less ammo, destroy glass without setting off alarms attached to them and more.\n\nFor all its small faults and bugs, Deus Ex 2 is a well made game and is head and shoulders above what was on store shelves around the time of its release. It's not a bad game and as long as you go into it not expecting it to be exactly like the first Deus Ex, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.","March 6, 2014","true","22.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Where to begin.\n\nThe AI is less intelligent than a wifi toaster. Sometimes it feels like they are inanimate objects. Your inventory is so limited, and in an obscure way (6+6 item slots no matter the size of the item, some stack, still annoying). Conversations are b-movie-esque, however there are some hidden gems in there.\n\nI thought the graphics were pretty good when I was a kid, probably the first dynamic shadows I remember seeing, but they weren't used to their potential at the time... and the low polycount on just about everything is kind if weird considering the sizes of the individual levels.\n\nAlmost forgot the worst part of all, loading in this game is still slow mega years after release, and it still alt-tabs and switches resolution between gameplay and loading screen. Pretty sure this issue isn't just me, or maybe I'm crazy for thinking it happened the first time I played it too.\n\nThere's some good story value, and some story branching (very little of consequence), and generally doesn't feel relative to the original other than the namethrowing. Not recomended unless you've played the first enough times to be the daedalus of its every pixel.","April 28, 2014","false","37.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I love oldschool games, but not first person games using this type of engine. It is just ugly, stiff, and clunky. This game reminds me of other stiff games like Shogo and Blood 2. It was also made back in the time of no direction markers so to find where you are going you walk around until you find it, following only notes in your journal. It is a good game worth buying for a nostalgia trip, but like I said it has a stiff clunky engine compared to games like Quake 3 which even came out 5 years earlier. I am not recommending this only because there is no reason to bother with it when Human Revolution Director's Cut is out and on sale like right now for $5.","February 3, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Doesn't add to the plot at all either, as the other games were set before this one.\nLet's start with the Protagonist (I can't say "Player character" because there is absolutely no trace of character to be found in Alex D.) Nothing but a dull monotone voice and a refusal to commit to anything. "I'll think about it" is a catchphrase which Alex often repeats, but sadly this thought never leads to any resolution. Alex never truly expresses an opinion about anything, or takes a stand for any of the rival factions on offer.\nAfter the numbness of the main lead. the bland voice acting is another point where nobody seems willing to stand out. It's like a scene out of Equilibrium where everybody is terrified of showing some emotion, even when trying to convert you to a religion.\nThe many factions set against each other are equally apathetic. If you decide to gun their agents down for no reason and steal their stuff, or even to trash an entire building of theirs, they'll forgive you if you run a small fetch quest for them, and if you decide to slaughter them all again, they won't hold a grudge.\nAll of this combines to stifle any RPG aspects of the game. There's no role to play, and even if there were, there are no real choices by which to express that role.\nThe anti-rpg agenda is continued by the removal of skill points and even ammo types. Your crossbow takes exactly the same ammo as your rocket launcher, which results in tactical choices being minimised.\nIf all of this isn't bad enough to put you off, all the maps are ridiculously tiny, and yet still take over 90 seconds to load. In a fetch quest within one building you will literally spend more time on loading screens than in the actual game. IF it ever actually loads, and doesn't Crash to Desktop.","September 22, 2013","false","2.2"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","0"

Then I played Deus Ex 1 and my opinion of Invisible War changed for the worse.  Invisible War offers good game play, a good story, some interesting choice mechanics, and smart writing.  But all of this is not as good as what the first Deus Ex, or many other games for that matter.  The game play often times feels streamlined to the point of being dumbed down.  The way choices are presented to the player feels more overt and clunky than Dues Ex.  While the writing is smarter than many other games, the dialouge too often takes the form of exposition dump or feels out of place.  Deus Ex had a similar problem with out of place philosophic dialogue, but Invisible War did it worse.\n\nIf steam offered a mixed choice instead just yes or no in terms of recommendations, I would choose that.  Given the binary nature of recommendations, I have to choose yes.   DE Invisible War is by no means a bad game and is actually very enjoyable.  Due to some unfortunate design choices it is not as good as it could have been.","December 1, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason was obviously the console port , that brought many problems : Loading times everywhere , very small maps and ultra simplified gameplay . Now it's more like an average FPS than an infiltration game . It is in fact nearly impossible to infiltrate , for that the maps are way too small , and moreover that you even make noise while crouching (except if you take an appropriate biomod) . You got only five augmentations slots , each containing 3 different biomods available . On each , one of them is an "Illegal" biomod , requiring specific and rare canister . Hack is one of them . A great choice if you don't like to wander in a level in search for a damn notebook , but it means you won't have the cloack . Also , the game is pretty short . I managed to finish it in 6 hours (while taking 20 for DX and 33 for HR) . Got to admit I didn't accomplished much secondary missions , because I found them somehow less interesting . And the begining is somehow less attractive . You gotta advance in the game before some worthy moments comes . That was for the flaw .\n\nIf however you loved the DX plot , this brings an end to it . It's heavily linked to the first episode . You will meet several characters of the first , sometimes completely unexpected to see . There are 4 endings , but let's be honest , only one is both good AND logical . Everything is related to the choices you will make . In fact , there are many clans for who you can work . You can choose to complete the objective of one , which will counter the plans of another . Or you can be a total ♥♥♥ and just betray everyone . Those clans each have their own points of view and theorically , there is no pure good and pure evil . And yet ... If you liked the first episode's characters , you will feel forced to join one in particular .  I won't spoil though . And I have to say that Alex is all in all an interesting character , even if he lacks of trench coat and sunglasses .\n\nSo , to resume , this is worth playing if you want to know the ending of the plot of DX (the obvious and best one , as I said ) . If you're only taking it for the gameplay though , prepare to be deceived . I would say : Only for the most faithfull to the Deus Ex series .","October 3, 2013","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Invisible War is a decent game I must stress this, but decent is simply not good enough if you are the direct followup to what many considered, even at the time, one of the greatest video games ever made. Invisible War has a distinction of taking away far too many of the original game's features and depth and offering very little in return aside from prettier graphics and the option to play as a female.\n\nFor starters, this is a port of a console game, while the original Deus Ex was custom built exclusively for the PC platform. This alone is a terrible thing, as the game is inherrently bound to the original Xbox's limitations, and these limitations negatively impact nearly every facet of the game. No environment is even half as big as the first level of the original, load times tend to take more screen time than gameplay, and your key binding options are much more limited. There are even actions that cannot be rebound to a different key!\n\nSecond of all, ammo across all weapons is universal, the health system is a standard percentage based system rather than one based of areas of the body inflicted (while Human Revolution also does this, that game allows such a system to be upgraded, thus adding depth), and you CANNOT MANUALLY RELOAD YOUR WEAPON. It stupefies gameplay to such a degree that it insults both console players new to this game as well as existing fans. It's the fisher-price version of Deus Ex, and it stars a protagonist that looks like a long-lost Backstreet Boy. There's a reason why it took so long between this and Human Revolution; the new devs had to figure out a proper way to un♥♥♥♥ this franchise.\n\nOther than all that ♥♥♥♥ I just said, it's not a broken game. It can be played and enjoyed, especially as a stealth or action game, but do know ahead of time that this is not the proper Deus Ex experience. Choices matter much less, and at times you simply HAVE to kill someone or HAVE to hack this thing. Player flexibility is discarded when seen useful, and that goes against the design philosophy of both the original and the excellent Human Revolution. Only play this as a history lesson on why this is one of the most disappointing sequels ever made.","December 27, 2014","false","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to disagree with most of the negative feelings toward this title, because a "bad" connotation or "worst in the series" designation to a Deus Ex game still makes for a really great experience. Why? The vastly improved physics certainly don't hurt. That's fun in its own right. Most of the worst reviews I've ever seen lobbed at this sequel come from long-time fans of the original game, and if I had to choose my own least favorite difference between the two, honestly, it is the loss of the corner-leaning function that felt so good in the first; but to me, that is one of the few reductions where many other gameplay elements are definitely improved upon and streamlined. I know that can be a bad word in gaming. Streamlined can easily mean less. Here, it applies.\n\nOne of the most common critiques I've heard, from professional critics and caring fans alike, has to do with Invisible War's level design. This seems hollow, I think, given the way this refers almost exclusively to size and wide-open feeling areas. In fact, the generally smaller levels of this sequel are far more efficient in their use of space -- something that seems to help it run better, actually, apart from some crashing which might be rooted in the series' early, unlucky business choices over bad drivers/graphics support for their engine -- you will quickly find so many tasks to complete that your head will be spinning, each with multiple choices, outcomes, and courses to get there. If you play many angles and think on your feet, trying to outwit what only ~seem~ like restraints on the surface, you will not only feel like an absolute bada$$ very early in the game, but be gratified at what you can do with some good creative planning. This is very much in keeping with the spirit of the Deus Ex name, the first mission areas alone having as many or more different paths to victory as any level in the original (if you only look hard enough), with all the cleverness and depth of story and world as every competent fan has come to expect. It doesn't always look or sound pretty, but in plenty of moments remains reasonably passable. Indeed, the beauty of this one, a learning experience in terms of its basic design aspects, are the ways in which your decisions invariably tie together in an emergent fashion. The greatest showcase of its true depth is probably best explained by pointing out how no two walkthroughs for it seem to contain all of the same information, each being subtly different and personal with an active community of explorers necessary to continually discover new things. You might find something new and unexpected, too. I feel like I do each time I play Invisible War, no different than the original, no less than any other standard of the series.\n\nHeck, to provide one non-spoiling testimony, even the most obscure details such as the names of coffee chains they included as a side-plot/metaphorical example to hint at the greater whole of this mystery, are remarkably witty little nods to our every day real life... though they seem almost laughably dumb if you don't know, I realize, that's exactly the point -- the whole story highlights how ignorance can be taken advantage of and manipulated from above, after all... Pequod and Queequeg were two principle characters in Melville's "MobyDick," and the name of the ship's first mate in that old, famous story just happened to be "Starbuck." See the connection? Did you ever realize? It takes digging, sometimes. This game, like the whole series, is overflowing with little details of that sort, the creators working well with whatever they had at hand, and is no less rooted in literature, history, or the greatest schools of philosophical thought than its counterparts. If you are an avid reader, especially of classics, this will be a fun game for you -- as would any Deus Ex game. It is a title that means your brain will be taxed, you'll go to bed either dreaming about your experiences or lying restlessly awake over its implications, and left saying, "wow," at every new twist. Yes, this one seems smaller, and yes, this might be the easiest of the series if you already have a grasp of how to play from the first, but there is a ton of detail within this title which can turn out to be just as rewarding as any other to carry that glorious logo. It's great. For my own part, today, feeling like a kid again, Invisible War was as equally amazing in its own day as the original had been, before.","May 21, 2014","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only is the game - by far - not finished, it's almost completely broken. I mean, practically everything that made the first Deus Ex good has disappeared.\n\nThe large open levels from the first game were replaced with small, closed levels. A walk from one level-change door to the next takes less than a minute on all levels in the whole game! The only thing that prolongs them are conversations and enemies, of which you can either skip or run past. While load times has been reduced due to the advancement of computers overall, they were a real pain when DXIW was first released.\n\nThe story, and/or the world, has been transformed from the cyberpunk future of the previous game to some kind of anachronistic sci-fi future. Explanations are almost nonexistant. For instance, in 20 years since the Collapse (i.e. the end of the previous game), somehow, a weapons manufacturer managed to completely take over the global market AND develop universal ammo for all those weapons. Yet, airports do not exist or have been transformed to garbage dumps, people have stopped driving cars (or bicycles, or any other vehicle except helicopters). How was this possible?\n\nThe story isn't all that bad, but the smallness of the game makes it too big. There simply isn't room enough for exploration or any meaningful sidequests. The choices you make are also pointless, since loyalty is changed back and forth at the slightest wrongdoing, and, as another reviewer said, the missions you get are practically all "kill this person or let it live".\n\nThe character you play, as well as the game's NPCs, are almost all irritating fools. The voice acting is ridiculous, and the only two characters I liked were JC Denton and Luminon Saman, them also being the only two characters in the game who have anything interesting to say. The player, Alex D., have been made into an idiot, because it seems that he/she accepts anything another character tells him/her. Now, I know this was due to saving space to crunsh it inside an old X-Box console, but at least let the player read a datacube (which can store documents and so on). Parallell this with JC Denton's skepticism in the first game.\n\nGame mechanics are almost completely broken. Characters have to spin their whole body to face you straight on when they talk - even in a conversation between three people, and for EVERY new sentence. Something seems to be wrong with their eyes, because many NPCs look like they're on drugs. Combat is the only way forward. Want to sneak past an enemy or stun him in the back, like the previous game? Forget it. Get the "silent running" biomod if you want any sneaking, otherwise they will hear you miles away. Besides, where are you going to sneak about? The levels are too small for any kind of "Thiefing" around. Civilians become enemies without you ever touching them, even though they don't attack, but still. Why wasn't this refined for final release?\n\nSkill points are gone, and so are the choices of augmentations. Now there are biomods, and they are everywhere. You can also swap biomods at any point in the game, so it's not like your choice really matters. Besides, about halfway through the game, you have to use rocket launchers, sniper rifles or energy weapons to get anywhere, or you won't stand a chance against the enemy.\n\nMiss the techo-esque music from the first game? Too bad, it's now replaced with ambience. Some band, represented by NG Resonanse, also made it to the game, but they failed after like five songs (I think they were called "Three Faced" or some such). Now, I have no quarrel with ambience, or especially ambient game music (just listen to Fallout 1 & 2 soundtracks, for instance, or Mass Effect soundtracks). But imagine The Elder Scrolls soundtrack being replaced with, say, Viking rock or death metal, playing constantly? Not very moody.\n\nSo, is it all that bad? Well, the game is certainly playable. The graphics are pretty neat, but that can't be a "positive" aspect of the game, because games do evolve. New engines are developed. It comes "naturally" if you will. It's just like aging, it happens, people grow up, get jobs, whatever. Of course it will have better graphics. The funny thing is, would it be better if they had reused the Unreal 1 graphical engine? I think yes. It would certainly fit more content. It would be "ugly", but hey, Wasteland 1 is "ugly". Fallout 1 & 2 are "ugly". System Shock 2, the Thief series. That doesn't mean they are bad games.\n\nIn any case, get Deus Ex: Human Revolution instead. While it is a prequel, it is a good one in my opinion. Is Invisible War the worst game ever created? Of course not. But it certainly is not anything like the first game, or even close to the prequel.\n\nOh, wait, there is one good thing about this game - how to not make a sequel. Game developers should definitely try this game then, after playing the first one. The sad thing is that if they had just waited for a couple more years, just until X-Box 360, this game could probably have been better.\n\nSo; not recommended.","April 6, 2014","false","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Given how underwhelmed I was by the original my expectations of this game were very low. There are some improvements such as the simplification of the biomods and skills system and the way you have conflicting goals right from the start. And there are some changes for the worse such as the removal of the nice inventory system and the universal ammo system which results in you running out of ammo for all your weapons at once and being reduced to throwing random objects at your enemies. In balance it seems no worse than the original to me it still had a plot that failed to interest me; confusing level designs with a poor mapping system which leave you wandering round in circles and the occasional fun section hidden amongst the tedium and frustration. I think overall there were more fun sections in this than the original but I still have no intention of ever playing through this game again.","October 25, 2012","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Compared to the original game which actually seems to handle anything I threw at it fine (played the game in a window and used a tool to make it borderless) this game flat out refuses to cooperate.\n\nMax resolution available to me is 1280x1024, you can force change this in the ini but the game automatically re-writes settings when it reloads (which is often, more later) so I had to forcibly deny access via Windows security settings.\n\nWindowed mode is also an option via .ini edit however do not expect borderless, the game flips out and the window simply becomes invisible if you attempt to modify anything about the size of the window while it is open, whether that be borderless using a tool or maximizing it in task manager to get rid of the ugly gap beneath the window.\n\nThe game also reloads often, loading in any area seems to do this as do some cutscenes, and believe me this is often. As a result of the console release presumably and the limited hardware of said consoles at the time the actual areas loaded in at once are horrifically small (Funnily enough, a criticism of the newer "The Fall" title too). However, this is not just loading screens, the game actually reloads itself entirely each time it does so, other reviews were certainly not exaggerating when they said you will spend more time watching loading screens than in game.\n\nThere are some other minor issues arising already, the controls are certainly not as freely rebindable as the first game and the UI compared to the previous game is clearly console-based though workable on PC. Other issues of varying magnitude by individual preference are a somewhat lacking options menu and more.\n\nOverall, as far as a PC title goes this game has a whole host of issues, this game is certainly not for the impatient and many will find the port frustrating to work with (hopefully some of my points help people get the game working how they like it).\n\nAs for the story, o far it seems like it could be promising, seen a few Deus Ex 1 style options, the core mechanics are still there though I'm not well they're handled later down the line. So far the game has been very much like a tutorial (or perhaps the game as a whole is too linear). There is certainly a clear conspiracy style storyline (as you would expect for Deus Ex) though perhaps its a little forced this time, as I mentioned I haven't played much so far, only about to leave the first area and I am already being presented by two very distinct sides and making a major choice between the two.\n\nThis review isn't really to cover the storyline though, if you've previously played Deus Ex you already know the reputation of Invisible War and are considering playing it because you want to find out what happens after the 1st game, just keep in mind the hurdles in doing so I mentioned earlier. I do think I will play this to the end regardless, just might be in shorter bursts than HR and DX1.\n","December 6, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, DX: Invisible War received mostly mixed and somewhat negative reviews on this issue. At first, like most, I felt a little disappointed by the end of my first playthrough. For a game developed four years after the original, I expected some new, exciting ground to be explored and ideas for  improvement on the original.\n\nMany fans took an instant dislike to DX:IW for one, some, or all the following reasons: 1. The graphics weren't much of an improvement (and perhaps worse) than the original, 2. The maps seemed claustrophobic and clunky when compared to fantastic spacious environments featured in the original DX, 3. Combat wasn't much better (again, perhaps worse), 4. Voice dialogue for the most part fell flat, boring, without emotion and lacked credibility, equally less memorable as the characters themselves, 5.That the gameplay had been too simplified and lacked ambition, ie: loss of ammo variation, skills system dropped, no XP points, absence of lockpicks, etc, 6. That while Alex D could take on secondary missions, they turned out to be nothing more than minor distractions far too easily accomplished (amongst many things that DX: HR had got right), 7. That the game itself was too short - it could be completed in about 10 hours first playthrough, while completion of its predecessor perhaps required four times as long!\n\nBut then something pulled me back to play it again, even a third time....Certainly, if you can see past the shortcomings listed above, then you might be able to enjoy IW's more positive aspects. For example, I considered IW's weapon mods to be far more interesting than the ones in DX. I also enjoyed a couple of innovative ideas: spider-bot bombs were tremendous fun, while the health leech and bot-domination were fantastic ideas included in augmentation. Also, Alex doesn't share JC Denton's frustrating inability to climb over waist-high crates!\n\nAs the world has moved 20 years on from DX, so too has nano-augmentation: the cybernetically enhanced Omar deal in black market goods, while nanite detonaters and harmful nanite clouds lend IW an intriguing backdrop to the conspiratorial story. The Greys make a return and this time around given a more sentient role in IW's affairs.\n\nHolograms also make a welcome return - although these are far more complex than the mere communication types featured in DX: such AI constucts styled in the image and voice of a fictitious pop star of this future, NG Resonance, are able to interact with people, even licensed to offer rewards for solving crimes (since as a precaution such holograms are connected to police databases)...not to mention report on everything said by someone suspicious. Another nice little idea.\n\nThe game music - while not quite as memorable as DX's - helped enhance the atmosphere of each mission. There were some great angles on the story itself: one particular mission meant a return to some place from DX (I don't want to spoil it for those yet to play IW!) as if everything had come full circle. It was quite a satisfying, if somewhat poignant moment.\n\nProject Leader Harvey Smith was given the chance to explain why events turned sour: DX:IW suffered a rushed development shipped with both good and bad ideas due to fan feedback mismanagement, there was little teamwork chemistry within the studio, and the need to cater for a console version confused matters even further. Not in the least he was going through a divorce. Later that same year, another big project by Ion Storm  was completed in the form of Thief: Deadly Shadows - and really that's what demanded DX director Warren Spector's attention. In hindsight, Invisible War should have been developed with a full studio complement in the same pioneering spirit as the original DX. Even if this meant waiting a couple of years for an improved engine to come along, the planning of more in-depth characters with credible dialogue, gameplay design and sharper mechanics, intriguing secondary missions, and complex map levels. Perhaps, one day, there will be a 'remake' of Deus Ex: Invisible War...?\n\nOne last note: if you have played Deus Ex, then be prepared that Inivisible War is a somewhat different beast to its predecessor. And please let me know whether you agree, disagree, or have something you'd like to add!","September 4, 2013","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wouldn't call me playing it a waste of time, because I have played plenty of games worse than this one. The game is awash with bugs - but many are in my opinion only aestethic, and does not affect the general gameplay as much. Sure the floating objects, invisible spider-bots and massive amount of clipping (mostly in cinematics) are disturbing - but again, nothing that should deteriorate you from playing this game, because it does function still.\n\nThe ragdoll-graphics bring both joy and annoyance - at times they are hilarious (yes, mostly at the beginning of the game), but at other times they are just plainly frustrating. Not to mention even a bit surreal - but extremely surreal. Sure, this ordinary enemy takes 10 shots to his torso and still lives (like what?), but one shot to the head and he's tossed like 30 feet out from a balcony. From a pistol-shot. With a silencer.\n\nThe loading-screens are many, and extremely frustrating. My first (and only, thank God) play-through of this game is roughly 18 hours. Not 18 hours that I was tormented non-stop. More like 3 hours of "damn, this is actually a very good game!" and 15 hours of "omg, I just wanna finish this game so I can move on". Point is, without the extreme amount of loading-screens every 5-10 minutes, my play-time could have been shaved down to like 11 hours or something. Not to mention random crashes (five in my play-through), and the fact that every time the game moves on to another loading-screen it minimizes to my desktop - stays that way for about 20 seconds and then resumes to the loading-screen which is another 30-40 seconds of waiting. And it randomize my oh-so-carefully organized desktop each and every ♥♥♥♥ing time, too.\n\nI didn't really have a problem with the HUD, I thought it was aestethically acceptable and easy to learn and understand. What I did have a problem with was the over-simplification of the biomods, and inventory-screen. Only 5 slots to fill with biomods, and none the ordinary biomods (except for the muscle-thing that expand you inventory) are that appealing seeing as you get a hold of your first supposedly illeagal - and almost too helpful - biomod after about 1 hour of play.\n\nThe story of the game is good. Not as good as the first Deus Ex, mind you. But it is still good, and frankly was the only thing that kept me going and completing the game. I think the level-design negatively impact the story-line and sort of cramps the ability to go about everything the way you could in the first Deus Ex, but on the other end the level-design did promote a more direct, fast-paced sort of action (seeing as upgrading the speed-biomod to max-level could be done in about 2 hours of game-time, and thus could be activated basically non-stop the rest of the game due to low bioenergy-consumption and a complete overload of energy-cells throughout the game).\n\nTo sum it up: Play this game for the story. It will not perform miracles gameplay-wise. The storyline isn't fantastic either, but I can't call it a waste of time because I did enjoy building upon the legacy that JC Denton left in the original game. I think with a bit more effort from the developers, that this game could have been somewhat better and more of a worthy sequel to the 1st Deus Ex, as opposed to the bleak shadow of the 1st game that it is today. The game is worth 7 €, but I got it on a sale, which somehow eased the discomfort I experienced while playing it.\n\n60/100","April 4, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We can help you correct this."\n\nDeus Ex: Invisible War is a for the most part linear FPS-RPG in a sinister Sci-Fi setting.\n\nIt's graphics pale compared to other titles using the same engine, levels seem a bit confined especially when compared to the first Deus Ex and the inventory is tiny - design concessions that had to be made in order for a release on the original Xbox console to be possible.\n\nFrequent loading screens in between small level sections can be somewhat annoying and take between 20-30 seconds even on a SSD. (Save regularly to avoid having to replay lenghty sections because very rarely the game did crash on me and even corrupted a save-file once.)\n\nSounds bad? Nah.\n\nI played through the game close to its release and played through it again just now. Don't be fooled into thinking this is the abysmal game enthusiasts of the first game often make it out to be. It's less complex in just about every aspect, yes, but it still an enjoyable experience for fans of the series and FPS-RPG fans alike. Shooting feels fine, weapons and gadgets/biomods are fun to use, different approaches to enemy encounters / completing objectives are possible and encouraged, even some plot altering decisions can be made.\n\nOverall it was an enjoyable 20 hour experience (if you take your time like me, and try to find up to six special weapons well hidden in the game). A recommendation when on sale, especially for fans of the first game for story reasons and for fans of the cyberpunk/noir/dark Sci-Fi genres.\n\n(Note: I ran this game on Win 8.1 64-Bit using the community texture pack, at 1080p resolution, 120 FOV and reduced HUD size. Using all these tweaks (to be found in the community section here on steam) I even found it visually to be a somewhat pleasing experience.)","March 24, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After the sheer joy of the first Deus Ex, I was very excited to give this one a try; too bad for me.\n\nWhile you can still find echoes of the open, multi-method gameplay that Deus Ex is known for, the overall experience is dull.  The AI appears less capable, and the voice acting does nothing to make up for the limitations.  The story just feels less compelling, and they even have one massively contradicting feature from the previous narrative (no spoiler here).  The individual maps are tiny and relatively featureless, and lack enough NPCs to give them life (even the night club’s population is a joke).  There are also no transition animations/mini-movies, which is painful given the amount of traveling you do (remember the small maps?).\n\nMoving on from the atmosphere, the gameplay reeks of a bad console port.  Your options for character customization are a far cry from the previous title; there are less augmentations and items to play with, too.  I also found a severe imbalance concerning ammunition.  If you don’t play it safe and stockpile munitions by the time you’ve got heavy hitters coming at you, and you didn’t plan on using stealth the whole way through (kinda go hand-in-hand, right?) then things get painful.  Oh, and all weapons are supplied by one ammo type, and you can only carry so much.  Not to say, however, that this game is overly challenging all the way through (quite the opposite).\n\nJust everything about this game was “less” than its predecessor.  Unless you are planning to purchase just out of dedication to the Deus Ex franchise, don’t waste your time with this one.\n","April 5, 2015","false","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now that I've actually played it, I can safely say that this is a bad game even outside the context of the vastly superiror Deus Ex and Human Revolution. Bugs abound, the story is boring and full of holes, combat is inane, and most of the biomods are completely uninteresting.\n\n(NOTE: My playtime is inaccurate. I had to play offline because of an obnoxious design flaw that has the game start a new process every time you go to a new area - Steam interprets this as restarting the game and sends annoying popups to all your friends every 5 minutes. My actual time with the game was around 12 hours.)\n\nPros:\n\n- You can throw furniture at people's heads. Everyone has 5-7 lines of dialogue to complain about you doing this and a funny recoil animation. They'll never go hostile despite threatening to attack. It's fun, and I did it to basically everyone in the game once I realized it wasn't any good.\n\n- You can kill everyone. There are only lasting consequneces for killing plot characters, though, and even those are fairly negligible. See cons.\n\n- The voice acting is generally pretty good. A few minor NPCs do their best to ruin that.\n\nCons:\n\n- Bugs. So many bugs. A few of the ones I encountered: Multitools sometimes won't stack or count correctly because the devs couldn't ID things correctly, autosaves will randomly delete and send you back 30 minutes, one full CTD, ragdolls try to reach the fourth dimension when shot by turrets or patrol bots, and tons of minor inconveniences like small items not being accessible behind useless aesthetics with large hitboxes or the light from lamps not remotely matching where the bulb is pointed.\n\n- The story is terrible. It tries to be deep, but mostly ends up being nonsensical. International air travel hasn't existed for 20 years, supposedly, but there's a private pilot hanging out in a slum bar in the first area you visit. He owns a Harrier and can fly to Cairo from Seattle.\n\n- There's basically no music.\n\n- The AI is incredibly stupid. You can kill people by pushing flaming barrels into them and no one will care. In combat, they'll stand still with their backs to you for no reason and all try to be in exactly the same spot. The only real threat comes the lack of health restoration in the early game.\n\n- Once you get a sniper rifle, there is no reason to use anything else. It can kill any human enemy (with a very late game exception) in one shot from any distance provided you hit them in the head, which isn't challenging since they're so fond of standing still. Pistols do pathetic damage, shotgun damage dropoff is too high, and all other weapons drain ammo too quickly to be worth using.\n\n- Ammo is shared between all weapons and obnoxiously rare. Quite a few enemy types apparently fire using dark magic and will never drop ammo.\n\n- You can kill everyone, but nobody cares. I walked into a nightclub and proceeded to murder everyone, including a security chief and the Culture Minister of Seattle. The police outside didn't care, and no one ever brought it up again.\n\n- Quests that clearly should be mutually exclusive aren't. You can take a quest to become the enemy of the Omar and the ally of the Omar. If you finish the enemy quest first, you'll briefly be penalized, but then can still reach friend status by completing the other quest. Another early quest pair involving rival businesses can also have both halves completely for full reward.\n\n- No meaningful choices until the end.\n\n- Bad level design. Where Human Revolution and Deus Ex have multiple routes into everything and allow for a stealth approach, Invisible War rarely has alternate routes more interesting than air ducts and seemingly goes out of its way to make stealth unviable.\n\n-------\n\nSome good get a bad reputation for failing to live up to their predecessors. This isn't one of those - it's simply bad, and not even the ability to bean bartenders in the head with their own kegs can save it.","April 6, 2015","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though it was extremely cramped and linear, it still had a lot of potential and a lot to offer. Unfortunately it's sad to say that this wasn't maximized on. It doesn't matter how many times I reinstall, verify cache, patch the game, restart the game I literally get game breaking crash spots. I can't take an elevator that requires me to use to progress the actual game because there's a scripted crash as soon as I take. Reloaded my save several times, tried every fix possible but apparently its just getting rid of the crash. Tried restarting the game several times from scratch and I get to the same elevator and the game continuously crashes at the same part of the story that I progress back to upon each playthrough. This game is literally preventing me from playing it. I was hoping to get more than 1 hour and 40 minutes into it but that's genuinely impossible when the game refuses to allow you to so much as take an elevator. Not only dealing with the elevator crash, I've dealt with several random crashes throughout my entire time TRYING to play the game. I've literally spent about an hour of my 1hr 40min playtime on loading screens and the extra 40 playing the actual game.\n\nLike I said. I really liked playing what little I've been able to but dealing with the constant crashing, I'm unable to say this game is worth the endless hours of reloading, reinstalling and reverifying. I'm sure its a good game but until I'm able to not get ♥♥♥ raped by endless crashing that prevents me from so much as playing 10 minutes, I have to not recommend this game.","April 1, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the standard "restart from desktop" that happens literally every time you enter a new area (3-4 rooms), but "click lift button to enter new area, game quits as usual, desktop appears as usual, game never comes back". I spent hours trying the different hacks and tweaks documented online: changing resolutions, binding the executables to individual CPUs, downloading hacked executables, setting it up in compatibility mode, alt-tabbing at the perfect time, creating junctions for 32-bit C:\Program Files, but nothing worked. It's a shame, because I actually quite liked the "circle interface" and the graphics and enemy AI seemed improved over Deus Ex GOTY, though it's hard to tell since I only got to see 6 bad guys and about 10 rooms in total.

The stealth system was only helped by haveing at least 4 ways to do most levels / zones / whatever you want to call them with only the method of getting to the next being 2 choices each with advanages and disadvanages of their own.\n\nStory line is better than alot of newer games besides its sequal of course with it even includeing references to the previous game without breaking the plot line if you do not get them. The story line is of course a consipacy that is true like all of them are in this game series. The plot is told through the infolink thing though not explained how that works in the game play to which i wish they did as they did in all the other games in the series.\n\nGraphics well for a game made in 2004 they were good for 2004 but compared to modern day graphics or even the watered down ones in Dues Ex: The fall they are not that good about a 5/10 for the graphics when compared to modern day standards mainly due to probably not enough room on the disk back then and lack of the GPUs back then being able to do as much as now. With that said good for 2004 not so much for 2015.\n\nBugs and Gliches now .... on windows 2000 and XP it runs fine without any help, vista  and 7 you have to turn off themes to get it to run like that but in 8 and 8.1 the bugs / gliches are as follows:\nfirst major one is with saveing you are allowed 2 saves not including the auto save of course before it makes you delete them both to save again the work around that i found is just to save over the last save which isnt that good if you are letting another person play or wanting to play it in 2 differnet ways at once thus needing 2 diffenret saves\nsecond major bug loading is a black screen then minimizes it then a white screen then the loading screen whenever changing areas and you do this alot when finishing up an area\nthird major bug failure of it to auto save when it should which is every time you go through a loading screen to another area\nfourth major bug random crashing at random times ussualy at a loading screen it will just crash for no reason that i can see also crashing when you try to skip dialog to fast\nfirst minor bug it doesn't always remember to drain your bio energy for the default light bio-modifcation so it might or might not drain the bio energy at random times\nsecond minor bug enemies some times stop being effected or are not effected when variable to the bolt caster weapon\nthird minor bug non biomodified human enemies some times being able to see you when you are using the cloak bio modification some times not some times so\n\nover all conclution of the game now. i think it is a good game wish it did not have so many issues on my system but the gameplay is good better than alot of games that i played recently too and the plot is excellent just the bugs i would not pay the $40 i paid for it back in 2004 for the console edition again as it is able to be gotten used to as the loading screens ussualy are not close to one another but when they are it is annoying with the bugs that might or might not happen also saveing whenever you think it is a good time to or just have a notion that you should save you save then as it might crash .... it is with the $6.99 it is now on steam and i urge you to get the collection of Deus Ex games too to make it cheaper and to understand the plot line more but this one has issues with windows 8.1 Pro anyways so the issues ruined its game play a few times for me\n\ni will recommened this to all my freinds as it is a good game just it has issues with the newer OSes is all and that is not good if you are reading this once you upgraded to windows 10 as they most likely are there too.","June 7, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Character customization is much more limited, the solutions to problems are all much simpler, and the storyline is just... sorry.  Ninety percent of the game consists of making choices that have zero effect on the endgame, despite feeling important at the time.  This game suffered because it was the sequel to the absolutely outstanding Deus Ex, and after waiting for a sequel, fans were delivered this disappointment.  They wanted more Deus Ex, and this failed to deliver.\n\nThat said, this was the first Deus Ex game I ever played, and it was good enough to make me want to play the others.  It's a fun game, with fun gameplay and intriguing mechanics.  If I had played the other Deus Ex games first and played this one after, yes, I would have been disappointed.  This is a failed attempt to match the other games' depth and customization.  But it's still a fun game.  This of it as Deus Ex Lite.  You'll get the Deus Ex experience, but nowhere near the level of Deus Ex 1 or Human Revolution.\n\nIt is worth playing, even as a Deus Ex game.  The plot is passable, as are the NPCs.  There is a "true pacifist" route to be taken if you desire, and there are some fun easter egg references to the first game buried in here.  For $6.99, the game is fantastic and fun, just don't expect a Deus Ex level experience.  Go in with that mindset, and you'll probably have a good time.\n\nBottom Line: Worth the price tag.","December 13, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, DX: Invisible War received mostly mixed and somewhat negative reviews on this issue. At first, like most, I felt a little disappointed by the end of my first playthrough. For a game developed four years after the original, I expected some new, exciting ground to be explored and ideas for  improvement on the original.\n\nMany fans took an instant dislike to DX:IW for one, some, or all the following reasons: 1. The graphics weren't much of an improvement (and perhaps worse) than the original, 2. The maps seemed claustrophobic and clunky when compared to fantastic spacious environments featured in the original DX, 3. Combat wasn't much better (again, perhaps worse), 4. Voice dialogue for the most part fell flat, boring, without emotion and lacked credibility, equally less memorable as the characters themselves, 5.That the gameplay had been too simplified and lacked ambition, ie: loss of ammo variation, skills system dropped, no XP points, absence of lockpicks, etc, 6. That while Alex D could take on secondary missions, they turned out to be nothing more than minor distractions far too easily accomplished (amongst many things that DX: HR had got right), 7. That the game itself was too short - it could be completed in about 10 hours first playthrough, while completion of its predecessor perhaps required four times as long!\n\nBut then something pulled me back to play it again, even a third time....Certainly, if you can see past the shortcomings listed above, then you might be able to enjoy IW's more positive aspects. For example, I considered IW's weapon mods to be far more interesting than the ones in DX. I also enjoyed a couple of innovative ideas: spider-bot bombs were tremendous fun, while the health leech and bot-domination were fantastic ideas included in augmentation. Also, Alex doesn't share JC Denton's frustrating inability to climb over waist-high crates!\n\nAs the world has moved 20 years on from DX, so too has nano-augmentation: the cybernetically enhanced Omar deal in black market goods, while nanite detonaters and harmful nanite clouds lend IW an intriguing backdrop to the conspiratorial story. The Greys make a return and this time around given a more sentient role in IW's affairs.\n\nHolograms also make a welcome return - although these are far more complex than the mere communication types featured in DX: such AI constucts styled in the image and voice of a fictitious pop star of this future, NG Resonance, are able to interact with people, even licensed to offer rewards for solving crimes (since as a precaution such holograms are connected to police databases)...not to mention report on everything said by someone suspicious. Another nice little idea.\n\nThe game music - while not quite as memorable as DX's - helped enhance the atmosphere of each mission. There were some great angles on the story itself: one particular mission meant a return to some place from DX (I don't want to spoil it for those yet to play IW!) as if everything had come full circle. It was quite a satisfying, if somewhat poignant moment.\n\nProject Leader Harvey Smith was given the chance to explain why events turned sour: DX:IW suffered a rushed development shipped with both good and bad ideas due to fan feedback mismanagement, there was little teamwork chemistry within the studio, and the need to cater for a console version confused matters even further. Not in the least he was going through a divorce. Later that same year, another big project by Ion Storm  was completed in the form of Thief: Deadly Shadows - and really that's what demanded DX director Warren Spector's attention. In hindsight, Invisible War should have been developed with a full studio complement in the same pioneering spirit as the original DX. Even if this meant waiting a couple of years for an improved engine to come along, the planning of more in-depth characters with credible dialogue, gameplay design and sharper mechanics, intriguing secondary missions, and complex map levels. Perhaps, one day, there will be a 'remake' of Deus Ex: Invisible War...?\n\nOne last note: if you have played Deus Ex, then be prepared that Inivisible War is a somewhat different beast to its predecessor. And please let me know whether you agree, disagree, or have something you'd like to add!","September 4, 2013","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story made no sense at all at the end of Deus Ex you can only pick one out come not all so why for the love of pound cake did they make it so JC Denton did all of them it makes no sense it would have been easy to make a save importer that tells the game what happened in the first so your choices would make a new story each time you play or even easier make an application in the launcher or at the start of the game that asks the user to say what they chose to do in major game changing events like "Did you kill Anna Navarre on the jet" or option 2 "Did you Kill Anna Navarre at UNATCO HQ". It would have been simple to do using Unreal Tournament Engine I have made 2 games that have that option granted I never published them as I didn't think they were very good so I spared the public the pain of another bad game. But my point still stands they wasted a great opportunity to make an ok game a great game Eidos need to look at what make a game story line good and improve it not go backwards. Another bad feature is the automatic keypads and computers the best part of Deus Ex was looking for key codes and computer logins and entering them yourself, it made the game immersive I have a book filled with Deus Ex Keypad codes and computer logins from the days when I used to play it.

Character customization is much more limited, the solutions to problems are all much simpler, and the storyline is just... sorry.  Ninety percent of the game consists of making choices that have zero effect on the endgame, despite feeling important at the time.  This game suffered because it was the sequel to the absolutely outstanding Deus Ex, and after waiting for a sequel, fans were delivered this disappointment.  They wanted more Deus Ex, and this failed to deliver.\n\nThat said, this was the first Deus Ex game I ever played, and it was good enough to make me want to play the others.  It's a fun game, with fun gameplay and intriguing mechanics.  If I had played the other Deus Ex games first and played this one after, yes, I would have been disappointed.  This is a failed attempt to match the other games' depth and customization.  But it's still a fun game.  This of it as Deus Ex Lite.  You'll get the Deus Ex experience, but nowhere near the level of Deus Ex 1 or Human Revolution.\n\nIt is worth playing, even as a Deus Ex game.  The plot is passable, as are the NPCs.  There is a "true pacifist" route to be taken if you desire, and there are some fun easter egg references to the first game buried in here.  For $6.99, the game is fantastic and fun, just don't expect a Deus Ex level experience.  Go in with that mindset, and you'll probably have a good time.\n\nBottom Line: Worth the price tag.","December 13, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I'm not entirely sure why DX: IW gets so much distain among the fanbase.  The game itself wasn't as good as the first and third; but it was still a very well made, and very fun game.  You needed to download a program to get it to run in widescreen, and optionally an improvement to the textures; but that's not a necessary thing to do.  The controls are great, the graphics are great, the story is great, just everything is great.  But if I was to nitpick something,  augments are dumbed down heavily, skills got removed because why not, everything uses a universal plasma ammo-  which honestly makes sense considering in DX1 and DX3 which are both prequels to DX2, you see plasma weaponry slowly becoming quite popular; it just wasn't mass produced too far just yet; although it is confusing trying to see how they had the time to universally produce and distribute plasma weaponry and ammo after the collapse.","August 29, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story made no sense at all at the end of Deus Ex you can only pick one out come not all so why for the love of pound cake did they make it so JC Denton did all of them it makes no sense it would have been easy to make a save importer that tells the game what happened in the first so your choices would make a new story each time you play or even easier make an application in the launcher or at the start of the game that asks the user to say what they chose to do in major game changing events like "Did you kill Anna Navarre on the jet" or option 2 "Did you Kill Anna Navarre at UNATCO HQ". It would have been simple to do using Unreal Tournament Engine I have made 2 games that have that option granted I never published them as I didn't think they were very good so I spared the public the pain of another bad game. But my point still stands they wasted a great opportunity to make an ok game a great game Eidos need to look at what make a game story line good and improve it not go backwards. Another bad feature is the automatic keypads and computers the best part of Deus Ex was looking for key codes and computer logins and entering them yourself, it made the game immersive I have a book filled with Deus Ex Keypad codes and computer logins from the days when I used to play it.

I will play the 3rd one for the 5th time again soon. I had never played Invisible war before now, as i have with the 1st and 3rd games. I was looking for a "segway" to the 3rd game with the ending of this game and found myself unusure if I did or not. the choice wasnt obvious to me, but I think that if Human Revolution is infact in the same universe as Deus Ex and Invisible war, there is only one choice. The 3rd choice i made. I have seen 4/4 endings as far as I can tell. It is a good game for its own merits, with a few bugs. These may have been fixed thru mods, but i didnt install any, with the exception of the high res texture pack. Game is beautiful in 720, but it flashes to desktop to flash to a loading screen before continueing on to a new section or area. TERRIBLE. it is beyond annoying. This game also seems to take a long time to load. especially on my pc. I found that to be really weird. I still put up with it and continued on. I would say it is the weakest of the 4 games currently available, with some of the biomods being unavailable because you have installed others. its similar to the options in the other games, but far more restrictive. I was maxed out in all the ones i chose by the half way point though, and i played it on hard... which was easy enough. I made all the choices i wanted to throughout and it didnt really affect the choices at the last stage. ((save before "uploading @ UNATCO if you want to see them all)) Can they ? maybe... im sure one or 2 can. I probably wont play this title again, but I will reccommend you buy it for $5 or less.

Sadly, DX: Invisible War received mostly mixed and somewhat negative reviews on this issue. At first, like most, I felt a little disappointed by the end of my first playthrough. For a game developed four years after the original, I expected some new, exciting ground to be explored and ideas for  improvement on the original.\n\nMany fans took an instant dislike to DX:IW for one, some, or all the following reasons: 1. The graphics weren't much of an improvement (and perhaps worse) than the original, 2. The maps seemed claustrophobic and clunky when compared to fantastic spacious environments featured in the original DX, 3. Combat wasn't much better (again, perhaps worse), 4. Voice dialogue for the most part fell flat, boring, without emotion and lacked credibility, equally less memorable as the characters themselves, 5.That the gameplay had been too simplified and lacked ambition, ie: loss of ammo variation, skills system dropped, no XP points, absence of lockpicks, etc, 6. That while Alex D could take on secondary missions, they turned out to be nothing more than minor distractions far too easily accomplished (amongst many things that DX: HR had got right), 7. That the game itself was too short - it could be completed in about 10 hours first playthrough, while completion of its predecessor perhaps required four times as long!\n\nBut then something pulled me back to play it again, even a third time....Certainly, if you can see past the shortcomings listed above, then you might be able to enjoy IW's more positive aspects. For example, I considered IW's weapon mods to be far more interesting than the ones in DX. I also enjoyed a couple of innovative ideas: spider-bot bombs were tremendous fun, while the health leech and bot-domination were fantastic ideas included in augmentation. Also, Alex doesn't share JC Denton's frustrating inability to climb over waist-high crates!\n\nAs the world has moved 20 years on from DX, so too has nano-augmentation: the cybernetically enhanced Omar deal in black market goods, while nanite detonaters and harmful nanite clouds lend IW an intriguing backdrop to the conspiratorial story. The Greys make a return and this time around given a more sentient role in IW's affairs.\n\nHolograms also make a welcome return - although these are far more complex than the mere communication types featured in DX: such AI constucts styled in the image and voice of a fictitious pop star of this future, NG Resonance, are able to interact with people, even licensed to offer rewards for solving crimes (since as a precaution such holograms are connected to police databases)...not to mention report on everything said by someone suspicious. Another nice little idea.\n\nThe game music - while not quite as memorable as DX's - helped enhance the atmosphere of each mission. There were some great angles on the story itself: one particular mission meant a return to some place from DX (I don't want to spoil it for those yet to play IW!) as if everything had come full circle. It was quite a satisfying, if somewhat poignant moment.\n\nProject Leader Harvey Smith was given the chance to explain why events turned sour: DX:IW suffered a rushed development shipped with both good and bad ideas due to fan feedback mismanagement, there was little teamwork chemistry within the studio, and the need to cater for a console version confused matters even further. Not in the least he was going through a divorce. Later that same year, another big project by Ion Storm  was completed in the form of Thief: Deadly Shadows - and really that's what demanded DX director Warren Spector's attention. In hindsight, Invisible War should have been developed with a full studio complement in the same pioneering spirit as the original DX. Even if this meant waiting a couple of years for an improved engine to come along, the planning of more in-depth characters with credible dialogue, gameplay design and sharper mechanics, intriguing secondary missions, and complex map levels. Perhaps, one day, there will be a 'remake' of Deus Ex: Invisible War...?\n\nOne last note: if you have played Deus Ex, then be prepared that Inivisible War is a somewhat different beast to its predecessor. And please let me know whether you agree, disagree, or have something you'd like to add!","September 4, 2013","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The small areas where you do your missions and sometimes running through areas to do one mission and then run back through them all again.\nThe HUD was weird in the beginning but got used to it so it didn't bother me.\nThe augmentations were more limited but at least you could switch them around.\nOnly thing that was really interesting for me was the s tory in this game. It was much easier then previous Deus Ex.\nIt is hard for me to decide to recommend it or not.\nIf you are interested in more of the story I do recommend it.\nIf you do not care about the story at all in the Deus Ex games I would say it is just a game you play through and kinda forget about it.\nIt is up to you if you want to or not.\nIt wasn't so bad for me as from all the negativ things I read about it.\n\nPlayed it on Windows 10 and had fix some stuff in the ini file to get it running well. Thou one thing I couldn't get around was the loading bug where it minimizes and then goes back to full screen. I solved this by playing window mode(it minimized and back in 3-5 seconds) and using the Borderless Gaming software.","March 12","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Throughtout the game, there are various factions that you must work either with or against often times with competing goals for the same objective. Weapons share a universal ammo and can be customized with up to two upgrades. This will make you want to carry a variety of weapons and upgrade combinations for certain situations.... until the last quarter of the game but more on that later.\n\nIt takes place some time after the first deus ex and the graphics haven't aged too terribly over the years. The story isn't quite as good as the first one but then again, not many stories can compete with such a high bar. It doesn't have quite the same dark grittiness of the original in presentation to the point where when your character makes a threat it almost comes off as comical.\n\nThe gun play and physics are much improved from the first one but its still an early 2000s game so there will be shenanigans here and there but its shouldn't be anything too gamebreaking or distracting. What will be distracting and must be learned to be embraced is that everytime you enter a new zone or a previous zone or a sub zone within a zone, there will be a loading screen that in my experience actually takes you out of the game and shows a poorly res'd version of your steam launcher until it comes back on. Luckily these screens don't take long (atleast on my device) and after a while they're not as jarring.\n\nNow, for the one major con in this game. The gun play is fairly balanced for the most part until the end when one of the factions starts using troops with what is essentially power armor. The power armor has a weak spot but it isn't a critical weak spot so even if you hit them in it with a damage enhanced sniper rifle (which easily wipes the floor with any other kind of opposition except for robots) it will only hurt them alittle bit and then they pursue you and never show you their back again. The solution to this is simple albeit really damaging to the fun of the fps aspect of the game.\n\nYou get a rocket launcher, you attach an ammo saving augment to it and thats all you use for the rest of the game. They usualy use rocket launchers as well so having the gun play devolve into rocket launcher duels is very very disappointing. Don't get me wrong, you can use other guns at that point but the amount of ammo it takes to take out just one of them with a conventional firearm is completely ridiculous let alone when there's multiple of them (which there will be).\n\nAll of that taken into consideration, I think its worth a couple playthroughs taking different paths each time to get a feel for the entire package it has to offer. As always, Buy the deus ex bundle when its on sale for the best value.","March 9","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OK, so, yes, as everyone will tell you, this game doesn't live up to the original Deus Ex, a deep creative-powerhouse that managed to not only be a thoroughly enjoyable cyberpunk game (and there are never enough cyberpunk games) but which, for the time, pushed the technology available and crossed the line from being just a fun game to adding to mankind's philosophical body of knowledge about life.  The first Deus Ex was a work on art in every sense.  Now, I'm not saying that Invisible War had nothing to say.  It had numerous useful witicisms and social and political-economic comentary.  But it wasn't quite as refined as Deus Ex the first.  But, honestly, there's a lot in this game to enjoy.  The hacking gameplay is just a blast, as you vicariously mow down enemies with the robot or turret of your choice, though it certainly could have been more.  The graphics is acceptable for the time, if uninspired, and you have a lot of options with how to take your character in terms of both story and gameplay, though you top out way too early, and there's really not much mechanical reason to do everything there is to do other than the fun of doing it.  The character development isn't nearly as involved (or excellent) as the original either.  I mean, you get money, but you won't have much to spend it on.  The game is also pretty short and somewhat lacking in the challenge department, though it does have the admirable quality of awarding intelligent tactics.  This is a good, fun game, just don't expect a great game.

I say that as someone who loves DX (and not Invisible War as much).\n\nI really like all three Deus Ex games. Yet after playing through Human Revolution I don't really appreciate the DX world any more. But, revisiting DX after playing IW really did make me appreciate Deus Ex more, because certain characters, and their motivations are really fleshed out in IW. And these motivations are effectively related to DX.\n\nIW streamlines the DX experience. The original DX had a problem in that the hub worlds were a slog to get through, yet that slog made the exploration more worthwhile. In later stages of DX, the slog was removed but levels were no longer so open, and you weren't as engaged in your exploration.\n\nInfinity War has more clausterphobic levels throughout the course of the game, in part becaus of all the clunky reloading, but also because the spaces seem noticeably smaller. Yet, the choices you have, the the things you can interact with, in all levels of IW (save the last, terrible level, which is spatially more open, yet empty as a vacuum), are as dense as the early levels of DX without being a slog.\n\nIW's story is much more focused than DX, because IW really focuses on a single idea (divisive politics). The struggle of Pequod's vs Queequeg's is more interesting than DX's triad war because the former's struggle is a clearer representation on the causes underlying the central conflict.\n\n","May 22","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
