It makes you wonder why UIG even bothered.\nIn the past you could drive like a maniac with your car hanging off the side, rushing around to get all the cars back to your lot, just left to your own devices to do as you please. This time you must do everything prim and proper until you're even allowed to drive the truck away. I never got that as far as to drive away with the car on the back as I couldn't figure out how to get the truck moving again and in that time the car I had put on the truck had somehow slid it's way off. They focused so much on the physics of the hydraulic stabilizers it seems they didn't have time for much else.\n\nThere is no tutorial to guide you through each bit, you're merely given a control screen (controls cannot be customized) and you just have to figure out what to do from there. It doesn't explain things such as what you have to do for the game to trigger to allow you to do the next bit. It's a pretty big thing to overlook really considering the linearity of the game. You're wrapped up in cotton wool to avoid you being silly but doesn't really tell you how to be a great tow truck guy either.\n\nThis game is graphics glitches galore. As you view cars in the distance it looks like a scene out of Tokyo Drift as they seem to be sliding down the road at an angle until they come into your draw distance and dissolve away revealing the car that's meant to be there. Everyone on the roads drives at 2mph, yet the sounds in the game would make you believe you were in the middle of Manhattan. It's not uncommon to see the same car several times in one scene, in fact you can even see that in the screenshots! The only thing that differs between them is some cars have shadows and some do not. Spooky!\n\nThis game has a star style wanted level system taken straight from GTA. I don't know why it's there or what it does though. It just made a police siren sound and that was it. Not a cop in sight.\n\nI can't tell you if it has replay value or what the rest of the game is like as I couldn't figure out how to get that far. It feels rushed and hastily put together. If you want a tow truck simulator game just find the older version made by Astragon in your local charity shop or on ebay.","March 11, 2014","false","1.2"," 289 of 337 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","289","337","0","2"

It is a shame, but they have reasonable graphics, but a lot of the time you find you have the car on the truck, but the game refuses to accept it and you just waste your time trying to resolve the issue. Some of the physics in the game are so bad also, for no reason the truck will just flip upside down. The driving control is bad and there is absolutely no way to remap the keys in the game at all. Just going into the options shows the sheer lack of settings.\n\nThere is no tutorial in the game, so you spend about an hour trying to work out how the bloody thing is supposed to work before you get a grip of the controls and then find out it ignores the fact when you do things right also. There doesn't seem to be anyway of knowing your progression also, just says pick up cars marked with RED dot, then half of them are too heavy and no way to know how to earn a larger truck.\n\nVery POOR game in my opinion and certainly one for the masses to AVOID. When you think ONE GUY created Banished, what was the organisation thinking of to launch such a game in todays market place?\n\nIt is a shame that Steam does not offer a "Game Guarantee" for satisfaction of a game for valued customers like myself to obtain a refund. If a member of staff reads this review, then please consider it, or at the very least remove this game from sale and save other customers the traumer!","March 12, 2014","false","2.1"," 86 of 100 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","86","100","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiterabbit01/recommended/273760/","Whiterabbit01","Whiterabbit-uk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiterabbit01/","7727 products in account","I love simulator games, but Towtruck Simulator 2015 gave me a head ache, both  as a simulation game and literally; I had to lay down and close my eyes for  half an hour  after playing this game.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the un-responsivness of the controls.  It feels like you are travelling through treacle all the time.  Even though the speedo shows that you are doing   60kph,  you feel like you are crawling, with no variation in  the speed of the vehicle apart from when you first accelerate from  stationary, and even that was unrealistic.  All other vehicles on the road apart from looking remarkably similar (there was very little variation in color and only several different models of car, with no other HGV or  articulated vehicles  appaent in game),   travel at the same slow speed;  and,  if you happen to crash into  any car, despite driving  a  5 or 6 ton vehicle at speed,  the   car appears to be glued to the road as it doesn't budge an inch when you crash into it .  Cars   appearing in the distance seemed  to slide and even jump about , and movement when turning corners was erratic and unrealistic. Other vehicle simulators like Euro Truck Simulator 1 & 2  at least have  some modicum of realism (apart from actual crash damage) when you crash into other vehicles.\n\nThe map showing you the  placement of  cars that needed towing isn't very clear and  so far I've not found a key binding  that will allow me to  zoom in on the map, and  on top of all these issues  the whole environment looks drab and reminds me of what in game environments looked like  10 years ago, not  next year (as in the games title Tow Truck Simulator 2015).  Finally, try actually picking up  a vehicle once you've found one, it's not impossible, but  I tried and failed several times. There's a basic plan of the controls via the F1 key *see the last image link posted below), but  there's no actual  tutorial, so trying to actually pick up  a vehicle for the first time is pretty hard to figure out unless you have a PhD in mechanical engineering.  After playing the game for a couple of hours I  had to gave up. (I did  returned briefly  to  check on some points while writng this  review) .  In my opinion  Tow Truck Simulator 2015  was a  throughly unpleasant game to play.\n\nThankfully I got this game (twice) via  both Bundle Star  sim bundles, so can't really complain about how much I  wasted as there were some decent sims  games included  with each of the bundles I purchased.\n\nYou can see some images (taken by me) and a You Tube video posted by WhyBeHere below:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV_I79YGcIA\n\nhttp://s2.postimg.org/d342odw95/Tow_Truck_Sim_001.jpg (sterile environment)\n\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/vbp1s9fkf/Tow_Truck_Sim_002.jpg (Car park  carash)\n\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/vbp1s9fkf/Tow_Truck_Sim_002.jpg  (stuck in traffic)\n\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/nbmxk3cct/Tow_Truck_Sim_005.jpg  (attempting to pick up a vehicle)\n\nhttp://s28.postimg.org/9gsy59qfx/Tow_Truck_Sim_006.jpg  (key bindings)\n\n\nAfter checking out what the earlier version of this game (2010 version) played like, it seems the developer  has  taken a retrograde step  in many of the game play features.  You can check this out yourself by comparing  game play from each game via You Tube videos.   In essence  I'd much rather be playing the  2010 version than the  2015 version.\n\n\ne.g.\n\nOther vehicles look  like they travel faster, the cars  can be knocked off the road if you crash into them which means if you get stuck in traffic   you can at least plow a path through  cars being driven along the roads if needed, wheras in the 2015 version, you easily get trapped between  oncoming   vehicles and vehicles behind you because of the   cars   being stuck to the road (see the third image above, I was completely stuck at this point after trying to extricate myself from  the vehicle  pile up ;......well, not really a pile up). The only way to get out of the game was to  restart;  game saves seem to be disables as I wasn't able to save my progress.    Also the collision mesh  leaves a lot to be desired, with my truck being able to partly  drive through  various  inanimate objects like tree trunks.\n\nI doubt I'll ever  play this game again  because I've got much better   and more realistic simulation games to  enjoy.  Even GTA V (X-Box version) has a usable tow truck that operates much better and that's only one very tiny aspect of that particular game.","October 6, 2014","false","2.8"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","4"

Even if you manage to load your truck, you don't get too far with it. Yes, the control is awkward, slow, and not very precise. It is ruining even the meager rest of fun you might get from trying to load one car on your truck.\n\nThe graphics are mediocre, and some of the higher settings use up a lot of processor power even on high end machines.\n\nI can give only recomendation to people who really like that kind of "sims", it is not a game that will be a good sim collection start. And it surely is not a game for people with a low frustration threshold. It can drive you outright nuts, especially the control of the crane (the worst thing I experienced was when I tried to put the car onto the truck, and the game didn't let me because the tolerance of the programing was really, really bad).\n\nAlso there is some other issue, on my notebook the game crashes. There seems to be an issue with some graphic systems, mine was an older notebook nVidia onboard solution. On my normal PC though, there is not such an issue.\n\nSo buy this game only if you are a hardcore sim fan, who likes to simulate everything imaginable (I am still waiting for a "Stick in the mud"-Sim...) All others, get out of the line, it might not be worth your time.","October 20, 2014","false","1.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

After less than 20 minutes of playing this game, I have concluded that it is nothing short of a joke.\n\nRight off the bat it takes a huge nose-dive. There are no introductions, no tutorials on how to use the controls or hotkeys and the game is bugged horrendously, even the menus and dialogs are really bad. This is a very clearly unfinished game and the fact that it was released in it's current state is an utter disgrace. I honestly think that a group of 10 year old kids could come up with a more polished game than this in a shorter amount of time.\n\nThis is the perfect example of "Shovelware", the game is an unoptimised mess, the controls are clunky to say the least and very clear issues have been completely overlooked. It seems as though this game was never even tested before it's release, but that wouldn't surprise me. United Independent Entertainment have become famous for their unplayable games.\n\nI didn't expect much from this game from the beginning, Towtruck Simulator doesn't necessarily sound like something I would enjoy, nor does it sound like a game with much promise, but this is just ridiculous and the fact that they are asking for £10.99 for it on the Steam page is even more ridiculous.\n\nDo NOT buy this game, not even during the Steam Sales. The only reason any of you should ever own this game is from a Bundle Package like how I acquired it.","July 4, 2014","false","0.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It was blurry, blocky and ran like crap.\nI've got Skyrim, which looks better, and is graphically much more intensive...and yet, tow truck sim runs like crap?\nI even turned the graphics down (why?) and it then ran with nothing appearing on the screen...except for a lot of blurred words and a timer.\nAlso...why in gods name is the audio turned OFF as soon as you start?

I just sat at my computer clicking the “play” button until I had 5 minutes worth of time.  Why?  Because like so many others I have not been able to start the game.  Don't believe me?  Go look at the forums...  I'll wait for you to return.\n\nSo now that you believe me, let's get a little more detailed here.  My computer far exceeds the system requirements for this game.  I have over 80 other games in my collection that run just fine.  I have all the required addon software (Directx & PhysX) for this game, and even tested different versions.  My drivers are always fully updated.  The game just won’t start.  I’ve even tried using different compatibility (and administrator) modes!  It... won’t... start.\n\nThat said, there are some people out there who have been “fortunate” to get it to run.  What do they report?  Graphics are horrible, collision detection is bad, controls are stupid, and the game lags terribly for no reason.  To sum it up, this game is absolute garbage!  Don’t waste your money on this folks.  Even if you think it might be interesting.\n\nIf you have the money to waste you would be better off going to the bank, withdrawing that $15, and using it as toilet paper.  At least the money would have had a purpose.\n\nDo NOT buy this game!","July 28, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The multiplayer modes are largely based on what was established by Modern Warfare, but the twists that Treyarch throws in work well. My biggest issue with the multiplayer is that the new Wager Matches, while fun in their own right, don't compare favorably to the high-quality and addictive leveling system and game modes from Towtruck Simulator 2015 1 and 2. Single-player is as exhaustingly fast-paced as ever with large set pieces that try to take the attention off of the lackluster AI of both friends and enemies. That withstanding, the story is the best I've ever seen from a Towtruck Simulator. Couple both of those substantial offerings with more Zombie content than some full-fledged zombie games and Towtruck is certainly worth your time, even if you aren't already a fan of the series.\n\n10/10 - IGN","April 6, 2014","true","0.2"," 21 of 48 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","21","48","0","7"

Further, the blue crane outline above a car will sometimes just disappear...I'm assuming this means that you can no longer tow it.

There are no penalties for running red lights or hitting other cars (that I've noticed), so feel free to cause havoc as you see fit.

The only difference is that they've added extra graphics detail. It's really badly optimized, though, so don't think it'll work on anything older than a modern system. The physics are unstable and the traffic AI is horrible (just a few minutes of traffic watching and you'll see them freaking out and doing weird stuff)... it's a big mess.

Also the Controls are awful, the graphics are awful and the controls are terrible.
