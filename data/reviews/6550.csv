You need to be extremely good for higher difficulty levels . After all video games need to be challenging , they are more fun that way . DA was tougher than SE .\n\nC - Combat - ♥♥♥♥in amazing , its so much fun to hurl enemies into air , use them as a skateboard , mixing devil arms and melee weapons in the combat and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of enemies . Style play  promotes  chaining of combos . Use of different styles , different weapons and devil arms brings variety in combat and gives fresh and fantastic experience . They just nailed it in this department , style switcher mod for pc takes it to next level . There so many brilliant combo videos on youtube and all are  amazing .\n\nB - Boss Fights - Boss fights are simply outstanding . Agni&Rudra , Nevan , Beowulf , Dante's shadow , Vergil fights etc ( one of the best boss ever )  all are amazing . No cutscene , qte ♥♥♥♥ just pure dope gameplay . You have to learn their moves and fight effectively . Bosses are designed well too and give  sense of achievement after beating them . Normal enemies are not that great and not that bad and there is a room for improvement . Loved vergil's and doppelganger's taunts .\n\nA - Action - Right in your face intense action . Amazing combat , style play and hordes of enemies keep the action going on . Few puzzles are here and there which save your fingers from getting sore . DMC3 is all about cool & stylish moves/action . DMC3 is one of the best action games ever made .\n\nS- Story - Pretty straightforward story , DMC3 focuses more on action/combat and this what i expect from a action game . Minimal story and loads of gameplay . Cutscenes are top notch and action packed esp. when dante gets devil trigger . Vergil & The Lady cutscenes are equally epic .\n\n\nSS - Sick Soundtrack - Battle theme pumps you up and with metal in the background and action going on the screen , one can never go wrong  . Metal + action games combo  gives birth to amazing gaming experience  . Battle theme do get repetitve and sometimes it gets irritating . Vergil 3 and doppelganger themes are great . Last but not the least , just listen to Devils never cry . So ♥♥♥♥in gooooood\n\n\nSSS - SonS of Sparda - Both Dante and vergil are fantstic characters , esp. Dante . Their chemistry is so interesting , both are twins but completely opposite to each other and whenever they interact its fun watch them . Dante is such a badass character with bring it on attitude and vergil on the other hand calm and more  deadly foe .Their design is pretty great too with old school red vs blue touch . No words to describe the battles between them , play it and experience it . Unarguably one of the best combination and boss fight . Rarely you have a opponent who is equally as powerful as you and defeats you . Being your own brother makes things more heated up( only in game :P )\n\nPc port is bad but can be fixed easliy with few fixes , thanks to modding community . Replay value  is great with playable vergil ,  bloody palce mode and ofcourse trying different styles and maximizing them .\n\nMasterpiece 9.9/10","January 4, 2015","true","30.9"," 172 of 183 people (94%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","94","172","183","36","6"

DO NOT BUY!!!!!(Fixes for this game are at the bottom of the review. Click on the link) DO NOT GET ON PC!!!! Get the HD Collection on PS3 or Xbox 360 instead. This Game is an AMAZING Game. However, the PC Port of this game is HORRIBLE!!!!! the controlls don't work right and you have to do a ton of unecessary fixes just to have some functionality, not even full functionality. and the resolution is about the same resolution as the original PS2 game so it will not play in HD or in any wide aspact ratio. This is a total waste of your hard earned money. your better off getting the "Devil May Cry HD Collection" on PS3 or Xbox 360 where u get the first 3 original DMC games including this one, the controls flow like you where born to play this game, and the resolution is FULL HD! now that is a WAY BETTER buy then this PC version piece of crap. keep in mind that DMC 4 and DMC:Devil May Cry (Remake) works amazing on PC so just becuase this one sucks on PC doesn't mean the other 2 on pc are bad as well. I would recommend DMC 4, and DMC Reamake over this game aswell. Have fun with those other DMC Games. :)\n\nI HAVE AMAZING NEWS!!! this link at the bottom of the review will help you fix every single problem this game can dish out! :D. it's in the steam forums. if you really want this game, than you have to see this link. This link will give you everything! how to get full controller functionality, get the proper resolution in game in full screen, and more. this is highly recomended for more advance computer users so, be warned, some of this fixes for some people aren't easy but for most it should be a piece of cake ;) have fun!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/6550/discussions/0/864969320373351964/#p1","November 30, 2013","false","3.0"," 246 of 347 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","246","347","2","8"

Fullscreen works by pressing ALT+Enter (maybe not while in the menu or title screen or cutscene, but ingame), widescreen support is available via a hack. On some systems, the resolution may be limited to 640x480 or 800x600, but that is not the normal behaviour. You should get the highest 4:3 resolution closest to your native resolution without a patch. XBox controllers are not officially supported because this game uses directinput for controller support, which is the predecessor to xinput. If you have one of the recent Logitech gamepads (F310 for example), you can choose between directinput and xinput via a hardware switch on the controller, then map the controller keys correctly (setup controller) and the game works out of the box. If you have to use an xbox compatible controller, you have to fiddle around to get the trigger keys working. This is because the trigger keys are analog and on the same axis on the xbox compatible controllers, but are two seperate digital keys on the older standard. Please note that this game was developed before the xbox compatible controllers had been invented! It would have been nice of Capcom to have this version revamped like they did for PS3 and XBox, but they have not.  It is not optimized for the PC and it is an old game, but I still think it is awesome.","December 27, 2013","true","132.3"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","53","66","0","0"

Dante is then attacked by lessor demons but quickly (and stylishly) kills them all and this starts the events of the game and overall the story is pretty good best in the series has some insane motioncapture and good voice acting (compared to DMC1 and DmC this is oscar worthy)\n\n\nSecond the styles - You can choose between four different styles which are Swordmaster where your melee weapons have more moves, do more damage and let you combo in the air easily, Gunslinger lets you use your guns in extremely stylish ways from spinning in mid air while fireing down to curb stomping a demon while shooting him in the head and its a pleasure to watch the animations, Royalguard works as a block button but it doesn't stop there sure you can block and take reduced damage but if you perfectly time your block you can absorb all damage and release it in a extremely damaging attack that if you build enough damage up you can instant kill some of the tougher demons, Trickster gives you another type of dodge, a teleport, a air dash and the ability to run on walls, Trickster can be used to create insane combos if you know what you're doing. There are two other styles quicksilver and doppleganger which let you slow down time and create a copy of yourself and thats about it but if used right are deadly (doppleganger unlocks a hidden two player mode to)\n\n\nThird the combat - The combat in this game is insanely fun with a total of 5 devil arms (melee weapons) and 5 fire arms (guns) for Dante and the ability to bring any combination of weapons (two devil arms two fire arms) and one of 6 styles to choose from this game has a crazy ammount of depth in its combat especailly since all weapons and styles (except doppleganger and quicksilver) can be upgraded and gain more moves.\n\n\nFourth Extras - With the special edition you are able to play as Vergil who has 3 devil arms and no fire arms but shoots summond swords instead and a single style (he has less depth then Dante but is fun to play) After you beat the game once you can start a new game as Vergil you will be given a cutscene that takes place before DMC3 but don't get your hopes up he ends up going through the same levels as Dante (from the Devil May Cry all the way to hell) The style switcher mod does work on Vergil but you can only use dark slayer (Default style) and Dante's quicksilver style (due to the other styles not working right or them already being a part of Dark Slayer)\n\nFifth should you buy it - In short yes you should buy this game...... if you have a playstation 2 the pc version is a extremely bad port and it is fixable (I fixed it after spending over 10 hours configureing it) it just takes a lot of time and a lot of reading user guides on how to fix it. On the brightside of the pc version is the ability to mod and the famous style switcher mod (go get it now) which lets you change to any of the 6 styles at any time in game without having to stop at a statue to change them (it also comes with other features that let you customize the game further but I won't get into that)\n\nIf you use a controller be prepared to break it in half with your teeth out of pure rage when you find out the triggers don't work and the sticks are reversed (right stick moves you left stick turns camera) there are fixes for this but they don't always work and if you are useing Motioninjoy be prepared to just quit (I made a discussion post on how to fix a ps3 controller with motioninjoy but if you are useing any other controllers good luck to you)\n\nI also hope you have a somewhat decent computer cause this game runs like hell the framerate is subpar and requires you to delete audio files (really?) to get the framerate up but it stops the badass soundtrack from playing if you do so (luckly for me my computer can handle it)\n\n\nFinal - Do i recommend this game? again yes if you can get a console copy or if you are willing to spend 10+ hours fixing it, if you have no choice but to buy it on PC buy it when it goes on sale it usualy drops down to $7.50 but this is one of my favorite games of all time it just has a bad pc port","February 16, 2015","true","52.3"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

It's not entirely unplayable as some may lead you to believe, but it's bad enough to make you want to not play the game despite how fun it is.\nMost console controllers will refuse to work for the game and what DOES work will leave you wanting more, such as not being able to use one of your joysticks. You CAN download a program to fix this and it's really not the main issue with the port because it can be fixed. The real problem comes from the fact that you will have massive, and I mean MASSIVE fps drops in multiple locations resulting in it being neigh unplayable.\nBut in those non-large areas where fps is stable and you fix the controller up, it works rather well for a port.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it because it's far too much work to get everything in working condition.\n(At this point there might even be a fix for the FPS drops but I didn't care to look for it)\n\nTHAT ALL BEING SAID\nIf you don't have a problem with everything I said, feel free to pick up this game.","November 30, 2013","false","3.0"," 52 of 92 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","52","92","0","0"

Everything about this game is rediculous.  The combat, the story, the cutscenes, it's all over the top crazy action, and I love it.  I bought this on Steam to try to replay it with some better graphics, but unfortunately, this game was not optimized for PC at ALL.\n\nController support is awful, you CAN get some of them to work, but it isn't easy, and you have to a lot of research to find out how to get it to work.\n\nGraphics are technically better than they were on the PS2, but widescreen support is not built in, so if you are one of the normal PC users that have a 16:9 or 16:10 screen, you will have blackbars on the sides of the screen.  There is a mod to 'fix' this, but it basically just stretches the screen, so it looks awful.\n\nCapcom didn't try very hard on the PC version of this game, which is unfortunate, because it's one of the best DMC's.  Try Devil May Cry 4 or DMC, they have way better support, so they know how to do it right, just not wortgh their effort to fix this version I guess.\n\nTL;DR version - Great game, but badly ported.

(Also it's pretty challenging so, if you don't like handholding- this is the game for you)\n\nI've had and played this game for about 4 years now, and still love it dearly. (Although it only says 30 hours on Steam, I also played it a lot on PS3 later).\nBut recently I came to notice how low the Steam ratings for this game were, and I read through the reviews to see why.\nFrom what I've seen, it's all in regards to the port itself, which is understandable.\nI've personally never had a problem running the game on Steam (even without downloading patches or anything).\n\nThat said, I do think that the in-game references to the controls are complete jank, because they are based on a\nnumbering system for buttons that VERY unclear. This can be solved by a simple google search to see what each button\ndoes. I don't think the frame-rate is optimal (especially for a hack and slash) but it's not unplayable,\nI really didn't notice it all that much when I first got into the game, but only after I'd had my share of a variety\nof hack and slash games and really came to know the genre, did I notice the difference.\nI also never had a problem using a controller as the controller scheme menu is actually pretty easy to understand,\nalthough customization is a bit annoying.\n\nIn summary:\nI guess from my experience, I'd say the game is still worth is, especially during Steam Sales, assuming that you can run it.\nLike I said, it is a bit jank here and there, and it's not an excellent port by any means, but if you are looking to have a\nhack and slash game that's easy to run on most computers just to casually play whenever, this is the game for you.","February 25","true","31.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Wtf man? Ok - without checking forums (and I should never have to do that) it won't run in anything other than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ windowed mode. It's not designed to, or adapted to, 360 compatible joysticks which is pretty much the only stick anyone has. Sure you can reconfigure the joystick but you'll have to remember  what the hell button 4 or 7 or 2 is, and there's no guide or helpful hint so you're just left stabbing in the dark. The only way to get the game working properly (and i'm not sure that I can) is going to be if i go and check forum posts - that just shoudn't happen. It should work perfectly out of the box for the vast majority of setups. They haven't even tried. I should have known after the Ducktales affair (where Capcom released a game that they KNEW was fundamentally broken) that Capcom were going to butt♥♥♥♥ me on this one but like a fool I thought it couldn't be THAT bad. Boy was I wrong.\n\n\nBuy it if you want an example of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy a port can be. Otherwise avoid like the plague.\n\nEDIT: After checking the forums you can apparently edit the ini file to get the 360 controller working kindasorta but for some it doesn't work and too bad if you're not comfy with editing files like that.Then you need the styleswitcher mod to get the most of the game, And then, no matter how beastly your pc, there are a couple of points where there's really bad framerate drops due to *gasp* music playing. Once you get through all that...it's apparently not too bad.\n\nThe sad fact is that Capcom could and should easily release a patch that would fix the 360 controller problem. But they won't. Why? Because they are a pack of something that ryhmes with punts.\n\nSo still a big no go from me. And it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy another Capcom game.","May 15","false","0.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","2"

It strayed from the formula that made the first AWESOME! and Devil May Cry 3 came right back to it. With this port though you are definitely going to have to tweek the controls to match the playstation controller to the one on the PC but once you get past that headack, let the fun begin! I usually don't like overly challenging games but this series changed my mind for it. Who doesn't like hacking and slashing while jumping about and then BLAM! you whip out dual guns and start wailing on everything!?! This game wasn't just mindless shooting and slashing either, all the enemies had specific weakness that if you didn't exploit left you working twice as long and frantic to put them down. This game doesn't mind overwelming you either if you start to get careless and charge into the middle of a group of enemies because as bad as you are in this game, stupid dies quickly.

Yes, there's no denying that, but it's not THAT bad of a PC port.

However, this port is completely unacceptable. Japanese video game companies aren't exactly known for great first attempts at PC porting, and Capcom is no exception. They DID more than make up for it with DMC4 and DmC, with the PC ports being the superior versions of the game, but this is one I can't whole-heartedly recommend. If you picked up the DmC Complete Pack, you basically got this one for free, but since that bundle no longer seems to exist, I can't recommend this, especially not as a single purchase. Unless you're one of the PC Master Race and refuse to own even what is possibly the best console of all time, drop by a GameStop and pick this game up from a used games bin, for a better experience and a much more reasonable asking price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alucard86/recommended/6550/","alucard86","AlucarD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alucard86/","166 products in account","Let's have a look on one of Capcons most action loaded games Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening Special Edition for the PC.\n\nPlatform: PC\nPublisher: Ubisoft\nDeveloper: Capcom\nGenre: Fantasy Action Adventure\nRelease Date: Oct 16, 2006\n\nStory: The story so far plays earlier than the orginal Devil May Cry game for the PS2. Its's about the half devil Dante Sparda who tries once again to save the world from the influence of the devil possesed Arkham\nand his horde of undead creatures from hell. In this game there is also some very cool new character introduced named Vergil Sparda who is actually Dantes evil twinbrother and most fearsome foe.\nVirgil works together with Arkham in order to open the gate of hell which was closed long years ago by Dantes father the legandary Devil Knight Sparda. So Dante starts his journey to climb up the unholy tower of evil called "The Temen-Ni-Gru" which is summoned by Arkham in order to connect the human world to the demon world. On his way up he crosses lines with a strange woman called Lady who tries to shoot him on sight.\nThe whereabouts of the Temen-Ni-Gru as well as the identity of lady seem very dark and unclear. What the end offers... i can't tell, just play to find out :D 8/10\n\nGameplay: DMC3-Se is a third perspective fantasy action adventure which combines very fast gameplay with lots of combos and various puzzles throughout the game. The fighting system is devided in "styles" which\nDante can switch between Missions and also level them up to perform even greater combos. There are also special obiects called orbs to collect as well as a very great varaety of fire and melee weapons throughout the game. 8/10\n\nControls: This is one of the main problems with the PC version of DMC3-Se because its totally bugged and you need a patch in order to convert the right keyboard comands to some gamepad. 4/10\n\nGraphic: This is unfortunately another minus for the PC port as you will see some graphics in ingame arent drawn very correctly as the PS2 version and also some parts of the game seem pretty greyscale due to the direct X output of your PC, nevertheless the FMV movies are really great. 7/10\n\nSound: I have to mention that the sound is absoluty awesome. DMC3-Se brings some very good soundtrack and very nice soundsamples combined with very thrilling metal music. 9/10\nMy Review: First of all I have to say that I have played only the PC version of DMC3-Se hench I am writting this review for the PC version of that great game.\nThe game starts right of in Dantes office with one of the most impressive and action loaded FMV movies I saw so far. After the nice introducing of the control tutorial you are directly thrown into action to kick some demon butts. You will learn very fast the combos and special attacks if you play the first time through this game. Actually you can change between 4 styles called Trickster, Gunslinger, Royal Guard and Swordmaster. As the names describe, each style is bound to some very cool and unique special attack and combos. For example if you like using long range weapons than you can choose Gunslinger for improving your shoot abillities but if you prefer short range you can go along with Swordmaster. All in one I really liked the style system and the idea of combining different styles. So after you have killed tons of demons and alot of other evil guys you will be introduced step by step through very cool FMV movies to the story of this game which is in my opinion really great. The game is divided in 20 Missions, and you will come across some very cool and though bosses, one remarcable of them will be Dantes twinbrother Virgil who actually seems to interfere with Dante on purpose. The boss fights are one big plus in this game because they really deliever some thrilling and decent difficulty (at least if you play on very hard or Dante must die mode). What I really liked about this game is the character developement its really different from DMC2 which was... to put it bluntly "it sucked". I would generally say that the difficulty in this game is fair and really depends on what scale you play. I beat this game on hard mode in 9 hours but some other guys sure need between 15 - 20 hours. Also after beating the entire game you can unlock Vergil as a playable character, and this is included in the Special edition only as well as some other nice feature I will mention beneath.\n\nSo what are the differences between the original Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening and Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening Special Edition you may ask ?\n\nWell here they are:\nDifficulties:\n\n- Easy mode\n- Hard mode\n- Very Hard mode\n- Dante Must Die mode\n- Heaven or Hell mode\n\nPlayable Character:\n\n- "Vergil" is playable after beating the game once with Dante. He brings his own uniqe styles as well as flying swords as his long range weapons.\n\nExtra Mode:\n\n- "Bloody Palace" is available after beating the game once with Dante, its some kind of battle arena where you are thrown in with a limited supply of orbs and must fight random enemies and bosses.\n\nExtra Outfits:\n\n- 4 new costumes for Vergil unlockable\n- 6 new outfits for Dante unlockable\n\nGallery:\n\n-you can unlock diverse Artwork and CGI work form DMC3 here\n\nDemo Digest:\n\n- You can preview all Ingame Movies from here\n- There is also some timelimit in the end of the game where you can beat 100 enemies in order to unlock a hidden ending\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n- There are different locations in the game where you know can fight Jester (its that annoying clown BTW)\n- Lady wears some fency new suit depending on the outfit you choose in Ingame\n- There is a yellow and gold option at the beginning of the game which allows to use the yellow orbs as restore point after dieing.\nThese are the differences available in the Special Edition of DMC3 as well for the PS2 version as for the PC version which was only released as the Special edition by the way.\n\nFInal Words: DMC3 SE sure is some special game for fans of the Devil May Cry series as well as for action fans who like fast and flashy gamplay combined with metal music and gothic ambience. I was very pleased about the importation of this game to the PC and really forgot fast about the undeveloped control settings which is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ indeed for people who wants to play the PC version on a gamepad. All I can say is that you should stick with the PS2 version if you are a die hard fan of DMC as for me I also liked the PC version therefore I give this game a 7 out of 10.\n\nEndrating: 7/10","December 25, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It is a fun game but with some quite severe issues. I'm not convinced that it is enough fun to outweigh the problems. This is a very shoddy console port with the controller arbitrarily mapped to the keyboard without any thought about how it might play. You can remap them but you can't use the mouse. Eventually with help from the forums I managed to configure enough of the controls to a controller for it to be playable.

It is a fun game but with some quite severe issues. I'm not convinced that it is enough fun to outweigh the problems. This is a very shoddy console port with the controller arbitrarily mapped to the keyboard without any thought about how it might play. You can remap them but you can't use the mouse. Eventually with help from the forums I managed to configure enough of the controls to a controller for it to be playable.

Unfortunately however this port to the PC is an insult to this legendary game from its god awful controller layout where community members have to manually add their own layout fixes to this lazy port and along with that at  times crappy frame rate issues have occured regardless of how powerful my pc is. For those new to the series PLEASE do not buy this port! I highly recommened instead buying it either for the PS2 or the HD collection for the XBOX 360/PS3 to see how amazing this game really is.\n\nEDIT 16/01/15: A mod called "style switcher" for this PC port has literally fixed almost every issue completely, it makes the game look 10 times better with fog and gamma fixes, fixing the terrible controller button layout, 1080p support (making it sharper and more crisp than the HD collections DMC 3) and widescreen, even allowing you to switch styles with both Dante and Vergil just like in Devil May Cry 4!!!\nUnfortunately however the framerate issue still applies, but this can be fixed by removing a select amount of audio files (but that means less badassery during combat :c).\nIf you ever (though i'd still not recommend this crappy port) decide to get this PC port please mod it with the style switcher mod!","March 31, 2014","false","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Here are all the problems: no fullscreen, choppy music, terrible/nonexistent keyboard controls (you literally can't navigate the menu w/ a keyboard), and ONLY three crappy resolution options. Oh but we aren't done, there's more to this crapshoot. Once you do get a controller to play this game, you better hope you got a PS3 controller, otherwise you have to manually edit files in the game to get an Xbox 360 controller working--but guess what! This still won't solve the control problems! The camera controls are nearly nonexistent. R3 snaps the camera to Dante's back, sometimes. Terrain/walls/obstacles within a level will stop the camera in its tracks whether you're using R3 or the stick itself (which pans the camera at a snail's pace). In a notoriously difficult game, this is unacceptable since you will be getting attacked offscreen. Yeah, it only cost me a few dollars, but I'd have been better off using my money as fuel for a fire. Do yourself a favor and tell Capcom how unacceptable this is with your wallet by staying far away from this terrible experience.","July 5, 2014","false","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As of combat, it's 1 button to rule them all, why use anything besides your sword attack, if the only other attack you have is weak guns, only used for maintaining your combo, or your "style" attack, which does barely anything. And for those of you who say, "well this dante is better than the one in DMC", I do not see much difference, except that this dante in fact, does not even care about anything, his emotions feel faked, he's not even a prick, who is like "oh you stepped on my pizza, now I'm mad", but he's like "oh you stepped on my pizza, this party is gonna be good". What kind of response is that?\n\nAlso, even if you get a controller working, the spaces and invisible walls your camera has to deal with, make an overview of the battlefield impossible.\n\nFor once, I think an AAA sequel of a game has been better than the old ones.\n\nOh, something popped up in my mind, this game is made for square screen resolutions. You can press alt+enter to enter fullscreen mode, but if your pixels turn rectangly where they should be square, this is not an improvement.

Not only that, but they work just fine, so ignore the idiots that are too lazy to solve problems and just write an angry review after 10 minutes.\n\nAbout the actual game, the port has some problems with some lag in a few areas. It's not excessive lag that will affect gameplay, but it will slow down the game for a second. One spot I can think of off the top of my head is the area on Mission 7 where you have to jump down to enter the library. I noticed slightly more lag with Vergil, but again, it did not affect areas where I was actually fighting enemies. There are also fixes for the lag if it seems like it's actually affecting your gameplay, so again, if you plan on getting this game, take a couple minutes to look for some common questions and answers. It's a good game and you don't need a console to play it, so there's no point in throwing a hissy-fit when you encounter small problems with the port.\n\n\n\n","July 5, 2015","true","262.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

I love the Gold edition to play around as Vergil.  I love the music and, despite the games plot always being ridiculous and hammy, this is one of the better plots I could get invested in (though I haven't completed 4 yet so my opinion might change...."might" ).\n\n*clears throat* ...with that said; I love the game (on PS2 or PS3).  This port to the steam (currently) is NON-PLAYABLE (unless you PC players are truly experts on playing action games like this on a Keyboard and don't mind wearing out or breaking your keys).  So far, it doesn't matter what Gamepad you are using; I've tried the PC Microsoft Xbox controller and using a gamepad program to make my PS3 and PS2 controller work on my comptuer (and I have made it work for several games without problems INCLUDING some where I had to custom input the functions for each buttons)...but it is STILL UNPLAYABLE.  Most of the functionatlly still works; the sword/gun/jump/camera/taunt/tricks button can still be used properly and rearranged on the game's setup screen like normal,,,but the Analog sticks DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY.\n\nThat's the only real problem at this time (which is why I can't comment on anything else graphical or compatibile-wise because I'm stuck in level 1).  The left analog stick does NOT function at all for this game.  For some reason you have to move with the right stick; but even if THAT functioned correctly I don't think most players could play this game at all like this.  And it's STILL bad because the only thing you can do to move is either left or right (or just up or down).  Either way; you can NOT move properly to enjoy playing this port.\n\nI'm not officially ready to say this Port SUCKS, because I am REALLY hoping Valve/Steam team are getting feedback like this and tell them they need to fix/patch the control schemes if anyone is to ever play this port at all.  Otherwise; for now until they do so, Do NOT purchase this game unless you more of a game collector building up your library.\n\n(To note: I have read some of the Steam user's guides to set-up your gamepad controller for it to work properly and said they had success...but I've tried and retried several times and I don't think the Game itself will register it at all, only keeping to what it's currently control functions are...which is crap.  Also, the port does come with a Gamepad Config that will NOT RECOGNIZE the Xbox controller...it recognized my PS controller, but nothing was accomplished as I hoped.  Plus, there is a option to switch/Reverse the L and R analog sticks...but it didn't do anything at all! ).","November 27, 2013","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love the Gold edition to play around as Vergil.  I love the music and, despite the games plot always being ridiculous and hammy, this is one of the better plots I could get invested in (though I haven't completed 4 yet so my opinion might change...."might" ).\n\n*clears throat* ...with that said; I love the game (on PS2 or PS3).  This port to the steam (currently) is NON-PLAYABLE (unless you PC players are truly experts on playing action games like this on a Keyboard and don't mind wearing out or breaking your keys).  So far, it doesn't matter what Gamepad you are using; I've tried the PC Microsoft Xbox controller and using a gamepad program to make my PS3 and PS2 controller work on my comptuer (and I have made it work for several games without problems INCLUDING some where I had to custom input the functions for each buttons)...but it is STILL UNPLAYABLE.  Most of the functionatlly still works; the sword/gun/jump/camera/taunt/tricks button can still be used properly and rearranged on the game's setup screen like normal,,,but the Analog sticks DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY.\n\nThat's the only real problem at this time (which is why I can't comment on anything else graphical or compatibile-wise because I'm stuck in level 1).  The left analog stick does NOT function at all for this game.  For some reason you have to move with the right stick; but even if THAT functioned correctly I don't think most players could play this game at all like this.  And it's STILL bad because the only thing you can do to move is either left or right (or just up or down).  Either way; you can NOT move properly to enjoy playing this port.\n\nI'm not officially ready to say this Port SUCKS, because I am REALLY hoping Valve/Steam team are getting feedback like this and tell them they need to fix/patch the control schemes if anyone is to ever play this port at all.  Otherwise; for now until they do so, Do NOT purchase this game unless you more of a game collector building up your library.\n\n(To note: I have read some of the Steam user's guides to set-up your gamepad controller for it to work properly and said they had success...but I've tried and retried several times and I don't think the Game itself will register it at all, only keeping to what it's currently control functions are...which is crap.  Also, the port does come with a Gamepad Config that will NOT RECOGNIZE the Xbox controller...it recognized my PS controller, but nothing was accomplished as I hoped.  Plus, there is a option to switch/Reverse the L and R analog sticks...but it didn't do anything at all! ).","November 27, 2013","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Framerate hovers around 30 at the best of times -- other versions maintain a stable 60 -- and this can drop when certain enemies appear. I've heard this is something to do with the music files, but I shouldn't have to fart around with deleting or renaming files just to get a game to run as it was supposed to.\n\nGameplay-wise though, DMC3 has a massive and in-depth combat system that includes lots of small details -- and even lets you do things that were in cutscenes! Not every thing from every cutscene, but a considerable amount of them are indeed doable. Dante handles rather well, and although the Style System is a little limited in this game compared to Devil May Cry 4, the time lapse between the two - enough for Dante to go from cocky, though out of his depth straight through to a marvelous drunken uncle who quite frankly has zero f**ks to give - can be seen as a handwave from the technical reasons for limiting the Style system as such.\n\nMy advice? Skip this version, and either get the original PS2 version of the Special Edition, or if you're running a PS3 or 360 in HD, just get the HD Collection. If you get the HD Collection and you're running in SD, you may have some audio synch problems during cutscenes. Also, get DMC4's PC version. Don't let the Games for Windows Live fool you, it's the best version by a long shot, including unique content.","June 19, 2014","false","7.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Very badly made without thinking from the perspective of the PC player control ergonomics either using keyboard or gamepad.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe graphics are typical of the older Play Station games (think of Resident Evil 2 and 3, except that background buildings are also in 3D). It's dated for 2015, but nothing sinful from when it was originally released.\n\nBut the sinful thing in here is that there is no fullscreen mode. It can only be viewed in windowed mode. Max resolution is at 1600x1200. (Even DOS games has fullscreen).\n\nSOUND\nIt's ok. From the intro to the rock tunes of the (in-game) broken jukebox, it does fine. Positional audio was not used.\n\nCONTROLS\nIt's a bad port mainly because the control scheme is unbearably bad... keyboard or XBox controller.\n\nWith the keyboard, you can configure the key map. The problem with using the keyboard is that [Jump] is reflected as [Style Action]. Pressing [Style Action] is still [Style Action]. I can't make Dante jump.\n\nButtons can also be configured with the XBox controller... except for the directional movement which is unfortunately placed to the Right analog stick. Forget about no rumble feature. I just want to move the character properly, which I can't.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIt has a lot of potential and I can feel that this could have been a good game. Camera control poorly done as well, though. I can only reset the camera view to it's default location. I can't do anything else with it.\n\nOVERALL\nI can't even play it, so I can't recommend it at all. The DMC franchise has gone a long way, but unless they've made the controls better, it is probably best to play the older parts of the franchise in the console rather than the PC.","December 24, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I had the special edition on the ps 2 about 9 years ago, and i loved it like a small angel that fell from heaven.\n\nThis port, however, is a worthless, broken and disgraceful sham.  If you've got a console, get the Devil May Cry HD edition instead.  If, like me, your a solo pc gamer, there's no way to get the full goodness of this game, even with all the mods.\n\nFirst, the controls are broken.  You can kind of get it to work with mods, but as far as i'm aware you can't get the shoulder buttons (lt and rt) to work, and you actually need them.  I also couldn't get my second analog stick to work the camera, which makes the game most unenjoyable as you can't adjust the camera manually.  I could kind of deal with that, but...\n\nThe framerate is awful.  This is a 2005 ps2 game which stutters and grinds down to abysmal rates on a PC that easily handles Skyrim.  You can fix it by deleting select audion files, apparantly, but left with the choice of losing audio or tolerating a crappy framerate, i choose to just uninstall it and leave my memories untarnished.\n\nIf you've got a console, get the HD collection. You might also want to try Devil May Cry 4, which is a much better and all round pretty sweet PC port (though sadly an inferior game),  If you get this on pc, be aware that you are buying a woefully grim port of classic.","April 1, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you're willing to put in the time to find a work around the game is still intact and fun, but if you aren't willing to track down the fixes you might want to just play it on an old PS2 or buy the current potato version that's out there.

I played it over and over and over again when I originally bought it back in the day. So when I saw it on Steam I was stoked. This port though. Seriously, this port is bad. You have to change .ini files to even try to make an xbox controller work for it and to get the resolution to something decenet. And even then it doesn't always work. If you're willing to put in the time to find a work around the game is still intact and fun, but if you aren't willing to track down the fixes you might want to just play it on an old PS2 or buy the current potato version that's out there. Because this is awful. Seriously, why map movement to the right stick and not make that something that you can alter. It's not even an option in the .ini file. That's just stupid.

The default setting controls make no sense whatsoever - jumping is NOT the A button, and the camera is your left control stick and movement is the right control stick, making it ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to control anything. Then even if you go try to change the controls, your not allowed to switch the two sticks, and you have to take half an hour to decode their labelling system of the ♥♥♥♥ing buttons - instead of using the universally accepted A, B, X, Y, or any of the buttons from any other commonly used controller, their buttons are labelled 1 to 11. And since your not allowed to use the triggers on the controller, theres only 10 buttons on the ♥♥♥♥ing controller, so I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ button 11 is.

The combat system is one of the deepest in any game, and it ranks you on how well you can perform combos. It has a lot of unlockables, including Vergil as a playable character, so there is also a lot of replay value in the game.\n\nUnfortunately, though, the PC port is horrible, one of the worst ever made. The game was released back in 2006 on PC's and it still gives even some of the higher end PC's performance issues. The reason behind the poor performance is the music of all things. The game also lacks controller support, so you're forced to use the keyboard and mouse to play the game. There is a survival guide thread that tells you how to fix the problems, but there are a few third party downloads that have to be made, and even then, success isn't guaranteed for everyone.\n\nIn the end, the game is just a very poor port of an otherwise amazing game. If you are interested in the game, buy either the original version of the game on the PlayStation 2, or the Devil May Cry HD Collection on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Those have none of the issues that the PC version has.","September 12, 2015","false","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even RE4 received a decent pre-RE4HD port, so I don't know what went wrong here.\n\nChances are that you probably have a 360 or PS3 around.

The story is still good, and the game itself is as enchanting as the console versions - but the partial controller support is a big pain in the butt.\n\nNot to mention all of the mods you would need to download, figure out, and install just to put it on the same level as Devil May Cry 4 in terms of playability.\n\nAll in all, a great game bogged down by poor redesign and an incomplete transition to modern PCs. If you don't have the patience for mods - and unless someone has the kindness and time to put together everything into one, easy-to-handle package - you're better off with the console versions.","June 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is still one of my favorite action games to date, and the gameplay is still challenging.  However, you will have to do some work if you want it to work.\n\nIt's made even more dynamic with the ability to expand on Virgil and switch styles on the fly (using mods).\n\nFor those who have never played a Devil May Cry title, this is arguably the best of them all.  Though there's options to start on Easy, the game can become extremely challenging.  Once you clear one difficulty, the next one is unlocked.  The hardest difficulty gets extremely hard with more enemies in each level, faster enemies that deal more damage, bosses with fatal (or near) attacks, and if you don't clear enemies quickly, the become much harder to kill.\n\nI think this is one of Capcom's best titles, even though the voice-acting and cutscenes are corny.  Controller extremely highly recommended.","January 26","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapgamejotaro/recommended/6550/","rapgamejotaro","DJ_Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapgamejotaro/","336 products in account","Let's get this party started! Devil May Cry 3 is the best. It just is. With a charming cast of supporting characters, Dante at his best, both gameplay and personality wise, as well as the best music, enviroments, enemy design, and bosses, weapon selection, and extra content of the series, I cannot tell you how much I love this game, but  I can say it is a lot. So much feels connected and satisfying, and the game just has so many satisfying moments it's enough to make me sweat more than anything else does.\nShamefully however, Ubisoft ported this and they did a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job too. No widescreen support is lame, really bad controller support is ♥♥♥♥ing awful and actually manages to make DS3 bluescreen somehow. And the cutscene quality is pretty dissapointing too,  but thankfully most of this can be fixed.\nNow I can get on to the good stuff though. Dante's gameplay just feels great because he not only has the abilities to bring interesting stuff to the table, but enemies that flow around them. If there's something that feels awkward to fight, it's because you aren't thinking outside the box yet.  DT explosion is an okay mechanic too, I like it better than "DT improves style moves", but it's just filler most of the time I think.\nThe bosses in this are really cool too, Nevan in particular is a favourite of mine, not due to her sexuality, but due to the fact that she really compliments Dante in her scenes, if only one boss could become a Devil Arm, it should be her. The other bosses are pretty cool too, with Cerberus' great music and Dante's cheeky one liners at him, those twin swords guys making for an interesting fight that forces you to think of it as a double boss; as well as the Vergil and Jester fights that gradually get harder and more interesting as the game goes on, which make for a very cool REAL final boss fight, although fighting side by side with a certain character for that one boss was cool too. I also really like how while Dante tends to be an overzealous cocky badass, he does understand what it means to actually be human and actually shows emotion as well, which is good, since Lady is a great receptor for these feelings, as well as an attractive character style, sexually, and personality wise. I also do like Vergil's conviction and dedication to his personal creed as well. Arkham and Jester are also very cool as well!  Another thing I really like is how powerful styles get to be at level 3, it really makes you feel powerful with whatever you choose, but you also don't feel dependent on them, with the strong weapons and guns as well.\nPlaying as Vergil is also pretty cool, although I must admit he feels a bit too eh for me. I also like the ability to pick whatever level of Bloody Palace you want to go to, it's just neat, but I wish there was a boss rush mode sometimes.\nAlso have to say the credits sequence is a HUGE turn on, ♥♥♥♥ I love playable credits.\n\nOne hell of a party!/10","October 27, 2013","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapgamejotaro/recommended/6550/","rapgamejotaro","DJ_Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapgamejotaro/","336 products in account","Let's get this party started! Devil May Cry 3 is the best. It just is. With a charming cast of supporting characters, Dante at his best, both gameplay and personality wise, as well as the best music, enviroments, enemy design, and bosses, weapon selection, and extra content of the series, I cannot tell you how much I love this game, but  I can say it is a lot. So much feels connected and satisfying, and the game just has so many satisfying moments it's enough to make me sweat more than anything else does.\nShamefully however, Ubisoft ported this and they did a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job too. No widescreen support is lame, really bad controller support is ♥♥♥♥ing awful and actually manages to make DS3 bluescreen somehow. And the cutscene quality is pretty dissapointing too,  but thankfully most of this can be fixed.\nNow I can get on to the good stuff though. Dante's gameplay just feels great because he not only has the abilities to bring interesting stuff to the table, but enemies that flow around them. If there's something that feels awkward to fight, it's because you aren't thinking outside the box yet.  DT explosion is an okay mechanic too, I like it better than "DT improves style moves", but it's just filler most of the time I think.\nThe bosses in this are really cool too, Nevan in particular is a favourite of mine, not due to her sexuality, but due to the fact that she really compliments Dante in her scenes, if only one boss could become a Devil Arm, it should be her. The other bosses are pretty cool too, with Cerberus' great music and Dante's cheeky one liners at him, those twin swords guys making for an interesting fight that forces you to think of it as a double boss; as well as the Vergil and Jester fights that gradually get harder and more interesting as the game goes on, which make for a very cool REAL final boss fight, although fighting side by side with a certain character for that one boss was cool too. I also really like how while Dante tends to be an overzealous cocky badass, he does understand what it means to actually be human and actually shows emotion as well, which is good, since Lady is a great receptor for these feelings, as well as an attractive character style, sexually, and personality wise. I also do like Vergil's conviction and dedication to his personal creed as well. Arkham and Jester are also very cool as well!  Another thing I really like is how powerful styles get to be at level 3, it really makes you feel powerful with whatever you choose, but you also don't feel dependent on them, with the strong weapons and guns as well.\nPlaying as Vergil is also pretty cool, although I must admit he feels a bit too eh for me. I also like the ability to pick whatever level of Bloody Palace you want to go to, it's just neat, but I wish there was a boss rush mode sometimes.\nAlso have to say the credits sequence is a HUGE turn on, ♥♥♥♥ I love playable credits.\n\nOne hell of a party!/10","October 27, 2013","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Well look no further, this game offers both of these things. Even on Normal mode.\n\nIt's ridiculous on how hard this game. So combat wise it's a pretty fun game but it has some problems.\n\nThe weapons have few moveset in the start and buying upgrades for them on the first run is pretty hard. Grinding souls just isn't an option on Normal mode either in my opinion. So it's best to stick with a weapon and that would most likely be Rebellion.\nFor the styles it's pretty much Swordmaster that you need. You can hit enemies in the air then because you'll always do a downward thrust. Later on you might use Doppleganger though because it can double your power on stunned bosses. Which is nice.\n\nFor items you need to be aware of one thing. The price goes up when you buy one. It goes up a lot. Using an item and continuing a stage makes you lose the item and start over the last checkpoint. Keep that in mind when fighting bosses.\n\n\nAs for getting the game to work. It ran fine on my system and my PS2 gamepad worked just fine with the game. But if you have a 360 gamepad you might need to look up on a fix.\n\nBut honestly, I'd pick up Devil May Cry 4 instead as the controls are better that time around.

If you're a seasoned DMC veteram who's gone through Heaven and Hell unscathed, it could be an interesting new playstyle that lets you suck at and eventually master the game all over again.

Pulling off stylish combos is an absolute delight in these kind of games. If you're inexperienced i would recommend devil may cry 4 first, as DMC 4 will actually tell you which buttons to press to achieve combos (and Dante has nearly identical controls)\n\nits cheap and its brilliant, i'd recommend it under that context of my review","January 2, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are very easy workarounds to get the resolution you want, and to fix the gamepad controls.\n\nI never really got a chance to play this game on the PS2, since it didn't seem like a game I would really be interested in, however after a few years of being released on PC, it caught my attention, most noticeably, it's really, really high rating, and I thought to myself, is this game really that good? Short answer: YES.\n\nBack in 2007 (with a 2004 Packard Bell PC) I was just glad I was running the game, I was new to PC gaming, so I didn't really have a clue what to expect. The visuals weren't really impressive, especially in 640x480 resolution, but I did manage to get it to full screen and a slightly higher res. The main problem was the keyboard controls, they were very unusual at first, and the game also was probably the hardest one I had played to date on PC (mind you, it was probably only the 10th game I played on PC) Just the second mission boss was owning me again and again, and probably went the same way about 10 more times before, I got fed up and stopped playing, and this was on normal difficulty.\n\nA few days later picked it up again and started playing, this time I somehow managed to scrape by the first boss, and off I went, one of the best games I have ever played, and also gave me the mentality to never give up on a hard game, it's always more satisfying when the game is hard, unlike DmC. DMC 3 truly is an epic game, with cheesy (but funny) one liners and whole load of awesome action, the cinematics are awesomely done, the storyline (though confusing at times) is awesome.\n\nIt really disappoints me that there hasn't been a true continuation of the DMC storyline, even in DMC 4, the main focus was not on Dante. But I am getting ahead of myself, and there are spoilers if I keep going on, and someone is still yet to play DMC 4, so I'll just stop here.\n\nNow that I have the game on steam, I had a few problems with the controls again, but this time for the gamepad, I was already used to the keyboard controls, since I played through this game before, and I also wanted to play it in 1080p this time, and with the help of the Steam community and a few mods, I got it to run as I wanted it to both the resolution and the gamepad, except for the quick weapon switches the triggers on the 360 controller are the only buttons that don't respond, it doesn't bother me much since my favourite weapons are the default ones anyway, Rebellion is just too good, and Ebony and Ivory are just the trademark guns you can't go anywhere without them. Besides that, the game looks better than ever, and I would definitely recommend you get this game, especially in a sale, since they didn't really do a good job on the port. Trust me the extra work will be completely worth your time, I wasn't into these kinds of games before, but this game just got me hooked to the DMC story.","December 24, 2014","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This version is a direct 1:1 port of the console version and is impossible to play. I have tried every gamepad config option through both the game's choices and MotioninJoy's emulated controllers and none of them work properly. Either the buttons refuse to map in game, axis' are reversed/swapped, or the controller just isn't reconized. I have a PS3 controller and it works with every other gamepad game I've played before. Yes, keyboard controls are technically possible but ridiculously cumbersome considering the control scheme.\n\nEven if my gamepad worked, the game starts off windowed and max rez on my 1920x1080 monitor is 1280x960, with all other options being 4:3 and no widescreen support. All cutscenes are heavily compressed and look significantly worse than the console versions. Actual gameplay looks better but considering that I can't play it kind of ruins the experience.\n\nPick this up on PS2 or use an emu instead because this is unplayable.","January 18, 2013","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

(I'd recommend XPadder if you really need the gamepad controls.)\nTheres also this weapon changing from the pause menu, why not during ingame for blazing the ♥♥♥♥ out of the combo'ing? (though this is possible in DMC4, but whatever.)\n\nRating: 7 / 10\n\nPros: Obvious gameplay is obvious, lots of weapons to use, a ♥♥♥♥ing guitar as a weapon (holy ♥♥♥♥),\nDevil Triggers are game changers to cause more mayhem.\n\nCons: Problems with gamepad, Weapon switching should've been ingame instead of in the pause menu.","January 28, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Also here is the general guidelines on how to fix your controller:\n\n1, the top line is your device name in Windows.  For Win 8.1, you need to go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers, then right click on your gamepad and select "Game controller settings".  Put whatever name that comes up for your controller inside [].\n2, the numbers for the button is exactly the name of the button minus 1. For example, the A button for my Razer Sabortooth Elite shows up as button 1, so 1 - 1 = 0, thus map "0" to the cross or X button.  You can ID the buttons within Properties > Test from the "Game controller settings."\n3, L and R trigger and the guide button need to be map with AntiMacro as mentioned above.\n4, L<->R is to swap the left and right stick, which needs to be enabled with a 1 for the Sabertooth Elite (0 to disable).\n5, the mapping was based on the PS2 verion of the controls, so change them to your linking in the config file for custom mapping.

While DMC4 is easier to get into, and more polished in both the gameplay and graphics department - it's no reason to overlook this game. DMC3 is arguably more difficult, and boasts a larger total weapon set along with what is in my opinion a much better setting and theme (very much Castlevania esque). In DMC3:SE you are also granted the ability to play as Dante's twin brother Vergil, who presents a very different and equally fun playstyle. There are also more total styles available for Dante, including Quicksilver (slow time) and Doppleganger (second Dante that repeats moves you do)\n\nFast paced combat filled with many combos and mechanics, along with a sizable amount of content and replayability, it makes for an overall fun experience that gets better as you do.\n\nMy only problem is the fact that the base port is very poorly done. KB&M controls are quite awful, and game performance has a tendency to drop even on a powerful rig for seemingly no reason (I mean, it's a PS2 era game on modern hardware).\n\nRegardless, highly recommended for fans of action and fighting games.

I strongly recommend using a 360 controller of some gamepad. You do unfortuantly have to mod the game by changling the controller script to make the triggers work. But after that it's solid. it's the special edition version so you get a few extra not seen in the original ps2 version. I would reccomend the console hd collection over this. but if a pc is all you got then this isn't a bad place to start in the Devil May Cry Series.","December 2, 2013","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This version is a direct 1:1 port of the console version and is impossible to play. I have tried every gamepad config option through both the game's choices and MotioninJoy's emulated controllers and none of them work properly. Either the buttons refuse to map in game, axis' are reversed/swapped, or the controller just isn't reconized. I have a PS3 controller and it works with every other gamepad game I've played before. Yes, keyboard controls are technically possible but ridiculously cumbersome considering the control scheme.\n\nEven if my gamepad worked, the game starts off windowed and max rez on my 1920x1080 monitor is 1280x960, with all other options being 4:3 and no widescreen support. All cutscenes are heavily compressed and look significantly worse than the console versions. Actual gameplay looks better but considering that I can't play it kind of ruins the experience.\n\nPick this up on PS2 or use an emu instead because this is unplayable.","January 18, 2013","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

While DMC4 is easier to get into, and more polished in both the gameplay and graphics department - it's no reason to overlook this game. DMC3 is arguably more difficult, and boasts a larger total weapon set along with what is in my opinion a much better setting and theme (very much Castlevania esque). In DMC3:SE you are also granted the ability to play as Dante's twin brother Vergil, who presents a very different and equally fun playstyle. There are also more total styles available for Dante, including Quicksilver (slow time) and Doppleganger (second Dante that repeats moves you do)\n\nFast paced combat filled with many combos and mechanics, along with a sizable amount of content and replayability, it makes for an overall fun experience that gets better as you do.\n\nMy only problem is the fact that the base port is very poorly done. KB&M controls are quite awful, and game performance has a tendency to drop even on a powerful rig for seemingly no reason (I mean, it's a PS2 era game on modern hardware).\n\nRegardless, highly recommended for fans of action and fighting games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/recommended/6550/","lightbringerid","Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/","83 products in account","Let me start this review by saying I didn't play this game anywhere near launch (started only recently), and have had very little experience with the Devil May Cry series before I started playing this game. I did have experience playing God of War, Ninja Gaiden Sigma and the like before however, so I'm familiar with the Hack & Slash genre.\n\nWith that said, here is my review. You're free to disagree with my points (I'd be more glad if you did agree though :)) as this is my personal opinion.\n\nFirst of all, the story. I kinda liked it, although it wasn't unusually gripping or emotional.  I don't want to spoil anything to people who haven't played it yet, but I will say that thanks to Dante's entertaining persona, the memorable bosses, and a few nice plot twists I didn't expect, it's one of the better plots for this type of game I came across. 7/10\n\nThe gameplay. This game has the best combat I've ever seen in this type of game, with great flow, especially on Turbo mode. Trying out different load-outs (there are plenty of combinations of arms, and most weapons are unique and fun to use) and styles (essentially a selectable special move to go along with your weapons) is addicting, and enemies (bosses in particular) are varied and require different strategies rather than repetitive mashing or QTEs to beat (looking at you, God of War).\nExploration and puzzles were a bit too simplistic for me most of the time, but helped make this game feel more like a grand adventure than a static arena.\nThe controls in the game however are problematic. While I've got them to work perfectly with my Logitech F310 (in D-Input mode) and Net Way PS3/PC Gamepad, This game doesn't support Xbox 360 and One controllers without some tweaking, so I recommend having an older, Direct-Input controller to play with as Keyboards aren't optimal for this type of game. 10/10 (with a gamepad, otherwise 6. yeah, it's that important)\n\nThe graphics of the game are showing their age; it is a relatively old game, and doesn't support high resolutions. Also, the graphics of this version are inferior to the PS2 and HD Collection versions as some of the more advanced lighting and shadowing effects are missing, and there is some very mild lag in some areas. The game is still perfectly fun and playable with these faults, but it's still something to keep in mind though if you care a lot about visuals. The character and environment designs however were pretty good for their time, and still have a bit of charm, even today. (7/10)\n\nThe music here is a mixed bag: I'm not a fan of the heavy-metal esque battle themes, although they fit the setting of the game. The rest of the music, like ambient sounds and effects are immersive however, and the goddess statue and final boss themes were very nice IMO. (6.5/10, although if you like the battle themes you might give an 8 or a 9)\n\nFinally replayability. This game isn't very long (about 12 hours for my first playthrough) but has immense replay value, with a lot of harder difficulty levels to unlock and test your skills with, an alternate playable character with unique weapons (Vergil), the ability to carry your upgrades and items from playthrough to playthrough, and the Bloody Palace, an arena with near endless battles, this game can keep you busy for a very long time if you want to master it. 10/10.\n\nVerdict: DMC3 SE is a fantastic game, with a ton of replay value. If you have a gamepad and don't mind a minor graphical downgrade, this is a solid reccomendation. If you're with a keyboard though or want the best graphics available, I'd recommend getting the PS2 version/HD remake if you can. Even if you can't, there's still a very solid game here. (No final score, as there are too many variables depending on your hardware and everyone has their own priorities in games. I only try to advise.

Hammy, trite dialogue, a plot that is skin deep and a protagonist that is a grade A ♥♥♥♥♥♥-bag... it's definitely not your regular AAA game. Still it has it's charm, and despite a couple of really terribly designed bosses, is a good but fair challenge. It has high action, hack and slash elements with a nice levelling and point system that keeps you coming back for more.\n\nThe PC port is terrible, a true travesty. However, follow the guides an this can be running in 1920 x 1080, with an xbox controller without a hitch. It's a shame that the community is left to fixed this travesty, but when it's on a good deal I would still recommend purchasing it for nostalgia or a good Sunday afternoon fun.\n\nBack to the game, several professional reviews said the game world was massive... Don't be fooled, after about midway most of the game is just level revisits with something slightly altered. The game feels big enough, but is no Dark souls in scope.\n\n7/10","October 4, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no question about that. However, with some tweaking you can get this game in playable form. There is a mod for the game called, the "Style Switcher" that enhances the game greatly with HD richness. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get this mod to work and it's a long process of steps. The good news is that I was able to get the xbox controller working and the game playable at full screen without implementing the "Style Switcher" mod. Sadly, I'm missing out on HD enhancements. Instead DMC3 is displayed more in tune with it's PS2 counterpart. That means some jaggies even at a higher resolution. Still, the game is totally playable you just have to make a few edits, which are all explained in the DMC3 community guides section here on Steam.\n\nI played the original on PS2 and skipped out on DMC2 because I read lackruster things about it. DMC3 is a prequel to the original so really nothing is missed. DMC3 is a stylish-high action-combo masher- adventure title. It's a huge step up from the original (which was very enjoyable) and perhaps from DMC 2 (so I've heard).\n\nDespite negative reviews here on Steam I'm going to go ahead and recommend the steam version of DMC3. I would highly suggest NOT purchasing it for $19.99 and wait for the game to go on sale. That's exactly what I did. Just be prepared to make some edits in the game's files, which is a very easy process. I wish I could say the same about the "Style Switcher" mod. That will require some patience and possibily some trials of errors.\n\nDMC3 is well praised from both critics and fans as being the best entry in the DMC series. Don't miss it as it's a great game just wait for a sale!","October 4, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did have experience playing God of War, Ninja Gaiden Sigma and the like before however, so I'm familiar with the Hack & Slash genre.\n\nWith that said, here is my review. You're free to disagree with my points (I'd be more glad if you did agree though :)) as this is my personal opinion.\n\nFirst of all, the story. I kinda liked it, although it wasn't unusually gripping or emotional.  I don't want to spoil anything to people who haven't played it yet, but I will say that thanks to Dante's entertaining persona, the memorable bosses, and a few nice plot twists I didn't expect, it's one of the better plots for this type of game I came across. 7/10\n\nThe gameplay. This game has the best combat I've ever seen in this type of game, with great flow, especially on Turbo mode. Trying out different load-outs (there are plenty of combinations of arms, and most weapons are unique and fun to use) and styles (essentially a selectable special move to go along with your weapons) is addicting, and enemies (bosses in particular) are varied and require different strategies rather than repetitive mashing or QTEs to beat (looking at you, God of War).\nExploration and puzzles were a bit too simplistic for me most of the time, but helped make this game feel more like a grand adventure than a static arena.\nThe controls in the game however are problematic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jplc/recommended/6550/","jplc","JPLC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jplc/","128 products in account","One of the best video games of the character action genre, one of the best shallow popcorn action movies you'll ever watch, and the true "start" of the Devil May Cry series as far as I'm concerned (and I don't mean chronologically, though it is also the earliest game canon-wise). I've played this game many times over the years on the original PS2 and in its HD re-release on PS3. I've loved it each and every time and I still love it now.\n\nThings you should know about this PC port: Yes, it's a shoddy port, but no, the PC version in its mod-less state is NOT unplayable. You just need to muck around a bit and you'll be fine with the game as-is (though the game will still run at much less than the natural 60 fps sometimes without mods, but it's still very playable under 60). (EDIT: Looks like after installing the K-Lite Codec Pack Mega and its Updates that I mention later on in this review, the number of drops in the framerate have reduced quite a bit. I guess the issue was tied to system codecs somehow. END EDIT)\n\nSome tips to get it running without mods:\n\n- Run the gamepad setup app that comes with the game before playing if you want to use a gamepad (and for a game like DMC3 that was designed with a gamepad in mind, you REALLY should). You'll need to disconnect any XInput gamepads (like an Xbox 360 gamepad) before using the setup app or playing the game; this game was made before XInput, so it's just not supported properly and will argue about it if it's still connected. What WILL work is a DInput (Direct Input) gamepad. I personally find that a DualShock 4 works perfectly (make sure you disable any background programs that will make the DS4 emulate a 360 gamepad). Edit the bindings in the app as you see fit, click the Save button multiple times until you see the "saved" popup, exit the app via its Exit button, and your gamepad should be good to go.\n\n- The game might crash during the opening pre-rendered videos due to possible codec incompatibilities. If you encounter this, downloading and installing a codec pack for your PC might fix this. I personally recommend the K-Lite Codec Pack Mega (if you choose this, don't forget to also download and install the separate Update app on the K-Lite Codec Pack website after downloading and installing the K-Lite Codec Pack).\n\n- The game might display strange resolutions in the Options (like 0x0) if you have a multiple monitor setup going. Unfortunate, I know, but that's why it's a shoddy port. Switching to only 1 monitor output before playing is best to choose the resolution you want. After choosing the desired resolution and making a save file, any time you start the game after, it will remember the resolution you chose, even if you re-enable multiple monitors and it goes back to displaying strange resolution in the Options.\n\n- The game will start windowed by default. To go back and forth between fullscreen, make sure the window has focus and hit Alt+Enter (it will unfortunately sometimes crash when doing this; I find it's safest to do it while you're in the Options menu).\n\n- The game was made in the era of 4:3 televisions (after all, it was a PS2 game first and foremost), so all offered resolutions will be in 4:3. If you are going to fullscreen, make sure your display uses the correct aspect ratio to avoid a stretched image (personally, I have to use my separate graphics card settings app to switch from scaling by aspect ratio to scaling by fullscreen, and then I have to set my actual display's settings to output in 4:3, though the specifics may vary depending on your setup).\n\n- There's no "Exit Game" option in the game, so to exit, you have to exit fullscreen and hit the window's close button to close it. When you do, THEN you'll actually get a "Quit Game" choice in-game. Choose "Yes" to close.\n\n- There can be quite a bit of screen tearing at times. However, the game DOES technically support V-sync. To enable it, however, you'll have to do it from your separate graphics card settings app.\n\nSo yeah, it IS a shoddy port, but the game without mods is still very much playable if you're willing to put in a bit of elbow grease for this old title. I'd say it's worth it, though; this game is a hell of a ride and a hell of a gem! And hell, you can still use the mods too if you want after all this, why not =p","May 20, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As for the controls, seriously guys, as many people posting about how the XBox controller won't work there are still people who continue to say so. Rather than complaining, go out and get a Logitech controller, adjust the controls with the gamepad application in the main file, and you're set to go. It's like playing on your PS2 all over again. But aside from some graphical errors, the game is still as great as it was when it first came out. Using an emulator takes too much time, what with finding all the files you need or having to actually purchase the game CD from one of the few small town stores that sell old and retro games/consoles. In my opinion it is better to just buy it on here, and spend a little bit of money for a simple Logitech controller. Or if you're too lazy to edit controls or get a controller, find a store that sells old PS2 games and consoles. 10/10 Will CONTINUE to play.","June 21, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no question about that. However, with some tweaking you can get this game in playable form. There is a mod for the game called, the "Style Switcher" that enhances the game greatly with HD richness. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get this mod to work and it's a long process of steps. The good news is that I was able to get the xbox controller working and the game playable at full screen without implementing the "Style Switcher" mod. Sadly, I'm missing out on HD enhancements. Instead DMC3 is displayed more in tune with it's PS2 counterpart. That means some jaggies even at a higher resolution. Still, the game is totally playable you just have to make a few edits, which are all explained in the DMC3 community guides section here on Steam.\n\nI played the original on PS2 and skipped out on DMC2 because I read lackruster things about it. DMC3 is a prequel to the original so really nothing is missed. DMC3 is a stylish-high action-combo masher- adventure title. It's a huge step up from the original (which was very enjoyable) and perhaps from DMC 2 (so I've heard).\n\nDespite negative reviews here on Steam I'm going to go ahead and recommend the steam version of DMC3. I would highly suggest NOT purchasing it for $19.99 and wait for the game to go on sale. That's exactly what I did. Just be prepared to make some edits in the game's files, which is a very easy process. I wish I could say the same about the "Style Switcher" mod. That will require some patience and possibily some trials of errors.\n\nDMC3 is well praised from both critics and fans as being the best entry in the DMC series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/recommended/6550/","lightbringerid","Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/","83 products in account","Let me start this review by saying I didn't play this game anywhere near launch (started only recently), and have had very little experience with the Devil May Cry series before I started playing this game. I did have experience playing God of War, Ninja Gaiden Sigma and the like before however, so I'm familiar with the Hack & Slash genre.\n\nWith that said, here is my review. You're free to disagree with my points (I'd be more glad if you did agree though :)) as this is my personal opinion.\n\nFirst of all, the story. I kinda liked it, although it wasn't unusually gripping or emotional.  I don't want to spoil anything to people who haven't played it yet, but I will say that thanks to Dante's entertaining persona, the memorable bosses, and a few nice plot twists I didn't expect, it's one of the better plots for this type of game I came across. 7/10\n\nThe gameplay. This game has the best combat I've ever seen in this type of game, with great flow, especially on Turbo mode. Trying out different load-outs (there are plenty of combinations of arms, and most weapons are unique and fun to use) and styles (essentially a selectable special move to go along with your weapons) is addicting, and enemies (bosses in particular) are varied and require different strategies rather than repetitive mashing or QTEs to beat (looking at you, God of War).\nExploration and puzzles were a bit too simplistic for me most of the time, but helped make this game feel more like a grand adventure than a static arena.\nThe controls in the game however are problematic. While I've got them to work perfectly with my Logitech F310 (in D-Input mode) and Net Way PS3/PC Gamepad, This game doesn't support Xbox 360 and One controllers without some tweaking, so I recommend having an older, Direct-Input controller to play with as Keyboards aren't optimal for this type of game. 10/10 (with a gamepad, otherwise 6. yeah, it's that important)\n\nThe graphics of the game are showing their age; it is a relatively old game, and doesn't support high resolutions. Also, the graphics of this version are inferior to the PS2 and HD Collection versions as some of the more advanced lighting and shadowing effects are missing, and there is some very mild lag in some areas. The game is still perfectly fun and playable with these faults, but it's still something to keep in mind though if you care a lot about visuals. The character and environment designs however were pretty good for their time, and still have a bit of charm, even today. (7/10)\n\nThe music here is a mixed bag: I'm not a fan of the heavy-metal esque battle themes, although they fit the setting of the game. The rest of the music, like ambient sounds and effects are immersive however, and the goddess statue and final boss themes were very nice IMO. (6.5/10, although if you like the battle themes you might give an 8 or a 9)\n\nFinally replayability. This game isn't very long (about 12 hours for my first playthrough) but has immense replay value, with a lot of harder difficulty levels to unlock and test your skills with, an alternate playable character with unique weapons (Vergil), the ability to carry your upgrades and items from playthrough to playthrough, and the Bloody Palace, an arena with near endless battles, this game can keep you busy for a very long time if you want to master it. 10/10.\n\nVerdict: DMC3 SE is a fantastic game, with a ton of replay value. If you have a gamepad and don't mind a minor graphical downgrade, this is a solid reccomendation. If you're with a keyboard though or want the best graphics available, I'd recommend getting the PS2 version/HD remake if you can. Even if you can't, there's still a very solid game here. (No final score, as there are too many variables depending on your hardware and everyone has their own priorities in games. I only try to advise. Who am I to judge what you find important?)","December 11, 2015","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Devil May Cry is one of the less forgiving entries in the series, but does crappy port of the game does no justice. Some people will try to defend their purchase that it is rather playable, but you need to do some advance configurations to get the game running with playable settings.\n\nControl support is barebones to the point that you might as well play with mouse and keyboard, oh wait, that's broken too.\n\nGraphics are really choppy and the setttings are barebones as well.\n\nThe game aside is good but this port is horrendous.\n\nI got this game with a DMC 4 bundle so I don't really care that this is in my library, but if anyone were to buy this game seperate please, I beg of  you don't buy it, and buy DMC4 seperate as it is worth the money.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go buy the console version or the DMC HD collection, or emulate it, whatever. Its really upsetting that this game is still up for sale and Valve won't take it down because they want to have DMC games in their library. Trust me, you'll love yourself for buying the console version instead of this poor excuse of a port that hasn't been updated forever.\n\nEDIT: So I found out that there is a mod that does fix the support for controls and video settings. BUT my review still stands as a thumbs down as no one should buy this game full price just for a third party mod.

Play the game like you played it on ps2.\n\nNeedless to say this is one of the best games ever made, especially in the hack n' slash genre, so for $3.99, you'd be hard pressed to find a better way to spend four dollars. Many hours of fulfilling playtime, with the best characters, story, and gameplay of any DMC title. If your game collection is lacking this legendary title, a new experience awaits! It's a classic for several reasons you just have to play to discover and appreciate, and if it's one of the few or only CAPCOM games you haven't played, you are missing out!\n\nSpecial Edition adds Dante's twin brother Vergil as a playable character in all 20 story missions, and bloody palace mode.\n"This party's gettin crazy! Let's rock!" - Dante\nStory:  8.5\nGameplay:  9.2\nSound:  8.5\nReplay value:  7 - 8\nGraphics (for the time of release):  7 - 8.5\nAtmosphere/world: 7 - 8\n\nBottom line:  This is definitely one you get for entertaining gameplay and short, humorous (sometimes mysterious) filler cutscenes with likeable dialogue (short and to the point, not drawn out) that keep the flow and advance the story, as well as decent game length compared to the average game. Highly recommended. This is a very natural feeling game with good content.\n\nThe only things I could say would improve this game by making it slightly more immersive, in my opinion, would be perhaps to see some other humans in the city, how they are affected by the Temen-ni-gru's resurrection, and maybe one or two bright, open places to contrast the otherwise dark, gritty, and toiling tower.\n\nHowever, the game sticks to its guns (no pun intended, although appropriate as hell), and does what it does extremely well. You feel the journey you're on to the demon world as you ascend and traverse the tower and it's many diverse bosses, and it is beautifully executed.\n\nAlso, one other drawback (this game does not have many of), the other styles besides swordmaster are pretty irrelevant and even unexciting, but this is hardly noticed as all the attacks you can do with swordmaster are so much fun and deal the greatest damage anyway. One exception to this is that the "Doppleganger" style enabled a sort of two player mode on the PS2, with a second controller plugged in and Super Dante, the costume that allows you to stay in Devil Trigger mode infinitely, thereby allowing a second player to follow and battle alongside you through the entire game. I have not tested this on this PC version with two Xbox 360 controllers, but this would be interesting, and if I find out the answer to that question by testing it myself or another's comment, I will update my review to reflect that.
