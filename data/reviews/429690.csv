It's a great party game.  Can't wait to play this the next time I have friends over.  While it supports keyboard controls, I recommend using gamepads and turning on Pilot Execution mode.","February 22","true","0.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Except they're not lame because you'll be playing Astro Duel and yelling obsenities at each other. Unless you're a child then you'll probably be pooping yourself because you've never experienced a video game this good before. Move over Call of Duty. IT'S TIME TO DUEL.....TO ASTRO DUEL....IN SPACE.....WITH LASERS.....AND STUFF.\n\nTip: Pilot Execution mode is dope.","February 22","true","0.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","11","12","4","0"

Im literally amazed about how people can create something innovative, even basing on game like Asteroids. Game itself is awesome. I had to try it out against bots first and it was quite fun. Then I played it against my gf and she said that it was one of her best times we had together. Well then... ANYWAY, lets get to reviewing.\n\nAdvantages\nGame offers you bunch of different arenas to play on, 3 match types and possibility to set your own few rules, so there is no way for you to get bored quickly\nNice, classic sounds. Brings back some good memories from childchood\nGame was created to play with friends. And it worked out perfectly\nControls and steering is easy and nicely overlayed\nSummary\nAs I couldn't think of any disadvantages I'll simply move right to summary. Well, game crashed on me 3 times in about 2.5h gameplay, but for unknown reasons, so I skipped that. Game provides with hours of engaging fun, even if you're playing alone, it still can be great against bots. Hope it will get some updates to expand its possibilities as there is alot of room to create new content. I also hope that one day I'll get to try it with 3 other people, it must be a crazy mess! So hesitate no more, just buy it, have fun and don't rage quit too quickly!\n\nPersonal score\n9.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","February 25","true","5.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It looks like Asteroids and Samurai Gun had a baby... but it turns out that the baby is actually like a Baby Rambo with twin uzis and insane kung fu skills and also a tail! That's how awesome this game is. I'm so stoked it's finally on Steam, cause now I can play it on my big screen and punk all my bois and baes with my insane astro dueling skills. If you're hard up for a game that will make you laugh, cry, scream, and probably get a whole pizza dumped on your head, then this is the game for you.","February 22","true","23.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Astro duel strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and depth. The added feature of controlling the pilot after your ship is destroyed gives you a great, frantic, last chance and creates some amazing comebacks. AI is challenging, but playing with friends is the best!","February 25","true","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The controls are tight on both keyboard and on game pad (I've only used wired connections for xbox one controllers for gamepad support initially, and it works great). Multiplayer is a complete blast, and is a good way to ruin friendships in a more skill based game than mario party 5000. It runs really well on the surface pro 3, so you can also take it to a (soon to be former) friend's house and humiliate them with your amazing piloting skills. In all seriousness though, it controls super tightly, and causes players to make decisions about ammo conservation, whether or not to rush to a powerup or try to snipe somebody trying to grab one. The game performs great on my surface, and works very well with my minidisplay to hdmi adaptor on my tv. If you have a liking of local vs games like street fighter or tower fall, and enjoy asteroids, or one of those two options separately, this is the game for you.","February 22","true","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's such a fun game!\n\nHere's how it works. You need a second player to play with (i.e. no solo play). There are a bunch of differnt powerups like missles and lasers. The pace is pretty fast and its super great to have another local multiplayer game in the library.\n\nI say its work the $5 :)","February 22","true","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It also is very fun to watch, and makes for a great event at parties as people cheer for the underdog or yell in surprise at a comeback. Definitely give this game a shot with your gamepads and friends! As others have said, Pilot Execution mode is really fun; in this mode, when your ship explodes, you can still move around your pilot in space, albeit slowly, and if you are able to survive long enough, your ship will reform and you'll get a chance at revenge :)","February 22","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I think the maps would be better if they're a bit bigger [some of them] so the levels can be more laid of fun. & please, it's not like KML is the only perfect guy whose music fits good. We can all tell you opinions about it. & the multiplayer's main game yeah it is very good. Fun. & having not a lot of achievements ain't a problem really. Just hope that those who buy this actually enjoy it along. 9/10","May 3","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
