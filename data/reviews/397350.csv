The only downside is the much simplified economy, which is far less interesting and challenging than the original.\n\nThe general idea of the game remains the same - build up an economy, raise troops, go out and conquer more neutral counties/countries to build even more armies so you can defeat the active AI opponents that are doing the same. Unlike the original there are a number of different maps to conquer, rather than just the single England and Wales map, although the gameplay doesn't really change all that much between each map (you don't grow different crops or find different resources or build different military units).\n\nAs noted the economy is much simplified - for agriculture you only have two options, grain and cows/dairy. Even worse the lack of weather (except as special events) and fertility/crop rotation means that in practise you just always switch over to pure grain production as soon as you can as it frees up the most workers to your military industrial complex, as the risks of the previous title in specializing like this just aren't there.\n\nOn the upside the combat part of the game is much improved however, with the ability to position and move your troops much more fluidly, so you can try to outflank the enemy, or bottleneck the enemy in defensive terrain (ideally with melee troops defending a bridge while your archers and crossbows rain death on them).\n\nParticularly for sieges this can get cheesy as you can dodge incoming fire with a bit of practise while the AI just stands there as you shoot at it, although this requires a lot of patience...especially when you have dozens of counties to capture during each campaign. Overall it plays much more like an proto-RTS game in this phase, and is much more fun and interesting that in LotR1.\n\nAs a whole then the game is far more accessible and friendly to play, so it would probably be the recommendation for someone that hasn't played the series before, although due to its age it likely is going to have an audience mostly limited to those that played it many years ago, who don't need a review to know what the game is like.","December 3, 2015","true","1.2"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","76","80","0","1"

Here is the formula for a great strategy game.\n\nThis game has always been on every pc and laptop i have ever owned since its release, to this day its the only game i done that with, only other close is warcraft 2. I never got to say thank you to Sierra and Impressions games for making my favourite childhood strategy game so if anyone that used to work for them see's this well thank you for making an amazing game.\n\nShould you buy this game? yes\nif you cant handle not so great graphics compared to todays standards and dont enjoy simple but rewarding gameplay you might want to reconsider.","December 5, 2015","true","16.6"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"

Lords of the Realm 2 is a priceless RTS game that was way ahead of it's time. At it's core is the mechanics of the game itself. Everything fits together seamlessly - the economy, the warfare, how you need proper map awareness and decision making. It's truly remarkable how brilliant this game was back in it's day - everything meshed together in perfect harmony. In my opinion though, the heart of the game lies in the soundtrack. It captures the atmosphere in an unbelievable way. In many games soundtracks eventually become monotonous but with Lords of the Realm it is a pleasure the entire time. This is a very special game, and one of the craftiest RTS games ever. Worth every penny.","December 7, 2015","true","7.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/397350/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nLords of the Realm II is a Medieval Turn based strategy game, and real-time strategy for the army battle phases. Lords of the Realm II was developed by Impressions Games, and published by Sierra Entertainment (Just saying those names takes me back) and released in 1996.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\n"The year is 1268 A.D. The King is dead... ...There will be dark days ahead."\nLords of the Realm II is set in the lands of England and Wales, every petty warlord is scrambling to take the throne for their own purposes, you must conquer the usurpers and force them to recognize your superiority in battle, economics, and leadership.\n\nGameplay: There are two key characteristics to Lords of the Realm II: World/Map View, and Combat View. In World View, you govern your people, keep them happy, feed them, plant crops, allocate food and supplies between cities/states/provinces, direct where your peasants should work to maximize efficiency... really, just about everything takes place in the map view, and most of the strategy takes place here too.\nAs with most strategy games, there's a lot of details to cover, and in a review there isn't really that much time, the basic gist is: Get as many people as possible, make or buy weapons, build an army, "conquer thy neighbors".\nThe combat view is where you can implement rather creative tactics. If you're fighting on an open plane, you can try to formulate a strong defense using your natural surrounding, or just charge in and smash against the enemy line.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624363664\n\nAchievements: Can I have an achievement that says "I played this game as a little kid, and wasn't completely terrible at it"? As far as older video games goes, this game isn't nearly as brutal as a game like X-COM: UFO Defense, however it's just as much fun to play.\nWithout the nostalgia factor I don't know how much someone else might enjoy playing this game. But when I saw it was available on Steam, I tried to ignore it for a while, but ended up purchasing it within a week. (As did my brothers, I might add.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624473659\n\nPrice: Lords of the Realm II, was definitely the best of the series. Lords II hours is priced at $2.99, I snagged the game, and then proceeded to played for 5 hours, 2 where I completely forgot I was supposed to be working on my next YouTube Video Review, and 3 hours spent streaming it on twitch boring my audience with my nostalgia gushing.\nThere is a "Lords of the Realm Complete" bundle for $12.99, I always wanted to know what the other games were like, so that's the bundle I purchased. Stay tuned to hear my reviews for those games as well! (But it seems the general consensus seems to be: Lords II was the best.)\n\nConclusion: If you cut me right now, I would bleed sound clips of "WE'LL BE SHOT TO PIECES", "ARCHERS HO!", "FOR HONOR AND GLORY". My apologies if this review has too many inside jokes and references, but this game... this game...\nLETS GET DIGGING! (4 out of 5 peasants agree, Lords of the realm II is the best.

If you remember when CompUSA would demo computer games, and if you played computer games, you probably played this one. Highly reccomended for 2 reasons - Nostalgia & playing it again as the older, better version of yourself (just to see how much easier you crush this game). The music is still great, the unit vocals are still great and hilarious. The fighting was pretty good back in the day, even better than many current cell phone apps, but it does not compare to Total War. If anything, this is Total War before Total War was Total War.\n\nHere's my strategy (you don't have to read this):\n\nAfter playing every single Total War series, this game's economy and production is pretty easy to manage.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, the AI likes to garrison its' starting castle very quickly. This takes away from the labor force. They also like to take over counties very early, within about 10 turns or so. They are spreading themselves too thin. Within the first 10-15 turns, they have successfully sabotaged their production and increased their borders with armies of peasants, maybe a few archers and pikemen, and if the AI is The Countess, a little bit of macemen too.\n\nThe biggest thing to note is every AI has a seriously damaged economy and production. They've got hundreds of peasants in each army... empty towns... ruined fields... high taxes... unhappy populations.\n\nI've found the -best way for me- to deal with this is to spend your first 10-25~ turns spending ALL OF YOUR MONEY on IRON and WOOD, leave your forestry, mining and quarrying OFF. You can make up to 100 weapons PER TURN this way. As you're doing this, make sure your garison is at maximum troop levels. Archers and pikemen will hold anything. I particularly like to have a garison of 50% archers, 25% crossbowmen and 25% pikemen.\n\nSo you're making tons of weapons, having a happy and healthy population of over 1700 people. Meanwhile, poor defenseless counties are being invaded one after another. No worries, your enemies are spreading themselves thin, crippling themselves with peasant armies and terrible economic management. ALL GAME you must keep spending your money on Iron and Wood. Unless a food shortage is imminent, spend some money on that, but by then, you'll have tens of thousands of coins to waste. On the England map, I made a Stone Castle in EVERY county, by buying most of my stone, and/or turning off any production that is not STONE in counties with quarries.\n\nThis is basically a HEAVY defensive strategy but when you're rolling around win tens of thousands of coin, with over 3000 weapons, NEVER using PEASANTS in your armies... it really doesn't matter how many counties the AI have. You will crush them.\n\nHave no more than 4 wheat fields in a county with a large amount of total fields. 3 Wheat fields is pretty standard. Put tax at 7% when you're at 100 happiness. Put tax at 5% when you're around 80~. When you're below 60 happiness, have 0% tax, and buy some damn ale if you can.\n\nIt's pretty easy to be the greatest noble with the most coins, most troops, happiest people, most castles and most counties. The easiest way to get there FIRST, is to have the happiest people and the most coins... except you will be spending all of those coins on Iron and Wood during early game meaning, you will have the MOST and HAPPIEST people. Have a solid defensive garison and victory will be yours. The AI will try very hard with its peasant armies and crippled counties to take your castle. Be sure to keep an eye on SINGLE TROOP armies, which consist of 40~ peasants whom will raid your crops. You can easily ungarison your troops and auto-resolve these pests. 40 Peasant armies don't arrive until after you have smashed a greater army.\n\nYou can easily defend your castle against 2, 3, even 4 or 5 times the odds. Sometimes I just say, "Hell, I'm gonna let them in", and I lower the bridge. Prior to this, I make sure all of my men are at the last and final chokepoint inside the castle. For a Motte and Baily, It would be the tiny palisade surrounded by water. Pikes at the door, archers and crossbows off to the left or right so that they may shoot over the flag tower. Royal castles are particularly easy to defend, especially in combination with the 6 boiling oil pots. Just send all your men into the flag keep, pikes at the door, crossbows and archers behind, and just lower that damn draw bridge and let em' in. Have your oil pots at the front gates and just dump on them as they come in. Aim for their pikes and archers if you can. As for a Stone castle, that is an easy defense too. Just put all of your ranged ontop of the flag, and pikes at the only two stairways that lead up to the flag.\n\nHave at least a Motte and Baily, because that second wall that they have to break through is where the money is, in any castle. Let them in through the first wall, don't allow them to use any other siege equipment by Letting Them In! Then just dump oil on them till their crippled force reaches your second gate, followed by a pike wall guarding your archers and crossbows.\n\nThere is no need to compete with how fast the AI takes counties. Don't be intimidated. Be a Prang Mantus, wait for your time to strike, preferably with over 600 men, including a majority of maces followed by swordsmen, then crossbows, then knights. Make sure to engage with your swordsmen first, with macemen following right behind your swords and/or with a hefty group of maces to hit the AI in the flank. ALWAYS use your knights to engage in the AI's flank AFTER they have initiated your melee units. Crossbows will sit right behind the melee lines and fire away. As for the AI's boiling oil pots, just send in 1 knight to tip them over before sending in your main force.\n\nIt's okay to train up a ton of army after you have made tons of weapons and garisoned your castle. If you've got 25 happiness, that's okay, either tax your people 0 or 1%. If you're gonna run out of money because you've been spending it on iron and wood to make weapons, just sell 10 or 15 swords, or knights here and there. It's okay to lose some more population due to unhappiness after raising an army. Because with an army at this size and professionalism, it can smash any AI army, because they all have peasants. Just make sure to front line with your armoured units, flank with your fast units, and dont let your ranged get touched.\n\nSuper easy. Easy game. Fun though. Never thought I'd get to this point when I was a kid when this game came out. I couldn't even get past the first level when I was 8 years old. Now I just watch the AI be feeble and aggressive while I build up my ONE ARMY TO RULE THEM ALL. It's a pretty nostalgiac feeling to have a 1500 man army with zero peasants and stone castles in every county.\n\nLet your people build and repair! Buy those goods my lord.\n\nWithout trade, you cannot expand your empire to ridiculous sizes.\n\nWithout patience, you cannot secure your realm.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uUYgGFI.jpg Politics do not matter. No amount of words will change the idiocy or willingness of the AI.\n\nMid-game screenshots http://imgur.com/a/yFqLX","December 10, 2015","true","39.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

Lords of the Realm 2 is a game that revolves around attempting to take over a region, which is split into a number of counties.  Each county provides your effort with resources such as food, lumber, money, and men.\n\nThe computer AI is remarkably good considering the age of the game.  It can accomplish many intelligent context based tasks.  For example if the computer sees it does not have the manpower to hold an endangered county, it will wreck what it can and transport away all the resources so that they do not fall into enemy hands.  In combat (which is done RTS style) it can organize a cohesive attack when it has the advantage of numbers, or attempt to turtle behind cover when it is at a disadvantage.  The computer can organize small expendable raiding parties designed to burn your crop fields and cripple your economy, and knows to press the advantage if it spots a lightly defended territory.  Overall it cannot match a human player, but it greatly lowers the need for computer advantages still used today by many games to artificially inflate difficulty.\n\nComputer controlled Lords have personalities and voice actors assigned to them for flavor, and although the voice acting is generally terrible, I must admit that it makes the game more enjoyable to have The Knight insult me in his exaggeratedly arrogant tone, or The Baron politely inform me of his intent to annex my territory.\n\nThe UI is easy to understand, and a marked step up from LotR 1.  There are tooltips and help topics; a brand new player will have no trouble diving right.  There are even auto saves, which was not a given at the time!  Very convenient!\n\nLotR 2 is fast and fun, a truly great game for its time.

I remember playing this as a kid on a Packard Bell with windows 95, a few Mb of RAM, and maybe 1 Gb of disk drive space.\n\nGreat game, very addictive.

The Baron is a bit of a jerk and only accepts large amounts of money for friendship. The Bishop lies by saying he is only sending out an army through your county for research purposes, but then turns back and attacks you the next season.

I love this game.  I actually saved old computers to play it on that finally gave out completely.  I originally started playing this game when I was about thirty over the phone internet with my good friend Bill.  I miss that fax  machine sound but the game runs better than it ever did back then.  Even the single player runs better.  Three dollars are u kidding me???  When I was a kid in the early eigthees I would take my ten dollars or so of money for doing good on my report card and go with my brother to the arcade and spend it in two hours.  Then I would have to wait on him an hour because he always got better grades.  I would have never imagined back then over 40 hours of fun for three dollars and I am just getting started.  This game has resource gathering, weapons building and castle sieges.  The battles switch to another screen for real time strategy from the turn based portion of the game.  They are quite often a blast unless the enemy chooses to invade you with only 50 troops.  Of course those dont take much time.  The only flaw that I have seen that the game has, if u like old games of course, is after prolonged play usually 3-4 hours the sound sometimes messes up.  I then save the game, exit and come right back in with no problems.  WOOOOO thanks again STEAM!!!!!","January 28","true","74.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't remember how much time I have spent playing it, it's definitely more than I have every devoted to all total war games so far.\n\nGraphics may be dated but they are still pleasant to look at, upholding the atmosphere which is further strenghthened by the music and sound quality.\n\nThe story is simple yet believable, you are one of the most powerful lords in England and you have just been denied the throne. Fight other nobles to unify the country.\n\nThe Siege pack expanded the already great game.\n\nI can definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes strategies.\n\nTested on Win7, runs perfectly fine.","January 16","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/397350/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","Summary: A classic-if-dated strategy game good for wasting some late nights. 5/5.\n\n-----\n\nI was thrilled to see this game on Steam, because it is one of my old favorite games from the late 90s.  I used to spend hours at night when I should have been sleeping playing this game, sending insults to The Baron while I was heavy-eyed and dozing off.  It was one of my introductions to games like Civilization, and I am not sure where to be thankful or angry at Impressions for that.\n\nAnd I think comparing it to a small-scale Civilization is a good way to put it.  It's a lot simpler and more focused than Civ, and nowhere near the scope of Civ.\n\nThe concept of Lords 2 is that the king has died, and five pretenders to the throne are fighting it out with diplomacy and warfare going county-by-county.  Each player starts with a county, and can conquer thier neighbors while forming alliances and starting wars.  A second part of the game deals with commanding a battlefield in real time as you storm castles and conquer towns.\n\nPart of what made this game special in its time is that the two  game modes combined two different strategy genres perfectly.  The main game was a turn-based strategy with a small amount of micromanaging of counties, while the skirmish mode was an RTS reminiscent of Warcraft without the building aspect.\n\nThe included "Siege pack" expanded on the RTS elements of the game, adding a Skirmish menu for custom battles and sieges.\n\nThe game is still a lot of fun, but doesn't quite hold up after nearly 2 decades.  The AI is not very competent in the skirmishes, and the controls during those battles is awkward.  Issuing orders in mid-fight can be a pain.  Fortunately there is an option to skip the battles and "autocalc" them, if they are frustrating.  This can be done at anytime, before the battle or during.\n\nThe micromanaging might be offputting to some people, but it is not particularly complicated.\n\nUltimately the game is still fun and immersive, but doesn't feel the same with all of the excellent strategy games that followed.\n\nAvoid Lords 3 at all costs.","January 16","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game plays like a simplified combination of Civilization and Total War, and despite this simplicity, I still find that the game surprises me.\n\nI have yet to play another game with a built in "Send an Insult" function...\n\n- Iconic and eternally enjoyable audio, strategic and (modestly) challenging gameplay.\n- The CG video sequences are markedly aged by today's standards, but what would one expect of production from 1996?\n- Other graphical assets have a 'tired' appearance as well, but failing an HD remake, its all passable.\n\nOverall 4.5 of 5","February 21","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
