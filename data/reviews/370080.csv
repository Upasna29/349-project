That game you control a 1 by 2 by 1 block so this wasnt has hard to pick up since i beat that game. This game is a nice little game that could leave you frustrated with yourself but once you start thinking in the 2x2x1 pattern the game will really shine. Great music that was fun to listen to. However at first glance there is 150 levels in this game!. If the dev keeps updating it im sure we will have great little game for yourself while you are doing something else.","June 11, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I cant say that theres something that I dont like.. Or maybe just the fact that I finished almost every level in under 1 hour :D But still, this game is really fun and relaxing to play!

Well worth it for the purchase price. The game needs interface improvements. There is a somewhat lack of options and in order to change resolutions you must restart the game. Your required to select a resolution size prior to launching the game. This is somewhat annoying. Considering if you don't like the selected resolution you must restart. Game interface and the level joining relatively easy no complaints. Game just needs better options.","February 29","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't a fan of the music (it wasn't that bad, but got repetitive very fast), there are no volume sliders and progress is stored in the registry, but these are the only issues I had. if you're into puzzle games, this is a very good choice.","May 1","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
