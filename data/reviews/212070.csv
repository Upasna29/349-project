There is a lot of options on how to play and lots to do includeing an Open mode.\n\n- A lot more ships have been added, and many of the moduels changes and updated.\n\n- Lots of people play this.\n\n- Has Guild Support\n\n- Has Crafting\n\n- Special ships and abilities etc, for Guilds. (If they build/Earn it)\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Still Very much Pay2Win - (GS = Galactic Standards, the Pay For Currency in Star Conflict)\n\nWhile the liscense issue spoken about in the old review has been fixed, Synergy still remains an issue as well as the P2Fly Ships which start at max level, and can be purchased for any tier.\n\n* Synergy, Synergy in game is what your ship acquires as it fights, it is ship specific, and it is used to upgrade your ship. The Pay to play Ships which start at max level have an ability called "Synergy Transfer" which allows you to convert their unused synergy, into "Free" synergy, which can be applied to any ship.... At a cost. To transfer Synergy to free synergy you will need to pay 1 Galactic Standard (Pay For Currency), for every 300 Synergy...\n\nSounds like a deal yea? It isn't. In the higher tiers you can use as much as 500k to 1 million Synergy in order to level your ship. This equates to about 15,000 - 30,000 GS, which is over 100$ USD. For a single ship level.\n\n* Now Granted. You don't have to use free synergy at all, you can simply grab a non p2p ship and level it manually. It is a very very long grind however, as to make and influence the obvious choice to simply "Buy" a better ship thats already leveled a much more convieient and optimal choice. And hey they are pretty cheap.\n\n* P2Use Modules, are common and they have some for every single catagory of module for your ship, they last 1 Battle, and generally cost anywhere from 20GS to 500GS for a single Use/Battle. They Give a 100% Synergy Bonus to your ship as well as being a Level 3 Module.\n\n* Boosts can increase anything from your damage, to your speed, to your looting chance, you can fit 2 on your ship at a time and they are also limited per battles, they usually last from 3-5 battles depending and costs around 300-500GS.\n\n* Liscense - Boosts all your non combat stats, such as Credit income per battle and gives other bonuses, this is basically SC's Subscription model, and there are several avaialble to choose from.\n\n----- Without useing any of the above, you can now progress in game, although it's very very slow. As would be expected, and since the game relies so heavily on people paying for gear, ships, and boosts which directly affect their preformance in battle, unless your willing to fork out the cash for "Consist gear and ships" Every single battle. It will be a long, slow arduous road for you.\n\n\n- Long Ques:\n\n* I played 25 battles, and managed to gain enough credits (Non paid currency) to upgrade a couple of my items a few times to Blue quality. Those battles took me around 5-6 hours to actually get into, ques seem to be very long depending on your tier of ship.\n\nI had to wait 10-15 minuets per match, even though the launcher says the max wait time is 4 minuets with an average of 1 minuet. So apparently this is broken.\n\nFrom what I was told in game any Tier above 3 is basically empty with very little players. But below and Tier 3 there are plenty of people to play with. I find this a bit sad considering the game has 15+ Levels of ships and over 7 Tiers.\n\n\n- Loot chance.\n\nThe Game is heavily Geared to make you "Purchase" stuff with real money. Loot chances are exceedingly low. You will rarely get anything of value, but no fear the store in the crafting area in game will sell you anything you want, as long as your willing to fork over that cash for Galactic Standards.\n\n- Very Grindy\n\nExceedingly repetitive and grindy.\n\n- Controlls are very clunky in the larger ships.\n\nThey want you to have a forward faceing view, but this makes it nigh impossible to target anything thats out of your 40 degree view range, and the larger ships are very slow to turn. (Obviously they are huge).\n\nThere used to be a defense module you could equip on frigates that made this hendrance less of an issue, as it acted as a 360 degree defense module. I beleive they have removed it as I was unable to find it. Now it is so easy for you to die from something smaller then you as to be.. pointless to fly one of the frigates.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs you can see the reoccuring theme seems to be - Gimme your money. And while the game has improved significantly (Vastly in fact, I am very Impressed).\n\nBased on this Money Grubbing Mentality the owners seem to have, I "still" can not in good concious reccomend this game.\n\n\n\n\n-----------------\n\nOld Review -\n\nI would love to recomend this game, I honestly would. I played it for a very long time, Baught many of the packs, and contributed as a community member... And loved every moment of it....\n\nThe Game keep's growing, Keeps expanding, and keeps getting better and better content wise, as a game.\n\n\nHowever,\n\nAs of late, in the last 6 months, the game seems to be degrading based on my below observations:\n\n\n1. F2p, P2p. Or Sub Based?\n\n* It is now 100% Pay to win (Actually it's sub based desguised as an F2P, you can download the game for free, even play for free "Technically", but if you actually want to progress your character you must purchases a Sub, or Licence).\n\nIf you are not willing to spend money, do not install this game, I am one of the payers telling you this.\n\nI saw people complaining about this, so I let my licences and some other things run out, just to see what the deal was and if the complaints were valid, Sadly.... They were. You can not progress at all without one.\n\n\n2.  Power Tripping, Unprofessional, Abusive Admins and GM's.\n\nI am not going to sit here and insult the Admin Staff as a whole like some, as there are some who are generally good people who try to do the job properly.\n\nHowever,\n\nA great majority of the  "Visable", Admins, community managers, and GM's etc, are sadly infact exactly the above. They will make comments, level threats, make up rules, or interpret rules to their advantage so they can punish you, just to show you they can.\n\nNot because you actually did something "wrong" or violated a rule, but because you "upset them personally" with something you may have said or an opinion you have expressed.\n\nThe main issue I suppose is that if the Admins etc, were to actually follow the rules and enforce them, they would be forced to permanently ban themselves for violating them.... Repeatedly.\n\n\n3. Some of the changes to the ships, have rendered them almost useless, when compared to other ships of the same class. Some small tweaks would fix this issue, and Balance between the races is now definitely an issue due to ship specializations, and specifically their assigned special weapons/abilities.\n\nAn easy fix to this would be to allow the player to change these like any other module, to whatever they want.\n\n\nSo with that, I can not conciously recomend this, what could be, a fantastic game.\n\nUpdate: I stopped playing this over 6 months ago, of course if the above changes, and the Dev's crack down and get professional admins, rather then immature ones, as well as fix some of the other issues, I will happily change this review, and recomend it in the future, and start playing again.\n\nTry this game if you like however, it's free after all.\n\n~Mal","October 30, 2014","false","260.8"," 2,261 of 2,419 people (93%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","93","261","2","47","78"

Pretty much just doing the same thing over and over, day in and day out, feeling like you're actually achieveing something. This game used to be a lot of fun. Maybe because the lower tier ships weren't so maddeningly far out of reach. I used to feel like I didn't have to spend money to enjoy this game. Then I bought a 3 month license just to start progressing. After all the effort I put into the game and not progressing very much, I had to take a long break from it. Came back after roughly 3 months and it's still pretty much the same game. Ridiculously long wait times to actually play, even more attempts to convince you to spend real money on the game.\n\nThe devs are moving it in a new direction, which is nice, but this is one of those games where I wish it wasn't just a perpetual beta. Just like FireFall, it seems the devs are focusing on the wrong areas and are adding new content without addressing existing issues. Feels like a huge letdown. Granted, it is free to play, but I was hoping for something more.\n\nIf you've played World of Tanks, you've already played Star Conflict. Sadly, I had let them both go. Seems too many games fade out because it's all a money grab... It might be for you, but after more than a year, I've come to realize this is not for me. Take my input with a grain of salt.

You might even say it was a beta stage. The game was great, 2 PvE levels, a good ship tiering system, balanced gameplay for paying and non-paying players...\n\n... But all that changed when 'the update' came (around last year or so). Ships that had certain powers suddenly had different (underpowered) powers, other ships that had certain 'roles' suddenly became other roles and you had to dismantle your entire ship and buy new items for it. PvE became less rewarding and paying players became extremely overpowered, almost forcing you to buy stuff/experience yourself.\n\nAnd when a F2P game is forcing me to buy stuff, that is where I draw the line and stop playing. You should not even start this up, it will only end in frustration.","October 9, 2014","false","25.3"," 491 of 558 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","491","558","6","0"

The ship models looks great with some really well designed maps and sky boxes.\n\nUnfortunately, just like vast majority of free to play titles, this is an incredibly grindy game as you progress up the tiers while it feels more and more pay to win too. I think it is also a bait and switch as the first couple of tiers are pretty fair and enjoyable but as you move up the tiers of your ship, the grind and pay to win gets exponentially worse.\n\nAvoid it at all cost. I do not recommend this grind fest.

WARNING!!!!!\n\nI want to give a positive review, I really do, but it feels dishonest to do so.\n\nThis game is plagued by its own development team. Unless you are a member of the Russian Master Race your problems and concerns are of no interest to them. The Devs do not want to support a non-Russian community, provide materials for the non-Russian Wiki, collect feedback from non-Russian players or even give complete patch notes to the non-Russian player base. They don't want to fix glaring issues with the game, they don't want to know about what you find fun, and they sure as hell don't want to provide a quality experience - that might get in the way of monetising you!\n\nThe core mechanics of the game are good, but used to be better. Much of the game's content is burdened by insane amounts of grind to coax money out of you, and other elements of the game are sealed behind paywalls to ensure proper Pay to Win behaviour is enforced.\n\nPlay it by all means - you can have fun providing you don't go beyond Tier 3 - but don't invest any money in it.","December 5, 2014","false","11.7"," 290 of 324 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","290","324","6","2"

Open space mode is most fun for gameplay though.\n\n- Open space mode can have really nice battles between corporations, but not often enough. Though it can be enjoyable alone, just roaming around exploring the limited amount of sectors. Just be aware of aliens, they are OP.\n\n- Graphics and effects are nice, could use a optional graphic pack for 4k texture or something higher.\n\n- You can join games already running, so playing isn't an issue much anymore, though it can really change how matches turn out.\n\n- A lot of really well designed ships, really enjoyable just to look at the ships and their detail.\n\nCons\n- A lot of ping issues, which is the reason for your ship wobbling on its own. The admins just tell you to read over a connection issue forum post, but new players shouldn't have to do that, and instead the servers should be good enough, and setup well enough. Like good hosts that have the best location for the players on the game with good networking.\n\n- The game is really really grindy, not as bad as some other games, but could be more focused on having fun.\n\n- Once you reach Tier 3 pvp, it becomes really difficult for new pilots to adapt, and have any chance. Usually the reason why people quit the game. They enjoy it until T3, which is when they meet fully equipped, mk4 premiums that are almost impossible for new pilots to do anything.\n\n- Not enough population on the game, all bad factors contribute to this, and its only getting worse.\n\n- A few ships feel like they are pay-to-win, not saying they are, but having bonuses they are seen as p2w, such as the Spark, a lot of veterans use it because of the advantages over the Lightbringer. Mauler has advantages over Inquisitor AE. Dessert Eagle and Nukem I are a clear advantage over any of gunships in T3.\n\n- Isn't really enjoyable playing alone, in order to enjoy the game fully, being in a team is needed, which is hard to play as a team.\n\n- People have the image that are non-US corps cheat, which would probably be something to do with ping. Most of the Russian corps in game always seem to kill you faster then what anyone else would be able to do, again, probably because of ping.\n\n- Teamwork isn't encouraged by the game, being in a squad will take forever to get a match. Which is ridiculous, but thats the game for you. Even with the new queue system where you can join matches at any time, it still takes forever to get a match.\n\n- Developers released dreadnoughts, and basically said "Hey, here are 3 dreadnoughts, you can't change them after you chose one, and here is no information about each of them. Chose wisely." They don't give us information we need to make good choices in game.\n\n- There is a story about a corp, I will not speak of the corp or the user who got banned, but the user had an argument with a moderator, not a terrible argument, and this was on the forums. The user got banned from both the forums and in game for around 45 years. The corp he was a part of were going to speak up against the issue, but decided to quit instead, a medium/large size corp mostly quit together because of a moderators action. The corp leader even put tons of money into the game to help it.\n\nI do not recommend as there is to many problems with a game that has so much potential.\nIf people think the game is so good, then people shouldn't be leaving. Being blind to the reasons the game is bad will waste your time and money.\n\nSome players are even trying to get others to downvote reviews on steam, but people should not hide the truth of what is wrong with the game. Servers are definately the worst part, fixing that issue alone could potentially make the game 500% more enjoyable, oh, and actually get a population. No one wants to play with their ship rotating on its own, and having a 5 second delay on their weapons.\n\nSuggestions for the game:\n1. Lower the price of the DLC, it would really increase sales. Lower price, higher volume sold. This would allow the game to buy better servers, like from Amazon. The price of some DLC are more expensive then practically all brand new games, its ridiculous. Grand theft auto? $60.00. 1 star conflict DLC? $87.00. What do you get from the DLC? Not enough for sure.","April 10, 2015","false","147.4"," 338 of 387 people (87%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","87","338","387","27","28"

The new ships - the Destroyers - look very good (much like the rest of the ships) but are, like everything else in this game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly expensive. The grind has not lessened one bit (and is still real - 109k synergy for a rank8 ship from synergy 8 to 9 at 1 to 2k synergy per battle (only if you win)) and the balance is still terrible (though it's not far from patch 3.3 Smite - not sure whether that's an insult to either game or not). PvE is still godawefully boring but at least I managed to destroy that alien commander now which I failed miserably at the last time. Guess they nerfed them.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 01.10.2015:\nPlayed it for about a week again to give it a fair chance at not being bad - I really like space games - but alas to no avail. Let's see\n\n- Matchmaking is a lot quicker now than it was before but no more balanced which means it can be attributed mainly to rising player numbers\n\n- PvP balancing... yeah no don't get me started on that\n\n- PvE balan... PvE is godawefully boring - admittedly that's the general problem of PvE everywhere in every game but this here takes it a step further\n\n- Ships are still the way they are after the evil wizard (see below) but somehow they managed to make it half decent with the weapon locks to classes and so on. Still bad though as you have to grind redundant ships to get the ones you really want - e.g. Jericho Guard-Frigattes are jsut way more sensible than Federation as former have way more base shielding to use their special with. Oh yeah and they are still absurdly expensive.\n\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time -\nthis was a fun game where you could do space dogfighting as though there was air. The factions were pretty starkly contrasted in their attributes and special abilities on ships making for some interessting choices. It had an OK progression for a FTP game - the premium content was actually more powerful than what could be gained from grinding but it wasn't gamebreaking.\n\nThen came the evil wiz-----a patch.\nAaaand suddenly it doesn't suffice to grind enough "standing" - now you have to grind synergy to unlock new ships that might or might not have a similar ability to the one you currently grind. Abilities got spread around more and some ships received things that are completely pointless on that hull and should've stayed where they once were. Then they switched around the weaponsystems, removing the cool ones and limiting the selection for ships even more than it was before (where at least you could find cool weaponsystems for all classes of hulls). Once you actually grinded enough synergy you hopefully have an astronomic amount of currency to actually buy that new ship as well. Did I mention volunteer secondary missions that lock the ships you select for them out for up to AN ENTIRE WEEK? Yeah - very fun gameplay element that. The premium content is basically mandatory if you ever want to get anywhere.\n\nNow it's a shipwreck (literally) of what it could've been, heck of what it WAS.\n\n\nUpdated 02.03.2016 TL;DR*:\nDON'T\nPLAY\n\n*still","March 5, 2015","false","59.3"," 413 of 483 people (86%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","86","413","483","35","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orangemobius/recommended/212070/","orangemobius","Sir Dildor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orangemobius/","200 products in account","I've been putting a lot of hours into this game. It's generally good game in terms of gameplay, variety and battles but I'll list out  the major cons:\n\n-Extremely grindy\n\n-Despite being called "free to play", people can just pay and advance to higher tiers/ranks. Lets call them Wallet players\n\n-Wallet players who reach higher tiers will get all implants (implants are like the point system tree in borderlands, payday 2 etc)\n\n-Wallet players who have all these implants can go back to lower tiers, are pretty much invincible and have the upper hand in every battle. YOU WILL GET YOUR ♥♥♥ HANDED TO YOU.\n\nNow you may ask Oh my, why would they come back to lower tier games and spoil our fun?. I'll tell you why...\nPeople think this game is really free to play and come into the lower tiers which are the only popluated matches available for instant battles. So the wallet players will just come into lower ranked games because nobody wants to wait 5 minutes for match. This is unsportive behaviour.\n\n-The game developers only seem to update the game in a way that favours wallet players.\n\n-Extra synergy (synergy is experience, you need this to access higher rank ships and higher tiers) cannot be transferred to ships which dont have full synergy. If you want to, you need to pay a lot of money.\n\n-Upgrading weapons to the max requires loyalty points (these can be done by doing special challenges like 'kill 3 ships in one battle'. These challenges are called contracts) And this requires another longg rinding process because contracts can only be done certain times. Some contracts can only be done once per day.

All currently available DLC's cost you 223,94 €. You get 4 or 5 AAA Titles for that.\n- There is a short Tutorial but the game is very complex and most things are unexplained. The Wiki is mostly in russian language.\n- Grind. All you do is to level up different ships to get a better one with slightly improved stats. rinse and repeat.\n- You can loot occassionaly usefull things for a certain module but since there are so many modules you can rarely update the stuff you need right now.\n- Balancing. The balancing is NOT for a fun game experience but solely for generating money for the developers. You will see MANY artifical walls which restrict you from progress when you don't want to pay the "incredible" prices for things that should be in there right away. this appears like extortion to me. And this will never end no matter how much you have paid already.\n- Long waiting times (1-5 minutes, European Server) when you want to do a battle. Be sure to have something to read for that time.\n- Depending on time of day few players so the battles are filled up with "stupid" bots.\n\nI have not done much PvE and been not in a Corp so I cannot rate these aspects. But corps mainly require Voice Coms (Teamspeak) so this only works if you live alone.\n\nOther reviews have mentioned unfair bans. I have none experienced myself but I will certainly NOT pay (waste) hundreds of Euros when the game can restrict me from playing it that easily.\n\nSo the game can be fun if you like Grind and are willing to pay many money. Everyone else should be aware that this is a simple cash mashine for the developers where you provide them the content (opponents) and shall even pay for it. The more I think about it the more I dislike this business model.\n\n\n\n\n\nas reply to TigusVidikis's comment:\n>Pay to Win??? why?\nBecause you can speed up your progress significantly with real money. Faster progress means faster success and an advantage over players who don't do it.\n\n> Premium ships are just different ships. Better in some stats, worse in others.\nBut they start fully leveled. Non-premium ships are therefore worse from their stats until they are leveled up also. but there is little point in flying a leveled ship any more since you mostly want to level up the next one. so for most of the time the premium ship IS better.\n\n>The only real thing to give you an edge is and indirect bonus, if you go premium you get more XP and more loot.\nmore xp and more loot (items, upgrades) means better stats than one who doesn't pay. better stats means better chances. better chances means winning more often. winning more often means even faster progress. so from my conclusion this IS pay to win.\n\nfrom what i have seen you can achieve most things by stupid grind. but it will take you a long while and will certainly not be fun for the most time. the game is purely balanced to annoy you so much until you pay. and the developers are greedy.\nfor 1 € (euro) i get 300 galactic standards (gs).\none month of premium licence (+50% xp, extra loot) cost you 3000 gs = 10 €\na second set of implants cost you 2000 gs = 6,7 €\na rank 11 ship costs you 6.2 million ingame credits this are around 12000 gs and thus 40 €.\nto change ONE visual aspect of ONE ship costs you 150 gs = 0,5 €.\neven beeing the mentor of a new character afaik costs you 200 gs = 0,7 €.\nso if you want to play it seriously and have fun doing it you have little chance without paying. thats what everyone starting this game must be aware of. if you have plenty of real money to spend play it. but don't let you fool by the "free to play" tag because this is a lie.\n\nI see that the developers must eat and want to be payed for their work. but the payment scheme applied in this game is obviously greedy and reminds me of extortion. and this is not only my opinion i have heard several other people mentioning this as the most annoying aspect of the game.\n\n\n\n\nupdate #2\nI have now spend lots of time in the game (and also few euros) and want to explain my long term experiences.\nCorp/buddies is important to have for flying together and get some tips.\nPVE is quite boring and repetitive.\nIDIOTS. I can't describe how frustrating this game is because of the idiots in it. there are many bad players who don't contribute to winning, refuse to help their teammates etc.. Its very frustrating when you constanly loose a match because of such people. And there are the players which have spent many time in game already (you are too late!) and have top (premium) ships, best equipment and experience. If you have those in enemy team you have mostly lost already before the fight even starts. So if you are a "medium" or average player like me you will recive constant frustration.\nThe matchmaking system seriously SUCKS. If you want to team up with someone you have significantly increased waiting times (you spent half of the time in this game waiting for a match anyway). So if you want to play together (its multiplayer, right?) you will actually have less fun.\nAnd the teams are often very unbalanced with one side having a clear advantage over the other. The balanced and fair (=the fun) fights are 1/3 approximately.\n\nSo with the greedy developers, the idtiot community and the crappy matchmaking system I CANNOT recommend this game to anyone. I'm sure there are better gaming experiences out there. Once my licence epxires i will leave the game for these reasons. Gaming should be fair fun and not unfair frustration.","November 6, 2014","false","4.2"," 301 of 369 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","301","369","2","34"

This game truly has had ups and downs but I think that at the end of the day, It still is a good game.  Star Conflict is one of my favorite games of all time, but the past few months the game has actually gotten worse in some ways. This review is titled as a “Not recommended game”, but it’s not a bad game. I don’t recommend it because I do not like what the developers are doing with the game.\n\nA good chunk of the game has become a Pay-To-Win; they keep on adding ways to spend your money in-game. With more and more Premium Ships and “Ship Bundles” and all kinds of little game booster packs  and all these “Specials Weekends”. Try to avoid wasting your money on them. However if you really want some Premium credits, wait for the DLC Packs to go on sale. Not worth it at full price. But I do understand that it is a free game and Stargem needs to make money, but it is just driving me crazy because They are spending more time on adding ways to get players to spend money on the game than they are actually developing the game! They also recently added a game mode called Invasion; This includes Aliens, Pirates, Police, lots of new rare items, an open space world that allows you to go across the sectors in the game and dock in the 3 faction’s stations and all kinds of cool stuff like that. This new game mode has a lot of potential, but holy crap is it a pain to play. All the experience holds is getting killed and losing everything you spent hours collecting, getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by Aliens, and very rarely gaining supplies that allow you to make better modules and upgrades. Not that fun, and not worth it. I won’t let that change my view on the game for now as they’re still developing it, but it needs a lot of work.\n\nAlso note you should never get too comfortable with the updates; expect change. However it is still a very fun and addicting game. It is still a good game. (With maybe a little too much grinding involved...) But Stargem just needs to stop trying so hard to get people to spend money on the game.\n\nAlso, not that this has anything to do with the review, so excuse me for this, but I'd like to throw on a link to my Star Conflict channel trailer on YouTube. :D Check it out if you'd like.

Good Game, but a few issues hurt this games potential.\nGame it self is good and highly addicting. Its a space shooter the maps look good. Not many like it. Its grindy like most free to plays.\n\nThis game is not pay to win. It pay to grind less. but the money you spend give you very little extra advancement. In order to advance faster you will end up spending alot in the long run.\n\nOnce you progress to the upper tiers, their matchmaking takes a long time. Sometimes longer than 10 minutes for a round that last as short as 2 minutes.\n\nIf you like the game and want to get some things for it I recommend to wait for the steam DLC sales.

Lots of fun, simple to get into, increased depth the longer you play. Good game.\nWhile some people will always complain about the grind and the buy-to-win in a free-to-play game, the developers managed an interesting balance in those topics.\nDon't get me wrong, there is some grind. But when compared to other free-to-play tittles, it's not that much.\n\nAs for the win-to-play that often puts off people in free to play games, I have to disagree with whoever thinks this about Star Conflict.  Ships are divided into tiers, and each tier can have 2 to 4 ships of each class, with increasing effectiveness. Battles match-making is also divided into tiers. This means that when you get to rank 3 (the last of tier 1), if you are any good you will be owning battles like a boss. But as soon as you get to tier 2, a whole new world of ships, more effective, with better pilots, and more ships modules(skills), you will be like the little fish in the pond of sharks.... again. That is, untill you get the best ships in that tier as well. Same happends when you jump from tier 2 to 3, and from 3 to 4, and so on.\nThis leads to some people thinking they are dying because the other player has a premium ship.\nWrong.\nWhile premium ships do have a very slight advantage in their stats, most of the time it's irrelevant. A good pilot is born from experience. Of course, premium ship owners are usually good pilots. Often only play with that ship and become very good with it.\nBut the slightly better stats will only make a slight difference in a 1 on 1, with 2 very good pilots. Any premium ship gets utterly destroyed with a simple 2 to 1. And lets face it:\nIf you and your team can't do a 2 to 1 in a 10 vs 10 battle, then you deserve to loose against him.\n\nFinally, ships tend to get more effective as tiers go up, and pilots also become better with experience. This leads to the tactical side of the batlles to become more apparent as you go up, as well as taking longer to get decided.\nThe different ship classes are also well done, with each having it's own specific role.\n\nIn the end, and considering there is nothing of the kind in recent game releases, together with the competent work Gaijin did with Star Conflict, this game is mandatory to any spaceship combat fan.\n\nMe? I was waiting for something like this since Colony Wars and Freelancer.","August 7, 2013","true","307.4"," 291 of 383 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","291","383","0","6"

We were all excited about it and even bought several of the packages ($49.99) ones.\n\nSummary: The game has a solid foundation and could be a great arena/World of Tanks alternative. Unfortunately the developers (like several other eastern european developers) rely heavily on cash shop purchases, premium time purchases, an incredibly steep progression curve (post rank 7), and a near impossible PvE environment. Do to the difficulty, extreme progression curve and the steep cash requirement to progress or even play the game beyond rank 7, I cannot fully recommend the game.\n\nPros:\n-Ships in space!\n-Lovely graphics, awesome ship designs with personality (unlike the flying turds in Eve).\n-An interesting open world element starting at rank 4. In many ways similar to Eve Online. If the developer capitalized on this and rebalanced the AI encounters found in open space, this game could have been a winner. See Cons.\n-Ship role customization, although limited it does allow some degree of freedom to tailor your ship to your liking.\n-Includes both PvE and PvP missions.\n-The crux of the game takes place in Arena style battlegrounds or instances.\n\nCons:\n-Steep difficulty curve in PvE missions starting at rank 4. These become near impossible without fully upgraded, fully tiered ships which can be either incredibly expensive or take an inordinate amount of time.\n-Open World exploration loses its luster at around rank 6, as NPCs send you on suicidal near impossibly difficult sectors of space (which are open to PvP ganking). This relegated open world to only end-game fully upgraded (think all purple equipment) ships or gank squads.\n-Cash shop solution for nearly anything. Equipment requires faction marks in order to level it to Rare (blue) status. Unfortunately it is prohibitively expensive to switch factions in order to grind their marks. Although a Cash Shop solution is offered.\n-All weapons, modules, and ship equipment can be ranked up (improved) all the way to purple status using the Cash Shop gold emblems.\n-PvP arenas can be hit or miss depending on whether or not your ship is fully leveled and equipped for that tier. Again, since you can do everything through the cash shop, you can easily fully gear up a ship with purples for PvP. Also, be prepared to encounter fully upgraded, cash shop ships out in open space as they suffer no repair costs when destroyed.\n\nIf I knew the developer had plans to lessen the PvE difficulty curve as well as remove the cash shop/cash requirements for switching factions, I might recomend the game. Until they do that I strongly recomend you steer clear of it. It is my understanding that this developer has no plans to do that and would rather run it into the ground.","November 27, 2014","false","50.5"," 115 of 136 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","115","136","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smaxx/recommended/212070/","smaxx","Smaxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smaxx/","942 products in account","A nice space shooter, a (somewhat) fair, but grindy game.\n\nUnfortunately there's no "maybe" rating for this review. The game definitely isn't something for everyone. It's possible to have fun with it, but at times its really just boring.\n\nAt first the game might look like a perfect "pay to win" candidate, considering there are several DLC packs available unlocking ships for you. However, that's not really the case.\n\nAll ships available as part of DLC offers or to be bought with real world currency are more or less sidegrades or shortcuts. The most powerful ships however, can only be unlocked by playing the game. That's very nice and fair.\n\nAnd here's the catch: Unfortunately, you can describe the game with three words: ONE HUGE GRINDFEST. And to be honest, that's sad, very sad, and also the reason why I can't really recommend this game without warning about this.\n\nLet me explain the game in a few sentences:\nYou start out with the factions' basic ships. To obtain bigger ships, you'll have to earn "sync" points. With these you're able to level up ships. Once you've leveled a ship, you'll be able to unlock the next ship in the tech tree that's usually a small upgrade or a new ship fitting a different role.\n\nIn addition, you're able to upgrade parts of the ships or more specific modules that are installed on them: a primary weapon system (turrets), secondary weapon systems (typically missiles), a ship specific special ability (not upgradeable), and two support abilities. The problem: Upgrades won't transfer between tiers.\n\nSo game progress looks like this:\n- Obtain a new ship.\n- Invest (ingame) money, mission rewards (or real money) to level up the ship modules.\n- Level up the ship to improve its power and unlock the next ship.\n- Obtain a new ship and start over again.\n\nAnd that's it, unfortunately. I guess I don't have to say that leveling the ships appears to take ages. While it's perfectly fine to not "finish" the progression part of the game within a week, it's really slow and tedious. Add to this the fact that the game's population isn't that high (typically 1000-3000 players online right now according to stats in the game), it happens that you'll have to wait one or two minutes to finally get into a PvE game. Queue times for PvP are usually slightly longer (sometimes 5 minutes or more).\n\nAnd here's another problem: Due to the low population (and a very limited number of PvE missions), you're usually fighting with or against significantly stronger enemies. It's not uncommon to die within seconds versus a sniping frigate that's simply out of range for you. Once you're dead, you'll either have to wait 30-60 seconds (seems to depend on game mode) or till the next stage of the mission (in PvE). In addition, most mission stages take only two or three minutes, but there's a full minute of wait time between stages.\n\n"Fortunately" there are ways to progress faster: You can buy the classic "booster" to gain more points, but you're also able to buy different ammo that will double your synergy gain. The unfair part: The costs! The initial price of the ammo module is 2 Standarts. That's not a lot. However, once unlocked it no longer shows any price. Although the module will still take 2 Standarts for every round you're playing. You won't see this unless you're paying close attention. And some of the costs... To upgrade a weapon from level 2 to level 3 you'll need something like 30,000 units of mission rewards: You'll get about 600 per mission - or buy the upgrade with real money. Do the math yourself.\n\nAnd one more thing to remember: This game can only be played using keyboard and mouse. There is no controller support (neither gamepad nor joysticks). Also there seems to be a significant amount of auto-aim involved or there are really just big hitboxes. It's definitely far easier to hit enemies as it is in other games of this genre.\n\nTL; DR: Star Conflict is a nice space shooter with great graphics (especially for a free to play game) and good sound, but overall the whole game is just one huge grindfest, which is sad and lowers the overall gameplay experience a lot. If you don't mind not progressing for a while or really having to start over several times, give it a try. You might like it. But don't expect to win dogfights from the beginning or progress in one straight line.","December 24, 2013","false","18.8"," 271 of 364 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","271","364","0","14"

Everything you want to work for (It will be work, not fun) can just be paid for. Everything that can be paid for is more powerful than anything that can't be.\n\n♥♥♥♥ anything about the game, the russian community behind it is absolutely pisstoss. The Devs hate the NA players, don't host any english speaking events, don't regard NA player desires for the game at all and treat them like ♥♥♥♥ on their own forums. I have reason to beleive they want to kill the NA playerbase entirely.\n\nEverything Here as of the Age of Destroyers update is still true and relevant, none of these things having changed.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Destroyers:\n-They aren't fun to fight against\n-They aren't fun to try and attain\n-So far Tier 3 and 4 has Destroyers, but they're made with T5 salvage parts and materials with ungodly low drop rates, OR by flying premium ships.\n\nAS OF 1.3.3: T4 destroyers added, Rewards for Ranking up turned to ♥♥♥♥. I was almost able to make a destoyer until they turned the reward from 10 neodium plates to 1. This is a publisher that actively hates its players.\n\nThe menu and UI are even more confusing and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than before. After playing for a while longer I'd add broken and more unbalanced than before. Interceptors and no longer viable for any US players due to the horrible ping issues such as uncontrollable ship wobble, and ships are now meshing between teirs, leaking T4 ships into the t3 pvp pool. pathetic.\n\nHERE: http://pastebin.com/qeFHCQiq Are my reviews from previous updates. Ive condensed them there to make my new review more simple. Now I present to you: *FACTS* About Star Conflict.\n\n> 90% of the servers are russian based, unsuring lots of high ping and connection issues.\n\n> Power can be bought with real world currency. Let me explain how:\n\n-All Ships and Ship parts can/should be leveled up/upgraded.\n\n-Ships are leveled with Synergy, gained from winning battles and completing main missions (Called  "Contacts"). Different ships have different amounts of Synergy Levels, and with each Synergy Level you add to a ship, it's base stats increase, as well as role specific stat boosts. Alternatively, each of the three playable factions have a row of ships that you can BUY (with real $ turned into Gold Currency) and don't need to be leveled at all, all of their synergy based stats come maxed. Here's an example of each:\n\n-Ship Parts are *ALL* Leveled in 4 teirs: Mk.1 (when you buy a part), Mk.2 (which can be paid for with earned in game credits), Mk.3 (which is paid for with faction specific "Vouchers", earned by completing specific goals in battle), and Mk.4 (Which is paid for with Iridium Crystals). Alternatively, you can buy gold currency and use it to level your Ship Parts. Ship Parts include: Weapons, Engines, Sheilds, Armor, Capacitors and Targeting Computers.\n\n-Spending GALACTIC STANDARDS (The Premium Currency bought with real world money) to level any Ship Part permanently turns that part gold as well as increasing the level. Gold Parts increase the synergy gained from battle.\n\n-(WARNING OPINIONS HERE) The rate of Real World Currency to Galactic Standards is unreasonable, with prices being $15+ dollars for ship.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> Open space is restriced to Teir 3+ ships in most sectors. Each station has a maximum of 6 sectors (maps) accessable to under rank 7 ships.\n\n> Flying into open space with anything less than a High, Teir 3 ship = automatic suicide. The AI enemies are too powerful.\n\n> Open space also has PVP sectors where you may be randomly destroyed by other players with higher teir ships.\n\n> Just under $5 worth of GS can be earned through acheivements, for 10 GS each.\n\n> At Ship Teir 3 (Currently the most populated teir out of the 1k Playerbase) Reaching max synergy level on any given ship at that teir will take approx 500,000+ synergy. The synergy payout per 1 battle with 1 enemy destroyed and 0 capture points is approx 2,750 (also with no gold parts). The Grind is Real. The higher Teir Ship, the more Synergy it needs.\n\n> The incoming playerbase is nearly non-existant\n\n> The remaining playerbase has all of their Teir 1-2 ships MAXED, ensuring any new players get effectively stomped.\n\n> New content is only released for T3 and up. New ships are only available at the end game, T5 and up.\n\n> Global Chat Moderators are not official staff, and are rude and abusive of their power.\n\n> (WARNING OPINIONS HERE) Developers are just dumb, making 'balance' changes that break the weapons when they're fun and turn previously broken weapons into unfun to fight against. They say they make these changes based on 'feedback', but all the feedback comes from a micro-echelon of the highest teir players who make a point to gang up on and shun feedback that they don't like, such as "game is p2w".\n\n> This game is designed to take money and be un-fun after a certain point. The only reason it's still getting content updates (As well as the reason all the content is endgame) is because there's a market of around a thousand players who have been either playing since the beta to grind to the endgame, or paid to get there.\n\n> Player Profiles in game show the amount of ships you own, amount of ships at max level, and amount of premium ships. It is rare to find a player that has the first two amounts high without the third.\n\n> If the game was 1/3rd of the grind it is and didn't have the ability to buy power, I would have paid at least 20 dollars for it. Instead Gaijin released it as a free to play, and Im here telling you not to give them more money. Do yourself a favor, save some money, buy a better game.\n\nIf my review isn't enough: http://steamcommunity.com/app/212070/reviews/?p=1&browsefilter=toprated.","September 10, 2015","false","823.7"," 203 of 273 people (74%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","74","203","273","21","46"

From that point, it basically got worse and worse.\n\nStar Conflict is WoT in space, with huge selection of ships, great graphics and pretty enjoyable combat mechanics. Just as WoT, it's horribly grindy and developers made a few misguided decisions that made progression even harder and slower then it was at the beginning. The strongest example is the contract system: contracts are missions that pay you with reputation, that you can spend for unlocking high-grade gear for your ships. At first, they were an additional source of reputation, that you could also get just by fighting in matches. Then, it became the only source of reputation, what made unlocking good gear much harder (and slower/boring). Then, they changed the mechanism from unlocking gear, that you could then buy for every ship you own, to upgrading single pieces of equipment. I salute everyone that didn't want to barf at the sole thought of how much grinding it will get them to equip a new ship decently. And it's only one of the changes that made the grinding much more painfull then it originally was.\n\nThe game has pretty good variety when it goes to game modes and maps, which gives decent potencial for organized teams to dominate the game, maybe more then in WoT thanks to the much more dynamic battles. It also has a decent clan wars system, that can have some appeal for dedicated players. Still, the grindfest stays as the main complain that will probably make all but those with really strong will drop this game - and it really seems that since the release SC playerbase is rather getting smaller.\n\nI invested 60 euro in the elite pilot pack, but after a month I couldn't force myself to play this game any more. So, unless you're a die-hard fan of WoT that wants a new game in similar style, or you want a somewhat-casual space shooter and won't care at all about painfully slow progression, you probably shouldn't give much time to this game (though you can always try it out for some initial fun, it's F2P after all).","February 5, 2014","false","100.6"," 208 of 284 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","208","284","0","2"

Dont waste your time or money on this game and send this developer a desounding answer of their attempt as making a get rich quick game. This game sucks plain and simple.","November 10, 2014","false","1.6"," 98 of 135 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","98","135","0","1"

It had great gameplay before the patch of last year, and I gave up since. I decided to give the game a fair try by playing on my friend's account (he is on tier 4) and the pay-to-win factor is at an all time high. It gets rather annoying, knowing that a "free" to play game is so prominately dominated by people who buy their ships and weapons. Whereas in games like tf2, the people who pay get equipment that is grossly overpowered, and people who stay free--either due to no money or no care to buy things--seemingly cant win. Above this, however, I've seen problems with the administrators. They seem rather...rude, to put it in nice terms. And with that concept, they are fairly jerks. The devs are the same way, though in more of a racist aspect (Russians being the overlords).

Unfortunately the current matching process means you'll spend more time waiting than playing.\n\n- There is a prominent 'Customization' button center bottom of the UI. This button leads to a menu where credits can be spent for paintjobs and decals for your ships.

While it lacks the intricacy of research and training crew that World of Tanks does, it still has a very similar experience grind that many other Free-to-Play games have used (Mechwarrior Online comes to mind.)\n\nYou spend time working your way through the tiers of each faction, factions you can change if you have enough credit earned from fights, each tier more powerful than the last. You have four basic types available to you ranging from small Covert Ops ships, intended for sneaky hit-and-runs against specific targets, to larger frigates that are there for longer range support with repair abilities.\n\nThe game looks absolutely stunning overall, with great dynamic lighting effects that I would have never expected from a DirectX9-based game. Effects are easily recognizable as well, giving you an easy way of knowing what is coming at you and what is going out.\n\nThe UI is serviceable. It lacks a certain flavor that would compliment the theme of the game, going fo ra simple "MMO" styled hot-button interface for extra utilities that your ship may have that dominates the bottom of the screen. The targeting cursor, or the mouse in combat, can also get lost in the middle of combat as well. Since the cursor is a a little too minimalist, and the HDR causes the screen to flash white violently at times, it becomes far too difficult to figure out just where your turrets are aiming.\n\nAudio is alright. Voice acting is pretty poor, with quality on par with a modding team that doesn't quite have the experience needed to pull off something believable. "We have lost our commander!" comes out as someone just fresh from high-school trying to pretend to be in a position of authority with no believable emotion what-so-ever. They try to emphasize a lot, and in the end they sound pretty silly and cringe-worthy.\n\nOn the case of balance, low-tier equipment seems to do pretty well against anyone you'd get matched up with, but as you start pushing to higher tiered fights, the discrepancy between earnable ships and paid for or "Premium" ships starts becoming readily apparent. Ships purchased by "Gold Standards" with premium status have higher base stats than their earnable counter-parts and also manage to avoid the costs of repairs. Equipment purchased with "Gold Standards" also gives a top tier benefit that one must grind for with a specific faction to get, allowing people who pay cash to not only have a better core ship, but better equipment compared to the rest of their competitors.\n\nThe game's currency rate seems a bit strange. After checking the math, it comes to about 300 "Gold Standards" per US$1 which translates to $2.20 for the cheapest premium ship, $27.50 for one of the most expensive ships, $10 for a single month "license" that grants you increased chances for loot if you win a battle (which in turn grants credits and rare equipment), or $48 for a six-month "license" for loot as well.\n\nWhile the licenses are less expensive than that of a standard MMORPG or ♥♥♥♥♥♥me in any right, everything else seems to tack on as extras. Cosmetics also cost roughly US$0.05 each depending on their type, certain equipment to mount on your ships also add to the cost, and really feels like the entire game is based on either trying to pull as much money out of you as it can for mid-tier (as that's where most players are), or nickel and diming you to death for cosmetic design.\n\nOverall, the game can be fun, but the mid-tier combat is very much dominated by that of people who have either (rightfully) earned their equipment, or purchased it all, with premium ships looking more flashy than that of their earnable counterparts. This sets up a sense of each fight being unfair, regardless of the skill involved.\n\nIf you can tolerate the mid-field tendency for pay-to-win behaviors, and hopefully push to "end-game" tiers, then you'll have a great time with this game, but if you're sensitive to the possibility of buying out a win by equipment advantages, it may not be for you.","August 11, 2013","true","8.9"," 111 of 166 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","111","166","0","0"

Recently I feel like I've hit a giant brick wall with this game. Here's what I see of this game: it's a very high skill-cap and rewarding game which almost deliberately makes it impossible for you to improve your own gameplay. Ironic, isn't it? Let me explain.\n\n\nTypically in team games it's hard to see whether you lost because you misplayed or because your teammates failed. This problem happens in MOBA's like DotA a lot. However, those games have a nice replay system where you can actually go back and analyze what you did wrong to improve as a player.\n\nStar Conflict has nothing like that. Every loss just feels one-sided, frustrating, and not constructive at all. I don't mind losing if I can take something away from it, see what I did wrong, etc. but I can't here.\n\nThere are often times during a game where I'm not quite sure what I need to do in order to turn the tide of a game. Unfortunately there's no way for me to actually post a replay on a forum, ask for advice, get better, etc. as I used to do with any other competitive game. One, because there is no replay system, and two, because the official forums for this game seem to be inhabited by 10-year olds. The quality of posts on the official forum is downright disgusting; people start arguing with each other on every possible thread and drown out any constructive conversation.\n\nSo maybe one solution is to play with people to improve right? Well, not really... that brings us to:\n\n\nTeam play. How to?\n\nDreadnought battles between corporations are actually a lot of fun. However you can only do one battle once per day realistically (the game limits you to 3, but for most people 2 of those are during work/sleep hours), so it's really hard to actually get better at the game by playing these.\n\nMost of the hotjoin matches you play, everyone else speaks Russian. You can't talk to them, and they can't talk to you. It gets boring/frustrating really fast watching your team throw the game and not even being able to coordinate any sort of strategy with them. And guess what, you can't actually hotjoin matches with a friend unless you sync and get lucky or are content with waiting 20 minutes between games, and you can't hotjoin matches with more than one other person period. Apparently this is a actually a feature of the game.\n\nThere's this mythical game mode called Leagues where you can play with large pre-formed teams using end-game ships. My corporation supposedly has a team for this but I think they are able to play a grand total of two games a season. There's also t3 tournaments which used to be good I think, but with the addition of destroyers, the few that I've played have consisted entirely of: Mexican standoff until one minute before time runs out, then rush in and try to grab kills in the last minute. Oh and they're also Sunday-only.\n\n\nThis review is from the perspective of someone who likes playing challenging games and wants to improve and outplay other people. This game feels like it should be an appropriate game, and the sad part is I think it used to be, but it really isn't anymore.","May 10","false","377.0"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","4"

What does it means?\nWell below I will tell you why I can give thumb up and down.\n\nFirst of all of course thumb up is for:\n- small dogfights in space'\n- fast combats;\n- if you have upgraded weapons you can slayghter everyone in matter of seconds;\n- 3 big progress trees with many ships each;\n- maps are full 3D so it matters what maneuvers you do;\n- Fights are quite short and you won't spend much time in one fight (at least in the beginning);\n- The sounds are good for the ears;\n- Graphics are good;\n\nAnd now for the part that really drive me away and give my thumb down:\n- When you start the game in the beginning, probably and in most cases you will die a lot. Your ship will get rekt many times and probably you won't be able to do something about it. No matter what skills you have, if the enemy already upgraded, you have very small chance to oppose them.\n- Murphy's law- game puts you in a team, full of new players and the enemy team is with better ships, betters skills and when you spawn, you will die after 1 minute max.\n- Of course you can buy some ships that are exclusive for the money giving people (donaters) and those ships as you can think, are slightly better, at least what I saw.\n- If you enjoy capital space battles more than the dogfights, this is not the game for you. Go play Fractured space (Alpha version) or Dreadnought.\n- With the thing above,  FOR ME  game is somewhat not welcome to the new players. Making it too predictive for the future of what is to come- you either play many hours to unlock several better ships, or give some money for the better ships so you can enjoy the game.\nBut that is for all free-to-play games, right?\n\nIn the end:\nI am willing to spend start price for a game, where things are in equilibrium and I will know that people won't have advantage of this.\nAnd yes- matchmaking in all games can suck- a lot of times. So this is not exception.\nBut still I have really few hours, even not scratched the full scale of things, but I can't go on. Too unfriendly fights.\n\nSo overall I am neutral to the game, but can't give my neutral horizontal thumb.\n\nP.S. At least devs are good people and collect feedback from everybody.\n\nP.S.S.

You are pitted against super accurate pirates, cartels, etc. in a laggy environment. Facing one or two at a time is managable, but these enemies are nearly impossible to defeat in groups due to the fact that they almost never miss any shots. The missions, on the other hand, are okay, albeit difficult. Missions are supposed to require teamwork to complete, which is something that does not happen very often. I cannot count this fact against the developers, though, as promoting teamwork is usually more complex than adding different classes of ships into the game.\n\nAlthough the open world portion is only one part of the game, it is a rather large area that still needs work. I doubt I will play Star Conflict much or at all until it is fixed.

Other alternatives are signing up to their forum & contacting a moderator there to review your cencorship, but more often than not you cannot reach them at a modest time & your censorship/ban has already ended-expired because you werent able to contact them quick enough.\n\nThis is an extremely unjust moderation system & I have never seen this in any other game I have played in my entire life, there is automatic anti-spam filters, & automatic anti-curseword filters to prevent bad behavior on this game that the dev's rulebook says you cannot be banned or cencored for these counts of rulebreaking, but their unpaid team of regular player's with moderation powers ban you for these counts anyhow & thus ending up breaking the rules themselves in this regard often enough. When you are banned or cencored you are also never informed of what offence you have 'done wrong' or anything of the sort.\nYou are just banned out of the blue (I've woken up & logged on without days of palying before to find out I've been cencored fo near 6+ days before without any kind of warning from devs or unpaid mods alike or anything telling you what offence you comitted/or did wrong which is not only total clueless injustice to the player playing this game, but it is total blind sabotage to their own system promoting the offender to go out & 'offend' again unknowingly & do the same thing wrong again because he was never properly told what he did wrong.)(You also dont know which official dealt it out either so you dont know who to watch out for/behave extra well around either which also promotes repeat offences as well).\nI have inquired both the lead administrator who is presumably paid on their game's forum, the unpaid moderation team members, & devs alike how their game's cencorship/& moderation is dealt out & I am told it really just amounts to sheer numbers of reports (So you beat somebody in-game they dislike this, they call you a name or something right, you respond back, even if you didn't do anything wrong, if the reporter or other people combined/or separate over the total net worth of reports is more reports on your head than it is on yours, you will be banned. The unpaid moderators are not impartial, they do not look for truth in both sides of the reports, & they ban simply based on sheer numbers towards 1 side, weather the side with the most reports is right or wrong which promotes mass reporting to have people you dislike banned from the game.).\nThere are 2 general kinds of bans on this game, regular player ban (for exploiters/hackers), & cencorship/chat ban.\nIn order to regular-ban somebody form playing the dev suggesting ban or mod sugegsting ban need to get an overall agreement on it at a meeting w/ all the devs. The chat bans are dealt out & totally not answerable to anybody.\nA mod could ban you & aside from him & you he'd be the only one who knows about it. Devs/mods can look up ban history & review bans but its still a death sentence because you're cencored & all the dev sees is a reported/banned-for out of context comment, & only the mod's half of the story. You dont get a fair appeal or your side of the story exposed.\nI like this game, it's a good game, but I havenever seen such a corrupt/abusive ineffective moderation system like this ever before in my entire life. This game is a 100% total appalling inefficient travesty in this regard.\nModeration on this game really shouldn't be used at all since it's all automated, in-game grudges ruins an otherwise fine game because regular players have moderation powers on here.-***\n\n\nDon't let above^ review discourage you from downloading this game, it's a good game, it's totally balanced & it's well designed in terms of a company that's got moderate-to-low-funding, & it is worth playing.\nThis is no pay to win game either. I have purchased lots of $ worth of their in-game DLC purchasable ships & for the most part they are not at all end-game totally unbeatable over pwoered ships, by playing free you can equal the premiuum ship's capabilities & power it just takes you more game time to do it (Which is the catch of course, premium just lets you get stronger stuff faster, as opposed to just unbeatable storng stuff in general/period.).\n\nI do recommend you play this game & purchase some DLC (If you want to, again playing free can equal paid for ships ^^^as said above), & this game is fine as it is & it's worth playing, it's a good game.\nHowever the moderation system on this game is very very extremely appalling & if it weren't for this very very horrible system of moderation that lets regular player's in-game bias & team death match grudges ruin your time & experience on this game because they abuse & take it out on other players, this game would be absolutely 100% fine.\n\n\n\nI have played this game for 1,200 legitimate hours worth, & I have purchase some of the developer's in-game premium DLC this is not some angry rant or biased report leaning either way on soe short-term weak whim, I have been around the community the moderation methods & the gameplay for thousands of hours worth over the course of 9 months or more I do know what goes on on this game in its entirety.\n\n\nSo long story short;\nIs this a good game?: Yes\nShould you play this game?: Yes\nIs this game balanced?: Yes\nIs this game pay-to-win?: No\nAre there multiple/well varied game modes in this game?: Yes\nIs this game worth spending my money on?: Yes, if you like the game enough\nIs the game's community in general alright/polite/nice?: Yes, there are always bad eggs on every game just don't run into a bad egg with moderation powers on this game in particular.\n\n\nIf I had 1 thing to comment/say to the devs behind this game it would be this:\nI don't see why this game needs any moderation at all everything is automated so every 'punishable' offence is covered. I've seen games without any moderation filters or moderation staff at all what so ever do perfectly fine.\nThe payless staff just abuse on players whenever they feel like it or if they get mad over a multiplayer match in-game, they just ruin a game that would be 100% fine without this.\nI really hope you fix this problem it's a complete massive & unecissary blight on the game at large, & thanks.","June 15, 2015","true","237.7"," 94 of 144 people (65%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","65","94","144","13","21"

It is listed as an MMO but is nothing of the sort- yet. Right now its more of a Multiplayer Online Game with lobby based gameplay in team vs team or Team vs PvE gameplay modes.

I don't recommend buying into the game just yet unless you'll be comfortable with some possible MAJOR changes to the game.\n\nIf you enjoyed space flight sims like X3, Freespace, Colony Wars, etc. then maybe this might satisfy an itch for competitive if at times unfair combat.\n\nThe Bad, yes the bad.

I like the dueling, and some of the maps are really challenging. Progression if you spend a little money is not too slow.\n\nThe problem lies in three directions: 1) most of the players and servers are in Europe or Russia. If you live in the USA, maybe won't be too bad. But playing from Taiwan, I'm getting 500+ ping and rubberbanding anytime I play past Tier 1 (the lvl 1-3 ships). Sure there's a southeast asia option, but 10 queues later, I get an average of 1-2 games out of 10 that are located here. After 5 minutes I get drafted into another Russian game.\n\n2) The synergy build is geared to make you spend money. Sure there's a feeling of building up ships and weaponry as progression, but when you've finally maxed out all the stats on one ship, that means you ought to move on to another ship, or else waste all that ship exp/spend money to move it to "free synergy."\n\n3) PvE is a ridiculously hard compared to PvP. Invasion mode is not bad, but the rewards are terrible. The PvE missions require a high amount of coordination, so unless you have 3 other friends that want to play, forget about those. And then you're left with just PvP.. against other people at 500 ping.\n\nI want to like this game, but the way it's set up is making it impossible to.\n\n***EDIT: also, not enough English-speakers around.","April 27, 2015","false","88.0"," 56 of 86 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","56","86","3","0"

Many say "World of Tanks in space", they say that because of the following things in common : Ships organised in 3 Factions and Tech Tree, 10 minute PvP Fights (in WoT it's 20 min), Synergy gain (in WoT Experience), Clans, and a Conquest map. That is not something original or specific only to World of Tanks, but because it is so popular, that may be a reason for many to say this is WoT in space, i personally don't know. But what i do know, is that this game is fast entertainment, as soon as you hit Battle, and fight, you just enjoy it.\n\n✓Graphics\n✓Gameplay\n✓Sound\n✓Players\n✓PvE (Not in WoT :P)\n\n✗Corporations(Clans) don't have their own page in game, when you search trough them you got no APPLY button, they don't have description so you could see who can you contact to get in, hell not even displaying the leader of the clan, so you could contact him. I really don't know why, but only way you can get in a corp, is by waiting for someone to recruit on global chat, and speak with them, no other means of contact, sad thing.\n✗Full synergy ships, should get more credits and/or free synergy(like in WoT :D), at least 20% bonus, but they don't do anything special, only adding to your Fleet Strenght (a percentage based on fully synergysed ships that makes you get more synergy)\n✗There is no method (or no easy to spot method) of contacting the Devs about the upper 2 problems, or whatever inovation you want to suggest. There is a Q@A section on the official forum... ALL CLOSED, yeah :|\n✗The time to enter a battle either solo or with party, takes some time (~ 5 minutes) and there are some times when it can get to 10 minutes.\n\nOther that that this is an entertaining game, which could get you 50 hours easy, BUT, any more than that and you can get bored, depends on you and your personality, but because of that Clan contacting problem, if you are not lucky to find yourself some mates, you will eventually get bored. Try getting some friends to play with you, I mean it's freaking free, what they got to loose :)\nWhy do i say it gets boring? It's kinda grindy and repetitive, so that might get you sooner or later, it's not so very complex, but it's fun for what it is. That 'repetitive stuff' is kinda entertaining and fun, but as i said, you won't probably play this a lot, except if you got friends to play with, or a clan with nice mates.\n\nEven with it's flawss, i still recommend this game, because i consider it fun to play.","January 28, 2014","true","57.5"," 97 of 159 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","97","159","0","9"

Thats really nice in the beginning always trying to get something better :)\n\nneutrals:\n- the steering is quite complicated in the beginning but one can adapt quite fast to it. (i just tried mouse/keyboard)\n\ncontras:\n- why I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game is: after 260hours im still lvl12 of 15. and the game feels so unbalanced! Lets start prior with: there are 3 LVL ranges where you can play together: lvl 1-3; lvl 4-9 and lvl 10-15 And when you use ships at the lower level border (and you have to cause you need to level upwards) then its just too ♥♥♥♥ing difficult. lvl 4-5 is makable after some time and experience and you need not much points to level higher. But level 10-12 PVE you can just forget! hit. bam dead. I want to know if ever anybody leveld from lvl 10 without any higher ship in the team the PVE missions. Feels undoable!! Impossible! Now that leads to the fact that: people can buy higher ships and good equip for real money. Then they can play even the hard stuff. but then they make points on a ship already fully leveled and equipped and again have to spend money to process the points to other ships. thats not as claimed "pay to faster proceed" Thats PAY TO WIN\n\nPLEASE STAR CONFLICT TEAM SHOW ME A VIDEO WHERE YOU ALL HAVE JUST LVL 10 SHIPS AND GREEN EQUIPP AND LVL 10 CREW AND FINISH SUCH A PVE MISSION!\nADDON:\n-With lvl 12 engineer and good team the 10-15 PVEs are quite ok, but even then in the PVE Missions designed for lower levels are some heavy spikes of incoming enemies thats realy still hard. And one needs the points for leveling.\n\n- next is if youre doing PVE only it feels the same and same s.h.i.t all over again. Just too less different PVE missions boooooooring.\n- next: it takes soooo long to level. i have around 330 hours now and are still lvl 13 max. Things are so expensive. And with recent update they added that you need a base ammount of ships in each faction to reach the levels. That means you cant just level one ship type, you have to level many! That just increses and increases the need of doing the few same lvls thousands and thousands of times. for lvl 13 i did the 7 PVE Maps now about 1500 times - boooooring!\n- Yes you can undock from the station and stay there and wait hours and hours for some little mobs that you can kill solo for some weeny few points. boooring!\n- then they have pve maps where you just have one little spec ops ship and you can fly to the station and hide there and do nothing but hit the station whilest the others die, and these guys even get the most points. super! that forces teamplay, really!\n\nADDON:\ni just forgot.. newest thing is that they added big destroyer ships. really nice. LVL 8 the first one they are big and powerfull, can shoot over the whole map nearly and.. are only affordable to the high rank players. i mean these players that anyway have all equipp, they now also get a totally overpowered ship. so all noob players wont get a hit. nice nice. and new players cant get the ressources to build that stuff cause you only can find them in lvl 10+ regions or drops. well done.\n\nin this game as noob you have to play better than the high level to get something!\n\nsummary: Nice game but: If you try to play this game as PVE and without fix team or corporation in random team and not buying anything for real money i would not suggest you to waste the time!\n\nI suggest: dont focus on more ships and regions, focus on the balance of the game content!\n\nFor all who like pvp and like to be in a fixed group company thats a great game! :) The space scenarios are gorgeous to fly through. The game is so nice damn i just wished i could play it solo.. anyway im gona try ;)\n\nADDON: Because i dont see any process by doing the few Levels again and again.. and again i now have uninstalled the game. Just wasting time addicted.. but aint that any gaming? ö.Ö Its up to your decision.. ;)","January 24","false","460.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","2"

Nice mechanics, nice graphics, good level of detail.\nThere is one tweak, though. The game gives you very limited opportunities to earn the synergy which is required basically for almost everything in the game. Not to mention ship repairs and ammunition refills. And without your ship repaired and rockets to fire - guess what, you cannot fly out there and provide a good result in the battles.\nGlad there is one way to fix that - money. That's right, pay al least 4,5 usd for a small bundle and here you go - repair your ship, buy ammo, spend it on everythnig and anything you want.\nSo, short to say, it is kinda free and gool up to the moment you come short on synergy and stop enjoying the game.\np2w\nEdit: Oh, did I also mentioned that matchmaking is waaaaay crappy?

Not only does this game force you to essentially play all 3 races in order to get race tokens to upgrade with (or wait and hope for a kit to drop) but also it makes it mandatory for you to level up other ships just for the sake of advancing your choice of role.\n\nIn essence: You want to play medic (engineer)? Sure son, level up heavy, sniper and spy for it. So not only do i have to level up the synergy of the engineer branch, but hey, just to make sure you play for a long long time: Level up EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES, because thats how you advance your one single chosen role.\n\nI like the game, good graphic, enjoyable battles, good weapons, interesting ship tweaking and so on, but leveling up a branch is hard on its own. The moment you understand that you basically need to level up everything: Its gone. There is in no god damn way enough diversity in this game to justify 999999999999999999 hours till you max out basically everything, and then we still didnt speak a damn thing about rare crafting mats and what not.\n\nThis software makes a korean farming simulator look like a cozy little stroll in the park on a warm spring afternoon.","January 14","false","40.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","4"

(it costs this much each time if you do it, no matter how far away you are)\n\nThe fast way home is to of course die, which drains your money obviously.\n\nWhen this game was just pve missions and pvp quick play, I never felt like I needed to spend hours grinding or throw money at the game for success.\nBut now it feels like I have an anchor attached to my ship.\n\nEach gate is 10-20 km out from the last, and it takes a minute or two just to fly to each of them in a decent ship.\n\nThe missions only seems suited to tankier classes of ships as well so far, which means loss of fuel, loss of time, loss of fun.\n\nI convinced myself to redownload this game just today, and I didn't quit the game because I didn't like it either, I had just moved on to other things after 80+ hours of play time.\nBut now I'm finding it frustrating, confusing, and just generally a slog.\nBeen in now for almost 3 hours, and the most fun I've had so far was looking at all of my old ships.\nSadly 90% of them can't do diddly out in space anymore, and every single action I make prompts a pay option to win. (even an option to respawn out in the world for real life money as well)\n\nI'm going to keep giving this a shot, but I gotta say, unless they take out this stupid fuel system, speed up travel time, add quick jumping, and stop punishing you every single time you die (TAKE OUT AMMO AND REPAIR COSTS YOU SADISTS) then I would tell you to just not play this.\n\nEven the people who currently like this model have more money than brains, and I can just picture the devs rubbing their hands together in joy at all the microtransaction money.\n\n500 dollars worth of DLC?\nWhat a joke.","April 23","false","87.0"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","28","39","2","19"

There is a cost for everything, from putting a pic on your character to changing the flag you unlocked.\n\nI like the game but it is the greedy over charge for everything you click that drags it down and completely ruins the experience.\n\nYes you can even pay to win, a little ship can cost you £50 but when you use this ship you have to pay emblems again to have the xp from it that you earn, so you have to pay more everytime you use a ship you already paid for.\n\nToo much greed so i would actually avoid this unless you like to pay to respawn, and yes this game has that.","February 2","false","23.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

The developers -Very- frequently ask you to pay Galactic Standards (Real money game currency) for almost every action aside from purchasing (Most) weapons, ships, and so forth. I feel the game asks this far to frequently. Galactic Standards are required to transfer Synergy (Ship Experience, basically) from one ship into the central pond, called Free Synergy. You cannot customize your ship's appearence whatsoever without paying Galactic Standards either. I once purchased a Black color for one of my ships to also find that 1. I could not make any other ship black. 2. When I removed that permenant black color I had purchased to see if I could switch it to another ship, it locked me out of it again, and asked me to pay the required 110 Galactic Seals all over again. You can also purchase Premium 'Liscenses' to get the -FULL- amount of Experience and Credits from each round you play, instead of having it reduced by 25% without said liscense, these liscenses also expire over time.\n\nThe game is good, the payment requirements to do anything are, however: absurd, foolish, a turn off, and several other unhappy things I could name, end rant there. The game does offer 'Premium' ammunitions and other forms as well-you can also exchange Galactic Seals for Credits, allowing the whole of the game atmosphere to be seen in a very Pay To Win atmosphere. If you don't mind this as much (Thankfully the Premium ammo/etc are semi balanced with the standard ammunitions and so forth), and you solely want this game for its gameplay? Then Star Conflict might be a good addition to your game repertoire, the 'Pay for Freedom' in the game that I see however isn't going to call me back anytime soon, unfortunately.","January 4, 2014","false","64.4"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","33","50","0","0"

Fun till you hit t7 then gameplay mimics the matchmaker of grind to play games.\n\nEvery game deserves a fair review so for other players new to the grind to play match making system. The game is fun. WoT in space is a great idea. The ship variety is excellent. The graphics and game design and game modes are excellent. I especially like defend the commander recon mode. The reason I did not recommend the game is the match maker.\n\nAfter playing last night, I analyzed an 11 game losing streak. Unlike WoT I accumulated some in game currency. I have not hit t8 or higher so that is a plus (its not worse than WoT). T7 ships are cool so playing them without worry of paying to stay in game is notable. WoT you lose money at high tiers and have to grind your lower tier tanks to keep in the high tier game (or spend money). I dropped $10 into this game. Good money well spent (mercenary pack). $10 for a fun game is worthwhile for the extras from the on sale poack. I will keep playing but limit my time in game because of the match making "formula".\n\nThe 11 game losing streak  felt exactly like WoT. All my scores were average. Some scores high some scores low but overall in the losing streak my gameplay was average and at t7 I was usually the low man on the teams.You hit winning streaks and losing streaks just like WoT. They are not random. The gameply design is to keep you playing the game. Then you realize you have to beat the system. When you have to beat a system and a match maker is not random, it does not feel like a game.That is why the recommendation to other players is a no.\n\nWorld of Battles had an excellent system for matchmaking and pvp games. The developers can look at WoB fororiginal in game economy ideas. Copying or utilizing the match making game economy of WoT drove me away permanently from WoT as a hobby.","December 22, 2013","false","23.0"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","0"

The short version is: It used to be good. I loved it when it was. Now it isn't.\n\nDon't play it.\n\nI suggest you read the long version though. 3000 hours of experience means you should probably listen to it.\n\nThe gameplay, at the base level, is great. You really feel like you're flying around doing daring astrobatics, dogfighting, and frigballing your opponents with powerful weaponry that lands with resounding thuds. The massive variety of weapons, boosters, and modules make you able to customize ship builds out the wazoo and accomplish all sorts of amazing things. It's a crafter's paradise. The game's aesthetics are excellent too. Beautiful space vistas and locations that make you sit back in awe.\n\nThere is a substantial grind, but it's worth it if you put the time in, and if you think of the time spend upgrading as more opportunities to play rather than a limiter on your gear. Paying isn't so bad if you do so sparingly, if you conserve your gold and spend it on useful things like high-tier premium ships and licenses. Most anything you can pay for, you can get for free if you grind. That's the right way to go on F2P.\n\nHowever, the game is not what it used to be. Heavy server bias towards the Russians, huge ping when that's the case, and code that's very, VERY poorly run in high-ping instances. Your ship is uncontrollable and basically flies itself. The new 'join-games-in-progress' feature causes ludicrous rubber-banding and screws everyone over for the first few minutes of each battle. A firefight can get turned around completely a result of this.\n\nSeveral high-end game modes are killed by inacessibility (stupid timezones, horrendous 'scheduling' system, and timezones that all but guarantee USA players can't play them) and the regular PvP game modes all have you screwed over by unskilled noobs - and carrying them is impossible in many cases. This game was built around teamplay, and particularly bad teams are common. The playerbase is too small to offer any worthwhile fixes, and mroe and more veterans are leaving every day.\n\nAnd the final nail - rather than resolve these crucial issues which the playerbase bends over backwards to try and help the devs address, the staff pushes out more and more content that looks like it belongs in their other game, Crossout. The staff no longer understands what their own game is, and radically changes the gameplay without regard to the immesurable consequences.\n\nIt's really quite unfortunate to see. The game has all this great potential, and the devs seem to simply refuse to make the right calls on how to use it to make a vibrant and enjoyable experience. I was a part of the community for quite a while, and was a rather large figure in it. I did what I could, but ultimately this game is killing itself. The staff management's poor decisions and failure to address crucial issues will guarantee it.\n\nDon't play this game. It used to be so much better, but not anymore.","August 14, 2015","false","264.8"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","17"

I ended up waiting 5 minutes just to get into a game that lasted 2.\n\nSecond, this game is obviously pay2win in multiplayer, so far every game I've been in was full of players with dlc weapons or weapons that they shouldnt have at their rank. People were killlng me with guns that did 12,000 damage a shot when mine dont even do 2,000, So clearly the devs need to do something about that. I would much rather wait an extra minute to get into a game againts people I can beat instead of getting destroyed by kids who begged their parents for money.\n\nSo I tried some PVE, which was worse. it took around 6 minutes for me to get into a game and when I did nobody knew what they were doing.\nSo it was either PVP which is p2w or PVE which was noob fest.\n\nSo in conclusion I do not recommend this game unless they do something about the p2w multiplayer and fix matchmaking times.","October 2, 2015","false","5.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","2"

Great looking graphics and a fun concept for a game. The biggest downfalls are the PVP. There seems to be no sort of matchmaking involved. If you're new to the game you'll be dropped into battle with ships that can knock out your shields with a single round from their guns and destroy you with the second because they are two or three levels higher than you with guns and shields way more powerful than you.\n\nThe only time there is "matchmaking" is when you and a friend form a group and try to do PVP. Then you'll set there for 20 minutes waiting for the game to try and pair you against another group of the same levels. And the enemy has to have a group that matches your group, not solitary players that happen to be playing at the same time. for example, if the enemy team is made of up 5 solitary players, your group won't get put into that game. Not unless at least two of those enemy players are in a group together that matches the levels of your group.\n\nAlso, you're allowed three people in a group or squad, but you cannot play PVP with a squad of three, only two. There are Player Versus Enemy missions but some of your ship upgrades cost tokens only received from doing missions by playing PVP. So then you're forced into the very lopside PVP arena","November 19, 2015","false","7.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","1"

It's not a MMO, despite the store page telling you something else.\n\nThe game is a team based arena shooter where players can group together in corperations to accomplish bigger projects.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is smooth, fast paced and leaves alot of room for tactical play. In contrast the game is very grind heavy if you wish to fly everything it has to offer.\n\nYou buy spaceships and then pew pew either against other players or npc.\nThere are 3 different factions with three different ship sizes devided into nine classes. A fourth ship size will be added soon.\n\nEach faction prefers a other style of gameplay as does each ship size or class. I'll only be going into the sizes in this review to keep it relatively short.\n\nInterceptor:\nsmall and very agile. Can relocate very quickly and generally can always be where it needs to be at a given time. Survivability is low.\n\nFrigate:\nlarge and slow. High firepower or alot of buff abilities. Survivability is high.\n\nFighter:\nMedium sized and located between the two above mentioned in terms of speed and survivability.\n\nEach ship has slots for modules and weapons that you can fit to tailor the ship to your needs and playstyle. The customizability is high for a arena based shooter.\nThe ships and modules, as well as pilot modifications are devided into 15 ranks. The higher the rank gets, the better will the ships and equipment become. It's kept simple for new players, because you will only have a small amount of modules and weapons available at the start. As you progress, more and more options will open up.\n\nIn order to progress, you'll have to level the ships by playing with them.\n\nPVP\nThe gamemode you'll be playing the most is skirmish. Players in queue will be thrown into team based matches depending on their rank. (There is much more to the matchmaking, but this would be too much for the review)\nThe matches will have different objectives, with more opening up to you as progression comes along.\nMore advanced and interesting pvp modes like leagues or dreadnought will be available to you as you move up the ranks.\n\nPVE\nFour players have to tackle a mission with set goals against npc. There are nine different missions. Until rank four you'll have access to four of them. As in PVP, you'll get more content as you progress in ranks. Such as special missions against giant alien space ships with 12-15 players vs. NPC.\n\nFree Roam\nA set of maps connected together by warp gates where you can either pve or pvp. Unfortunately, one and the same map can exist on multiple servers. So not every player on a particular map will be able to interact with other players on that map, because he might be on a other server.\n\nMonetization\n\nThis game gets it right. No pay to win can be found here. You have your standard customization options for your ships, which can be bought for permanent use with real money or for temporary use with in game currency.\n\nThere are premium modules/weapons as well as premium ammo, but these only give you more experience and let you level faster.\n\nPremium ships do not need repairs and earn more experience and income. They aren't stronger than their normal counter parts.\n\nFinally, we've got the typical premium subscription, which will boost your income and experience gain.\n\nTo sum this section up, paying players will grind alot less, advance faster in the ranks, but will not have an advantage in battle.\n\nControls\nStandard as in most shooters, mouse and keyboard. Keys are all fully bindable. Controllers and Oculus Rift are also supported.\n\nGraphics\nNice and as good as they need to be for this type of game. They won't blow your mind, but compliment the game play and also run very well on older machines. Some maps tend to be more demanding than others.\n\nSound\nThe sound is good, if you ignore the random chatter the game throws at you occaisonally.\n"We're on the same target, shoot a missile" is neat, but after you've heard it thousands of times, it gets annoying. This can't be turned off.\n\nI do recommend playing this game with good bass and surround sound speakers. The battle sounds and explosions will be awesome.\nNonetheless, they're still good with headsets or normal speakers.\n\nConclusion with pros and cons\n\nIf spaceships and shooters are your thing, this game is definitely worth a try. It is very grind heavy, even if you let your wallet do some speaking. Nonetheless, the grind does insure, that you don't unlock everything to fast and have nothing left to aspire to.\n\nIt's not your type of game for spending the whole day on, it's rather for having a few quick rounds of pew pew and fun and then doing something else.\n\nPros\n-free to play done right.\n-easy to get into, hard to master.\n-fast paced and action loaded pvp matches with lot of tactical depth.\n-good roster of ships and classes which all play differently and can be customized differently.\n-nice amount of pve content for a game that whas built on pvp.\n\nCons\n-the grind, this game has 9 currencies and the tenth soon to come. Their purpose? Increase grind and keep you hooked longer. Could also be a good thing, depends on your view.\n-low player base. In some time zones, you'll have a hard time finding matches. EU and Russian are most populated.\n-veteran players seal clubbing in lower ranks. Fortunately, the devs are constantely working against this issue and improving it.\n-bad tutorials and explaining. The game doesn't do a good job on explaining it's mechaniks or importance of the ship roles as well as team work. As a result, some matches can become a real mess, if nobody is filling in their role or working in a team.\n\nCredit has to be given for the out of game tutorial vids and helpful community. I strongly recommend the forums and the vids linked by OmegaFighter in the comments.\n\nTips from a player\n-find yourself an active corperation. The game is more enjoyable when working together.\n-do not rush the ranks. You won't know how to properly fly your ships and will get your behind whooped.\n-be thoughtful of your ship, its role and what modules you equip for filling that role.\n-be a teamplayer. Lone wolves don't get much accomplished in matches.\n\nAuthor's notes\nIt's my first review ever. Please be so kind and leave a comment to tell me, what was done right or what I did wrong if you don't find this review helpful.","December 20, 2015","true","448.5"," 46 of 76 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","46","76","4","5"

From Tier 3 and on, if you aren't a paying player, you have an uphill climb to get enough money/upgrades/synergy to make yourself as powerful as the next guy.  If you've used the cash shop in this game, you know how utterly effortless the game can become.  You have the most powerful upgrades and ships, and you WILL dominate.  Skill IS a factor, however, and it takes immense skill to dominate Tier 5 even once you've maxed your upgrades. (through thousands of boring pvp battles, each the same as the last)  The playerbase is largely European and Russian, and queue times for a US player can suffer after dark because of this.  You do have the option to play on Russia/EU/China servers, but they are notoriously laggy and unreliable unless you come from that area.\n\nThe short of it is that as a Free to Play game, I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy.  It's a grueling trek uphill, a neverending reminder of how much more OP you'd be if you just spent 20 dollars or so.  Though, if you like the idea of putting 60-100USD into it, this can be one of the most enertaining games you could ever play.","September 14, 2014","false","51.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The best (and only) F2P game that I actually played long-term. A self-proclaimed critic of the entire F2P model (and no great fan of multiplayer interaction), this game managed to pull me in. It was gorgeous, controls were intuitive and responsive, ships felt and looked great, phenomenal weapon and component selection. I could tinker with my ship for hours!

It makes for a really isolated gameplay feel where your interactions with players are largely limited to the matches you find yourself in unless you can strike up enough of a conversation with a few of the talkative types in chat.\n\nYou play matches with wait times between how the matchmaker tries to balance teams. The game is largely divided between PvE and PvP play, with an increasingly unfair feeling PvP feel as the MM attempts to balance things. You'll often find what will feel like unbalanced matches where one side will effectively steamroll the other.\n\nAt the core, its a fancy space shooter and that shows inside the PvE with the AI being horribly predictable and abuseable. It does lean to making some of the game fun with an ease of use, but can have stark contrasts with horrifyingly difficult spikes when overwhelmed or facing some of the sporatic Bosses that don't play the same rules - not that you won't learn how to handle them, but their contrasts can make some teams stumble and falter under the shift. It adds to a frustrating feel as the game collapses and players under the pressure of the shifting difficulty  may not be able to handle it. For those that can - its a thing of beauty and a kind of fun enjoyment, but it can be increasingly few and far between with much frustration with poor matches inbetween.\n\nIt can lead to what seems to be a few players that lean on what can seem overpowered ships carrying a random PvE team, maybe abusing some AI glitches or bending the rules in a way to complete a mission instead of working as a team to complete it.\n\nThat gameplay is sub-divided between ship "Tiers" that holds a varrying degree of 3 "Ranks" within it. Ranks 1-15 is split between the 5 Tiers, making the majority of the game further split in its playerbase. Rank 1-3 is Tier 1, Rank 2-6 is Tier 2, Rank 7-9 is Tier 3, Rank 10-12 is Tier 4, Rank 13-15 is Tier 5. The major downside of this is further reducing the playerbase making some game modes unpopular and feel unplayable.\n\nTier 1, 2 & 3 are individual dificulties in PvP with Tier 4-5 being lumped together for the endgame content. The highest Rank ships in the tiers often dominate the matches, discouraging many of the ships from playing outside certain modes such as the Sector Conquest for Corporations (like Guild/Clans) for special perks. Even then you'll find Tier 4 largely not used inside PvP for its lower ranking compared to Tier 5.\n\nPvE now splits the game into Tier 1 "Beginner", Tier 2 & 3 clumped into "Easy" and Tiers 4 & 5 into "Hard". The difficulties are relative where the right preperations and a good team mix can still make the most of the match. However with the Tier split and generally lower player population the PvE is largely limited to two options unless you start up a premade team to do one. PvP remains largely random, but Tier 2 and 3 are easier to start with Tier 1 and 4 & 5 much slower, expecially during Conquest fighting times. Certain missions will feel harder or easier depending on what ships are used, and an unfair edge if felt with certain classes on many of them.\n\nThere are 3 ship types of Interceptor, Fighter and Frigate that are split into 3 sub-classes; Interceptors of Recon, ECM, Covert Ops - Fighters like Gunships, Tacklers or Command - Frigates are Long-Range, Guard or Engineer. The sub-classes largely determine gameplay styles and certain ones can frequently dominate particular match types. Interceptors largely dominate PvP and Frigates own PvE in most modes. Certain game types benefit from a different ship, such as Capt vs Capt PvP having Frigates is good and some Bosses are easier to handle with Fighters or Interceptors in PvE. But outside that the game largely breaks down into its grinding feel.\n\nYou buy ships, grind "Synergy" through use to level up and get the next Rank to progress. Its alot of rinse and repeat gameplay that can drag on easily. And by far that is the worst thing going for it. The combination of generally low population, isolated instances and sporatic player involvement beyond point and shoot makes the obvious grind a bit dull despite its fabulous looks.\n\nAs I said, and don't get me wrong - its a good and fun game, but its not for everyone. Free to play is good to try it out, but I'm not placing bets on player retention.","August 14, 2014","false","670.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

But last I checked the grind had almost doubled. Ignoring that, originally you only fought against ships of your own tier. Which was fine, the queues were only a minute long. Then suddenly they made it akin to WoT, where you can be paired up against ships of a higher tier.\n\nin WoT, irritating as it is as a lower tier tank you're still -somewhat- useful. Star Conflict? There's no real scouting mechanic. You are slower, weaker and significantly less durable than any ship a single tier higher than you. I distinctly recall firing everything I had at such an opponent, but his shields were able to regenerate faster than I could deal damage, even if he sat still.\n\nThis is the equivalent of a tier 1 WoT tank going against a tier 5 (If it were a tier 1 and 2 ship in SC). As you might guess, this is horribly misbalanced and the T1 has no hope in hell of doing a dang thing.\n\nAgain, it really pains me. The game itself was -good-, I enjoyed it. The grind increase was iffy but I could deal with it, but the botched tier matchmaking (Which evidently was an attempt to imitate other, similar, games, such as their own War Thunder, but without considering the fact that a T1 ship is utterly useless against a T2. Whereas in War Thunder a T1 plane is still capable against a T2) was what really killed Star Conflict for me.\n\nMind you, this was ages ago, so they might have changed it back, or re-balanced each tier. In which case feel free to correct me.","September 23, 2014","false","26.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The biggest frustration i had with the game was when it kicked me out or i got disconnected from a match i could not just rejoin easily. it said my ships were still in battle and i could not launch another mission unless i changed my ship. and if i got disconnected that way i would have to wait like 30 minutes before i could play again. not to mention losing everything i gained in the match.\n\n2. I would also like to see more customization for the ships. because you really can only equip one type of gun on each ship and then upgrade it. i would like to put plasma or lasers on any ship. but thats more of a want.\n\n3. another thing that would be really cool is if there was a single player campaign mode with co op options because that is really what im looking for in this game is to just play it with my girlfriend.

Paying money into this game gets you so far you could unlock every non gold ship within a few months than years on the weekends. If you don't like Pay to win I wouldn't recommend this to you.\n\nThe grind for non-gold players isn't as bad as like world of tanks as getting to Rank 6+ ships isn't hard and farming PvE is easy with friends... There is no real challange here except in PvP where the mm in my eyes tries to balance teams with atleast one good player per team but this game you need to know what to do or your team loses even if that means you get less kills or less efficany which makes the goal of an objective lost... You don't really get rewarded for spoting for artillary or Long Range ships... If you don't have capturing on (if you get hit) you lose out on a lot of points for capture (which is very high for some reason)\n\nThis game is addiciting but once you have other games to play than this one will be worthless... Invasion is horrible as getting around in larger ships is hard and since weapon balancing is off for this mode you will die and lose all the work you place into it except for some missions you do... In unsafe zones if you don't have someone to back you up or your not in a high tier ship you might as well forget getting anywhere profitable on it and do the normal PvE missions.\n\nThe developer for this game is trying to make money ONLY and not make a fair and balanced game for all...

It's not worth starting it at this point.\nThe problems it has are not unfixable, in fact, many solutions have been offered that (if the devs would listen) would make the game amazing! but that's where the problem lies: They know, they hear, and they say "who cares? buy premium xaxaxaxa"\nwould be an amazing game if it had Star Citizen's development team.","March 10","false","95.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Back in 2013 when it was at it's prime, I would've certainly recommended it. Now, I can't.\nI'll keep it simple and cut to the point;\n\n-Requires a ♥♥♥♥ ton of grinding.\n\nIt seems with every update, it requires more grinding. That burns the fun out of the game eventually.\n\n-Devs NEVER listen to the playerbase suggestions.\n\nThis is a huge problem that 98% of the players have. The devs have claimed to listen to our ideas on the fourms, but it's clear they're lying. There have been many good ideas that would make the game much better, that could be added. Yet they never do even if they claim they will.\n\n-Abusive Gm's/admins.\n\nBasically, they're either absent most of the time and let tons of rules be broken, or they're there and chat ban people who aren't doing anything wrong or breaking rules.\n\n-Server Lag.\n\nIn all honesty, if they spent more time adding more servers, and making the ones they already have more stable, that alone would make the game a thousand times better.  There's like, 8 RU servers, 4 EU, and like... 2 US. Not enough, not stable.\n\n-Lottery Style Bundles.\n\nIt's a Free to play, so of course they need money. Sure. But the bundles have a CHANCE of giving you the things they advertise, instead of a guarantee. It's a waste.\n\n-Matchmaking.\n\nDue to other issues players have, alot of people quit at rank 7, 8, or 9. This is the reason for the small playerbase, and terrible matchmaking -- most of the time the game can't find someone to match you against. I smell a Domino Effect.\n\n\nTL:DR -- Devs are braindead, and don't care about the players. Admins are HIGHLY abusive. Game is as money grubbing as EA. Matchmaking is bad. Server number is small and stability is poor. And last but not least, it's all fun and games until things turn Russian.\n\n","April 3","false","038.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","8"

PvE is pretty steep when you're low level and almost absurdly easy when you're leveled, and in PvE there are 3 difficulties depending on your level, so you'll end up experiencing it 3 times.\nOpen space has been balanced so pretty much whatever enemy you encounter will own you. Loads of people will then say you need light nimble craft to fly in open space, in other words, forget about using you leveled frigate there (incase you only unlocked frigates .. you're screwed).\nPvAI* was pretty fun since the AI spawned in ships roughly equal to your level. It was said this was too easy and would be fun if they could lenghten the mission, so the devs did, by making you fight ships 5-6 levels above your own. Now PvAI means you'll need to team up to take down an AI ship, but since they also team up (somewhat) you're better off expecting to die. If I want to die I'll just play PvP, and just PvP does not make for a good game, at least not in this game, imo.\n\n*PvAI = like PvP, but vs AI controlled ships, not the same as PvE","March 22","false","96.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm still a newbie in reviews, so I hope this is helpful to anyone thinking about playing this game)\n\nBefore I start this off, the reason I DON'T recommend the game is purely because it is STILL in open beta. And, the way things are going, it is likely to stay that way for quite a long time, unfortunately.\n\nAfter wasting countless hours in front of a keyboard on it, I've come to realise five things:\n\n1) That the game punishes you for doing good.\n2) The issues with ship balance (more specifically Premium vs. Free).\n3) The game is addictive as all hell.\n4) Leveling is a lengthy process.\n5) Gameplay is amazing. Physics are thrown out the window.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo not everything is bad, but let's expand on this, shall we...\n\n1) Punishing your victories.\nIt does. For as long as you queue solo, the game punishes you in extreme ways. If you win one battle, you get pitted against harder and harder opponents (as it should be, in any ranked game). However, the problem comes with the fact that the game punishes you by teaming you up with pilots that are... Well, let's just call them "below standard". For a fair match to occur, you'd need equal amount of skill level (Skill Rating in this game), which does not happen. And, in that sense, the Matchmaker needs a LOT of work and tweaking. So, as long as you're flying in a coordinated squad, nothing bad will ever happen to you.\n\n2) P2W? P2L? P2GL?\nThe P2W discussions are getting old, FAST, so let this be here to clarify it once and for all. THERE IS NO DIRECT P2W IN THIS GAME. What makes Premium ships overpowered is a deadly combination of ship bonuses, slot layout AND, most important of all, pilot skill. If you put two pilots of different skill rating in the same ship, not only will their fits be different, but so will their aiming skills, reactions and module timing. The opposite, however (Free ships more powerful than their Premium counterparts) also exists in the game, albeit in a large minority (I daresay 1:5 ratio for Free > Premium).\n\n3) Drug addicts!\nIT. IS. ADDICTING. Like smoking. Or any light/heavy drug in existence. You reach a point where you NEED to play it and can't avoid NOT playing it. When you are playing it, you curse yourself for still playing it because the Matchmaker doesn't give you a breather.\n\n4) Leveling all ships is a lengthy process without a paid License for bonus Synergy (required to progress in the game) and Credits (ships get ludicrously more expensive as you progress), but not horrible. If I remember correctly, it is a 20% bonus with License and the DLCs (all of them), provide another 25% to both Credits and Synergy. They might be worth it, if you're willing to spend the money on them.\n\n5) The gameplay is solid. The Physics are not. Commands are highly responsive and nigh-instant as long as your latency is low (<180) and it all happens in low orbit. Either that or the laws of physics don't apply, here, meaning the hard-sf fans will be disappointed by this game. There is a minor attrition and if you stop your thrusters and there is no inercia.\n\n\nSo, in short:\n\nUpsides:\n> Incredibly fun to play.\n> F2P.\n> P2W jokes left and right.\n> Solid, quick response gameplay.\n\nDownsides:\n\n> Expert pilots in overpowered ships.\n> Matchmaker punishment.\n> Lengthy progression.\n> Balance issues that keep getting ignored.\n\n\nSolid 7/10 game, all things considered. The downsides aren't enough to bring the game down and it IS still in beta. Give the game a chance, you lose nothing but some hours and disk space, all things considered.","June 14, 2014","false","943.3"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","12"

Without a corporation with coordination and good teamwork, you have a 99% chance of losing every single match, whether PVP or PVE. I spent the last two days playing the game after re-installing it, and the balance hasnt changed at all. Coordinated PVP teams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ randomly thrown together teams of solo players, PVE rounds that are nigh impossible to beat (After two days and 17 runs, I have yet to see the Special Ops mission even close to beaten), and constant encouragement to buy your way to the top of the game make this one of my least favorite space shooters out there.\n\nI only play this game when my other games are offline. An excellent game if you like staring at timers, watching other people play, and losing to superior forces repeatedly. Almost ZERO solo content, impossible to progress without team play or group work, and pointless to play if you are a solo player as even the top level ships can be easily popped by a small mob in the open world. Not a game for individual players. Barely a game for team players, as it gets harder to near impossible as you progress.

At it's core.\n\nThe past\n3 years ago, you would enter a game of action with lots of players, and pew pew pew.\nit's a team game, and the grind was awful, so the endgame crowd was small, but steady, with good retention, awesome corporations, lots of hopes for the future, dreams of players.\n\nThen finally progression got faster in early tiers. But instead of streamlining a grindy beta game into something rewarding and extending it with visual options, the road went differently.\n\nThe bad\nFeatures got removed, to prevent abuses, even if it didnt make sense, like information what friends or corpmates are doing. Bugs kept players exploiting mechanics or rendered whole classes unusable. Squads got reduced from 4 to 2. New rank up parts got introduced so new players can acquire their first destroyer easier, but old players were not reimbursed.\n\nSadly, while communication is being worked on, the initial setup of a separate ru community, as this game was primarily created for the russian market first, is an additional hardship the devs have to overcome - but in that regard I hope for the best - even if most of the PR is straight out of the 80s and many things just sound strange, backward and small-minded if you got used to how other game developers work in the Internet.\n\nNew things are constantly introduced like someone is afraid, people will actually have fun in the game. There is simply no realistic relation anymore between what is obtainable in the game by gameplay, and pay2grind-less. It's even too grindy if you spend a fortune on it.\n\nThe Good\nNot that unlocking everything is important, since most probably many people would play this game even after unlocking everything.\n\nBecause, from its mechanics, its cool.\n\nMy recommendation: play it, have fun, but think twice about investing. This is why I can overall atm. not really recommend the game, but on the other hand play it myself casually still.\n\nThe community is currently regaining consciousness, and plans have been revealed to deal with current problems. However with the lobbies in place, where some people are in power, who have little to no competence regarding their duties, I doubt the devs will really change the face of the game, without a complete change in their self-criticism.\n\nBecause that is my greatest complaint, after 3 years, the game still feels like a beta, in terms of progression and game modes, simply because too much is changed often without proper foresight.","May 26","false","180.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

As you can see I have put some hours into the game. Until the most recent update that introduced Destroyers into the game it was relatively well balanced for those that took advantage of the F2P model against those that choose to pay for upgrades, various ships and what have you. Those days are over. This is now a complete P2W game (not the first and will not be the last). You have to have a lot of rare components in order to "build" a destroyer, let alone upgrade the modules and weaponry. If you pay you can of course do this far in advance of those who choose to stick with the F2P offering of the game.\n\nOverall I believe the game is (was) fun to play under the F2P model and still probably is if you are willing to put up the cash to keep up with the new class of ship.

The game currently features some PvP, PvE and PvAI scenarios. You get to pick one of three factions, Jericho, Federation and Empire, each with unique stats on their ships.\nThe combat in Star Conflict feels solid, there's always bullets, plasma, lasers and rockets flying in all directions, and it's ships do not fly like Star Wars, as they fly like planes in space, here ships can remain still, move in all directions without limitations. You get to pick one of three ship types at first, Interceptor, Fighter and Frigate, from smallest to biggest.\nThe game itself puts heavy focus on team work. PvE Missions and PvP requires some co-ordination with your team. Truth be told, when a team works together they are unstoppable.\n\nMy favorite type of ships are the Fighters, and it's role Tacklers, focusing mostly on throwing de-buffs and cloacking behind enemy lines.\n\nThis game is to be experienced with friends and comrades, and if you need someone to guide you, let me know, In-game my nick is Richyda.\n\nPS: If you wish, use this code to be my refferal, we both gain Galactic Standards from it, which is ingame currency.\nD42BF26E5AFF755DBE6571472126F2A7 Use it just when you are about to select your starting faction, thanks!","May 21","true","256.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

Star Conflict is an arcade-style MMO space shooter game, offering PvP (team deathmatches, capture the beacon, etc.) and PvE (set missions, instanced "open space") game modes.\n\nOverall, I have enjoyed it and would recommend as a fun game, primarily for its PvP modes, but with caveats. This game is for people who like flying around in pew pew space fighter ships; it is NOT a macro/econ type game (e.g. EVE) on a vast scale. Playable maps are bound (but rather beautiful to play in IMO), and "open space" feels obviously instanced, i.e. it isn't truly "open space."\n\nPROS:\n- Fun arcade-style space shooter game (primarily PvP--again, IMO)\n- Multiple ship classes to choose from, build customization\n- Pew pew lasers, missiles\n- PvP modes are fast-paced\n- Free to play (F2P), with purchasable extras (game is not Pay to Win (P2W), IMO)\n\nCONS:\n- Small game population (queue times, matchmaker can be annoying)\n- Grind becomes rather evident\n- Underdeveloped econ system; no player trading\n\nIn conclusion, it's a free game, and can potentially be a lot of fun. It does take a bit of time investment, but for someone who's looking for a space fighter game, this might be a good one to take a look at.

There is no way you can get them in an hour or a day or even a week.\n\nDevelopers say it is a team game, but unfortunately it is not. In fact it punishes you for being in group with a friend, increasing your queue time dramatically. If there is no any other group to place against you, just forget about battle.\n\nOpen space is very limited and boring. Randomly generated quests are basically 3 types: kill a thing or many things, protect the transport, fly to to another thing and activate/pickup it, and activating and picking it up is the same action to be honest. Some of daily quests there are too difficult for a single person, but you will never find anyone to help you because as said above, there is no reason to team up, unless you want to wait half a day to enter pvp battle.\n\nWant to give developers feedback or report a bug on their forum?

It's been an excellent time sink for me, with a great concept with wonderful graphics (that still runs pretty nicely - with the exception of one map - on integrated graphics if turned down a tad) and a neat community that has its own quirks. As it's free, if anyone asked me whether or not to give it a go, I'd say absolutely. That's not that it doesn't have its problems, though.\n\nPerhaps the worst of these is the blatant monetization. It was less apparent when I started, probably a combination both of more monetization as you progress and more monetization as time went on, but at this point, it's practically screaming for money. There's myriad kinds of in game currency, eight of which are free, and one of which is premium. The primary currency, credits, is earned by simply playing - neat enough. But six of the remaining require you to do certain tasks while playing, many of which are extremely difficult. Even if you do complete some, these tasks are then put on cooldown for some value of time between nothing - for the lowest paying ones - or 17 hours - for the highest. Complicating matters further, one can only earn two of these six at a time, and must pay roughly 20 minutes worth of credits to change which two - or skimp out and pay with premium. These six currencies are used to pay for certain equipment upgrades, which can also be skimped out on and paid with premium. The other free currency not yet talked about is perhaps the only one in abundance that doesn't really encourage anyone to skip out and pay with premium for.\n\nThe premium problem does go a bit further, yes, but not that much. There exist premium ships in the game, and while they typically have a slight advantage - easier progression, no upkeep fees, the tiniest of extra customization, get in the same queue as a slightly lower ranked free ship - they're not honestly that great. I've used one myself, and heard from several veteran players that they're not that much better, and in some cases, are even slightly worse than their free counterparts. Premium currency can be used for the things mentioned in the paragraph above, but those are mostly convenience fees, albeit "convenience" in the sense of "how it should have been done in the first place because the system is a tad bit too grindy for most people". But perhaps the biggest travesty is that customization of ships - and I'm not talking about buying passive modules and such - is so ridiculous. To buy a colour, one must pay roughly a dollar's worth of real world money. Each ship has three colours, even, so to fully customize a ship, that's three dollars. Now, that might not sound ridiculous, but these colours do not transfer to any other ship, and if you wish to change the colour once and then back again, you'll have to pay to change it twice. Same deal for stickers. You can't simply "unlock" a colour or a sticker, neither for your fleet nor for you ship, but must instead buy them on a per-instance basis.\n\nNow, all that said, would I still recommend this game? Hell yes. Even if monetization is being pushed ridiculously hard, it's still a /good game/ at its core. There's no other game out there that makes use of the third dimension like this one. The mechanics are still wonderful as ever. My favourite part is that skill is valued over hardware, 90% of the time. There's both a casual base and a competitive base, so there's neither a push nor a restraint on getting better at the game. There's an official forum where the active community gets together and talks about the game, as well as whatever else.

The ships handling is fast, responsive, easy to learn, and will allow you to move your ship more or less any way you would want to.\n\nSecond, the quality of the graphics is very high, I would even go as far as saying they are beautiful. The last space game that I played was freelancer, and this game totally blows freelancer out of the water when it comes to the graphics.\n\nThird, the overall layout is intuitive and easy to understand. You will have no problem at all figuring out where you go to get new weapons, or what you have to click to go do missions, everything is layed out in a simple but good looking interface.\n\nHowever, the game suffers from that DLC nonsense we have all seen time and time again, and has other problems too.\n\nThe biggest problem for me, is how generic everything is, it has a serious lack of personality. While the graphics are beautiful, they are beautiful graphics of generic looking things. Generic space stations, generic ships, generic races/factions, generic everything.\n\nThe whole game, feels like it was put together by highly competent and passionate developers, who were forced into doing things the way the suited business men wanted it done. Namely, DLC and stuff.\n\nTo me, it feels like a game that was made to fit a business model, instead of a business model made to fit a game. In other words, I think the idea to make money from a space game came before the idea to make a space game with this one.\n\nThe second biggest problem, is that if you want to go PVP, or PVE, you have to wait to join some seperate instance thing. This procedure can take as much as a minute or two, and it causes the game to feel fragmented. Personally, I would preffer a large open space to explore, rather than lots of seperate instances to load.\n\nOverall, considering how much choice there is out there, I would not recommend this game.\n\nHaving said that, it is totally free to download and play, and you don't really have anything to lose. The file is a few gig, and there will be an update after, so maybe leave it downloading and installing over night, and give it a try the next morning.\n\n5/10 that could so easy be a 10/10 with some tweeking.","May 9, 2014","false","2.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virtus90/recommended/212070/","Virtus90","Septimus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virtus90/","68 products in account","Despite the promising teasers and exciting premise of a proper space dogfighting experience, I feel Star Conflict falls short of delivering a flat out entertaining experience. There exists a double edged sword when it comes to offering a free to play title along with paid content. On one edge, you've got the semblance of a fully enjoyable well balanced title. Obversely, there is that nasty temptation of paying to bypass grinding or paying to compete with other paid players. Star Conflict is no stranger to this system, and offers the payment option quite often, as many times as it can. Whether this be through pop ups offering deals on standards, or through post match reminders along the lines of 'this is how much you COULD have earned if you were premium.' I may be biased towards the F2P format for games, but when it's that in your face, it gets quite frustrating.\n\nAdmittedly, SC is not without it's fun. At it's core it's a very pretty, smooth running game. There is plenty of visual candy to keep your attention focused on combat. PvE is an excellent alternative to dodge the paid players in PvP, and is done well enough that it's not inherently obvious you're playing against bots. They mostly consist of strike type missions mixed with capturing points. This is one of the few redeeming features I see, aside from other basic, but desperately needed additions such as a daily log in bonus (after five days, a free player can get 24 hours of premium status). Honestly, PvP can be avoided altogether if one absolutely wanted to. You get a decent amount of credits in the beginning to buy a few ships, but I started to notice the ships were getting more and more expensive when climbing the level tree. The daily login bonus coupled with the PvE missions were keeping me afloat and able to pay for ammunition after every match, but any more ships, and I feel I would start getting credit starved. This is where the curve starts to kick in, and it becomes ever more tempting to buy into the game to continue your progress. Progression is choked further when attempting to sell ships and recover some credits for the next level ship; I received a quote of exactly 1 credit when attempting to sell my used gunship. Not sure if this is just because it's a low tier ship, or because you genuinely get no credits for used ships. Thus, you are forced back into the same PvE mission to grind for more credits.\n\nDue to how heavily insistent the game is on purchasing credits, I cannot recommend this game to any serious player. At most, a few hours of fun can be had from progressing a few levels and playing through several PvE matches. Heck, you may even play a few very one sided, poorly matched PvP matches against high tier players too. Play the game for a bit, get what fun you can out of it, and leave once it stops being fun. Just don't spend any money on it, and you can leave guilt free.","December 17, 2014","false","5.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

It doesn't want to be either.\n\nThis game is a lobby based, free to play fighting arena game, settled in space. You have several ships at your disposal, with different classes and a lot of modules and modifiers to customize their performance. Then you go into battle in teams against other people in several game modes like the usual team battle, king of the hill, capture points etc... So far really standard.\n\nWe can say that it is very similar to Warthunder of World of tanks, but with spaceships regarding the pvp skirmish matches.\n\nThen you have also High end content for clans with rewards if you conquer some of the sectors, which is nice for hardcore players, since you can even win a few premium currency here and there.\n\nNEW!: High end content has been reworked and now you can battle other corporations with your own corporate dreadnought. The attacks and defences are all happening in the open world map, so it is all integrated in the same place, instead of random sectors as it was before. So far it looks nice and helps with immersion. Dread battles feel like a mashup of all modes, since you have beacons (dread tactical devices) bombs, and a lot of tactical choices. The battle feels gorgeous and I remember in the first 2 or 3 games I was just watching the new graphics instead of playing.\n\nThe only problem so far is that most of the corporations just fight over the small sectors, and the tier 4 were contested in the first week and since they they haven't changed. I suppose with time more and more people will join the fray. But the tier 3 sectors are really, really contested.\n\nAnd finally, what makes this game very balanced is that you can also play missions or scenarios in a Co-op fashion with friends, or straight open world and do PvP (pilot killing) or PvE vs AI.\n\nThe open world is not like Eve online, is more like a huge sandbox map, with some RPG like missions (go there, kill 4 wolfs, come back, go there, pick some asteroids and return) and people to interact with. But you have respawns and you don't lose your stuff if you are killed, so it is more arcadish.\n\nGood thing is that the open world comes with a simple manufacturing tab which allows you to manufacture special ammo, weapons and consumables with the resources collected in there, and also 3 top tier ships which can be configured as you want when you are building them.\n\nThe business model is akin to said games (warthunder, world of tanks) so you have to play and unlock ships with experience, credits and several special currency to get better and better modules. Investing money in the game gives you economical advance, as it is usual in this games, but so far there is nothing you can get with gold that you can't get for free. You will just have it later.\n\nConcerning most of the complains about the pay to win in premium ships, premium ships are not better than standard ships. They have the same slots than their credit counterparts, and the bonus are different, but not better. Modules can be shared between ships so there is no difference either.\n\nThe problem is that in the tech tree, the credit ships appear with their level 1 stats, and premiums always appear with full level, because they are sold that way. But after you level your credit ships you will see that the premium ships are not better.\n\nSo my final verdict is still a 9, because the Dreadnoughts are still in developing (not tier 5 Dreads yet) but we are almost there. All other balance issues with the new consumables had been fixed, and currently only the Destructor weapon is a pain in high tier beacon games. But I hope they will fix it as well.\n\nPROS:\n- Good art and graphics.\n- Runs well in mid and low end computers.\n- Free to play, it won't hurt your wallet if you try it.\n- Fast paced action and a good number of game modes.\n- PvP, PvE, and a sandbox with both, all in the same game.\n- SPACE DUDE!! SPACE!!!\n\nCONS:\n- A good chunk of the population is russian, so expect longer than average waiting times out of russian or european prime time.\n- Servers are a bit unstable sometimes, but this is something I'm finding in almost any late game.\n- Population is not as high as in mainstream games like world of tanks or warthunder. You won't notice it in low - mid tiers, but top end content lacks a bit of players.","October 25, 2013","true","073.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","1"

Sadly, the content becomes rather dull, and there is a considerable amount of grind. For new players, the lower levels can be painful, when higher players, tired of not finding games, come into their tiers with matched, but maxed ships and ruin their progress by sealclubbing. Overall, if played for free, a decent game.","June 27, 2015","true","368.7"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","1"

(And looking back, they were all good)\nThere are a lot of people giving "bad review" without understanding completly the game or having see all the content that the game can offer.\n\nTo prevent the wall of text !\n\nGameplay : The game propose various ships (3 Classes each divided in 3 differents roles for a total of 9 roles) offering tons of diversity fitting to what you want to do or how you want to play.\nSecondly, at the difference of most of the other games, you are not limited to 1 ship per battle, you can bring 3 (then 4) differents ships in battle adding much more possibilities and gameplay than any other games.\n\nStar Conflict also have various gamemodes :\n\n_PvP : 6 differents gamemode (From Team Battle to Capture mode ectect) with 15 different maps (each map have its particularities and design)\n\n_PvE : Multiple scenarized missions in group for all levels granting you an easy way to get money and loots (1 garanted loot per day)\n\n_Raid : End Game content, there is only 1 available but fighting a big Alien have no price (I don't want to spoil :D)\n\n_Open Space (aslo called Invasion) : It's an open world mode where you can fly throught differents sectors, doing missions, collecting ressources, killing others players or NPC (Killing Players is better !) and Aliens ! (Aliens hurt hard)\n\n_Tournament : Every Sunday we have multiple tournament that you can join in group or as a Solo Players granting you free Gold Standard (a little amount but its always nice to have them ;) )\n\n_Dreadnought : Soon :D\n\nFor the Ships:\nIt's extremly easy : Standard Ships or Premium, they all have the same power so there is no problem with them. Each Ship is unique with its own stats and bonuses, you will see each new ship like a new adventure.\n\nTo detail a bit more, the Ships are divided in 5 Tiers, each tier have 3 Ranks. All ships in ONE tiers can beat each others.\nAnd each have its own gameplay, you just need to find the ships corresponding to you :)\n\nTo answer to some complains about P2W :\nNo, the game isn't P2W. Premium Ships will never garantee you victory, as well they will never grant you better stats.\nThey are interesting if you don't have a lot of time to play to progress a bit faster or support the game. (Note there are tons of sold)\n\nGraphism : The Design and the Graphism are really good for a F2P game. It's fast and smooth and pretty cool :D\nThe game does not require a big computer to be played, it's an enourmous point, even small config can enjoy the game.\nIn more general terms, the game is really well done and "EXPLOOOOOOOOOOOSIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" !\n\nI'm really enjoying the game and it's evolution.\nThe grind is proportionnal to the time you can invest in the game. The more you play, the faster you progress but I prefer to recommand to take your time will progressing. StarConflict is a complete game with a lot of mechanics that you will have to use/understand at a certains points and the community is always here to answer your questions (Chat or on the forums).\n\nThere are too many things I like in this game and not enough time :D\n\nThe last thing I can do is this :\nI can't give you  a better advice than "Test the game by Yourself and make your own opinion, take your time to see everything".\nIt's a F2P game, it will cost you nothing !\n\n...\n\nOkay, if it's doing the same thing to you than what happened to me, your life and your soul will be captured by the game.","April 7, 2015","true","781.1"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","15","28","3","3"

(it has to be mentioned, despite my love for the game...)\n\nFairly small matches in higher tiers\n\nLow population on anything other than EU/RU prime time\n\nHigh ping for US pilots on RU servers and vice versa\n\nHigh grind, but hey? who want a game you can complete in two days?  Also there are plenty of ways to reduce grind by using real money, if that is what you are looking for.\n\nPreviously I would have said lack of communication on the dev's behalf, but this seems to have changed recently\n\nDifficulty to get matches in squads, since with the current system, a squad of the same size as yours has to queue up also, before you can get into a match.\n\nSome tips for someone trying the game for the first time:\n\nPlease try the game until tier 3 (ranks 7-9) at least.  This will give you the best overall view of the game, as t3 is where you get the largest PVP matches, and where most of the intercorporate tournaments happen.\n\nJoin a corp as soon as you reach t2/t3, and ask around for a corp that uses voice comms.  You can easily find one on the forum.  Joining a corp will help you make friends, and make the most out of the game.  They can give you advice, ship builds, squad with you, and just generally have a good laugh together!\n\nThe forum has a lot of information. Get involved! Ask questions and the game's veterans will be glad to help you! (maybe your thread will turn into a huge off-topic debate, but that's another matter...)\n\nTry all ship types from all factions, before you choose your favourites.  They all have very different playing styles!\n\nPVE can be very useful to gain credits rapidly, while PVP is better for synergising (levelling-up) your ships.\n\nWatch out in Invasion, there are pilots like mysself lurking around ;) If you just want to farm bots, don't forget to put your station protection on before undocking.  Also don't forget that certain zones have no station protection.\n\nI look forward to meeting you on the battlefield!

I haven't seen any bad administrating or admin abuse in this game in all the hours I have played, but I have heard that the GMs run a tight ship & don't put up with nonsense as in other games (like racists rants in-game or use of foul language in chat), so these are probably just people who got a timeout for spamming the n-word, or a hateful clan taking out their anger. In fact the devs put on fun special events that anyone can participate in & you will get great prizes & they are really nice, even giving new players tips & advice no matter what country you are from.\n\nThe game isn't grindy at all, if you are an average player you can probably unlock a different ship each day in just a few hours of play & each ship comes fully loaded with a free set of weapons & modules so it's ready for battle. Compared to other free to play games the grind is miniscule, & with each step your ship & your whole fleet gets more & more powerful, any reviewer who says this game is a grind obviously hasn't played many free-to-play games.\n\nIt's not a pay-to-win game at all, what you can buy as for DLC packages doesn't make you better & the ships you can unlock in-game & the custom ships you can build in-game are either on par with the premium ships or in most cases even more powerful than the premium ships you can buy. So why do people buy the premium & DLC packages? Well it's very simple, would you rather play a lot, or pay a little to progress a little faster (this is the same as all the other free-to-play games out there). If you have a job you might be willing to spend some money to support the game & get some cool looking ships/ decals/ & extra synnergy gain. If you don't want to spend the dough then just play more & you're on par with all the players that have bought something (how do you think the company will make the game & manage it without some sort of transactions taking place?).\n\nAlso they give free premium money (Galactic Standards) away all the time for answering in-game questionaires (like which ship do you like best?, etc.), They give free premium money away EVEN FOR COMPLETEING ACHIEVEMENTS! <-- how many other games do you know that do this?\n\nThey have excellent sales on non-premium ships & stuff as well as packages/ premium stuff all the time. If you think the DLC is expensive & you still want it, just wait for it to go on sale, but really you could own everything premium in-game for a fraction of the cost of other free-to-play games (or just get premium standards from achievements, inviting friends, etc.).\n\n\n\nSo what is great about this game & why should you play it:\n\nIt has PvP matches of many types & plenty of action with matchmaking.\n\nIt has PvE matches that are really fun.\n\nIt has special events/ deals/ & free stuff all the time.\n\nIt has an Open-World too, with many diverse star systems & fun missions to do, or you can just stealthfully search for loot worth in-game money & components to build stuff with (these "star systems" change month-to-month as different factors occur, like for example: alien invasions & systems being destroyed or over-run). Watch out for the other players though if your hauling a full load of loots back to the space station otherwise you might get nabbed, hehe :)\n\nIt also has a "sector control" component (basically sections of space where your faction can battle for control & this then gives your faction bonuses).\n\nIt has a component kinda like Real Time Strategy where you can send your unused extra ships out on contract missions & you get ship parts & munitions if they are successful.\n\nIt has the fun 6 axis space flight system & you can just use a mouse & keyboard to play, or use a joystick if you want.\n\nIt's only a 5GB Install (which is surprising considering the size of space depicted & what is all in this game).\n\nYou can play with friends/ with a large corporation/ or be a loner it really makes no difference.\n\nThey give out free premium credits (called Galactic Standards) & free stuff all the time & you get nice freebies every day just for logging in!\n\nYou are able to craft your own weapons/ munitions/ ships/ etc. (but you don't have to craft anything just to be successful).\n\nYou don't have to play everyday just to be competitive. Play it for a few hours & you can set it on the back burner & come back to playing later, or play everyday cause there's plenty to do. You won't be compelled by some outrageous subscription fees or feel that you're falling off by not playing like other space games.\n\nBeautiful graphics & space scenery & you can decorate your ships with skins & decals (my favorites are the pirate flag, old roger, & the snooker (8-ball)).\n\nGreat audio & reactive in-game music that changes depending on what your doing (like when your in combat or enter a different star sector, or just chilling out floating around in space looking for some minerals, components, parts, or other loot).\n\nHuge Dreadnaught ships are coming soon (these you will probably be able to launch other ships from, or man the cannons upon with a group of players).\n\nBe a good guy, be a pirate, be a mercenary, or search the stars & scavenge for minerals & investigate destroyed ships for cargo & parts for crafting weapons & etc., pilot small fast interceptor ships or huge lumbering frigates & everything in between, lock on with missiles, activate a plasma web that fries your enemies, lay a minefield, self destruct to take out that enemy that's dogging you at the last minute, launch a torpedo & TV guide it toward your enemies, equip a ship with attack drones that chase after your enemy or pilot a ship with defense drones that fly around your ship attacking anything that comes too close & then they repair your ship when needed, pilot a long range frigate with a sniper rifle like cannon on it to take out enemies from far away, drop a warpgate & fly through it to speed across great distances, cloak your ship to make a hasty retreat or sneak up on your enemies & surprise them when they least expect it, use a plasma arc to cut your enemy's ship in half, support & repair your comrades ships & reinforce their shields, ram the enemy to death, deploy a bomb to blow up pursuing ships as you speed away from the blast, equip a gravity beam to slow your enemy down so they can't escape your wrath, use a parasitic remodulator to steal energy from your target, & so much more I can't even list it, & do it all in the same day!\n\nSound complicated? It's really not & you won't need a mathematics degree to play & be successful. Also the devs & population is really friendly & helpful as far as I've seen.\n\n\nThe most compelling reason to play is that it's COMPLETELY FREE!!!. If you're thinking on dropping the big bucks to buy a subscription or just a single ship for one of the "other" space games out there or you're not sure if you will even like these types of space games, consider trying this game first & it will give you a taste of what you might expect from a well built space type game & you can have many ships of all different types & sizes to choose from, without the huge pricetag! If you find it's not for you you can always uninstall & go buy a $25,000 dollar ship from a guy named Chris or be an Elite Delivery Man & be bored, hehe :)","February 16, 2015","true","202.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

After that its hard core grinding and moving along. :) Also highly recommended to join a Corporation since they will usually help u advance and lvl up. :) Ive been playing this game for a few years and enjoy playing it every time :)\n\nFor corporations to join if u like nice people, respect and NO DRAMA, I recommend checking out http://JungC.ORG\n\nOther game info:\nGame has dramaticly improved and is way better then it was a few years ago, though i hope they dont over do it now.\n\nPVP aka Skermish\nPVE aka VS AI\nSector conquest aka t4-t5 ships battle it out sectors for their faction and Corporations\nOpen Space aka some places pvp some places pvp and pve and some sectors can be captured by corporations\n\nUPDATE 27th march 2016\nOk now we have pvp vs AI? and destroyers. Oh and it's definitely a PAY to WIN game. Sadly they over did it...\n\nUPDATE: 24th May 2016\nSo the PVP vs AI thing (aka Co-Op) has its ups:\n- Less wait time for matches.\n- Can creat a wing (have 8 - 16ppls vs AI).\n- The Destoyers... Very nice well done. Best in open space with good team mates (Finaly can take out Predator :).\n- About the pay to win thing.... You can now get premium ships without paying real cash. yes its true, 3 of them to be exact and they are quit unique if i may add.\n- Though with all this, yes you can have nearly everything in the game for FREE, if you spend about, lets say 4hrs a day, 5 days a week, for 2 years.\n- Still very fun game love playing with the team. :)","June 1, 2015","true","498.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Not for me.\n\nI dont feel developers should be allowed to accept money for in-game items that are subject to change at any point because the game is still technically in BETA. Figure out what you want to do then start charging. The game feels like its always wanting real money for something. Ammo, paint jobs, rolling on good items (with a very low chance of aquisition), ships, pilot license that expires and has to be renewed (gives XP boost that is almost necessary for any casual gamer). The list goes on.\n\nNo one wants to buy a Corvette on Monday just to walk out to a Pinto on Tuesday, because your dealership is in BETA. This is a horrible way to run a game.\n\nPROS: Fast and smooth gameplay. Really is a good engine in my opinion. You dont HAVE to pay anything.\nCONS: Money Pit - Forever in BETA - P2W (Worst parts of F2P - You FEEL like you need to pay to compete)","January 13, 2014","true","154.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Gainjin seems halfway decent in War Thunder, making the grind not so bad.  This game on the other hand is a damned grind-fest. We play games to wind down after work, they shoudln't feel like a second freakin' job. Also, dunno if the admins are from gaijin (I wonder) or from Star Gem, but they... are bad.  I felt like the several interactions between players and the company's lackeys was very unprofessional and felt like the admins were 12 year olds on a power trip. They're also extremely absusive towards players, and dish out lots of trash-talk but can't take a professional sounding rebuttal.\n\nKind amakes me sad because the engine behind the game is really good, and there is a lot of potential there for them to have an excellent game, easily outclassing many others in the genre.  But the company's incessant demand for pay2win and abusive admin/GMs ruin the game.","December 28, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You'll be able to get the ships\nyou want faster by using this method. Once in T5, you can even gain huge amounts of extra synergy.\nOf course, currently, if you want to transfer extra synergy to other ships that you just don't want to grind, you can simply pay a small fee to transfer the synergy from your T5 ship to your T3+ ships when you wish to skip a few ships to the one you like.\nAgain, I really enjoy this game and will start playing it again as soon as I gain a computer that won't fry on me like the last one. :D\n\nThat is all\n\n- WolfKhan","June 5, 2014","true","637.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Perhaps the best space fight simulation game I've ever seen. I especially like the combination of sandbox flavor and "WoT" flavor: You can immediately jump into a PVP or PVE fight from the hanger, and you could also choose to loot resources by traveling through systems. Good news: your ship won't be lost if destroyed during a loot. Unlike EVE. That's good to know.\n\nAs most people have pointed out, like World of Tanks, this is a "pay to advance" game instead of a "pay to win" game. What you can really do is use dollars to: 1. buy premium ships and jump directly to the corresponding tier; 2. buy premium license to accelerate synapse and credit gain. Neither will help you win in the game. It might actually hinder winning, since jumping to high tiers means you lack the experience to fight those veterans.\n\nHonestly, I might be one of the "wallet warriors" some people refer to. I'm willing to spend a considerable amount of dollars into a game that I really like. And Star Conflict is one of them.","April 9, 2015","true","105.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

SC abuses you for not paying(the most expensive and extreme I've encountered). Player base too small = queues are long, matchmaking doesn't work, no gear and fully geared players always in same matches.  Learning curve is ♥♥♥ backwards. Older players ignore objectives to stat farm new players. New Players don't know how to play objectives. Objectives are mostly ignored by all. PAY MONEY!\n\nMy stats for the game dont look great but that's all the time I spent helping/training new players. Made video tutorials and dedicated the vast majority of my time to helping new players get into the game.I thought that I'd help the game find its feet but the developers lied to us about what they were developing; it's not a game, it's punish-you-for-not-paying software.\n\nPre-release the interface was not litered with "Buy this or that". The very first thing I noticed on release day was that the interface was suddenly filled to the brim with "Give Us Money" buttons, I mean filled to the brim: every weapon or item has the Premium stamp on it in one way or another. You can't ignore it, every menu or button you click will shout at you to pay money.\n\nI ♥♥♥♥in' wished I could install adblock in Star Conflict because the money whoring was so explicit that it became tiresome. If you don't pay you're not gonna have a good time m'kay. And ♥♥♥♥'s expensive yo. All progress is incrememntal and every step of the way features some way for you to pay. I mean hell, I would have paid NOT to see all the ♥♥♥♥ing money whoring.\n\nProgression:\nUsing phrases like learning- or skill curve is misleading as the game is designed in such a way that NEW PLAYERS WILL HAVE THE MAXIMUM DISADVANTAGE UNLESS THEY PAY. It's not pay to win, it's pay or get slaughtered like confused sheep over and over and over and over and over and over again. It's ♥♥♥ backwards because each time you level into a new Tier you have to grind to upgrade your weapons, grind to upgrade your ships etc. This means that the only time you can compete on equal footing is when you have unlocked and maximally upgraded you ships/weapons/mods.\n\nQueuing:\nIn the years I spent in this game a very very low percentage of new players stuck around. On release day they hid the PLAYERS ONLINE meter from the community. The queues are long and queuing in a group is painful and long and awkward and just kind of ♥♥♥♥♥ all round.\n\nGRIND!\nYou HAVE TO GRIND for countless hours to get anywhere. Each time you move to a new level in the progression you have GRIND every ship and every weapon just to compete with guys who have fully pimped out ships.  The grind wears you down till you stop playing the game or spend money. In the meantime you will be abused by players with much more powerful stuff. The best you can hope for is to eventually become one of the abusers yourself.\n\nThe f2P claims for this game are BS. You get to "play" for free but you have to pay or die of old age before you will get anywhere.\n\nWhat could have been great turned out to be nothing more than yet another soulless cash grab.\n","July 24, 2015","false","226.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The flight system is a modified version of the one used in Warthunder and expirienced players will have no trouble. It can take a few minutes to get used to flying with no down or up, but it can by fun to disorient players by coming at them along an odd attack angle. The game forces players to think in 3d, going under and over to flank instead of around, because there is no down in space. The crafting system works well and forces you to carefuly consider your play style. Best of all the dreaded "Pay to Win" system is mor limited than most. Synergy transpher, DLC, and Premium ships are the only noticable advantages. Premium ships are usually much weaker than their Synergy required counterparts and are so over priced only the desprat and the rich bother to use them.\n\nOver all the game is well ballanced (except for the occasional max level russian), and easy to play. There is controler support and Occulus use is avalable. The graphics are exelent if you can run at max level, and are better than many paid games.\n\nThe only real drawbacks is the dwindling player base because the developers put all of the advertising budget into their flagship game Warthunder and allowd Star Conflict to fade into relative obscurity. It needs more players, and the developers need to pay more attention, but the game itself has been great since I started in 2013.\n\nIf youre a fan of arcade space flight, and combat sims this game is for you.","March 27, 2015","true","842.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I stopped for a bit while they worked out some beta issues, but I would reccomend this game for the folllowing reason:\n\nIf you love space combat, cool space environments, varied weaponry, and interesting space combat tactics I would reccomend this game as one of the best out there.  You can do quite well without ever spending a penny.\n\nThe 'freemium' element of this game is following a common trend with modern games, and at first I was really against it. Eventually I noticed there are major discounts now and then, and if you do purchase, it's basically convenience, and some unique ships that  are marginally better than others.  It's worth it if you think the game deserves your time, and a little investment to keep it running.\n\n\nI say this game is great because it makes me feel like a space pilot from the tv shows I used to watch growing up. The combat is balanced enough that you can feel proud of yourself for beating an opponent, and I personally like the slow grind, because it gives me something to work towards.\n\nIn order to really like a game like this, you have to be unconcerned with the grinding, and enjoy the space dogfighting in a pure and well programmed way.  If you like to fight in space, then the grind is just a slow and steady stream of improvements on an already fun concept.\n\n\n\nPros:\nGreat gameplay\nCool graphics and environments\nMany updates\nCool weapons\nMany goals to work toward in game that yield rewards\n\nCons:\nvery slow grind\noccasional rude players\nlong wait times for pvp and even pve on occasion.","December 3, 2014","true","966.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","2"

You should get a DLC (I recommend the Galaxy explorer pack when on sale and with the 10000 GalacticStandards [GS] you get a licence - also when on sale in game).\nAs casual player, only Tier 3 (of 5) has to be reached to play with most addons/mods active.

Star Conflict has many different weapons, modules and overall setups and types of gameplay. New players can become disoriented quickly with the X, Y, Z movement and rolling camera views. Matchmaking at this time can take a few minutes due to a small player base during Western primetime as this game is Russian. I'd give it a 8/10 mostly because it has the long wait for matches sometimes and doesn't have much easily accessible information and that can result in your grind becoming longer.","December 20, 2013","true","453.5"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

I like to play it daily, but never for more than an hour or two.\n\nLets begin with the fact that it is free to play. In Star Conflict you pilot a space ship in approximately 10 minute matches. The matches include; Combat Recon: a deathmatch like game where two teams face off against each other and may respawn after death only as long as their captain is alive. Detonation: A capture the flag-like game where two team attempt to pick up a bomb and deliver it to enemy stations, winning when no enemy stations remain. Capture: Is a three point domination game where holding a base is worth points, so which ever team holds the most points over a duration will win. Domination: Is an elimination match, you when when you cap three enemy bases or you kill the enemy team. Hunt: Is a one moving point domination game where one of three points is active for 70 seconds during which the team who controls it earns points.\n\n\nPlayers advance through a ranking system by earning credits (money) and synergy (xp). Players quickly gain access to three different hull types; Interceptors: Small-sized, lightly armed and shielded, agile, fast ships. Fighters: Medium-sized, heavily armed and lightly shielded ships. Frigates: Large-sized, heavily armed and shielded, slow ships. For the three hulls there are three sub-classes for every hull type. For Interceptors there are Covert Ops, Recon, ECM, each specializing in defeating a particular type of ship or performing a particular task. For Fighters there are Gunship, Tackler, Command. For Frigates there are Guard, Engineer, Long Range.\n\nThere are three factions, being a member of a particular faction will only determine who your opponents are. A player may purchase ships from any faction. Within each faction is a ship tree showing all the ships available and the path you must take to unlock them. Each faction will offer contracts that reward the player with special currencies that will allow for upgrades of specific weapons.\n\nThe game play is highly addictive. The controls are simple and intuitive. The game is enjoyable at every tier. Game servers handle latency very well. You wont get killed by the really laggy guy you never saw or not be able to hit the guy who skips all around.\n\nFor a free game that states it is a BETA, the devs keep you posted about updates and changes to the game and there are frequent updates.\n\nMy only complaint is that the player base is low, so the match making system can take 5 minutes to put you into a match during off-peak playing hours. During peak hours its usually under 30 seconds. In addition, the low player base forces the match maker to create matches that are slightly imbalanced ie everyone on the other team is more skilled than everyone on yours etc.\n","January 9, 2014","true","302.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

I set it aside from time to time but always end up coming back.\n\nThe graphics engine is beautiful, if you like sci fi ships this game has them in droves. A vast array of technological marvels to fly around and blow stuff up with.  The flight and shooting mechanics I find to be very tight and responsive. Sound effects are spot on, very satisfying and visceral.\n\nThe downside is the progression system is extremely grindy if you don't spend real money. Its not so bad if you are enjoying the gameplay, but sadly despite having several pvp and even pve modes, one can get burnt out because the gameplay itself doesn't vary much. Aim your reticle at enemies, fire until they explode, rinse and repeat. There are plenty of modules to give different abilities to your ship, hull and shield repairs, additional weapons or drones, disables, and while they do add variety I find myself wishing for a broader spectrum of tools to use to liven up the gameplay after a while.\n\nI do still greatly enjoy it. Nothing around that I'm aware of that scratches the same spacey dogfighting itch while also being accessible, populated, and beautiful. But do be aware that while the game does not have a hard pay wall, it does make progress difficult past tier 2 without at least a small investment. I've spent money on this game, more than I'd like to admit. But I do it because the core game is fantastic, space battle goodness that deserves to be paid for.","January 3, 2015","true","164.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The grind is not too much (though it's certainly there), and the ships you can buy with money are not strictly superior (though they are better in some ways, just like every ship has their own quirks).\n3) Very nice gradual learning, you start with very few options, slower ships, only one game mode, and you ramp up the number of modules and modes you can use gradually through the tiers.\n4) Developing competitive side. Observer system already in place, tournaments are held, teams are preparing well ahead.\n5) Multiple game modes with their own interesting mechanics and multiple maps, some very imaginative.\n\nWhat's bad\n1) Low population, and all that comes with this. Sometimes long Q times for some modes.\n2) No skill based matchmaking, so everyone is thrown into the game as equals (except squads who have to be matched by an enemy squad), which sometimes lead to very unbalanced matches.\n3) The game is not really dynamic compared to shooters like Freelancer or even Moon Breakers, if you fly anything other than an interceptor than you usually strafe behind cover more than you dogfight, which is fine for frigates but a bit weird for a fighter.\n4) Somewhat lacking balance, one shiptree (graph) (Jericho) is considered strictly inferior in most areas to the others. Hopefully will be patched, and anyone can play anything anyways, it's not restricted, players don't belong to a side.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable space shooter, even if somewhat grindy, but if you enjoy your game, you won't notice it at all.\n\nSincerely: [NASA]fasz","September 5, 2014","true","308.0"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","2"

Even one of my projectile weapons (one designed to be something like a shotgun for starfighters) sounds like an old shotgun sound effect.\n\nGraphically speaking, the game is simply beautiful, although the scenery outside the actual playing fields don't change much - you only notice this when flying in the new open space "invasion" mode.  In the PvE and PvP modes, which are much more faster paced and hectic, it won't be an issue.\n\nGame play is relatively balanced, and constantly being tweaked, controls are fine tuned and adjustable, and the game can be effectively played with keyboard and mouse, gamepad, or joystick.\n\nIf your pace is more MMO style, you can explore the relatively vast reaches of invasion space - the open world portion of the game.  For me, a guy who's perfectly content to explore this space in search of loot and crafting material, it stops just a little short of being fullfilling.  The mining opportunities are small, and the risks far outweigh the rewards, though considering the company seems to be pushing for more players to join the Invasion part of the game, as well as the crafting set up, this may change in the future.\n\nFor clans, or "corporations" there is the conflict area of the game, where you and your corp fight for territory between the three main factions.  Can't say I've played this one yet, because a certain rank of ship is required, which is a shame...because it's the part of the game I was most excited for.\n\noverall, the game is much more than satisfying and enjoyable, constantly evolving - for better or worse, with an active support team involved in the game community, can't ask for much more than that.","September 15, 2014","true","175.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

It seems like the main objective of the game is to get the next better ship you can get and by doing pvp and pve mission help you get closer to being able to do that. As a begginer, pvp isn't the best gamemode to go into when you just star because there are many other skilled players in better ships who will just blow you up multiple times. pve is alot better to do to get started because you work with others to get though a mission that doesn't involve fighting other people who are most likely more skilled than you, also pve mission normally give off better rewards than pvp.\n\nI would definitley recommend this game to other people, it is very good quality for a free game (though there are aspects of the game that you would need to pay for if you want it) and I thing anyone could play this game and enjoy it. The only weakness I have found in this game is pvp miss-matches.\n\nRating: 8.5/10","February 8, 2014","true","22.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

E.G: 3-5mins to get in one battle-(Somtimes less).\nGrinding takes a long time-(but in a way it is good cause you cant rush through the game like in a day or so)\nThe battle's dont last that long. Cant remember the correct time of the battles but no more than 10minutes, cause when you are flying a frigate and they are slow, and you get a massive map, it will take you ages to get from the spawn point to the area you want to get to.\nFactions are to upgrade your weapons/modules from MK-3 to MK-4 but it used to be free when you changed contracts but now they changed it where you now have to pay credits-(In game money) or gold. Changing contracts means changing hangers but different weapons/modules use different contracts. BUT one good thing is that you keep the loyalty vouchers when changing. Cost to change faction from 200.000 to 750.000.\n\nOverall this game is GREAT and I will recommend StarConflict to people who love flying spaceships.\nI will give StarConflict 8/10. I am giving them this score because they changed the factions. If they did not mess around with that I would of gave them 10/10","October 4, 2014","true","629.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I really like the look of this game though some of the options are a bit confusing and I could not find native support for my flight stick (SPEEDLINK BLACK WIDOW.) so manual configuring and working out the options did take some time. I also could not locate the first person view option on ly a third view perspective after scouring the menu options as well as looking at key bind options\n\nI think that this is really good considering you can play for free. I heard that the moderators are strict so I will not be getting into disputes to find out if this is true or not.\n\nMade by the same team as WARTHUNDER so if you enjoy that then you should give it a try.\n\nFirst Impression verdict.\n\nIf you own an Oculus Rift then yeah you should definatly check it out but if you own ELITE DANGEROUS then there is no real reason to stay too long.

I grew up playing the old FPS games like Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament.\n\nOn to the pros:\nThe pvp in the game is very fun.  Lots of pvp game types.  Over 200 ships.  Progression is very fun.  Basically you unlock more ships the more you level up the ones you have.    6 degrees of freedom.  Tons of ship modules/weapon types.\n\nCons:\nPve is fun at first but then feels repetitive.  Open world so far seems fairly limiting.  Basically pickup fetch/kill quests.  I don't mind it but maybe if they had an event system it might feel more dyanmic and alive.

Honestly I haven't played many games like this since I shy away from shooting games.  I grew up playing the old FPS games like Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament.\n\nOn to the pros:\nThe pvp in the game is very fun.  Lots of pvp game types.  Over 200 ships.  Progression is very fun.  Basically you unlock more ships the more you level up the ones you have.    6 degrees of freedom.  Tons of ship modules/weapon types.\n\nCons:\nPve is fun at first but then feels repetitive.  Open world so far seems fairly limiting.  Basically pickup fetch/kill quests.  I don't mind it but maybe if they had an event system it might feel more dyanmic and alive.  Maybe the higher level zones have a more organic feel.","September 22, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, if you like EVE online, this is NOTHING like EVE, for this is more a TPS then a space tactics game. In this game you will have a lot of fun blowing up and blowing the others up. In the lower tier, like Tier 1 and 2 ships, you can have a lot of fun, however, as you advance in Tiers, it gets much harder to kill and be killed, so watch out for that.\n\nA final thought, if you are not russian, and will play the game with 100-300ms of latency, it can be a little annoying getting killed by russians with 10-20ms latency, since the Shooting and Moving of the ships are all influenced by LAG.\n\nThat's all, hope you like my review.","December 30, 2013","true","382.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

What more is to say?\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Update on April 2nd; 2015:\nMaybe it is time to add something in response to some other so called reviews around here:\nThere seem to be some players, who are talking about abusive admins etc. Since more than 1250 hours active game time I have seen not a single use of admin powers in terms of banning, let alone abuse.\nIf you carefully read through those comments, they later all have to admit, that they were swearing, talking about drugs, using political names etc. For that, they got warnings and chat-mutes of a few hours.\nAnd now, we have some bad mooded kiddies who seek their revenge in negative comments.\n\nI suggest: if you ARE interested in this kind of game, try it for free. If you later decide to spend money on a DLC or Premium, you can do so by a personal opinion. Until then, you can enjoy the game for free.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWell, apperantly a lot. First - like a lot of those games (War Thunder etc.) you need to invest some hours to learn the game mechanics and what ship is doing what. Second, you need some patience, as this game is more or less in constant development. Sometimes they make it better, sometimes they make it worse.\n\nBut, after all, it is free, and it generates a lot of fun. Especially, if you do it with a buddy or join one of the (better) corps (like clans) to play this together. There is PvP, PvE and an Open World Mode called Invasion (involves some Aliens).\n\nThere are Premium ships, but they have not more killing potential than other, normal ships - they just don't need repairs and generates some % more free synergy (to level your other ships).\nHint: don't spend your real money for transferring this synergy, but if you want, invest it in a licence to get more loot. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or go to the official forum pages @ forum.star-conflict.com","June 19, 2014","true","444.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Sure, there's a high skill curve involved, but the community is very helpful in getting you started in your pilot career. Just ask questions, and you'll get all the answers you need. Find what you like flying best, and improve at that before branching out into other ship classes.\n\nAs for GMs abusing their powers like in the negative reviews, I have personally never seen that. In the 700+ hours I have played this game. The GMs I know are very nice and very polite, and they do not hesitate to play with people and help out in any way they can!\n\nThe game could use a few tweaks, but the devs do listen to our suggestions and are constantly improving and balancing the game. We have a very active forum that is constantly suggesting what can be done to our game.\n\nGet this game, grab your friends, form a squad, and prepare to shoot.

Anyway there are many differen Ships, modules and  play styles that keep the game interesting.\n\nThe devs are always adding new things and are expanding the game at a nice pace. The new open World mode seems interesting but I will hold judgement on that for now it's still new and there are things to e worked out on it.\n\nBTW - for New Players here is a Pro-Tip there is a steep learning curve when you first start out. Prepare to die alot and not get many kills, but if you stick with it things will get a lot eaisy and you will have more fun in the game.\n\nGood Luck and BTW the Emperor's Hammer is always recuriting new Pilots... http://tc.emperorshammer.org/index.php","June 21, 2014","true","632.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It has surprising graphics and features for a "free to play" game and is also very easy to run on just about any computer (within reason). SC is a very fast paced game with a somewhat slow learning curve. If you are willing to take your time and learn to appreciate the little things in this game it will only get better for you from there. The difference in ship complexity from the lowest level (T1) to the highest level (T5) is absolutely astounding.\n\nLike I said before; this game has a somewhat slow learning curve, so ask around in the community. For the most part people are much friendlier in this game than any other online games I've played and many of the pilots are very glad to help out newbs or just about anyone.\n\nA lot of the reviews on here do more complaining than good, so I'd like to remedy that. I have logged over 1000 hours in this game and have never run into any problems with the devs, mods or supervisors of any kind. So, any reviews you may have seen saying "Oh, this game sucks because the mods are irresponsible and rude." are just not true. As a matter of fact, I know many of the mods personally and they are all great guys that love the role that they play in the game.\n\nI hope this review helped you join the game. Star Conflict is a constantly changing and updating world with many possibilities that will come along if more people are added. Overall I reccomend this game highly to anyone that is willing to spend time in a great community with endless possibilities in the future, not to mention amazing gameplay :)\n","August 1, 2015","true","315.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Every ship that I unlock feels the same as the one before, only a tad bit stronger.\n\nI will still recommend the game though for people who wish for a free to play version of star citzens dogfight mode.","April 24, 2015","true","12.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I personally have a lot of fun with it (even when I get my teeth kicked in during a PvP Domination match).  I'll try to break it down, Pros and Cons.\n\nCons:\n-Upgrades can be bought through GS (Galatic Standards, the in-game currency bought with actual money).\n-Some ships can only be bought with GS.\n-No safety net with items (currently).  If you accidentally sell something you didn't mean to, you're out of luck.\n-Matchmaking doesn't seem to have a balance to it (yet).\n-Open Space (the Eve/Star Trek: Online-style connected sectors map) is unforgiving.  When Cybers and Biomorphs start showing up, and if you're a new player, you're screwed.\n\nPros:\n-Galactic Standards can be earned.  It's small, but you get 10 or so for every one or two victories in PvP.  That's a pretty fair shake, considering it's bought with real-world cash.\n-GS can only be used to upgrade ships by converting Synergy (experience) from an elite ship (max level) into Free Synergy, which is also earned during matches.\n-Dogfights are fun!  Seriously, there's nothing quite like circling one another in three dimensions, each trying to get behind the other while taking shots or firing missles.  It can be nerve-wracking if you're hull is damaged or your shields are out, and there's a certain thrill to pulling an enemy off one of your teammates mid-fight.  Or, you can sit back in a Harpy, or other long-ranged frigate and take pot shots with your Disintegrator.  Just watch those Command fighters, or Covert Ops.\n-No ship is the strongest.  Each ship has a role, each role has a purpose, every ship has its strength and weakness.  The combat is more based on skill with your ships than anything.  Upgrades help to increase hull strength and shield capacity, or cooldown time on modules and weapons damage, and later variants of ships in the same role will often have better stats, but no class is omnipotent and even lower-ranked ships can be threats with skill.\n-The grind for Credits (the techniqually buyable in-game currency, as GS can be exchanged for Credits with an admittedly good rate) is miniscule.  Just a few games and you're raking in hundreds of thousands of Credits for new ships, MK II weapon and module upgrades, and other things.\n-You don't have to sell ships.  In fact, you can eventually get every ship, all maxed in level with MK IV modules.  You start with three ship slots (these are the ships you can choose during matches or for Open space), and can unlock a fourth with either level or Galactic Standards.\n-The devs are very active.\n\nOn a more personal note, the game seems best enjoyed with a friend.  You don't even have to be a super serious player.  It's easy to pick up and put down.  If you have an interest in space dogfights and don't mind luck-based grind for upgrade materials or MILD pay-advantage systems, I would definitely recommend you grab a friend (or a few) and try it out.\n\nUntil next time, Mercenarcies.","June 10, 2015","true","34.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayGameZOnAPC/recommended/212070/","JayGameZOnAPC","Furryness ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayGameZOnAPC/","55 products in account","Its fun pretty graphics, Lazers going pew pew pew and stuff. Sort of like War Thunder but with a space theme. If War Thunder and Fractured Space had a baby it would be this. Read on if you want some quick basic info about it that i think its all the main stuff.\n\nThe Good:\n\nIts just really enjoyable to play for a free to play its great, not sure about the pay 2 win as of yet because i've only had 3 games. But so far it doesn't feel unfair i've not even leveld up yet.\n\nControls are simple but may be a bit odd to some The controls are similar to Strike Vector. Its a bit weird for the first minute or so but it works really well.\n\nDog fighting in this is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. The Rush having to go invisible to find a safer place to recover while your shields low. Its just awesome especially with an extra wide set up whether 21:9 or eyefinity custom res side by side on two or three monitors.\n\nI can actually play this game in eyefinity mode across two monitors without the bezel in the middle annoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nManufactoring seems kinda cool you learn things, then process things and use things and i think you can sell them too for extra cash thingies in the game. What ever the blue stuff is.\n\nEven your moms laptop should run this alright i get great fps with the settings turned up and my pc is running a R9 270x 2gb which is like a £120 gpu. (well more for mine because its an asus directcu ii top so that was 180 with bf4 a game i dont play).\n\nThe Bad:\n\nMain Menu is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ full of all sorts of stuff you can't be arsed reading and looking into. But having said that the manufacture thing seems to make sense so far i've only done one item so far.\n\nThe time it takes to connect to a game. Over 5mins to join the same game with the same people. what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with that?\n\nSome of the stuff doesn't make sense or it does but i'm just not figuring it out properly. I dont get the crew system thing for example. For some it will be a jump in and you'll understand it all for others it may be a wtf does that mean?\n\nOther stuff:\n\nPeople are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about abusive admins here in the comment section. Personally I have no idea i've had like 3 games with the same people in a row. Takes like 5mins to connect but it might be the time of day that i'm playing or maybe people don't play it anymore.  I dont know if it is few dedicated servers or what.\n\nAll in all Definately Worth a try. Its Free it wont hurt to have a different experience, you'll either like it, dislike it or hate it i'm just simply stating my thoughts about it. Its fun its gripping at times flying through asteroid fields during a team match that involves dying less than the other team due to reinforcement waves. The Domination matches. It  Looks awesome and is even more awesome when the action gets really intense. Also it doesn't require an amazing computer to run this. This much fun this nice pretty graphics and its free. What more can you want? There is a few irritating things like trying to time your cool down timers correctly for using flares or you wanna jump in a game quickly and your stuck connecting for 5+mins and then to find out oh hey the games almost over so you have to go through all that again. It does need more servers. But for what you get the game is pretty solid does a good job is fun pretty and easy to get the hang of.\n\ngive it an 8/10\n\nI feel like it would be a 9 if it was a more simplified cleared up main menu page and the game had a proper ingame voice over tutorial to explain to you what the stuff on the menu is and how you get it. I personally don't like clustered menus. It gets a bit confusing and servers are a pain in the ♥♥♥.  The wait times are terrible and that is a huge deal breaker as it can lead to less time actually playing the game. I feel like it doesn't quite do enough to make the 10 it could do with more ships, more cosmetics and stuff for free to play users. Like pimping out the ships a bit with maybe neons or something would be cool just to give it that me more personalization (if thats even a word).\n\nJust play it. Do the tutorial to figure the controls then just jump straight in a battle you'll see how much fun it is. Its not like you can do much after only doing a tutorial mission\n\nP.S It needs more servers with more players on them! Sick of 4 actual players in the one game in total and the rest being ai bots. Get it fixed! It deserves it.","April 20, 2015","true","14.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You can buy premium ships, but they simply fill slightly different battlefield roles or suit different builds. The meta is constantly evolving as pilots discover new builds and develop new tactics. Daily inter-corporation battles and weekly tournaments ensure that there is plenty of opportunity to sharpen your teeth.\n\nThe learning curve is steep at times, but perseverance is rewarded!\n\nIt takes real skill to excel in battle across 3 dimensions.

Before you believe what they say, go and look at how long they have played.  If it is less than 100 hours, I guarantee they are still learning how this game works. I have TONS of time invested in this game, and I can honestly say this is the best game I have ever played.  Why?  Well, it's free for starters, and that's a huge plus.\n\nMany free games favor premium players—the ones who actually pay for in-game content—so that the incentive becomes to pay for content to gain the upper-hand.  While there is premium content in this game, it is not at all overpowered.  In fact, there are many veteran players like myself who choose regular ships over premium ships because we know the real difference between them and can make the right decision.  The truth is, while there are plenty of people who Pay to Win in this game, they do not win because of their money.  They win because of their time spent learning this complex game and growing from each battle—every win, every defeat.\n\nThere is plenty wrong with this game, however, but I see it more as a challenge than a hinderance.  First, the developers are Russian, so it is difficult to be in contact with them.  This might seem minor, but it has grown to become one of the biggest issues in the community.  However, much of the community is active on the forums, so we do have some contact, but mostly with moderators and game masters.  Secondly, the game is hardly advertised.  Obviously, this is a problem.  But the BIGGEST problem in the game is the lack of players, which kind of comes from the aforementioned issues.  I do not believe this issue will last, however; many are coming to the game because it is exciting, and it is growing...albeit slowly.\n\nI really do love this game; it's a wondrous space-fighter with plenty of action and ships to choose from.  The grind in this game is very long, but it's worth it.  To be honest, it has to be this long because of how complex it is.  Too many people simply buy their way into T5 (the highest rank) and end up really bad.  Why?  Because they did not play their way to the top like most others.  This might be the longest way, and it might well be the most annoying way, but it is by far the best way to become good at this game.\n\nSo, if you are on the fence about whether or not to try this game, please, trust me—it is definitely worth a try.  What have you got to lose besides time?  It's well worth the time if you enjoy blowing things up, that's for sure.  Also, if you love space fighters, this is a game to check out and keep at it.\n\nDo not give up in the beginning.  It is hard.  It is REALLY hard, especially when all the ships in T1 (the lowest rank) are all terrible.  When you get into T3 (basically the mid-game), you will see the game's beauty.  The epic fights, the ferocious clashes, the immense strategy.\n\nPlay this game, you will not regret it unless you give up.","April 6, 2015","true","685.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

However, with some planning on what to buy and when, this can be mitigated somewhat. I think it does a really good job of converting some of the familiar traditional flight combat sim mechanics into a more twitch based space theme. It forgoes a good bit of realism, but allows for more interesting matchmaking game modes, and an arcadey shooter feel.\n\nI definitely suggest checking it out, especially since it requires no real investment to get started and look around.","June 8, 2015","true","34.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Only downside is that unless you are willing to spend a reasonable amount of money on this it gets very hard to improve quickly and you dont feel as though you are ever a superior in combat, those that spend money on the game always seem to win and I dont think this is very fair but each to their own.","June 21, 2015","true","29.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The combat is extremely well thought out and functions just right for a game that's all about avoiding aponents and shoting them down wile keeping yourself alive. On high end PC's this game preforms flawlessly, but on lower end PC's you may get a lot of lag or very low res textures, but the game should still be playable.\n\nSoon enough open world exploarion wil be released out of its closed beta stage, and I believe that is when this game will really take off.\n\nShould you be considering this game, you should know that the leveling and equipment selections are somewhat ok. Those who pay will have a clear advantage over those who don't, but its not as though its impossible to do well without paying, it just requires a heaping load more of skill to succeed.\n\nI would seggest getting your friends involved too and communicating thourgh voice chat through steam.

So, I decided to play it again. There are a few points I would like to address.\n\n1). If you played Warthunder and enjoyed it, and you also like Sci-Fi games, this is for you. It was made by the same developers that made Warthunder, World of Tanks etc.\n\n2). This game features, PvP, PvE and Free roaming in the galaxy. Now, I have not explored the galaxy, I just went around for like 5-10 minutes, so I cannot tell you how big it is or what exactly you can do in it. You will have to go explore it.\n\n3). PvP is like Warthunder, but with spaceships, PvE is a co-operative mission with 3 other pilots, it's like Warframe, but with spaceships.\n\n4). The graphics of this game are pretty good. I have my settings all on the highest possibly, with the highest AA, everything turned on, and I am getting a solid 60fps no matter what is going on. I am running a GTX 660 oc and an i7-3770.\n\n5). The controls are hard to get used to, and because it is 0 gravity, the space ship will behave eratically if you do sudden movements and turn suddenly, it makes me dizzy sometimes. So if you are the one that gets sick easily, stay away.\n\nAll in all, I would rate this game 8/10.","July 16, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The ability to fly through the stars killing things and making money is something I really like. However, the matchmaker has been very slow recently. I'm not sure if it's due to maintenance, an error, or something else, but it's been slow. On PvP mode I can't even get into a match, but strangely I can get into PvE matches, albeit slowly.\n\nIn summary, Star Conflict is a fun game, but the fact that the matchmaker has been incredibly slow for me and the fact that I can't play PvP currently certainly sours my experience, so it definitely needs to be fixed.  I do recommend the game though because it is quite fun, but remember that the matchmaker is kind of a crap-shoot currently, so you may want to look elsewhere for the time being.","April 28, 2015","true","44.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I personally have a lot of fun with it (even when I get my teeth kicked in during a PvP Domination match).  I'll try to break it down, Pros and Cons.\n\nCons:\n-Upgrades can be bought through GS (Galatic Standards, the in-game currency bought with actual money).\n-Some ships can only be bought with GS.\n-No safety net with items (currently).  If you accidentally sell something you didn't mean to, you're out of luck.\n-Matchmaking doesn't seem to have a balance to it (yet).\n-Open Space (the Eve/Star Trek: Online-style connected sectors map) is unforgiving.  When Cybers and Biomorphs start showing up, and if you're a new player, you're screwed.\n\nPros:\n-Galactic Standards can be earned.  It's small, but you get 10 or so for every one or two victories in PvP.  That's a pretty fair shake, considering it's bought with real-world cash.\n-GS can only be used to upgrade ships by converting Synergy (experience) from an elite ship (max level) into Free Synergy, which is also earned during matches.\n-Dogfights are fun!  Seriously, there's nothing quite like circling one another in three dimensions, each trying to get behind the other while taking shots or firing missles.  It can be nerve-wracking if you're hull is damaged or your shields are out, and there's a certain thrill to pulling an enemy off one of your teammates mid-fight.  Or, you can sit back in a Harpy, or other long-ranged frigate and take pot shots with your Disintegrator.  Just watch those Command fighters, or Covert Ops.\n-No ship is the strongest.  Each ship has a role, each role has a purpose, every ship has its strength and weakness.  The combat is more based on skill with your ships than anything.  Upgrades help to increase hull strength and shield capacity, or cooldown time on modules and weapons damage, and later variants of ships in the same role will often have better stats, but no class is omnipotent and even lower-ranked ships can be threats with skill.\n-The grind for Credits (the techniqually buyable in-game currency, as GS can be exchanged for Credits with an admittedly good rate) is miniscule.  Just a few games and you're raking in hundreds of thousands of Credits for new ships, MK II weapon and module upgrades, and other things.\n-You don't have to sell ships.  In fact, you can eventually get every ship, all maxed in level with MK IV modules.  You start with three ship slots (these are the ships you can choose during matches or for Open space), and can unlock a fourth with either level or Galactic Standards.\n-The devs are very active.\n\nOn a more personal note, the game seems best enjoyed with a friend.  You don't even have to be a super serious player.  It's easy to pick up and put down.  If you have an interest in space dogfights and don't mind luck-based grind for upgrade materials or MILD pay-advantage systems, I would definitely recommend you grab a friend (or a few) and try it out.\n\nUntil next time, Mercenarcies.","June 10, 2015","true","34.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

I haven't paid any money into it so far and I don't imagine I will.  The missions are kind-of repetative but as a fan of the old Decent and Hellbender games it's been a lot of fun playing something so much more modern.  Ranking up isn't a chore and it doesn't feel nearly as grindy as Warframe.  Most of my PvP battles are so close, it balances the game well.  Once you get past the basic ships it starts you with it opens up more aspects of the game, too.  Now I have a small, fast fighter, a heavy long rang frigate, and a medium attack ship.  I can use whichever one I feel will compliment the team and have had some very good battles.","June 16, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you are a fan of world of tanks, but like the sci-fi, space worlds this may be a game for you. PvE, is a good aspect, open world is, well there, but thats about it, but the PvP is where this game shines for me. The battles can be pretty spectacular, and can get you on the edge of your seat.\n\nPvE, is pretty good, and can be very fun, but if your expecting a solo experience, its not in this game. Everything you do is party based, even the open world flying. In that I mean the npc's you face in open world are very OP, if you are not in a rank 6 ship at the very least you will not survive an incounter with multiple npc's.\n\nOpen world flight pretty much is there just for the purpose of having some daily missions for people to do. Its all pretty much fly here, get this thing, or kill that person, type thing. So its there, but not something this game is for. This game is in its core meant for the pvp, in my opinion.","June 11, 2015","true","43.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It may not be for everyone, but I like it.\n\nI will admit that this game is a bit tough to get through the bot filled tier 1 phase, and then the early under equipped phases when you finally make it to a new tier. However, with some planning on what to buy and when, this can be mitigated somewhat. I think it does a really good job of converting some of the familiar traditional flight combat sim mechanics into a more twitch based space theme. It forgoes a good bit of realism, but allows for more interesting matchmaking game modes, and an arcadey shooter feel.\n\nI definitely suggest checking it out, especially since it requires no real investment to get started and look around.","June 8, 2015","true","34.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayGameZOnAPC/recommended/212070/","JayGameZOnAPC","Furryness ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayGameZOnAPC/","55 products in account","Its fun pretty graphics, Lazers going pew pew pew and stuff. Sort of like War Thunder but with a space theme. If War Thunder and Fractured Space had a baby it would be this. Read on if you want some quick basic info about it that i think its all the main stuff.\n\nThe Good:\n\nIts just really enjoyable to play for a free to play its great, not sure about the pay 2 win as of yet because i've only had 3 games. But so far it doesn't feel unfair i've not even leveld up yet.\n\nControls are simple but may be a bit odd to some The controls are similar to Strike Vector. Its a bit weird for the first minute or so but it works really well.\n\nDog fighting in this is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. The Rush having to go invisible to find a safer place to recover while your shields low. Its just awesome especially with an extra wide set up whether 21:9 or eyefinity custom res side by side on two or three monitors.\n\nI can actually play this game in eyefinity mode across two monitors without the bezel in the middle annoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nManufactoring seems kinda cool you learn things, then process things and use things and i think you can sell them too for extra cash thingies in the game. What ever the blue stuff is.\n\nEven your moms laptop should run this alright i get great fps with the settings turned up and my pc is running a R9 270x 2gb which is like a £120 gpu. (well more for mine because its an asus directcu ii top so that was 180 with bf4 a game i dont play).\n\nThe Bad:\n\nMain Menu is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ full of all sorts of stuff you can't be arsed reading and looking into. But having said that the manufacture thing seems to make sense so far i've only done one item so far.\n\nThe time it takes to connect to a game. Over 5mins to join the same game with the same people. what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with that?\n\nSome of the stuff doesn't make sense or it does but i'm just not figuring it out properly. I dont get the crew system thing for example. For some it will be a jump in and you'll understand it all for others it may be a wtf does that mean?\n\nOther stuff:\n\nPeople are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about abusive admins here in the comment section. Personally I have no idea i've had like 3 games with the same people in a row. Takes like 5mins to connect but it might be the time of day that i'm playing or maybe people don't play it anymore.  I dont know if it is few dedicated servers or what.\n\nAll in all Definately Worth a try. Its Free it wont hurt to have a different experience, you'll either like it, dislike it or hate it i'm just simply stating my thoughts about it. Its fun its gripping at times flying through asteroid fields during a team match that involves dying less than the other team due to reinforcement waves. The Domination matches. It  Looks awesome and is even more awesome when the action gets really intense. Also it doesn't require an amazing computer to run this. This much fun this nice pretty graphics and its free. What more can you want? There is a few irritating things like trying to time your cool down timers correctly for using flares or you wanna jump in a game quickly and your stuck connecting for 5+mins and then to find out oh hey the games almost over so you have to go through all that again. It does need more servers. But for what you get the game is pretty solid does a good job is fun pretty and easy to get the hang of.\n\ngive it an 8/10\n\nI feel like it would be a 9 if it was a more simplified cleared up main menu page and the game had a proper ingame voice over tutorial to explain to you what the stuff on the menu is and how you get it. I personally don't like clustered menus. It gets a bit confusing and servers are a pain in the ♥♥♥.  The wait times are terrible and that is a huge deal breaker as it can lead to less time actually playing the game. I feel like it doesn't quite do enough to make the 10 it could do with more ships, more cosmetics and stuff for free to play users. Like pimping out the ships a bit with maybe neons or something would be cool just to give it that me more personalization (if thats even a word).\n\nJust play it. Do the tutorial to figure the controls then just jump straight in a battle you'll see how much fun it is. Its not like you can do much after only doing a tutorial mission\n\nP.S It needs more servers with more players on them! Sick of 4 actual players in the one game in total and the rest being ai bots. Get it fixed! It deserves it.","April 20, 2015","true","14.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You can buy premium ships, but they simply fill slightly different battlefield roles or suit different builds. The meta is constantly evolving as pilots discover new builds and develop new tactics. Daily inter-corporation battles and weekly tournaments ensure that there is plenty of opportunity to sharpen your teeth.\n\nThe learning curve is steep at times, but perseverance is rewarded!\n\nIt takes real skill to excel in battle across 3 dimensions. It takes dedication to understand the finer points of equipment configuration.\n\nOh, and it's visually beautiful.

I haven't paid any money into it so far and I don't imagine I will.  The missions are kind-of repetative but as a fan of the old Decent and Hellbender games it's been a lot of fun playing something so much more modern.  Ranking up isn't a chore and it doesn't feel nearly as grindy as Warframe.  Most of my PvP battles are so close, it balances the game well.  Once you get past the basic ships it starts you with it opens up more aspects of the game, too.  Now I have a small, fast fighter, a heavy long rang frigate, and a medium attack ship.  I can use whichever one I feel will compliment the team and have had some very good battles.","June 16, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you are a fan of world of tanks, but like the sci-fi, space worlds this may be a game for you. PvE, is a good aspect, open world is, well there, but thats about it, but the PvP is where this game shines for me. The battles can be pretty spectacular, and can get you on the edge of your seat.\n\nPvE, is pretty good, and can be very fun, but if your expecting a solo experience, its not in this game. Everything you do is party based, even the open world flying. In that I mean the npc's you face in open world are very OP, if you are not in a rank 6 ship at the very least you will not survive an incounter with multiple npc's.\n\nOpen world flight pretty much is there just for the purpose of having some daily missions for people to do. Its all pretty much fly here, get this thing, or kill that person, type thing. So its there, but not something this game is for. This game is in its core meant for the pvp, in my opinion.","June 11, 2015","true","43.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, there's a high skill curve involved, but the community is very helpful in getting you started in your pilot career. Just ask questions, and you'll get all the answers you need.

In the 700+ hours I have played this game. The GMs I know are very nice and very polite, and they do not hesitate to play with people and help out in any way they can!\n\nThe game could use a few tweaks, but the devs do listen to our suggestions and are constantly improving and balancing the game.

I prefer more tactical games rather than shooter and even the biggest ship class in this game was more like playing a shooter.\n\nThere is supposedly an open world in the game, or upcoming, but I could not play long enough to unluck it.

So I only have about 13 hours in this game at the time of this review. Either way, its enough to give me a relitive idea about this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Relitivly easy to pick up if you have played war thunder\n+ Map design is top notch\n+ Some maps contain easter eggs (A few maps have souyze capsules floating around. Also a possible reference to gailin being a russian company)\n+ Combat is nicely paced, with a ship type for everyone\n+ Each faction feels sort of unique, especially in terms of ship design\n+ No ship feels pointless (So far for me)\n+ PVE integration is rather impressive\n+ Feels fun when in a balanced match\n+ Huge amount of content means that gameplay itself is rarelly ever boring\n\nCons:\n- Gameplay is tedious at times\n- The grind at times can be painfull, especially the synergy grind\n- Some weapons feel a little bit unbalanced, namely coil mortars\n- PVE tends to suffer from a serious lack of corrdinated teams, in the one game type that demands corrdination.\n- Match search times tend to be very slow.\n- Small team sizes plus team balance based on ship tier means that PVP can end up being rather unbalanced\n\n\nSummary: The second you get into a balanced match in game, there is no other game I would rather play. There is no such thing as an average match. There are only painful matches, and awsome matches. Unfortunatly, the second you get into a badly balanced match, all the fun seams to leave this game. Although there is this problem, open space is always open and suprisingly fun. The real danger to this game is the boredom of looking for matches. Still, the cross game bonus features do make it worth trying out to at least get something out of this game.\n\n8/10 Overall","June 20, 2015","true","105.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

"its grindy and the other players playing suck". or around those lines.\nto be honest.\nI agree to some degree. im okay with grinding. it makes you look forward to your next ship, and paying for premium ships hold sidegrades, not upgrades. they're simply built different ways.\nyou'll find yourself doing better than a premium ship pilot most of the time since you've spent time and experimentation on your ships instead of pay-and-fly\n\nAn important thing if you want to like this game is. join a corporation with a teamspeak and rather active members. otherwise you'll find yourself bored and tired of grinding alone without competent teammates.\n\nI understand where negative reviews are coming from. seeing how I hear people how the game changed too much for their own likings and such while I joined rather recently, so Im accustomised to the newer version.\n\nsure working to get a destroyer is hard work and takes forever, but thats jumping the gun. you get your destroyer way faster if you do your dailies and focus on something else than those big dumb piles of metal.\n(trust me, they were good at first but now everyone knows how to rid of them easely and you feel weaker than a frigate)\n\nOpen space... its. only good for two things.\n1). getting monocrystal on daily missions. (the lifeblood of all things worth crafting)\n2) fighting other players  for your own amusement. (and watch them get mad at you)\n\nnote: it is NOT worth grinding there for money unless you have a spacial scanner!\n(remotely the only thing profitable of buying with real money..oh and painting ships.. cosmetics are fun.. dont buy the DLCs aside from soldier of fortune, they're too expensive.)\n\nIn conclusion, the most fun you'll have is doing everything corporation-related, dreadnaught battles and tournaments are so much fun even if you loose them, and the community is fun if you use teamspeak.\ndont bother too much with grinding, it gets fun later on. patience is key.","May 11","true","607.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

After 250+ hours, I'm still very 50/50 about this game. The devs recently added a new ship class which basically makes the other 3 classes obsolete, and of course you need to grind a lot to even get your hands on any of these new ships. You can't simply buy them for cash, which is also a 50/50 thing. It's not P2W, but the grind is painful.\n\nIt would be great if the developers focused on adding new content like maps and game modes, instead of new ships.

I'm a huge fan of the space combat in Star Wars Battlefront II and I enjoyed this game immensely. There are many cool looking ships and I find that visually the game looks great.\n\nI find that there's not many problems with PvP (Player vs Player) except that it seems as though some ships are a bit overpowered or annoying to fight such as the sniper\n\nIn PvE (Players vs AI), it can be fun and challenging for new players at first but when you get higher tier ships, the difficulty increases. The only changes that I notice between difficulties is that the enemies have more health (don't know whether if they deal more damage). I hate it when a higher difficulty means simply giving the enemy more health and/or damage.\n\nAlthough I said the game is fun, over time it starts to become more and more boring and dull. This game is not really pay to win but instead it is pay to not grind. I find that there is a lot of grinding if you want to get to the higher tier ships since you need enough credits and experience from the ships of previous tiers.\n\nOverall I think the game is a lot of fun to play for a while but eventually it will get old. But hey, it's free, so why not pick it up?\n\nHope this helps","December 12, 2013","true","74.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

After buying so much during the steam sale, I ended up playing this for free instead...\nYou fly combat spaceships and shoot at other spaceships with lasers and missiles and try to outrun them around asteroids. How could it not be fun? The controls are quite good and pilot skill is very well reflected in combat. The free to play model doesn't really hurt gameplay - it's ridiculously expensive when you want to get perks, but if you don't, you're never at a real disadvantage in a battle. Besides, you get grouped with other players near the same rank so that your opponents are never out of your reach.\nThe problem I had with the game is that you can only play in team modes - team deathmatch, domination (capture and hold flags), bomb - usually around 10 vs 10. Sometimes you'll end up on a team that's too strong and win by an incredible margin, and often it'll be the opposite. Your individual performance can help your team but sometimes you can have the game of a lifetime and still badly lose because you got unbalanced teams. It can get really frustrating and is the reason I stopped playing.\nDo try it!","August 14, 2013","true","21.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Three kinds of covert classes of ships are available to you. Are you the defense bolster? There are defense modules for every ship, and two ships that focus around just that. Maybe you prefer to just take the fight to the enemy as soon as possible, or scope them down, or buff you allies. The game is amazing, and honestly, I'm surprised that it's still free.

Many have come and many have left, yet I remain. What holds me loyal to the game is not just the fancy graphics or the cool customizable ships, but the fun, fast-paced gameplay and amazing PvE missions that you can go out on. You can go from defending allied territory to taking down a massive alien dreadnought with a team of your stronest friends. After that you can cool off by flying around in the open world and fighting other players or AI enemies. You can gather resources and craft powerful weapons and modifications for your ships, and when you obtain a high enough rank you can even craft your own custom ship that you can outfit however you like! I really adore games with serious customization, but I seriously love this game's ship models. Every single ship is a work of art and they only get better as you go. It takes a while to gain traction in this game, but once you do, it will be more rewarding than ever.\n\nPlease, please keep playing the game beyond the first week or so. After you get moving and start getting more powerful ships and weapons and modules the game world opens up in so many ways.

Add in to the fact you have to spend real-world money just to part up with anymore than two people, and you have a recipe for your standard greedy microtransaction based game.\n\nthe gameplay itself is fairly solid, ship-to-ship combat is interesting and the game looks and plays great. Its just a shame that its burdened by such terrible design decisions. I would've gladly paid 50+ dollars for a game like this, but the constant need to spend reworld money (or spend an absurd amount of time grinding) keeps me from spending any sort of cash on games like this.","February 3, 2015","false","10.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

With the game seamingly more geared towards PvP (like most games nowadays) I felt like the PvE side lacked just a little. PvE had some great missions to play and with each new tier you jumped to in lvl's, you got new and harder missions. I would suggest going with a group of friends as per my experience, the random pugs sat and did nothing half the time just soaking up free XP.. unfortunate.. My biggest gripe with the game was how "grindy" it felt to get anywhere, even with the release of Free Roam (their open world concept) the missions for it felt very "go here, fetch this, drop it here".. Outside of PvE and to the PVP, I don't have any real words other then Carnage and Chaos. Pick something that moves and kill it, before it kills you.","October 2, 2014","true","35.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

A great sci-fi action game, comparable to Freelancer, but with much more depth and tactical aspects. For me, it is definitely not pay-to-win - if you want to spend money, you can get into the game a bit easier and faster, but you still need to play through the same parts of the game as anyone else, in order to get to the top tier ships.\n\nAlso, I was surprised about the game modes. Not only mission-based PvE, but also PvP (where even as a total newb you can be usefull), guild (called "corporations") based campaign and a open world style free-flying mode.\n\nThe real downside is that the publisher/developer does not do more commercial and advertising to open it up for a broader audience. If you love games like Freelancer (for the action) or Privateer (for the freedom of play style) you should definitely try it out. If you are looking for a space sim, more into the direction of EVE, you may be disappointed.\n\nSee you ingame!","July 1, 2014","true","24.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARMmaster17/recommended/212070/","ARMmaster17","ARMmaster17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARMmaster17/","51 products in account","EDIT: updated to reflect recent updates\n\nThis is a game where you fly spaceships and shoot at other spaceships. There's not much else to it. I wouldn't say this is a try F2P, but it's not much of a P2W. Especially when you get in higher ranked battles, the people who bought there way to the top are the first to go. This is a game of skill, not fancy weapons. The game itself gives you plenty of opportunities to level up quickly. The only issue I have to complain about is that the instructions in the missions do not reflect the recent updates, so you may end up spending a good amount of time on google if you wish to do the missions (which are completely optional, but they do have their rewards). In terms of combat it's pretty simple in terms of HUD readability and controls. Matchmaking is based on ship rank, so you will be fighting players of multiple different skill levels (which can be a good thing and a bad thing). If you really are that bad (when you are starting out), there are plenty of bot players that are added to both sides that give you a few free points and target practice. There is also a mode now where you can freely roam the sector (assuming you are ready to take on enemy pirates and players that may come your way). In terms of the ships, no matter what faction you choose, there are 3 basic ship classes. Recon: fast and deadly but almost no shields. Commander: good balance between weapons and shielding, moderately fast. And engineering ships: painfully slow, but extremely deadly to anything in front of it, plus high shields. So as you can see there is no "master" ship. Despite what you may see above, in actual combat you will learn quickly that all ships are equal, it's just a matter of learning what your ship was built to do. Upgrade paths can be confusing. There is no "this is level 2, this is level 3". You can mix and match almost any weapon type (assuming there is a version of that weapon for your ship class, some weapon types are only built for a specific class). You can also upgrade your shield, engine, targeting computer, and pretty much anything you can think of. You can also upgrade the entire ship using synergy. Synergy is accumulated at the end of battle (usually only when you win), and can be used to level up all components of your ship.\n\nShort version of this review: It's addicting, it's fun. It's a nice break from other "shoot 'em up" games. And it's free. If you are really impacient, you can buy your way to fame at the cost of being humiliated due to lack of skill.\n\n9.2/10","January 2, 2014","true","39.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The ships play their roles well, the missions are interesting as you unlock them, the game looks great...\n\nThe amount of time it takes and how many times you have to repeat the same missions in the same starter ships to get out into open space almost turned me away. While I love PvP and PvE in the game, the ability to undock and poke around before you have 10 hours in would have helped a little.\n\nThe factions don't seem to really have much point other than design and the extent of universe to explore outside is kinda limited.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to take a more Galaxy On Fire approach to travel. Hopping around from station to station picking up work instead of always killing and collecting for the same people.\n\nAs far as a space shooter goes. It's good. It's fun. You can manufacture new massive ships, explore space for parts and work together with friends to get things done. It's nice to pull a small squadron together with a couple fighters and a support frigate.\n\nSolid recommendation for a pretty solid game that won't eat your entire life away.","May 6","true","37.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Because of the F2P model and the pegi 12 rating this game also attracts lots of kids (The amount of autism in the chat is too damn high) and imbecils, players don't cap empty nodes (like flags in a CTF-game mode) because they don't even care about them or are busy doing whatever they are doing somewhere else which makes a dedicated player rage from time to time.\nAlready mentioned, the game is missing depth. You can upgrade your ships weapons and systems and get new ships through grinding. That's it. There are not even more than 1 main-weapon systems (rockets/torpedos, railguns/lasers) per ship that you can use, at least not from the ships I tested. It contains a PVE mode through that you also can level and grind your ship up which I find very good.\nThere are basically 3 different ship sizes. Big slow ones, medium ones and small agile ones.\nMy conclusion: Try it out, there's nothing world-changing in this game but it's not bad.\nI decided not to play it over long terms because I find the stuff the game has offer to me simply boring.\nThe only difference in the higher tier ships and the lower tier ships is that the higher ones have more "grinding levels" (called synergy). They basically look all the same and are the same size while using the same weapons. Why should I bother reaching those ships then?","December 23, 2013","true","4.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It is based in space as you are in a starfighter. There are ranges of ships to choose from which you can unlock and buy. You fight in online missions against other players or just fight in a random battle. Choose from plasma machine-gun turrets to heat sinking missles and torpeodes! I say this is a game for the MMO fans and Star Wars and Star Trek fans. It is a good flying fighter but I think I would rather something a bit more this age of time. But don't let me get in your way of your gaming. Star Conflict still is a great game, but I think it can be better. I do recommend this to players but be prepared for online chats on the side of your screens of other players. If you are thinking of this game for your child 8 or 9 or 10 and below I would recommend to superzise them at all during the game. And if they are that age, I wouldn't recommend steam for them either. But like I said, don't let me get in your way.

Do you like dogfights? Do like explosions and lasers? Do you like nonstop PVP action? Then you should definitely check this game out!\n\nThis is one of my favorite Free-to-Play games available on steam. The number of hours I have on record should be an indication of how much I love this game. There are over 100 ships to fly and obtain, a pretty good community, and lots of battles to participate in. There's an open space exploration, PVE co-op missions, and the new update includes a new mechanic; DREADNAUGHTS. If you're part of a corporation (clan) your corp can get a dreadnaught to participate in sector conquest.\n\nBasic Stats Rating:\nGraphics/Visuals- AWESOME\nGameplay- AWESOME\nNotes on Gameplay/Mechanics:\n-There are 3 main classes of ship (Interceptor, Fighter, and Frigate), and 3 roles for each class\n-There are 15 ranks and 5 tiers of ships.\n-Ships are customizable in durability, handling, abilities, and weapons. Color is customizable for gold standards (real money)\n-There are 6 PVP game modes and a nice variety of PVE co-op missions. There is also the open space available as well where you can explore the different sectors of the system.\n-There is  a ship-crafting/module crafting system, but that's really only available to higher-tier players. Each faction has 1 ship that can be crafted, and it can take a long time to get all the resources and parts to craft them.\nCommunity- Pretty good\nPay-to-win? Not really, spending money will get you better ships faster, but in the end it all comes down to skill and teamwork\nPlot: Not the reason you're playing, but there is a kind of lore/backstory\nShould you play? YES!\n\n"Major" Con (what many people consider to be a con):\nThis game will get REALLY GRINDY if you don't want to spend a LOT of money on it (I, personally, haven't spent a single penny yet). In order to unlock new ships, you have to earn "synergy" (exp) on the ships you own. Once you reach a certain synergy level, the next rank of ship(s) in that class will be unlocked for purchase. This will take time.\nHowever, when you are finally able to get a new ship, you will feel like you've earned it. But if you enjoy the gameplay and don't really care about corporation politics and whatnot, then I wouldn't consider this too much of a con.","April 18, 2015","true","877.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I would also love if the game had a larger player base, my biggest and only problem really is the fact that it takes from 0 seconds-3 minutes to get me in a match. Now it is usually less than a minute which is awesome and heck its even better than League of Legends but sometimes it can span over 4 minutes in periods of downtime. I really enjoy the player base they are fun and cannot stress how much I would recommend the game. It is 3rd person which i would love to be fixed a.k.a FPSSSSSS style but yolo.

This game can be very satisfying. Beautiful free space sectors with various facets from treasure hunting, to very diverse questing, and even nice battles. Great PvP and PvE instances, and I mean great. But yes, you must pay lots of money!!! and you better know how to spend it because if your a noob, you could easily blow through $100.00 dollars truly believing your doing proper with it and  end up wasting every penny. I got lucky and cashed in on a 90% off ship sale, all ships. Without that I wouldn't be past tier 3 because the ships are about $40.00 each and to reach T5 you have to purchase some earlier ships. While this game is P2W, it is honestly kind of reversed. You pay first, to win later. The initial investment allows you to have a good base to earn synergy, credits and loyalty with bonuses from packs and the cash shop ships which generate extra synergy for faction ships.. Later down the road you build the ships in your faction trees, which are actually better ships. Wait, the progression ships are actually better than the $40.00 ones?  Yup, good luck getting them without the cash shop ones though. That said, there are a ton of good players in game that haven't spent a single dime and are probably the best players. (much grinding)\nAll that said, I really do recommend this game. Even if you dont pay a dime, you can have a lot of fun. If your willing to put some money into a game it's a good one, If your not willing to put money into this game though maybe stay away because you will like it so much you'll make poor life decisions and spend money on it anyway. Which is what I did $200.00 later.\n\nWould spend $200.00 again and probably will.","May 14, 2015","true","311.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The situational awareness in VR is really good, and it stays locked at 75fps hardly any lag and no judder. Very immersive, the combat is addictive. Some interesting loot and crafting materials can be salvaged and the game universe can be explored if you undock your ship from the station as opposed to entering the PVP skirmish matchmaking countdown.

Considering myself a casual player - can take on almost anyone on a good day, or die like a newb on a bad one.\n\nOn the Game: Great, addictive game. Maybe the best space combat game currently on the market. Spaceships, fights, PvE & PvP, open space, pirates, aliens, missions, ship customization, great graphics, low requirements, linux & mac support - everything you want from a space combat game and much more. Also much more mature than most other space combat offerings on Steam, and far more dynamic and  interesting than e.g. Elite:Dangerous. Basically it's War Thunder in Space.\n\nTry it, it's free, and up to the mid-tiers the grind is moderate (and mid-tiers are much more fun than high-tiers anyway). If you have the time and patience to improve your gameplay to competitive levels, this may be a game worthy of long-term engagement.\n\nAs reference: without investing any real cash, it will take you about 100-150 matches to maximize all Tier-1 ships. With licence etc. it will take 3000 to 5000 matches to maximize all ships in the game, if that is your goal.\n\nHowever, you need the frustration tolerance of a tibetan monk after Tier-1:\n\n- Matchmaking is super-broken and will put new players with 100 matches against unbeatable veterans with 10'000. Often. And in every Tier (except 1). Only thing worse than "normal" matchmaking is squad matchmaking - the only balancing there is the amount of players in squads to be near-equal. The game doesn't even try to match based on skill or experience - I've seen squads with 300 matches total placed against squads with 30'000 matches total. Matchmaking generally feels worse than random - it seems the goal is to frustrate players on purpose, to get them to buy "better" stuff and spend more money on the game. Newer players complaining about the frustrating game experience are told to simply "gid gud", as if every casual player had the intention to spend 2 years of his life in the game.\n\n- Tiers are supposed to be skill-related, but that is not the case. There are just as many new players in T5 as there are experienced veterans. Lower Tiers (T2/3) are chock-full of uber-leet veteran players and  - even worse - elite kill squads "seal-clubbing" / "farming" newer players for easy wins which yield stats and Iridium for the corp.\n\n- A lot of the vet no-lifers are extremely abrasive, insulting other players at every opportunity. The vets basically "own" the game (or at least act as if they did), and vet squads and corps dominate the whole gaming experience. Newer players (anyone with less than maybe 3'000 matches) are treated as cannon fodder. This, together with the disgusting matchmaking, greatly contributes to extremely high player fluctuation in the mid-tiers and an environment very unfriendly towards casual players. Woe upon the newer player daring to use the same OP builds and tactics as the veterans. For example, it's OK if you're getting killed by OP vet drone pooping tacklers 20 times in a row, but if you so much as dare using a drone in your interceptor, be prepared for a veritable ♥♥♥♥♥torm.\n\n- The whole "Dreadnought" match experience is a huge hassle and pretty repetitive. Timeslots are limited, setup horribly complicated, and strategic sector gains are basically reserved for the vet corps due to the inherent  mechanics.\n\n- Testing of changes is reserved to/done by some of the vet players, which in turn leads to  major and minor changes which generally favour the veteran player community.\n\n- Veteran players incessantly ask for more advertising to get more players (more lambs for the slaughter), not realizig that this game's primary issue is not gaining new players, but to retain those who give the game a try. I have led a major corp for some time, and the speed in which the game is bleeding players due to frustration is absurd (about 2% each day).\n\nOver 1.2 million players have tried this game. Only about 2k play it concurrently, maybe around 7k  over the course of a week. Less than 100 vets "own" the game. Are you the one out of 10'000 that can stand the frustration and has the skill and time to make it into their ranks?\n\nIf not, give this a spin for a great casual game experience - until it's your time to rage-quit.\n\n12/10 as Space combat game\n7/10 when taking matchmaking and balancing into consideration","March 26, 2015","true","461.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Personally I say no alot of you will disagree, sure spending money will help you progress faster but i'm used to the grind, this game reminds me of monster hunter 3 tri back on the wii in alot of ways, and just like monster hunter I was introduced to alot of frendly people who congratulated each other after a sucessful fight, people who would chat in the lobbies give useful advice to noobs (ike me) and every pre-fight we would all say stuff like "stay near me so I can give you all buffs" and generally work as a team backing each other up. Now like monster hunter you feel great getting new stuff but unlike swords and armor you get ships and upgrades to these ships, I run this game on windows xp and turning the setting to low gets rid of frame rate issues and personally I don't this it affects the look of the game too much. there is alot here and I wish this game many years becase I had alot of fun. but now the cons, its costs ALOT, I mean 100 gold for a costom paint job on ONE of my ships?! or 5-6-7 thousand gold for a dlc ship?! gold in the game is about 5 dollars to every 100 gold and earning it in game takes FOREVER also don't plan on freeroaming unless you got some wingmen backing you up because those aliens are strong witch brings me to if you're not in the same faction as your buddy good luck meeting up in freeroam as you have to meet halfway and theres alot you cannot reach in early hours of the game, now with all of that out of the way theres alot here, epic battles, PVP action, exploring new areas, and not to mention the PVE missions I found to be alot of fun, all in all I would give this game an 8/10","January 29, 2015","true","111.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game can be very satisfying. Beautiful free space sectors with various facets from treasure hunting, to very diverse questing, and even nice battles. Great PvP and PvE instances, and I mean great. But yes, you must pay lots of money!!! and you better know how to spend it because if your a noob, you could easily blow through $100.00 dollars truly believing your doing proper with it and  end up wasting every penny. I got lucky and cashed in on a 90% off ship sale, all ships. Without that I wouldn't be past tier 3 because the ships are about $40.00 each and to reach T5 you have to purchase some earlier ships. While this game is P2W, it is honestly kind of reversed. You pay first, to win later. The initial investment allows you to have a good base to earn synergy, credits and loyalty with bonuses from packs and the cash shop ships which generate extra synergy for faction ships.. Later down the road you build the ships in your faction trees, which are actually better ships. Wait, the progression ships are actually better than the $40.00 ones?  Yup, good luck getting them without the cash shop ones though. That said, there are a ton of good players in game that haven't spent a single dime and are probably the best players. (much grinding)\nAll that said, I really do recommend this game. Even if you dont pay a dime, you can have a lot of fun. If your willing to put some money into a game it's a good one, If your not willing to put money into this game though maybe stay away because you will like it so much you'll make poor life decisions and spend money on it anyway. Which is what I did $200.00 later.\n\nWould spend $200.00 again and probably will.","May 14, 2015","true","311.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This mean you'll have to level most of your 4-8 ships with bonus experience.  I presume from 10-15 will be much the same.  Open world is extremely difficult under rank 6-7 and the difficulty scales up rapidly.\n\nModules require multiple faction credit and it costs to change factions.\n\nLeveling without cash shop is near impossible past rank 6, and the caash shop prices are too expensive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coljala/recommended/212070/","coljala","coljala","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coljala/","22 products in account","Quite a learning curve to be good at this game, but upon install, one begins having fun immediately.  As with any lvl up system, the grind to new ships and equipment can be tedious at times, but once one recognizes how easily all this comes just by being active in matches, they can advance quite quickly.\n\nThe mutliple directons of movement add a dynamic that has been done before but never so well in my experience.  the ship handling FEELS good.  The game does not properly support joysticks without using a oculus rift (FoV is scaled down to less than half when using JS setup and cannot be altered...no cokcpit view, you just see the top front of your ship on the bottom 1/3rd of your screen all the time) but the keyboard controls can be customized as expected to suit your style.\n*having a mouse with adjustbale dpi on the fly will help a great deal when using more than 1 type of ship and weapon in a match.\n\nThe scenery is spectacular and even more brilliant than one might 1st suspect once they disable Depth of Field...sadly, as most games do, this one loses a lot with the "realistic haze" effect of DoF.\n\nTBH, it's not terribly well balanced in many cases, especially in the pvp matches...that being said, some of the imbalances can be countered effectively once the player gets a more-than-basic understanding of things. (to be fair it is still a work-in-progress and thigs are coming along nicely imo - for the most part)\n\nThere is much to learn here; the game itself, its progression and ship ranking system, equipment assignment, etc.\n\nNew players will face many veterans that play mid and low tiers in completely upgraded ships with max lvl equipment (they claim for fun but is mostly stat padding).  New and veteran players share the issue of language barriers however...the game is worldwide with most it's players being in Russia and Europe.  With a 4:1 ratio of RU/EU players to NA players many random matches result in being teamed with ppl that dont speak the same languages so communication is tough at times.\n\nPvP pays poorly in terms of credit currency and that is the primary type of currency: repairs, low lvl equipment upgrades, ammo, ships themselves, etc all require credits.   PvE pays 3-4x what PvP does in credits, but PvP is the best way to obtain faction vouchers for high end equipment upgrades...so a balance of play styles progresses fastest and most efficiently.\n\nThe Open Space option is quite fun as well.  this lets you throw off the restriction of premade matches, explore things, blow things up at random, atk players at will in some areas/sectors, assist players at random while running missions for your faxction of choice (5 daily open space missions per faction) find random loots and minerals in space that can be a source of income or a source of materials for a custom built ship called a Secret Project ship...these are quite customizable in terms of building it to suit the type of loadouts you prefer vs using the predetermined setups given through the progression system.  Secret Project ships are TOP Tier, meaning you musyt advance to the top of a faction ot have access to build any of its Secret Project ships...this also aims to have players well versed in ship types/module types/ship handling, etc by this point so that the custom build can excel in areas of preference.  Some players build them too soon, before they really understand the ship type and they suffer greatly...these are not easy to obtain mats for and making 1 mistake can make it all but worthless.  They have announced further options to SP ships customization coming soon.\n\nAll in all, this tldr review is saying it's a great game and has potential for great fun.  A somewhat small NA community atm, but a recent advertising push has begun to change that a bit.\n\nI started with the beta in 2013, took a break from what it was then - 3 pvp only maps with only a handful of ships to choose from - came back recently and I'm so impressed and have so much fun it has become the primary game for me...I have left WoT behind to the point of uninstalling, WT barely gets a nod anymore due to their complete disregard for playerbase desires and fixes(and especially for the 2 year promise-not-delivered to make bombers viable in higher BR battles), and the fps's, well, they all roll into one here: space flight, fps shooting, sniping, slow lumbering frigates to fast agile interceptors, queued matches, custom matches, obsenely difficult special operations missions with premium loots, open world exploration, player built-to-spec ships, it offers everything in one game.","October 16, 2015","true","046.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

A GOOD game but want you to BLEED your money hard. I played for FIVE hours straight with prem (+50%) and barely made over 2 000 000 credits and only 15 000 faction rep. (you need 75 k for ONE upgrade of 15 little things you MUST use in battle on ONE of your FOUR ships, and it's only a 3-d lvl tech) You'll need to spend about  30-45 $ monthly to play comfortably or sell your soul to a clan for five hours daily online for a year. Otherwise only grinding for tech four will take more then a two years (If you're normal person who doesn't play more then a two hours and not DAILY). It's game that flyes on a noutbook with 512 mb card on ULTRA HIGH graphics with 30 FPS, because optimization of engine and server is THAT GOOD (Robocraft I look at you) while looking like a YOBA project, but for all nine hells it's want your money bad...

Deep PvP, grindy PvE, no Pay2Win and even an open world adventure for the guys like me. Eventually you might want to pay a few bucks to make things go faster, but nobody will ever really force you to do that. And if you pay, well this game deserves to be paid for.\n\nUPD:\n\nSo I've played little more (maybe a couple of hundreds of hours more), and it's time to somewhat update this review with some new impressions and info.\n\nFirst - Star Conflict is two games in one package. One game is PvP session-based tactical space shooter with huge teamwork influence and the other one is open-space based exploration game, where you just grab you ship and fly anywhere doing some missions and observing how this universe evolves from season to season. Open-space part is not very rich yet, but it grows and gets some attention from the devs with every update.\n\nSecond - some of you might think that this game is like World of Tanks with starships. Well it's not. It looks like WoT in some aspects and the hangar UI is a bit similar but the gameplay is nowhere the same. This game is ultra-fast, it requires skills and some tactical thinking. At first it's like: "Hey, here's me flying, shooting random fellas". But play just a bit more and whenever you try to just shoot random fellas with your lazors drinking some beer you'll find yourself dead most of the times. There's really a lot to master in this game. Lots of different ship classes all with unique sets of abilities. You either learn how to use them the right way, or die again and again. And you just can't fix this by throwing in some cash. You'll just get some fancy ships instantly, but they won't complete mission objectives for ya. You can spend some bucks and get some powerful weapons faster than the free players, but it's still you who shoots them.\n\nAlso as far as I know there are no cheters here, or if they are they are few and unwelcome.\n\nStill a good game after almost 600 hrs of gameplay.","February 15, 2015","true","853.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

They have for one thing, got pretty much everything scaled right. PvP is mostly by choice, you can always do PvE or Open Space (OS) which is good fun aswell. The Aliens are OP as hell when you start, but as you get stronger, you start to think "Aliens??? You are easy!". Then you meet the Defiler and rethink what you just said. which is why I like this game!\n\nThe maps are pretty big and there are quite a lot of them too. I like to go around killing ALiens in my Hyena and picking up their cargo to see if I get anything rare like Alien Capacitors, which you can sell for Iridium (upgrading stuff). The things I will say I don't like is this:\n\n1) People often say that Tackler's are the worst type of ships you can buy, but the funny thing is I use a Tackler (Hyena) and in 95% of my PvE (which is where people tell me never to use 1) I'm the last 1 alive so don't listen to people, find out yourself!\n\n2) Matchmaking is pretty good, but 1 thing I don't like is often I get put into a bad team especially on PvE.\n\nThat's pretty much all I can think of. There are many parts of the game I haven't explored yet, but can't wait to. The graphics seem to be good and the game is quite well optimized which is a shock for modern games to even be optimized at all. XD\n\nDon't get me wrong, 'Star Trek: Online' is a good game but to me doesn't feel like it was made with a passion, whereas this game just feels like the devs are more passionate about it.\n\nThe Customisation has been quite well done, not too sophisticated and not too narrow (not enough weapons, modules etc.), every family of ship (e.g. Tackler, Interceptor) has their own bunch of modules which can only be fitted on to them ships, also you have the Multi-purpose modules that can be fitted onto pretty much any ship, so some have restrictions, some don't.\n\nI will give this game a thumbs up for sure!","September 24, 2015","true","296.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Unfortunatly, the fan base is not huge, so it takes some time to get into PVP and PVE (team) battles. However, when you do, the game is a blast to play. There is also a developing single player PVE. This game possesses a lot of potential.","October 8, 2014","true","30.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Even though Star Conflict is all about combat, it does it very well. With the ability to choose between different classes of ships allows you to plan ahead, and different variations of that class allow you todo what you want. This is one hell of a game.","November 29, 2013","true","18.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
