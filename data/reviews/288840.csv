In fact, it's an extremely fun game. However, it's also extremely short. When the game ended, I just sat there dumbfounded. I couldn't believe the game was over already and the story seemed incomplete - there were questions that never got answered. So I looked up the walkthrough on Gamezebo to see if I had missed anything. It turns out that there is a "collector's edition" with more to the story. So I DO recommend this game. But don't buy it on Steam. Buy it elsewhere and make sure it's the Collector's Edition. If you're a hidden object fan, you'll love this game.","October 11, 2014","false","3.4"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

The game is short and all puzzles can be skipped with hint buttons if stuck somewhere.  Adjustable difficulty is nice but its the way the game is designed that is the weak point.  Many of the hidden object puzzles have a colored filter over the entire screen making everything seem white, blue, or black.  This is very straining to try and enjoy veteran players will find, while casual players spamming the hint button will probably just turn it off.\n\nThe story is good not that it matters this is a game, and the gameplay is where it breaks down.  There is an interesting mechanic used of switching from the present to the ghostly past where you can move items from the past to the present.  This is very interesting, would be nice to see some sort of mechanic like that used in future games.  Doesnt feel very ghosty overall, not to spooky which is a downer for october scary gaming :(\n\nRating:  4/10  Value:  $1.99$","October 9, 2014","false","0.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

What makes Haunted Past: Realm of Ghosts different is how the developers made sure that the player is interested and invested in their tale.\nTheir greatest tool was the pacing, which involves just enough backtracking to shake the feeling of being stuck in a corridor, but not too much to make anyone run around in circles (thanks to the room clearance indicators).\n\nThe game has no traditional puzzles, only item gathering point ‘n’ click style, and lots and lots of hidden object scenes. These two elements are often combined into single-room challenges, called ghost rooms, where you must find and hide items to use them later in the normal world.\nSadly, not even this abundance of hidden object scenes could save the play time that barely reaches two hours, which may be too short even for such an engaging game.","November 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","2"

This game indeed scratches that itch. Very casual; extremely linear and the hidden object areas are good but not too difficult or clever. Where this game fails is in the so called puzzles. They are extremely simple and the developers failed so far offering no mini-games with these. Where the game gets it right is presentation. Good atmosphere, the graphics & sound/music are good for it's genre.\nI believe that casual players and gamers like myself who are looking for a change of pace will enjoy this game. However aficionados of this type of game will probably find it lacking. Only once did I even consider using the hint button to find a hidden object and a few times I found myself wishing the hidden object portions where either longer or more difficult; this on the so called advanced setting.","March 27, 2015","true","6.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

They're always set in spooky houses, old ruins or other planes of existence. History is revealed, secrets are unraveled and generally just all that kind of stuff really.\n\nDespite hidden object games being all very similar to each other, they are a guilty pleasure of mine as i do just enjoy the hidden object scenes and puzzles you find in these games.\n\nThis one is set in haunted house. You need to find what happened, whose behind it and destroy the evil entity. The story was interesting, it was nothing amazing but it kept me playing which is always good.\n\nIn terms of puzzles, there wasn't really any in this one. It was more so just clear each room and move on. I quite liked the pace of the game as i was only looking for a short few hour game to complete so it worked for me!\n\nThis game also has an interesting feature of being able to switch between two planes of existence. You can find items you need in the other realm and hide them somewhere for you to find in the real world. This kind of switches the gameplay up a little bit and it's always nice to play the slightly more unique HOGs.\n\nIn terms of the object finding, the scenes weren't too cluttered to the point your eyes hurt, and the items were well blended into the scenes. So all around good on that part in my opinion.\n\nAll in all it's a decent one, if you enjoy the HOG genre then this is definitely one you can whiz through and add to pile.\n\n\nTL;DR : It's decent for a hidden object game, pretty standard but it's enjoyable.\n","January 9","true","2.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/288840/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Haunted Past is another game from the developer of Princess Isabella, Gogii Games, and is pretty clearly a more recent creation. The graphics are cleaner, the art is better, and the scenes are more detailed in terms of animation and sound. It also feels like a more mature game in tone and design. The haunted house motif is done without jumpscares or loud stingers, and the puzzles are quite a bit more challenging than the ones in Isabella. It's a very polished game, though still a bit dated. One strange omission I should mention is that there's no map, and thus no fast-travel between rooms, but the game flow is quite linear and they had the good sense to include a few shortcuts where backtracking is needed.\n\nGameplay is a lot of point-and-click puzzling through rooms, with the hidden object scenes almost a secondary feature. Worth noting that with the better graphics, the hidden object scenes are actually easier since everything is more distinct. The big gimmick of the game is the "spirit world", which is alternate ghostly versions of rooms where you can find additional items. Not only do you have to find the items, you have to "hide" them in a place you can retrieve them in the real world, because ghosts will steal them or some ♥♥♥♥, I don't remember but it was dumb. These aren't particularly challenging puzzles but they add a little much-appreciated variety. Unfortunately, the main draw of the game, the puzzles, suffer from some really obnoxious design. Two examples:\n\n- You have to match up the birth and death years on some funerary urns. These dates are on gravestones in the cemetery, but finding them isn't enough. You HAVE to find three pieces of paper and three pieces of charcoal to make rubbings of the gravestones, and THEN you can match up the dates. It's a completely unnecessary step that got me stuck for awhile because I had no idea why the urns wouldn't let me move ♥♥♥♥ around.\n\n- You can't use items on other items directly, which lead to a couple aggravating situations where you have to use a piece of paper on a SPECIFIC background spot to lay it down, and then use a pencil or whatever on it to get the thing you're trying to do done.\n\nIf you can deal with some outdated puzzle design, this is a solid 2-hour game that actually falls more on the point-and-click end of the spectrum than hidden object, but should suffice for either.","September 22, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

First, it isn't a bad HOG. But it's very short (my 8 hours of playtime were caused by me, getting some rest and dozing off). Second the story is interesting. But the riddles and puzzles are quite easy to solve, some of them are literally self solving. The graphics look great, but some of the full screen animations do lag and the sound is at times, best described as... "crunchy" - though the voiceacting was very pretty.\n\nIf I follow my own Rules and Regulations this game lies in the 50% area, because there are good and bad things in the game, overall it would be a "Not Recommended" for this game. Which actually I will give. To clarify my stance with this game I will give the Pros and Cons and then describe why I don't recommend the game.\n\nPros:Nice Voiceacting.Pretty Graphics, though they show the age of the game.Interesting Supernatural Story.Cons:Crunchy Sound.Lagging Cutscenes, only the fullscreen scenes were affected in my case.Though the story is interesting, it failed to build up enough suspense.Riddles and Puzzles are far too easy. Some are really self solving (Urns, Sigils etc.).Too short in playtime, remember this is a HOG with only limited replayability value.\nNot Recommended\nGiven the age of the game, this game isn't all bad - but it lacks a lot which games of the genre and this age already had, there are a lot of similar games which did truly build up a suspense. The game also isn't quite perfect on case of technology, the lagging was encountered on all of my machines. The crunchy sound might have to do with some of the effect filters used, to make the voices sound ghostly. The too easy puzzles/riddles were only a small anoyance compared to the really short playtime (actually about two hours).\n\nAll in all this game is nestled in the 45 to 50 % Value, because all of the encountered problems and annoyances. If you want at all to try this one out, try to get it bundled, or at a sale. But, please don't make the mistake to gift this game to a newby of the genre, he might lose his interest in HOGs forever...","November 25, 2015","false","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Is she just ticked off being brought back form the dead, or is she jealous that he got remarried AND they had a kid? And, why the hell would her servants, loyal though they may have been, want to bring her back?  Was he an evil guy?  Doesn't seem so from his notes.

Now, I don't generally expect HO games to be brimming over with complex plot, but there are many out there that have taken time to at least flesh things out, which this didn't do well.\n\nThe other thing I will mention is that in order to play fullscreen on Windows 8 with a 4k monitor, I did have to go into the executable and disable display scaling; this is the only way I've found to get the game to scale properly.  Just FYI if you are running a newer display.\n\nSo if you want a short and simple HO puzzle and don't care too much about deep plot, go ahead and grab this one if you can find it on sale.

You can see by my hours played that this is not a very long game. It's by no means a bad one but it is short so if you want short entertainment, a few dollars dropped on this in a bundle with other games is worth it. Otherwise, do not pay full asking price because it is not worth it.\n\nThat being said, it is a very fun hidden object game. In terms of hidden object scenes (HOGs) there are a handful of them but not so many that they become annoying. This game is very inventory item heavy in that a lot of game play is finding an item to use later on. One good feature is that areas will have an Area Cleared banner on the top of the screen after everything is done in the area so you don't have to worry about not knowing if you missed something or not. There arn't a ton of puzzles compared to other HOG games but there are some fun little puzzles occasionally.\n\nA main mechanic in this game is traveling back in time through reflective surfaces to obtain items in the past, hide them and get them in the future. Sometimes this doesn't make sense logically (you hide some in a baby's crib so sometime between the past and the future no one thought to check it?) but since when were HOG games a place for logic? This is a neat little feature but I feel they could have done some more with the time traveling part other than just hiding items like maybe areas only reachable in the past due to things breaking.\n\nStorywise it's a bit typical, dead mother, haunted house... You get more story from reading the diary and papers you find laying around otherwise the story can pretty much be ignored. The voice acting isn't too bad and I found it slightly better quality than most other HOG games.\n\nGraphically this game isn't HD quality but it's not Minecraft pixelated level graphics either. I'd say 7/10 around since it's not so bad that it hurt the hidden object scences but not high enough quality to make that a selling point.\n\nI noticed maybe two annoying things, one, the hidden objects often have a small clickable area so you need to be precise in your clicks. The other is if you spam using an item (I KNOW THIS ITEM WORKS HERE STOP TELLING ME OTHERWISE GAME) it will keep playing the "this isn't going to work" message lines as many times as you clicked. Which can be annoying when you finally give in to the games logic and want to click the area to see what hint it gives you.\n\nOne really nice feature is that custom difficulty options it gives you. You have about three options for the most part on how long the hint button recharges as well as how long until you can skip a puzzle and if active areas glow. It's nice if you want certain things to be easier and others to be harder like if you like not using hints but hate puzzles and want those to be skippable faster. That is a nice feature.\n\nOverall its a good fun game that will entertain you for one night and then you'll hide it in your Steam library and forget all about it.","August 1, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its atmosphere is unique, engaging, and held my attention from start to finish. There's roughly 1 - 2 hours of gameplay depending on a person's playstyle and game difficulty, which is customizable. The story, voice acting, and puzzles were all above average compared to other hidden object games I have experienced. I definitely recommend this game.","December 22, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The negative part is that the game is a little bit short, especially because it's such a mysterious game.","December 26, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can see by my hours played that this is not a very long game. It's by no means a bad one but it is short so if you want short entertainment, a few dollars dropped on this in a bundle with other games is worth it. Otherwise, do not pay full asking price because it is not worth it.\n\nThat being said, it is a very fun hidden object game. In terms of hidden object scenes (HOGs) there are a handful of them but not so many that they become annoying. This game is very inventory item heavy in that a lot of game play is finding an item to use later on. One good feature is that areas will have an Area Cleared banner on the top of the screen after everything is done in the area so you don't have to worry about not knowing if you missed something or not. There arn't a ton of puzzles compared to other HOG games but there are some fun little puzzles occasionally.\n\nA main mechanic in this game is traveling back in time through reflective surfaces to obtain items in the past, hide them and get them in the future. Sometimes this doesn't make sense logically (you hide some in a baby's crib so sometime between the past and the future no one thought to check it?) but since when were HOG games a place for logic? This is a neat little feature but I feel they could have done some more with the time traveling part other than just hiding items like maybe areas only reachable in the past due to things breaking.\n\nStorywise it's a bit typical, dead mother, haunted house... You get more story from reading the diary and papers you find laying around otherwise the story can pretty much be ignored. The voice acting isn't too bad and I found it slightly better quality than most other HOG games.\n\nGraphically this game isn't HD quality but it's not Minecraft pixelated level graphics either. I'd say 7/10 around since it's not so bad that it hurt the hidden object scences but not high enough quality to make that a selling point.\n\nI noticed maybe two annoying things, one, the hidden objects often have a small clickable area so you need to be precise in your clicks. The other is if you spam using an item (I KNOW THIS ITEM WORKS HERE STOP TELLING ME OTHERWISE GAME) it will keep playing the "this isn't going to work" message lines as many times as you clicked. Which can be annoying when you finally give in to the games logic and want to click the area to see what hint it gives you.\n\nOne really nice feature is that custom difficulty options it gives you. You have about three options for the most part on how long the hint button recharges as well as how long until you can skip a puzzle and if active areas glow. It's nice if you want certain things to be easier and others to be harder like if you like not using hints but hate puzzles and want those to be skippable faster. That is a nice feature.\n\nOverall its a good fun game that will entertain you for one night and then you'll hide it in your Steam library and forget all about it.","August 1, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked the atmosphere and the artwork. I wouldn't really pay the full price though, if you can purchase it during a sales week -the better!","May 19","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
