"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/312710/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:Broadsword: Age of Chivalry is a turn-based medieval strategy game ported from Android (where it's free with in-app purchases). It offers two single player campaign, skirmish games and hot seat (local) multiplayer.\n\nGameplay is really simple, you get few units, a hero, a city and few research and upgrades, one whole tutorial campaign is enough for you to get into the game. But do you want it? I think you won't, Broadsword simply doesn't offer much entertainment for price of 20 euros, you can get way better turn-based strategies on Steam for this cost.\n\nVisuals wouldn't look bad on smartphones or tablets but on the PC it looks as a joke for a 2015 game with higher price tag. Option to see all battles in style of Advance Wars is nice but you'll look one or twice and then you'll rather skip those scenes - it takes so long and it even doesn't look appealing, you can actually laugh (or facepalm) at those poor fighter models swinging swords.\n\nAlso, the whole interface is terribly designed as you have to do unnecessarily clicks for every single action - but this is the outcome from Android porting without many changes.\n\nPros:- Units are voiced in good old style. With every movement or attack, they say their phrase. How nostalgic.\n- Hot seat local multiplayer.\n\nCons:- Only two campaigns. Don't expect to get much playtime from this if you expect single-player experience. Get a better turn-based strategy game instead.\n- Mediocre graphics. Developers tried to make fight scenes in Advance Wars style but it doesn't look good in result.\n- Terribly designed interface.\n- On Steam page you can see mentioned "Multi-player" but there's only hot seat. Don't get misled.\n- High price. Broadsword: Age of Chivalry is simply not worth 20 euros.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 4","false","1.8"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","38","47","2","0"

The graphics are pretty good, they are 2D while moving through the map, but they are 3D while you watch fight scenes between the factions. The atmosphere is about many areas on Europe, where you must capture towns, especially the fortification of each town. You must move your units, to take resources for your army, as well as combating your enemies, and the main objective: capturing the fortification. The audio is nice, I like the sound of the swords, screaming, moving, etc. The original music is from German film, with the composer being Jan Morgenstern. The gameplay is basically moving the units, which will construct buildings such as lumber yards, farms and gold stations. Lumber yards are necessary for the training of your new units, the farm is for the food of your units, the more farms you have, the more units you can have and the gold station are very important in order to train new units. Also, you must combat the enemies, as well as taking over the fortifications. The story is about the factions who fight in the medium era, fighting in Europe. The engines and the mechanics are alright, the units are well-designed when fighting/dying during the fight scenes, as well as the 2D are also well-designed, moving on the hexagons. I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops.\n\nStrong Points\nPretty nice 2D and 3D graphics\nPretty nice soundtrack and SFX\nChallenging gameplay\nSeveral factions in the game\nMany types of enemies\nThe ability to construct buildings\nThe ability to choose your own units\nTurn-based game and decent requirement of strategy\nLong missions and campaigns\nWeak Points\nThe price tag is a little too high\nThe interface is too simple\nThe “multiplayer” is just a local CO-OP option\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nAudio/Music: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: 8/10\nEngines/Mechanics: 8.5/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 8.1/10","April 26","true","3.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","0"

It has a simple turn-based game design with plenty of options, speeches and noce graphics to go along with it.  In the campaign, ther are two available factions you can choose to play as the French or the English with 5 missions each.  The gameplay and fighting mechanics are rather simple.  You can spawn units and create building and upgrade them.  My complains are the map and the AI is this game.  For the maps, they are pretty much the same are quite small for my liking and for the AI, they are not too intelligent.  As a final warning, there is no game save functionality in this game.  If your Hero dies you have to start the whole campaign from the beginning which is infuriating.  You can only save after completing the mission. The game is intriguing and I'm quite enjoying it.","May 18","true","4.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game will be released on the 15th May 2015. I do not have a great knowledge of mobile games but heard that this was a free-to-play android game with lots of micro transactions. This version do not have any though.\n\nI was provided a review copy by KISS and would like to thank them for that.\n\nThe main setting of the game is from the hundred years war between the English and French, where you get to play campaign mode from either one of the two sides. The path for both sides in the campaign is linear and you don't get much choice but to just click on the next mission. I would also like to chirp in that there is also local multiplayer where you can go against one other person- Which I could not test as I am billy no mates :)\n\nI found the game very basic and the graphics to be pretty old. The combat is pretty funny but repetitive as the rest of the game. It was pretty cool to have a system where you can upgrade your home base in the midst of battle and research new techniques using Skill Points. You can also train new troops from these home bases.\n\nMy main concern though is that there was nothing really making me feel compelled to play the game. Everything was just so basic from the fight system to the graphics. The character movements were very easy to pick up though after a few moments of trying to understand. You have to click on the character you want to control, then click on where you want them to move and then a box will pop up asking you if you would like for the unit to attack, merge or undo the move.\n\nI'm just happy that the game functions well and nothing is broken or buggy. For me it's one of those games which I can only play 10 minutes or so a day before I have to stop.\n\nYou don't need a mind blowing PC to play this game as the specifications are really low. This game would really cater to the people with more low end PC's.\n\nIf you enjoy games like Civilization and other turn based games then I would recommend this to any hardcore fan of the genre. However, if you're not familiar or only lightly into the genre then you may find the slowness of the game off putting. The price is slightly steep too.\n\nThanks for reading :)","May 15, 2015","true","2.4"," 56 of 125 people (45%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","45","56","125","7","7"
