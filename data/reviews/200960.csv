"http://steamcommunity.com/id/felipepepe/recommended/200960/","felipepepe","Felipepepe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/felipepepe/","734 products in account","Geneforge presents an original setting, masterfully blending sci-fi with fantasy. Here “Shapers” are humans able to create and shape life through magic, raise armies of creatures to work and fight for them, and even genetically alter plants to serve as tools and weapons. Everything about the world seems exotic and well-thought, and it’s very interesting to learn about its lore and workings.\n\nThe story starts with your character being washed in the shores of a mysterious island, where rogue creations run wild over abandoned Shaper ruins. As you explore the massive island in search for a way back home, you’ll find the truth behind the abandoned ruins, and will decide the fate of the various factions that inhabit it. The writing is solid, and the game asks you to make some seriously complex decisions, without any banal morality judging you. I’ll add that Geneforge is the only game I ever played where the NPCs managed to change my mind with solid arguments (instead of bribes) after I had decided on a set course of action.\n\nCombat is turn-based with action points, and although it has some annoying limitations (like only one attack per turn), it’s solid. There are three classes to choose from, and they give you freedom to fight any way you want, being able to create hordes of weak monster to fight for you, focus on a large and powerful creatures, cast spells like firebolt and fear, or simply hack and slash your enemies. Non-combat skills like Leadership and Mechanics are also important, as they provide unique ways to avoid conflicts and solve quests. And although it may not seem obvious at first, there’s a great deal of reactivity here as well.\n\nWhen this was release, back in 2001, cRPGs fans had their mouths full, being spoiled with the release of classic such as Arcanum, BG2: Throne of Bhaal, Morrowind, Wizardry 8 and Gothic. So it is understandable that Geneforge, with its unattractive graphics and puke-green UI, went by undetected by most. But it’s a damn shame, and you should fix that now.","February 12, 2014","true","16.0"," 93 of 97 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","93","97","2","2"

This gem from Spiderweb allows for a multitude of choices in your actions and playstyle in and out of combat.

Do you think that prefrabricated beings can change and evolve acquiring ideas and motivations of their own? Do you like planning out each combat turn by turn or maybe you like to fly by the seat of your pants trusting in the intelligence of your handmade monsters? All of these and many more are choices you can and will make if you choose to step into this colorful world, and I certainly hope you do.

You get to encounter different sects, and you can ally yourself with them, betray them later, and then change your mind and do what they probably would have wanted if you hadn't already massacred their town. All of these actions have consequences within the world and how that world reacts to you. Those consequences follow through all the way to the ending of the game, which has a pretty impressive variety of outcomes. This is probably the strongest part of the game and what makes it worth playing through.\n\nThe growth and progression of your character is also well done. You can choose to play Geneforge as three quite different "classes". Every level up you get a set of skill points that you can apportion as you wish. The class you choose doesn't dictate what you can do, but it does make it easier/harder to level up certain skills. Skills range from physical combat, magic spells, the ability to "shape" creatures to fight for you. General skills, such as Leadership and Mechanics, are also available. Pleasantly, these are actually very useful to find non-combat methods to progress through the game.\n\nAgain all of these things are well done, and are what make the game worth playing. Where it falls apart a bit, is in the interface and to a certain degree, the combat.\n\nCombat is turn-based, and on the surface, can be quite tactical. Timing, and awareness of the positions of both your allies and your enemies are all quite important. Particularly, when you do have allies (such as the creatures you can "shape"), you do have to take into account whether or not you or your creatures are blocking a path forward. You can use this both to your benefit and your detriment, by funneling enemies down a corridor into one of your stronger creatures.\n\nIn theory anyway.\n\nThe problem is that, at least in my experience, the game is rather easy. So, tactics more or less go out the window, when you can just click-click-click your way to victory. Positioning at that point becomes more of an annoyance, as you try to coax the pathing algorithms to make sure that you don't waste a turn because you clicked slightly to the left of something, so it paths all the way around and your turn is wasted. And it's even worse that the punishment for this is not death, but a test of your patience, more often than not.\n\nTowards the end of the game, the challenge is upped, but by presenting annoyances, like poisoned areas that do damage to you and your creatures for just being in them. There is an optional area towards the end that serves as a pretty robust challenge, but again, the tactics aren't really that interesting at the end of it. It's more a battle of attrition that you just need to push through.\n\nOverall, the combat side of this game seems like it would be great on paper, but it ends up being boring most of the time, and annoying some of the time. Very rarely is it actually much fun.\n\nI should mention that the presentation of the game is quite old-school, and to top it off, there is no music aside from the title screen of the game. You just get some ambient noise in towns, and sound effects for all the actions. That's it. Honestly, some music would have made some of the more annoying slog parts of the game much more palatable. I mean, it helped a lot when I was just listening to a podcast or some music when I was doing it.\n\nThat being said, despite all the gripes, I would still totally recommend the game. Normally, I'm a gameplay over story/presentation guy, but in this case I can overlook it. What it does right, it does very well.\n\nFrom what I've heard, the series just continues to build on itself as it goes on. Based on what I played, I'm very much looking forward to eventually going through the following games in the series.","July 6, 2014","true","70.3"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","29","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tirelessirony/recommended/200960/","tirelessirony","tirelessirony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tirelessirony/","43 products in account","what to say about Geneforge? To put it simply: It's an oddly fantastic game.\n\nHaving never heard of the series, I purchased a bundle with all 5 Geneforge games. I really enjoyed my playthough of Geneforge 1, despite the difficulty and dated feel of its isometric graphics. Many of the sound effects are terrible and yet somehow memorable and enjoyable. The entire gameworld is immersive, and the creators succeed at inviting the player into a curious world unlike anything I've found elsewhere.\n\nThe turn-based combat is unique and seamless with world exploration; no cutscenes to a battlefield. Feel free to disagree, but this games combat feels a lot like what Dragon Age would have been (without the dragons) in 2001. You set your party into a formation (some strategy), you scout bad guys, you draw them into battle and then the turn-based system engages right where the characters are standing, based on the players/enemies speed as determined by stats. The balancing is steeped against the player and pots/items/spells saved my creations several times. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention? You're a Shaper, a god-like race of techno-religious beings who fashioned slaves through genetic engineering, albeit 150 years ago before much of the technology was abandoned, ship wrecked on an island populated with the decendants of those slaves. If you want to know more, or about what the Geneforge is, buy the game!\n\nAside from combat, content-wise it's pretty dense. I was able to get up to 50hrs in a single playthrough, although I explored just about every square inch of map and tried multiple different endings. The story is pushed by text-narration as opposed to characters rendered in 3D, animated w/ voice acting. This makes it impenetrable to many spoilt by games such as Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and Bioshock, but nevertheless it has it all. Political intrigue, factions, tons of choices that shape the world and your standing within it, hundreds of items and creatures, and dungeon after dungeon to crawl through.\n\nI can't speak to the whole series, although I may play them through in the future, but IMO Geneforge 1 is worth your time for anything under $3. I think I got it for a buck in the bundle and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nUltimately, I give "Geneforge 1" 7/10, would genetically modify self again.","October 31, 2014","true","50.7"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","25","25","0","0"

Regardless of what year you play this game, the amount of raw depth and story is outstanding. It has been ten years since I first played this game, the Geneforge series remains one of my favorite games of all time, and I can't recommend it without advising players to start at the beginning.\n\nAlthough the events in this game are clearly felt in the sequel, it also has the least connection with the outside world. Leaving your discovery of who you are, who you work for, and what Sucia Island is all about up to intensive study, exploration, and imagination. It's because of that feature that this might be the best introduction to Geneforge, even though it has the most clunky interface.\n\nI won't pretend to give an in-depth analysis of this game, I just wouldn't know where to start. If Steam was able to record how much I played this game when it first came out, it would be over 350 hours. Despite that, all I can do is recommend that you try it for yourself. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd be interested, visit spidweb.com and download the demo.

You've arrived -- by accident -- on an island filled with shaper creations called serviles. They're more or less the same in physical capability and appearance as humans, but they were created by shapers to do the bidding of said shapers. The island has since been deserted of all shapers for hundreds of years, leaving the serviles with no masters. They've split into three sects based on their views of shapers. There are the Obeyers, who believe that, despite their absence, shapers are still, for all practical purposes, their gods, and should be worshipped as such. Next are the Awakened, who believe that their self-sustinance has severed their ties with shapers, but are also humble enough not to ignore them entirely. Thus, the Awakened view themselves as equal to shapers. Lastly, there are the Takers, who believe that, because they were abandoned, their survival has granted them superiority over shapers.

There is a ton of reading and the game is very heavily story based which is a good thing because so far it has been pretty well written. I won't give anything away so i can't say much just know that it is well worth reading through. Also talk to every npc  that is a must. You also might want something to write down notes.\n\nGameplay\n\ngees where do i start  ... Well i guess the battle gameplay. It is a stradegy turn based rpg. Every turn you have a certain amout of ability ponts. moving, using items, attacking will use ability points. This makes you think a lot about your move during the combat phase which again is a good thing.  As you level up you will gain point in which you can distribute to certain stats.\n\nEventually you will be able to summon creatures to fight by your side. But if you do not keep them happy the will turn on you and start attacking you. Which could turn a battle thats going good in to a nightmare. Which brings another level of stradegy. Also creating creatures effects your essance points base stat. So say you summon one that uses 7 essance points. Your base stat will be ... 21-7 =14  you can gain back that stat by absorbing the creature when you do not need it.\n\nMusic\nThere is not much music here aside from the title screen but enough  form towns with the kids playing and running around to outside where there will be animal sounds. that is more then enough to be enjoyable.\n\nscore 9/10","August 30, 2014","true","33.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/recommended/200960/","senorsantiago","(PoA) ¿Señor Santiágo?!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/","666 products in account","For me, Geneforge is one of the series that represents a hybrid of old school and new for RPG, a transition that came around at a time when developers not only relied on certain conventions (such as the heavy use of textual description in games) but embraced these over the flash and thunder of visual & audio spectacle that would inevitably supplant them in mainstream gaming.  This review is for Geneforge 1 through 5, the complete series.\n\nMr. Jeff Vogel and his Spiderweb Software are involved not just in the Geneforge IP but also the Avernum series which is enjoyable.  Geneforge was developed in five installments from 2001 to 2008.  Graphics were never a priority with this IP, and in my opinion like most games developed by this company, its greatest strength is story.\n\nSome things that must be talked about when discussing Geneforge:\nHeavy use of text\nMerciless combat & careful character progression\nNo hand holding or linearity in a huge world  Understand that these games feel old by any standard.  People who didn't grow up playing MUDs or other types of games in high school will likely be frustrated by the high amount of text here: it's how you get the dialogue, interact with people and objects, and absorb specific information about every new area you come across in addition to most of the situations that dynamically arise in the game world.  The pace of the game is necessarily slowed down by this feature and many players either don't have the patience or simply aren't inclined to sit through so much content when presented in this format.  Yeah, you have to stop and read.  I urge you to take that time and effort, since the reading provides great detail and insight into the lore, characters and story --not to mention you'll be completely lost on what to do next if you skip through it!\n\nCombat can be very fun and is especially rewarding after you've repeated an encounter that initially punished you but discovered a viable path to victory.  "Shaping," the act of creating life via magic, is the central theme of Geneforge and translates into an "essence" mechanic, a second mana pool the player character spends to summon a host of little minions (or a handful of stronger ones, or a single powerful one; it varies based on the demands of each encounter).  There are a few types of shaping that each come with their own creations (magical, melee, ranged, control, etcetera).  Even on the casual difficulty you need to be smart about how you invest skill points upon leveling up.  Support skills like Leadership and Mechanics are great; they can supposedly be used to beat the game without a combat-viable character.  Melee and ranged specializations are available too, of course, if you aren't into the magic system.  I found the most success with a bit of everything, emphasizing survivability + stats over armor in my gear choices.  Be prepared for some trial and error (or look up some cheats online...but really, don't do that).  There are a couple of succinct and helpful guides out there, though.\n\nThe third item on that list just further drives home the importance of realizing it's a long game with lots of text.  You have very little indication of where to go or what to do even when given a quest.  You'll forge out into the world and earn every inch of progress with meticulous interrogation of NPCs in towns and navigation of treacherous, trap-filled monster infested wildlands in equal measure.  If you skip that text, eventually you'll be having to consult a guide or just roam randomly until you get lucky.  I did not explore every area, complete every quest, hunt down every rare item or talk to everyone I met.  In fact, at times I followed the main questline as closely as is possible in my eagerness to see the main plot play out.\n\nTechnically the game is very simple but runs without any issue.  It started as demoware on the Mac.  Everything runs fine but looks extremely dated and perhaps feels clunky.\n\nThe themes dealt with in this story are ones I liked and would enjoy seeing more of in future games.  I found it very pleasing that the story unfolded in episodic manner from one game to the next, especially regarding the recurring characters who I'd grown attached to.  The only criticism I'd level against the story is that it is delivered almost too arbitrarily; I felt at times I would have been better served experiencing the story through my actions rather than being told what to think with a text box.  Overall however, it was an excellent delivery.  Of the cRPGs I've played, this series isn't my favorite but it's up there, although...\n\nI can only recommend Geneforge to players who have considerable patience and time on their hands for the experience I've described above, and who are craving an "old school" game.  It's challenging but good fun.  Defeating your enemies to reach the ending and see how everything wraps up based on your choices is so rewarding.\n\nTIP: Be thorough in exploring, talking, and reading the text for each area.  It'll help in various ways, not just the extra experience points.\nTIP: Guides exist online if you find yourself in an unbeatable fight or unsure of where to go next.","September 16, 2014","true","24.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A game that's not just about seeing how many goblins you can bop on the head or how much gold you've shamelessly stolen by the end of the adventure.\n\nThe Geneforge series is all about story, strategy and whether or not, you're willing to sacrifice Binky (your sadly under-leveled Fyora) for a brand spanking new, just off the line, Terror Vlish (you might name him Keith). Now in any other RPG this is an easy choice - Binky doesn't even have time to say goodbye to his best friend Crispin (a dependable Clawbug), before you've reabsorbed him and used his essence to create Keith.\n\nBut this is the bit that makes Geneforge different - Keith might be better in every possible way, but you two haven't taken a journey together from the Bandit Woods, through the Thorny Fen, and down into the (horrific) Mines. You and Binky have a partnership and you're not about to give him up, not even for Keith (with his awesome name).\n\nEventually you'll either decide to give up Binky (Crispin still gets a far off look in his eyes whenever he smells roasted Ornk) or you'll keep Binky and find another way to survive the Labs. It'll take more healing, planning, tools and a fair bit of luck, but Crispin won't be crying himself to sleep every night.\n\nAnd that's what Geneforge is about. At its core, it's game where you create creatures to fight for you, that you actually weirdly start caring about (sorry Jiggly Puff). It's a journey, both plot and game mechanic wise of hard decisions. At the end you'll never feel completely happy with the choices you've made and that's the sign of a good game. There's no right or wrong in Geneforge, only things you did because you followed your gut.","June 29, 2014","true","66.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was never fond of isometric RPGs until I played this game. I ended up buying the full game and its sequel and played the crap out of them.\n\nBy some freak chance, I noticed the entire series on sale on Steam yesterday and bought it right away. Since my main computer's busted, I can't play any graphics-intensive stuff, so this is just perfect. Absolutely recommend this, 100%, especially to RPG fans.

Its gameplay, storytelling and style is reminiscent of the old Baldur's Gate series, and other games of that era. Overall, it's an excellent sci-fi/fantasy epic, and I am thoroughly reassured by the fact that after I finish battling through this game, I have four more games in the series to take a run at.\nThe only downside is that much like other games in this style, there is a tendency to say "Oh, I'll just do *one more quest*", and then to end up playing the game for 6 more hours.\nAnyway, great game.

The game does have some things to be 'desired', one of them being companions/creations who can genuinely level and a better reason to keep around old ones.\n\n\nThis game has a sort of 'old style' charm to it with simple RPG leveling, stats to put points into and different classes to play. Graphics aren't amazing, but if you really want (like I did) you can go edit them a bit (not sure if you can do this with the steam version ) (I turned my shaper into a hot elf chick cuz I can).\n\nThe gameplay is solid, though it takes a bit to get used to the 'looting' system where you open the grab menu and you look at all the items around you or click containers to view what's inside. Stats and stat paths can determine if you are skilled enough to go certain ways and it's entierly possible to get through the game without REALLY fighting. I played a mixed route and tried my best to see it all and found it difficult because I wasn't specialized, but it was ok in the end since I reached a point where I felt I was 'thinking' about the combat, but also doing quite well by using some items correctly and also by positioned right, etc.\n\nOne of the best reasons to play the game though is the rich story, lore and plot. The game has 'canisters' that can enhance you throughout the game and although I don't want to ruin anything, I will just say that using them can affect the ending. So can a LOT of the actions performed. I think there is anywhere from 3 to 20ish different endings, only around 4 of which I really saw, 1 being death cuz duh it happens.\n\n\n\nSummed up, solid game, old world charm, slow paced, good story. Definitely recommended.","April 22, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm sure that the game had many interesting choices to make that led to different stories. I didn't mind the poor graphics one bit, and I'm normally a fan of games like Baldur's Gate.\n\nIn the end, though, I just couldn't get used to the terrible combat. It's infuriating. Make and ugprade a few meat shield creatures coupled with a few ranged ones and you're good to go. Just charge forward and hope that you don't die. And I say hope because it all really does hinge on luck. In games like X-COM, you might need to rely on a few lucky hits, but for the most part, some dumb mistake you made is responsible for your deaths. Your choices matter in games like X-COM. Too bad Geneforge isn't like that.\n\nIn Geneforge, there are a-holes that can instakill your main character everywhere. Seriously, there are areas where more than 75% of the monsters can bring your main character from 100% HP to 0% HP. Even the second hostile monster in the game, the Thahd, can one-shot your main character. All any of those instakilling a-holes have to do is attack your main character, get a decent damage value from the RNG, and land the hit to trigger the game over screen. All you can do about it is pray that their AI picks on your creations rather than your main character or get bad RNG numbers if they do attack your main character. Too bad the AI doesn't always pick on your creatures. Sometimes, they just arbitrarily walk past your meat shield and give your main character a lethal smack, and that's it. And all of that happens on normal difficulty. On harder difficulties like torment, the monsters get better hit chance and damage, which means more one-shots on your main character. That's half the combat: just hoping that some monster doesn't one-shot your main character.\n\nIf you can get over that hurdle, you'll have a good time. I personally couldn't ignore this problem though.","December 30, 2014","false","8.3"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","18","37","0","2"

Do not let that fool you though. Geneforge's graphical style is a throwback to those glory days of early pre-console gaming; a visual feast of animated pixels. What we have here is an incredibly immersive RPG reminiscent of the days when games kept you playing not because the last achievement is to kill a bajillion goblins but because it's genuinely interesting. The plot is original and offers multiple endings based upon the many decisions you'll have to make while playing and the turn based, AP driven combat system allows you to play in a variety of styles as suiting your character choice, be it a warrior, rogue or summoner. Throw in a well thought out stat system and this feels less like a video game and more like a DnD adventure with bonus graphical interface.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkapplepolisher/recommended/200960/","darkapplepolisher","Salvia Hardon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkapplepolisher/","689 products in account","Old school western RPG.\n\nIf you have played anything like Fallout 1-2, or maybe Baldur's Gate, you should feel right at home here. Although it's an early 2000 game, the interface feels like it's from the mid 90s - makes sense, Jeff Vogel is essentially a one man development team.\n\nBut why do I recommend this game? Because Jeff Vogel creates wide open worlds with large amounts of content, alternate paths, and meaningful quests. Throughout my ~35 hours of play, the only parts that felt like a grind/chore were a few specific areas (<1 hour, because I chose to ignore them) that had large swarms of mobs roaming the map, or environmental damaging effects that were too annoying to deal with. The only quests that felt like the reason of being given as "because ♥♥♥♥ you, that's why" were few, played for good effect, and completely optional. Speaking of optional quests and really open worlds, it is technically possible to beat it by performing the only quest that you get at the very beginning - Get Off Sucia Island. Of course, you miss out on a fair amount of treats Geneforge will offer you.\n\nCombat is alright, but hardly optimal. Pathfinding is trash - you gotta manually path out a lot of movement or face the consequences of letting the pathfinding handle it. RNG can be somewhat harsh - 50 max hp, take 8 damage, take 6 damage, take 41 damage, dead. Frequent saving and/or high risk aversity can negate this. Despite all of that, there is a variety of playstyles, builds, and spells that make combat entertaining enough.\n\nIn summary, if you are willing to overlook the flaws associated with an aged genre, you will find world building and open-ended questing/exploration strong enough to rival the best of titles in that category.\n\nNOTE: There is a slowness issue in this game that is not patched by default.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/200960/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","Before I clarify my thoughts on Geneforge, I must ask a question. What, to you, makes a good game? There are many potential answers to that question, all of them valid. If, however, you rely on graphics for the sake of immersion you will not enjoy Geneforge. Its graphics are rather primitive, even considering their age. If you cannot bring yourself to overlook the game's presentation, that's understandable. But if you can see past the rough edges, you will find an RPG with a lot to offer.\n\n\n\nIf graphics are the lowest point of Geneforge, story is the highest. The game takes place in a creative and well-realized world where science and magic combine into an entire discipline based on creating life. Those who wield this power, called shapers,  hold immense social and political influence over the setting. Entire species owe their existence to these mad scientists of the magic world, and the shapers are quick to bring that up and exploit it.\n\n\n\nOn the island where the plot is set, long-abandoned creations get these quaint ideas like "free will" and "fair compensation". It's up to the player to decide to what extent they support the rights of the created beings, if at all. Choices like that are common in Geneforge, and railroading the player's decisions is refreshingly rare. None of the story paths is presented as the absolute most ethical--each faction has flaws and benefits, both to the NPCs and to the player. Not allying yourself to any of them is possible but more difficult.\n\n\n\nThe game play itself is adequate, but personally I only saw it as a vehicle to access more of the plot. Make of that what you will.\n\n\nIn summary: Geneforge is a game that must be viewed with certain expectations in mind. There are a number of obvious budget and technical constraints at work, which may turn away those with little tolerance fo such things. Those who can endure despite its flaws will find a game with immense personality, well worth the effort required to uncover its riches. Give it a shot.\n","July 2, 2014","true","32.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quite a few factions to work with or against, one of which literally worships you.\n\nSolid game from the makers of Exile and Avernum.\n\nGameplay comments: I hate mines.  Combat automatically starts whenever you see an enemy (or sometimes when one is /just/ offscreen), and in some zones they're placed close enough together that you can't actually leave combat, and must move your entire squad unit by unit through the whole level until everything is dead.  I love watching my flock of dragons rampage over everything.  I have seriously considered summoning a herd of pig-cows and trying to use those as my minions, but they walk slightly too slow for my taste.  The dialogue and area design are excellent, though I'm sad I don't have more options.

Only about 50% through, I'm guessing, but wanted to post this review for anyone considering purchasing this while it's still on sale. Can't stop playing, and my 360 and PS3 are getting dusty -- and I've got Skyrim, Dragon's Dogma, Dark Souls, Demon Souls, etc., all of which are great but are now on hold!\n\nPros:\n* Well-written story, and location, item, and character descriptions are compelling and not too long or short.\n* Turn-based combat, assuming you like that.\n* No loading screen more than 3 seconds -- lightning fast, which means area transitions and other activities are never discouraged. This seems like a minor point, but it isn't. It makes the game feel quick and responsive like driving a Porsche (even though the game looks like a Kia).\n* Some (although not consistent) decent challenge here on occasions, especially based on what creations you choose to bring with you on your adventure. Strategy is rewarded nicely.\n* Love the graphical interface -- almost all information is on the playing screen, which means most (but not all) commands are one mouse-click away.\n* Very low computer demands, playable on old machines.\n\nCons:\n* Minimal graphical treats, very basic map and character and monster animations. However, in my opinion, this adds to the charm of the game, and also makes the game easier on the eyes. After a few hours, it becomes the new normal.\n* Minimal audio treats, no voice-acting (so far) that I can remember. The audio for combat, door slides, and other events is adequate but limited.\n* No cut scenes (so far) that I can remember.\n* Interface could be improved by allowing the same key that opens a pop-up menu to close the same menu when pressed again. Other fans have mentioned this but Spiderweb for some reason has resisted making this improvement.\n* Would be nice if clicking anywhere on screen other than a pop-up closed the pop-up. Would be nice to have the right mouse button select player character and all creatures, instead of forcing player to find and punch the "0" on the keyboard every time -- a minor but constant irritation.\n* Would be nice if the hotkeys were customizable.\n\nNote on how to enjoy:\n* Read everything! The material is enjoyable, short, and well written. If you get tired, play something else until you are ready again to read everything. In this game you will create your own mental image and interpretation of the game world, based on what you read, unlike most games in which you will be shown a more explicit graphical representation of everything.\n* Don't read a guide, stay away from forums. They're not necessary (so far). Use trial and error. You can save anywhere.\n* Don't worry about trying to make the perfect build or to select every optimal decision in dialog choices. Immerse yourself in the world and let consequences just happen. The game is not so tough (so far) that you will get stuck.\n* Even if you don't finish this game, or for some reason don't like it much, it should be at least interesting to see what a very small but talented development team can accomplish with limited resources.\n\nEnjoy!","July 25, 2015","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djdexcat/recommended/200960/","djdexcat","Dexcat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djdexcat/","264 products in account","This series is a good example of classic-style open world RPGs like Fallout. The story does moral ambiguity very well, particularly as the series goes on. Compare that to a lot of modern games where your only options are "Barf rainbows and friendship" or "Be a complete psychopath." And as the type of person who can't seem to choose anything other than rainbows and friendship, this series made me feel really uncomfortable. (Which is good; stories should make you feel things.)\nWhile the gameplay is good, it can sometimes fall victim to the "Dominant Strategy" trope. Dungeon too dangerous for your squishy wizard? Just have your creations scout ahead while you hide in a pantry! Character building isn't completely open, but it's done in a way that makes sense. Playing as someone specializing in the magical arts? They aren't exactly going be become Conan overnight. And you may think that getting all the stat-increasing canisters you can would be a no-brainer... Think again.\nAll in all, I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys classic PC RPGs, or anyone who enjoys a good (soul-crushing) story.","July 5, 2014","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What, to you, makes a good game? There are many potential answers to that question, all of them valid. If, however, you rely on graphics for the sake of immersion you will not enjoy Geneforge. Its graphics are rather primitive, even considering their age. If you cannot bring yourself to overlook the game's presentation, that's understandable. But if you can see past the rough edges, you will find an RPG with a lot to offer.\n\n\n\nIf graphics are the lowest point of Geneforge, story is the highest. The game takes place in a creative and well-realized world where science and magic combine into an entire discipline based on creating life. Those who wield this power, called shapers,  hold immense social and political influence over the setting. Entire species owe their existence to these mad scientists of the magic world, and the shapers are quick to bring that up and exploit it.\n\n\n\nOn the island where the plot is set, long-abandoned creations get these quaint ideas like "free will" and "fair compensation". It's up to the player to decide to what extent they support the rights of the created beings, if at all. Choices like that are common in Geneforge, and railroading the player's decisions is refreshingly rare. None of the story paths is presented as the absolute most ethical--each faction has flaws and benefits, both to the NPCs and to the player. Not allying yourself to any of them is possible but more difficult.\n\n\n\nThe game play itself is adequate, but personally I only saw it as a vehicle to access more of the plot. Make of that what you will.\n\n\nIn summary: Geneforge is a game that must be viewed with certain expectations in mind. There are a number of obvious budget and technical constraints at work, which may turn away those with little tolerance fo such things. Those who can endure despite its flaws will find a game with immense personality, well worth the effort required to uncover its riches. Give it a shot.\n","July 2, 2014","true","32.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is engaging and mysterious, drawing you to play more to learn about the forbidden island you've been stranded on. The story is text heavy and those who enjoy reading will be happy that the game is, in a certain sense, a constantly evolving novel. The choices you make, dialogues you pursue, and your inclination to support one faction of the island over the other is a consequantial and important part of the game. The writing is excellent and shapes the experience into a memorable one.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the fighting is turn-based and becomes quite strategic as you delve further into the game. The control scheme is point and click (Diablo-esque). Your character levels up by gaining experience through killing monsters and completing quests, and there are also many containers/tombs which enable you to build up skills as you explore the island. One of the most fun aspects of the gameplay is making a variety of shaper creations, monster-like creatures, to aid you in combat. Your choice of creations can make or break certain battle areas, finding the right combination between different creations is what lends quite a bit of strategy to the battles.\n\nThe game can be quite challenging and you can expect to die pretty often. I had my hand hovering over the quicksave key most of the time.\n\nFinally, the sound is sparse and the music is nonexistent. While sometimes I enjoyed this, I also liked to add in my own music. I really enjoyed listening to Korsakov's Scheherazade while playing. I would recommend playing some favorite instrumental albums which could add to the ambience of the game.\n\n8/10","November 2, 2015","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Memorable zones include the biological hazardous waste dump, a few areas where someone screwed up so bad the water is orange, and a variety of local villages and ancient cultures to disrespect.  Quite a few factions to work with or against, one of which literally worships you.\n\nSolid game from the makers of Exile and Avernum.\n\nGameplay comments: I hate mines.  Combat automatically starts whenever you see an enemy (or sometimes when one is /just/ offscreen), and in some zones they're placed close enough together that you can't actually leave combat, and must move your entire squad unit by unit through the whole level until everything is dead.  I love watching my flock of dragons rampage over everything.  I have seriously considered summoning a herd of pig-cows and trying to use those as my minions, but they walk slightly too slow for my taste.  The dialogue and area design are excellent, though I'm sad I don't have more options.  I really liked unravelling the twisty history of the island, and highly reccomend cheating just enough to have maxed out leadership (talky skill) and mechanics (unlocky skill).

The audio for combat, door slides, and other events is adequate but limited.\n* No cut scenes (so far) that I can remember.\n* Interface could be improved by allowing the same key that opens a pop-up menu to close the same menu when pressed again. Other fans have mentioned this but Spiderweb for some reason has resisted making this improvement.\n* Would be nice if clicking anywhere on screen other than a pop-up closed the pop-up. Would be nice to have the right mouse button select player character and all creatures, instead of forcing player to find and punch the "0" on the keyboard every time -- a minor but constant irritation.\n* Would be nice if the hotkeys were customizable.\n\nNote on how to enjoy:\n* Read everything! The material is enjoyable, short, and well written. If you get tired, play something else until you are ready again to read everything. In this game you will create your own mental image and interpretation of the game world, based on what you read, unlike most games in which you will be shown a more explicit graphical representation of everything.\n* Don't read a guide, stay away from forums. They're not necessary (so far). Use trial and error. You can save anywhere.\n* Don't worry about trying to make the perfect build or to select every optimal decision in dialog choices. Immerse yourself in the world and let consequences just happen. The game is not so tough (so far) that you will get stuck.\n* Even if you don't finish this game, or for some reason don't like it much, it should be at least interesting to see what a very small but talented development team can accomplish with limited resources.\n\nEnjoy!","July 25, 2015","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have over 52 hours in this game.\n\nThis game is utterly amazing: a different take on CRPG where you are the Shaper and you create your party members through your own abilities.  It is a Fatasy setting with a twist of science fiction blended into a story that is both moving and fantastic. It will lead you into various adventure quests as the story is non-linear.  It has a ton of maps to explore especially when you find that lone canister hidden in a locked away room and you click on it to alter your shapers genetic code--what surprises will the canister yield upon your Shaper--you never know.\n\nThe game is old, the graphics may not appeal to some, especially to those younger gamers who are accustomed to high fidelity graphics and game play.  This is a turn base combat style game and should not be mistaken as a Diablo clone just because it has an isometric perspective, it is far from a Diablo style game.  If you're new to CRPG and you have purchased this game or had gotten it for free I would suggest playing it on easy mode it can still be quite challenging at times.  The other modes are much too difficult for someone new this format of gaming, once you get the feel of the mechanics, feel free to set your challenges higher: Normal, Tricky , and Torment-- frustration and delight awaits you in those modes.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite games next to Planescape: Torment, Ultima 7, and System Shock 2, in fact, I bought the entire saga and am looking forward to playing all five games.","May 7","true","3.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
