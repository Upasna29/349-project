I saw the trailer which truly expanded what I knew to be possible about bad Steam Greenlight games, so I bought it to check and see how bad it got. (I have since refunded this game. Don't worry.)\n\nThere are two weapons in this game - an assault rifle and a rocket launcher. The rocket launcher has no animation when fired. You pull the trigger and see an explosion happen.  There is no way to tell when, how, or if the enemies are attacking you. There are things in the environment that will make you curious only to insta kill you for approaching them, without warning or explanation. The level design is unexplainably bland - open ground and corridors  full of reused assets - that's it. It is unintentionally creepy due to an eerie lack of music. I won't even mention the nearly nonexistant story. What would you expect from the shovelware Greenlight garbage that floods the store these days?\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\n\nUnless you're intention is to show yourself and your friends the absolute depths of lazy design that a game can achieve in the modern day, STAY FAR, FAR AWAY.\n\nPS - I am aware that this game was created from start to finish by just one person. Good for him! That's awesome. Keep working on your trade. However, you have absolutely no business selling your half-baked practice games on Steam.","May 7","false","0.4"," 116 of 125 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","116","125","14","0"

Frame drops on menu, when shooting robots and some areas of map. There isn't much to the map or game it just looks like they through something togethor in a few months. I don't recommend right now, so refunding.","May 7","false","0.4"," 103 of 121 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","103","121","8","3"

The main menu's text has the same color as the rest of the starting screen, so you really can't see what you're clicking on. The weapons have the same reload animation, for every weapon. The main menu lags. The actual game uses stolen / default objects, everything is stock. The combat is as laughable as the writing. Speaking of writing, the popup text at the start is re-writable, and the dialogue was written by a 10 year old.\n\nI'm really glad nobody will ever spend real money on this game.\n\n9/11 would z.i.o.n. again!!!11!!!!1!!!!!11!","May 7","false","1.0"," 71 of 81 people (88%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","88","71","81","22","0"

This game is one of the worst titles I have ever played on Steam. There is nothing about this that could be redeeming. I could see this being done in like 2 days with little experience.\n\nHere is my video Impressions.... More enjoyable than the game IMO\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccaxh6Ue1os","May 8","false","0.2"," 71 of 86 people (83%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","83","71","86","16","1"

And what's worse you have to download 8051 Mb of pure crap just to see for yourself.\n\nDon't believe me? Did you see the trailer? You still want to give this game a try?\nGo ahead have fun...
