"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/359600/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Following the same formula of Assassin’s Creed Chronicles China and India, it’s now Russia’s turn to take part in this franchise. Developed by Climax Studios, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles Russia is set after the reign of Tsar Nicholas II as players navigate the turbulent Russian Empire of 1918 as you control assassin Nikolai Oreov who is on his last mission for the Assassins. There’s also a fun twist of another character that you also get to control and given the time period, let’s just say she’s no Disney princess.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia is the most stylized version of the trilogy. Most of the game’s color palette is a decidedly gray-based affair, to match with the Russian Revolution setting. However, objects which are able to be interacted with, and especially that are crucial to your advancement, are tinged blood red. The world even looks like it has a pastel, almost hand-outlined rendering applied to it. It’s a nice change of pace from the more realistic-looking earlier entries. Perhaps due to the fact that the backgrounds are simpler, the game also runs a little more smoothly than its predecessors.\n\nOutside of the visuals, the audio of the game is not that great. Since this game is set in Russia, one would think that all of the characters would be speaking in a Russian accent. However, most of the voice actors couldn’t even bother trying to put on a fake one and instead speak in their normal voices. It’s similar to how there were many British voice actors in Assassin’s Creed Unity which was set in France. The inaccurate voice acting breaks the immersion of the game entirely and this is a real disappointment.\n\nThough Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia is an admirable visual effort, the rest of the game follows the path of the entries before it in this trilogy. Expect to run around, jump, hide, and kill some terribly stupid AI characters. Enemies lose track of you after just a few feet, even indoors, and rarely look very far beyond the last spot that they saw you. The game is really almost too easy…except for those chase/escape missions. Oh man, they are back and as annoying as ever. There’s an exciting scene where you’re being chased by a train, which is ruined because you’ll likely have to repeat it several times. My issue isn’t with the fact that they are challenging — it’s that the game requires that you have pinpoint precision in performing your moves, while giving you clunky control over your character.\n\nSomething else that has been carried over from previous games and which also contributes to fortifying the game’s longevity are the secrets and secondary objectives that are scattered throughout each mission. Often requiring the player to deviate from an otherwise linear path, collecting these trinkets such as money to help Orelov pay for his family’s trip away from Russia or a collection of Templar documents, all provide additional unlockable rewards and a real tangible reason to replay previously conquered missions. Additionally, various lore scrolls also litter each map which aside from providing extra incentive to explore, also help to fill in the backstory of the game as well.\n\nStill though, in spite of such strict adherence to an already established formula, this Russian entry in the Chronicles spin-off series does actually do a handful of things a little differently from its predecessors, for better or worse. Aside from poorly conceived sniper sections and a Batman Arkham inspired grappling hook that can disable electrics, allowing you to disrupt enemy patrol patterns so that you may either slip silently past or assassinate them according to your chosen style of play, arguably the biggest change that Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia brings over its predecessor is the introduction of a second character to control.\n\nA mysterious figure known as Anastasia, she introduces a number of new abilities into the mix that are geared around the blue Helix crystals which appear later on in the game. The first of these abilities is the very handy Helix Blend, which allows Anastasia to instantly vanish and thus thwart the detection of any foes in the vicinity. Another of these abilities worth mentioning is the Helix Dash that allows our heroine to effectively teleport from one area of concealment to another. Sadly though, as is the broader case with the controls, these abilities can be horrendously tricky to pull off, more often than not resulting in a fluke or instant death depending on how lucky you are.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia is largely a stealth game, so as you navigate each level you’ve got to be on the look out for enemies that are capable of shooting you from long and short range.  Many levels feature soldiers that have long ranged rifles and can kill players in an instant. It’s “one shot one kill” in this game and this can make it tedious at times.  For players looking for a more action-oriented gameplay experience, Chronicles Russia isn’t your game.  Reinforcing this stealth gameplay, player characters are absolutely abysmal when it comes to close quarters combat.  It’s somewhat of a deviation within the series.  In Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China, Shao Jun was efficient in combat as she was able to engage enemies with a sword. Orelev and Anastasia on the other hand cannot put up a decent fight when facing enemies head-on.  It’s either stay unseen or die in Russia, because both characters die instantly if they are hit once or twice.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia has the most intriguing story in this mini-series and there are finally some new mechanics that add to the gameplay. The core of the game, however, is still unfortunately flawed. Enemies are hilariously stupid, chase/escape sequences require timing that is too precise for such a clunky control scheme, and checkpoints can be frustratingly sparse. While the stylized look and feel is a standout for this entry, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia doesn’t do quite enough to its core to improve by much. But if you enjoyed your time with the Chronicles series, then you shouldn't be disappointed with Russia.","March 6","true","34.4"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","28","31","2","1"

What an awesome game. Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia unfortunately is the last series in the trilogy chronicle series where you play two characters Nicolai Orelov and Anastasia.  In Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia  you can use a telephone in one room can distract a guard in another or shooting out breaker boxes which shortens (but doesn't eliminate) enemies  field of vision.  I love the environments (from nondescript buildings to blood-strewn laboratories and actual moving train, trams and boats) which makes the adventure even more involved, giving you the opportunity to really use your ever-changing surroundings to your advantage. The story, the gameplay, graphics and sounds are all of the highest caliber.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nArt Work/Storyline: 10/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nSound: 10/10\nControls: 10/10 (Keyboard and Mouse).\nOverall: 10/10\n\nThere are a lot of complains above the weak controls. Let me say that I played Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China, India and Russia twice and I have found no problems with the controls.  Yes, if this is the first time playing the game, then you will need to get used to it and if you stick to keyboard and mouse like I did, you will not find any problems.\n\nFinally if you have not played Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China and India, I would strongly recommend that you play Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China first, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India second and Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia last.\n\nThank you Ubisoft and Climax Studios for making three wonderful games. Can you please make more????? I would also recommend the developers to make an expansion pack.","February 15","true","18.0"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","19","26","5","6"

They are 2.5D platformers in the vein of the far superior Mark of the Ninja (developed by Klei Entertainment). I really enjoyed the first entry in the series, China, and immediately bought India when it was released. India was significantly more difficult than China, but never frustrating. I enjoyed it tremendously.\n\nSo when Russia was released, I bought it without hesitation. These games, taken as a whole, add a few things to the Mark of the Ninja formula (such as bushes you can hide in), and they are nothing but a treat as far as visuals are concerned. Russia certainly looks great and I enjoyed the story. As far as difficulty is concerns, this is on par with India with one notable exception: the chase/escape missions.\n\nMy goodness, how I hate those missions! They are an excercise in frustration. The timing is brutal and the controls sometimes are more than a little dodgy, meaning you won't got off a ledge or up from a ladder before some sniper gets you in his crosshairs. At that point, it's game over and you'll have to do the whole thing again. I was struggling to get through a sequence with spotlights, snipers, and a train, and I kept dying over and over again in a way that didn't feel like it was my fault, but rather the game instead.\n\nHaving just died for the umpteenth time, I just don't feel like continuing. I've deleted the game from my drive. Perhaps at some point in the future, I will revisit it and try if I can get further. But for now, other and better games demand my attention. As such, I recommend you check out the China and India entries in this series, but skip this one for now.","March 12","false","2.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

While not altogether different from the other Assassin's Creed Chronicles games, it offers a different and unique challenge. The difficulty has been ramped up in this version to provide a bit more of a challenge, but not so much so that it'll take you longer than 5-7 hours to beat it.\n\nAt the end of the story, I'm left with more questions than answers, but I'm told that this series is a companion series to the comic books which I have not read.\n\nYou'll go through 10 memory sequences which will feel familiar if you've ever played a main series Assassin's Creed game, though these are much shorter, much less cinematic, and much more comic book-y. You'll play through a series of sequences in which you are scored based on your "style grade" and you'll earn bonuses for being extra stealthy, non-lethal, and make good use of your resources. Some of my favorite levels are the "chase and run" levels where you're racing the clock to reach the exit. Those were by far the most fun and interactive.\n\nThe controls are a little unresponsive, but no more or less responsive than the previous two Assassin's Creed Chronicles games.\n\nAll in all, I would reccommend playing Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia as a breather to the main AC series. While not the best game, this has inspired me to try out other 2.5D puzzle platformers and that's a good thing.","February 15","true","6.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Where as in ACC China, there are multiple paths to complete an objective, usually many stealth paths and some open combat, there is only the illusion of choice in this games level design. To get to some of the main objectives you are seeminly given multiple ways to do things but when you try to experiment, you are punished with instant fail states or death. It was my understanding that the Assassins Creed games are all about open endedness, and choosing your owen path to and objective or target. Not in this game. You must do things the way the level designer intended it and ONLY THAT WAY.\n\nThis game is bsolutley not fun in any way, shape, or form. Chronicles China is a fine purchase in its stead. I am wondering how a developer actaully devolves in level design. Most of the levels where you play as Anastasia, yes Meg Ryan Anasatasia, rely almost entirely on Helix riffs to propel you forward, which they give you too many of, basically handing you the level. But then cut to playing as Nikolai and you get instant death traps just for daring to look in the wrong direction.\n\nDo not buy this game. It is an excercise in frustration and annoyance.
