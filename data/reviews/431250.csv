OMG!| I was just thinking of this today and wishing it was on Steam, and got released this same day!!!\nI used to play this game on PS3 (for literally years) and reached 15th position in world rankings, so i may be biased.\n\n--Edit: If you are trying the game to decide if asking for refund in the first two hours, DON'T judge the game only by the first campaign levels!!!\n\n--Most features and mechanics gets introduced later in the campaign. The morale system is introduced at level 11, forges at level 14, the possibility to transform buildings only at level 17.\n\n--IF you want to judge the game fast take a look at the "how to play" section where mechanics are well explained and, maybe, try them immediatly in a skirmish map (even tho campaign does a better job by introducing them step by step, just maybe you'll need more than 2 hours...)\n\n--In my experience, I've NEVER found any game similar to this that has the same strategic depth (from Galcon to Eufloria to any other free flash game on the net or android and apple stores), that in comparison always felt boring to me.\n\nThis game is a pearl.\n\nEasy to get in, but a lot of strategy and fast-thinking involved at high levels.\n\nOnline matches are not yet available, but should be soon with free updates.\n\nMeanwhile you can play the campaign and train yourself against AI controlled opponents, it is still fun!\n\nHow it works: is a simple, fast paced RTS game with 2D cartoonish graphics. All happen in a single screen, where 2 to 4 factions fight over the control of all buildings (conquest mode) or key buildings (king of the hill and domination modes).\n\nA match last an average of 3 minutes, but may be virtually infinite (i had 30 minutes long matches).\n\nI must say tho, I was rather disappointed with how the devs dealt with the ps3 versions: kept on promising new schemes (the community was also well willing to pay for those) but never delivered in order to work exclusively on the mobile version that later came out.\nI'm giving this a second chance and I sincerely hope this steam version gets a little bit more love. The game itself is really great.\n\nOn a side note: with mushroom wars 2 being work in progress (i just discovered while typing this review, lol), you might want to think twice if buying this one or wait for the next game.\n\nEdit: oh yeah, controller support and local multiplayer are (sadly) missing. Controller support should be added soon too (see discussions), no informations about local multiplayer.","April 7","true","15.8"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","45","53","4","5"

There isn't much to say about Mushroom Wars. It's a strategy game in the same vein as Planets Under Attack! except with Mushroom people who are slaughtering each other wholesale for the enjoyment of us non-mushroom Humans. The gameplay is simple, you start out with a tier 1 mushroom building that is upgraded by sacrificing a certain number of mushroom people to create more mushroom people at a faster rate. You conquer more of the mushroom buildings, creating more mushroom people to violate the lives and property of the opposing mushroom people who dared be born a different color. As time goes on, you'll unlock mushroom towers and mushroom forges which add a bit of mushroom variety but the core mechanics pretty much remain the mushroom... have more Mushroom people than your mushroom opponent.\nEventually, you'll mushroom mushrooms by mushrooms and mushrooms...\nIn summation, I rate this game Mushroom out of Mushroom. Definitely a Mushroom.\nMushroom Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW2h9Cb_erY","April 10","true","0.9"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","88","30","34","22","3"

You will find here now a single player campaign and skirmish mode. In a future come the multiplayer too. You are a general of mushroom army, you have only one thing what you can use, this is your soldiers. This one resource what you have and should to use. Your soldiers always growing, a growing speed depend of a level of your "barracks". Also you will find another types of building too, for example some help to you in defense or boost your army strength. So a gameplay very addictive,skill based and a battles very fast.\nThe game graphic is simple but looks very nice. Music and sound also nice.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ addictive gameplay\n+ fast action\n+ strategy skill based game\n+ fast decisions\n+ steam cards and achievements\n+ high replay value\n+ multiplayer (in closest updates)\n+ nice music and graphic style\n+ easy to learn how to play\n\n- a bit high price\n\nWhen i played this, I really like it. When you start it, its be hard to stop a play, because the fast action and a skill based gameplay is very addictive. The game also have great music and graphic style too. When this get a multiplayer mode in closest time, can bring even more fun for you. So if you like action and a strategical thinking this game absolutely for you. Only one thing can keep now far away from this, this is a price, but if this game going to sale and get some discount, dont hesitate, buy it and become to the great Mushroom general.\n\n","April 15","true","1.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/431250/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","This game was one of my favorite indie games on the PS3. I must have sunk tens or even hundreds of hours into it. A silly little indie game that is just totally addictive. To be honest I find it difficult to be objective on a game that captured my attention for as long and is as beloved as this title is. When Zillion Whales approached me to see whether or not I was interested in featuring their game on Steamified I was taken aback and had to ask if it was the very same game or whether they had come along and made a completely new game and given it that name. I don’t expect to see such old casual indie games ported to PC  but here it is and here I am digging it and getting the feels.\n\nThe best way to sum up the game is that it is one game that is especially easy to learn how to play but good luck mastering it. If you enjoy the game it is one that will capture your attention through to completion in the single player campaign. It makes the game highly accessible to almost every gamer, is much deeper strategically than what it may appear at first and has tremendous replayability. It’s a great game and I believe that the original has been improved upon for its PC release – from what I have played.\n\nAs an aside, I haven’t played the Steam multiplayer but it is one mode that I am most looking forward to. If anyone wants to play a few rounds please let me know and we’ll get to it.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","14.3"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","26","37","0","0"

Graphics and Audio deserve the best compliments, the game has its own apmosphere and entertainment which is really important when you are developer and go for high-level development.\n\nThis is indeed strategy game where you are the commander of many mushrooms and you lead your army to the victory, defending your own stuff, fighting alien mushrooms and other creatures, conquering important towers - defend your own world, brave player!\n\nThe game has 3 different modes which are mixed in the company (story) mode, but it is also possible to play any mode using single game option.\nDevelopers also have an intention to update the game with multiplayer thing, i believe it's pretty much important, because this brand new feature will allow this strategy game to shine its best!\n\nSome level are plenty difficult and it takes a while to complete them, it's not a game of "one shot", there are a lot of possibilities and gameplay options for you to get caught by this game for a long time.\n\nFor those who are not sure about technical side of the game:\nI didn't find any bugs or similar crap, had no problems with installing or anything like that, sound is great, picture is also nice, no freezes, no lags, so i got only positive emotions.\n\nSummary:\nI would say 9/10 at this moment, totally worth its money.\n\nThe developer is well-known by its other game called Plastiland, so if you enjoyed this game, you should probably try Plastiland too.\n\nI will add more information and my own thoughts after i go deeper inside the game.","April 15","true","3.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","13","14","4","0"

You command an army of mushroom warriors who are housed in mushroom structures. You can command 25%, 50%, 75%, or all mushrooms of a selected structure to attack or move to another structure. Although simplistic, this can get really interesting when dealing with a large number of villiages and a variety of structures.\n\nThe devs said they were inspired by a game called Galcon, and games like Modern Conflict and Planets Under Attack took a lot of inspiration from Mushroom Wars. So if you are familiar with those other games, you might have a decent grasp of how Mushroom Wars plays.\n\nThe campaign is 30 levels (with a few being simple tutorial missions), and compete against enemy AI who sometimes have a tactical advantage from the start. Initially I was annoyed by this, but since the AI is nowhere near the competance of another human player, I found that the difficulty was actually pretty fair. This actually led to some of the later levels almost feeling like a puzzle to me, forcing me to decide which enemy structures to take out first in order to not get overwhelmed by the AI's larger numbers. Overall it's a decent campaign, although a little short.\n\nOther than the campaign there are skirmish and multiplayer modes. Skirmish is what it sounds like, you're given a selection of symmetrical maps where you can compete against AI. I can't say anything about the multiplayer unfortunately, as it is not availible at launch. This may be a deal breaker for some considering the short campaign, and that's understandable. However, the devs have promised that multiplayer will be availible for free in a future update. I'll update my review then.\n\nThe PC Port itself works fine. There aren't many graphical options beyond resolution and vsync, but that's all that's necessary for a game like this.\n\nOverall, Mushroom Wars is a fun little indie game with surprising depth despite its simplicity. I would say that it's worth $10, especially when it recieves its multiplayer update.","April 15","true","8.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You have to coordinate your very own mushroom army in order to conquer, hold and defend villages, towers and forges. I played this game for quite some hours now and it is getting more and more fun. What has been wild clicking in the beginning - including lots of failures -   became coordinated battle sessions where you have to think fast and make quick decisions in order to win.  Once you are there this game is just AWESOME!  You can select Campaign, Skirmish and Multiplayer (not yet implemented) Mode. Also there are three different game modes/mission types:\n1. Conquest: you  have to capture all buildings.\n2. Domination: Conquer  specific buildings to win\n3. King of the hill: Conquer and hold specific buildings to gain points. Whoever reaches 300 points first wins the round\nEverything comes in easy, normal and hard.... and hard means hard! It is very challenging and I especially love the reward system. Every mission in the campaign mode can be played having a different focus and goal in order to unlock the rewards.\nThe game will also have a multiplayer mode in the near future and that means up to 4 players can play against each other or make a 2on2 ... or 1on3 :-).

But what he won’t tell you is that there’s a war going on that he has no clue how to end.  Since 2009, a vicious war between factions of the mushroom kingdom has taken place.  Since this time, the war has only grown larger.  It’s now spread to PC.  I have seen this war up close and let me tell you.  It’s amazing. There’s nothing like it.  People should give the makers of this game a lot of credit. Since the release of this game, America and the entire world has become great again.  In the near future, things will only get better with the multiplayer update.","April 8","true","5.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","38","3","8","9","0"

I was wrong.  You need to control every single unit, grow stronger and figure out how to outdo an ai that does exactly what you are doing with no mistakes.  Basically you just have to outnumber your for in every way.  Was not fun.","May 30","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
