It's an atmospheric, mesmerizing take on the classic block breaker.   I had a lot of fun just looking around and enjoying the environment and vibing to the music.   The game play involves throwing balls at a series of block puzzles.  It's simple at first, but grows more challenging as you must find a strategy to work the angles and throw around obstacles.  You'll do a lot of damage throwing balls and work hard enough to get an arm workout.  Along the way you'll discover a few zen moments of destruction toppling down massive block walls, and satisfaction when balls lobbed around a corner connect with the intended target.   It's a lot of fun to be able to throw and break things in VR, and just like a classic arcade game you can expect a frenzied escape from the ordinary.","April 29","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
