Which is a damn shame, seeing as how much hours people have put into this and the fact that the community of veterans has somehow managed to stay alive and well after all of these years.\n\nI got the original Trackmania (The original) game out of a cereal box. And if I didn't, I bet I would have never touched the series. Out of sheer awe from the quality of the game, I bought Trackmania: Sunrise Xtreme off of Ebay years later. And now, I found that there was a steam version of the game, Trackmania: United Forever, which luckily enough, is a full-functioning combination of everything in the Original TM and Sunrise Xtreme TM into one super-game with content updated for both games and new content for both to officially mash the two together on an updated playfield.\n\nFor people new to the series, Trackmania is mostly a racing game. HOWEVER.\n\nYou build your own tracks with the exact same advanced freedom the developers had when they made the standard tracks\nThe races are non-contact and are purely for who can get the best time\nA lot of the game is directed towards break-neck stunts and mile-long jumps that require extreme precision to complete flawlessly\nThe game has multiplayer that is cleverly designed to have the players race together but remove the effects of lag, competition and griefing by simply using non-contact 'ghost' style races and stunt events\nAs a map builder you can concentrate just as much on making the map beautiful and realistic as well as concentrate on somehow making a single ramp send the player from one end of the map to the other\nWhile being a game with a lot of features for multiplayer, the game definitely accomodates for the offline community as well. And being that the races are a 'ghost' style event, you don't have to worry about poor AI opponents or finding other people to play with as the people's races on the same course are recorded to be your 'ghost' opponent. In fact, you can turn off the 'ghost' opponent entirely and just race against your own time if that's how you want to go.\n\nThe only time I ever have a problem with the game's community is when I find myself forced to play somebody's extreme track that takes half an hour to complete because some people are certain their creations are the s**t.\n\nPlease, give this game a chance. Please.","September 29, 2014","true","20.7"," 70 of 74 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","70","74","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oublie10/recommended/7200/","oublie10","Forgot10","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oublie10/","155 products in account","If you give this game only a brief glance, you are going to see a simple arcade racing game where cars look like toys and drive round corners at speeds exceeding 600 km/h. But if you look under the shell and start probing deeper you shall see that TrackMania is in fact many things and it isn't in fact simple, but rather simplistic.\n\nDo you like hardcore racing where you need to hunt for tenths and hundredths of a second, and even a small concentration lapse can result in a crash when you are on a world record pace? Come on in, there's plenty of that. Do you like to build maps for others to race at? It's easy to do that with a built in editor. Maybe you prefer doing various stunts, such as backflips, barrel rolls, driving through loops or just riding the walls in a car? TM is a perfect choice for you. Just in case you like puzzles, there's a game mode for you where you have to build a fastest way between start, finish and a few checkpoints using a limited amount of blocks. Then again you can just challenge your brain and your very self to try and seek for outrageous shortcuts in others' tracks, as nobody can dictate you the order in which the checkpoints must be driven.\n\nAnd there's definitely more to this game than I mentioned above, feel free to discover your favourite bit of the game.\n\nOne of the best things is of course the community. People are usually friendly, helpful and positive in every way.\n\nLast word from me: http://united.tm-exchange.com/ - check out this website, and the quick links. Maybe that will lead you to something that can hold you playing this game for thousands of hours.","February 18, 2015","true","75.5"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","43","45","6","6"

The only Trackmania game I had played at the time was the original. I picked it up for 5 bucks at a convention, not knoning what I would discover. I loved the track editor, and the consistant car handling making the time trials pure skill and pathfinding. Trackmania United it the refined accumulated verision of all 3 the Trackmania PC games before Trackmania 2.\n\nIt's a great hot wheel style racing, It's tight. it's right. The content creation within the game is incredibly accessible enabling new content to be continuously created by players. I often play online without experiencing playing the same track twice. Anyone can easily create playable tracks resulting in a gigantic amount of tracks existing.\n\nTHe online community in this game is still huge and full of dedication. For example, there's a site for sharing tracks and racetimes online that's still lively.\nunited.tm-exchange.com\n\nLove this game. Great if you like this stuff.

IMO, the best racing game out there... still.\n\nThis game is bigger outside of the US than it is inside the US.  Most of the servers you will play on (which all host unique custom races) will be outside of the US.  If you are worried about lag, don't be, as the gameplay isn't like a standard racing game.  You start a track with a specific time limit.  You can run the track as many times as you can within this time limit.  In the end, the person who managed to run the course the fastest on any given run, is the winner.  There is no collision with other players in this game, and once you play some of the tracks out there, you will know why.  It wouldn't be possible to complete them any other way.\n\nI would describe this style of racing game as a twitch racer.

You'll get over 800 km/h sometimes.\n\nThere's a reason why 97 % people recommened this game. It's just that good. You can play in 7 enviroments that feel completely different. Each enviroment also has their own vehicle which you can paint to your liking. You have over 400 races, platforms, stunts, and puzzles to beat.\nThe game may seem really hard at first, but you'll get used to it quite fast. Some tracks are fairy easy, while others provide extreme challange, and to get golden medal (highest reward you can get for each track), you'll need to play it litterally 50 times to get beat golden medal requirements.\n\nWhile graphics do look outdated compared to modern games, the gameplay is perfect, and could hardly be any better, so don't worry too much about that.\nIf you are into making your own tracks, this is the best game out there to do so. You can make tracks for all 7 enviroments. There is simple editor to get used to basics, and once you get used to it, there is very, very complex editor that allows you to everything with all objects in the game.\nMultiplayer is still active. It offers tons of superb custom made tracks that will provide additional challange.\n\nThe specs for the game are very, very low for nowadays PC gaming standards, and don't worry about compatibility. The game runs great on Windows 10 (I play it on 10 myself).\n\nIf you have never played Trackmania game, you should try this one even if you don't like racing. It's really fun game to play. If you have already played other Trackmania games, you should buy it too because it's currently the best one you can get. It offers so much content, that even though it's almost 10 years old, it's still worth the asking price.\n\nThe only people that shouldn't buy this game, are people who have played Trackmania games before, and didn't enjoy them. It's unlikely that you will like this one, if you didn't like the other ones.\n\nYou can try how game feels for free, as stadium enviroment is available for free here:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/11020/\n\nHave fun and get gut.","March 27","true","5.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

If you're thinking about buying United, but you're on the fence, play Nations Forever first. The real question worth answering is: should I upgrade to this game, or just stick with Nations Forever?\n\nIn short, get it if:\nYou want to avoid the multiplayer limitations in TMNF\nYou want more single-player tracks\nYou want to become more competitive in multiplayer, or in single-player time trial\nYou don't mind the bugs in TMNF\nmultiplayer limitations in Nations Forever\nIn Nations Forever, there are a few multiplayer limitations added to the game that incentivise players to upgrade - the most obvious being: you can only go on FreeZone servers; car skins are not visible to other players; and every fifth track you will be relegated to being a spectator.\n\nSpectating every fifth track can be pretty annoying, especially if you were hoping to play a specific track but need to sit out. Also, the chat is disabled when you are 'FreeZoned', which is unnecessary and frustrating. If you are into the multiplayer, this will probably be the biggest advantage that United has over Nations Forever.\n\nsingle-player tracks\nUnited adds a boat load more single-player tracks over Nations Forever (which still has quite a lot)! It also adds some legacy environments to the game, which are probably familiar to the player of older TM games (Sunrise, woo!). Bear in mind that the cars handle really differently in the other environments, so it can be a little jarring to play them.\n\non competitiveness\nI don't really play competitive, but the single-player leaderboard system is really expanded in United, showing (as in the later games) your placement among your peers. Of course, if you play multiplayer, the far more important aspect is that you can join any server rather that those in the FreeZone.\n\nbugs\nThis game is really old. And it includes content from games older still. If you find bugs in TMNF, don't expect them to be fixed in United.\n\nAll in all, it is a great game, and whether you get United, stick with Nations Forever, or buy a newer Trackmania, you'll still get a great and addictive racing game.\n\n","April 16","true","205.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You probably want to know if Trackmania is even worth buying, right ? Don't lie to yourself. Good. Ok, let me tell you; it's worth it. There. I said it. So what's the difference between this game and the free one ? Honestly ? I have no idea. But it's such a fun game that you should go and buy it anyway to support the developers for even creating games like these, and to do yourself a favor of course. For those who don't know what Trackmania is all about; you basically drive a car (no sims here, it's all arcade racing) and have to beat the lap times. Easy enough, right ? Well, anyone can win a bronze medal in this game. If you want the gold one you have to drive perfect though. You have to know when to slow down, where to jump, how to take corners, everything. THAT's the challenge. It's great ! And it's even more epic when you play this game 'with' your friends.

You should only care about time you have in finish of the race.\n\nSounds easy? Well at first, yes, but you should know, that it's not that easy. There are many levels, where you should firstly try them many times to find best way to the end.\n\nThis is just small info about the game, well take a look more closer.\n\nTrackMania United is the paid game based on TrackMania Nations Forever, which is free. You can try it and take a look at the race model and have big fun too. In the United edition you find many more stuff, like many game modes from simple to multi player races, you can compete with your own time, your friends and whole community over the internet, and you should know that the community is huge!\n\nThere are even competitions with real world standings so if you fall into this game, you should make much time to spend it here :D. You can choose to play as single player at the beginning, if you are worried to know how bad racer you are ;-) but practise makes perfect, so you will have great progress in time.\n\nSingle player is all about having better and better times and to get medals - from bronze to gold, but if you obtain better time than creator of the map (or let's say something like par in golf) you will get green Nadeo medal[en.tm-ladder.com], and be happy :D. One more thing: with winning medals you get in-game currency named coopers.\n\nOK, let's continue, medals you can get in races from classical races, to platform, stunt and puzzle races in many environments where the stadium one is similar in Nations version.\n\nThere is availability to modify your vehicles - at least the design of color and stickers, you can even write something on your car - place there your national flag or so ...\n\nThe last but not least option is to make your own track and if you will be good in it, you can show it to the community and compete your time with theirs.\n\nThe game is really great and if you want to take a break from killing creatures or from saving worlds try this one and enjoy :)","July 4, 2011","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw that Steam got the entire season to buy, then i almost instantly returned to this addiction! (thank you lord Gaben)\n\nYou can never get bored of TrackMania, the competition catches you in a never end cycle. You're going to start on the Stadium mode, which is pretty straight forward, beat the time of your opponents and climb the ladder with millions of players, yes i know this isn't an easy task, but it's very much worth when you improve and play with people with the same skill as you.\n\nThe community is one of the nicest i ever knew (League of Legends veteran here), for example, when i enter the Coast server, every single person says hello, good game, they even compliment when you get a nice record, i highly recommend this game if you want to make some friends, you'll feel like home!\n\nThere's 7 other modes, including Stadium, you can try them all on the Solo play, and you can search if they still have a dedicated server of the mode. I'm a Coast player since when i found back on my days, i loved it more because it's more my playstyle, i'll resume briefly how every one of they are:\n*Stadium, it's the first one, arcadish and fast, it's the first door to understand the game.\n*Coast it's more like a grip challenge, how to control your car, it's the most competitive of them all in my honest opinion.\n*Island gets pretty insane with the Ferraris and their speed! Put the cockpit camera and fly on the track.\n*Desert you can handle your muscle car pretty nicely, but in the turns, you better watch out!\n*Rally is when i suck pretty hard, remembers me the "ColinMcRee Rally" series, watch your brakes.\n*Snow it's one of the funniest, honestly, little cars in apparently toy tracks, Micro Machines anyone?\n*Bay, when the SUVs reaches lightspeed, pretty awesome to handle those cars!\n\nThe only one Cons i found is, TrackMania isn't very popular nowadays, because Nadeo implemented a FreeZone kinda style, which is, every free player (from TrackMania Nations) can play 2 or 3 tracks, and needs to spectate one because of the FreeZone limitations, this got the game on the ground for many years, but the fun is the same with the United version, you're not a free user obviously, and can experiment all of the modes, try the game, it's really worth!","March 16, 2014","true","200.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're looking for a serious racing game, this isn't it... but if you've already beaten plants vs. zombies and peggle and are looking for something mindless to do while listening to audio books, this will fit the bill perfectly.\n\nThe only multiplayer mode is concurrent time trials, which works quite well. Since you're mainly racing the clock, you can restart the race at any time and won't be unduly affected by lag or cheats. However, the lack of variety means the game itself won't hold your interest for long unless you're playing with friends or also listening to podcasts at the same time.\n\nAll cars in a given race mode handle exactly the same. There is no car customization outside of your car's paint and model, but that's quite fun in itself. No plot. None of the annoying interruptions that are so common in other racing games such as cutscenes, slow menus, and crash cams. You can jump directly from one lap to the next. There is a 1 minute delay between races every time the server switches tracks, but otherwise the fun is uninterrupted.\n\nThere is a huge number of tracks but all are constructed from the same set of sections, so the variety is limited. Most tracks can be driven fairly close to top speed for most of the race - late braking isn't a part of the game. The game is mainly about finding the shortest path through the track that doesn't result in a crash.\n\nThe free version requires spectating every few races but otherwise gets access to most of the content. This isn't pay-to-win. Free players don't play at a disadvantage. I paid for the full version and I found it to be worth the price in order to play uninterrupted. Paid players also get access to several other modes including many tracks, different track types, and a new type of car for each track type. Unfortunately, the paid servers are normally empty so you'll still spend most of your time racing the same tracks as the free players.\n\nIf you think of this as a casual game, you'll get some fun out of it. If you're looking for a realistic driving sim, look elsewhere.\n","January 29, 2015","true","66.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

These tracks can be played alone, with friends through the multiplayer mode or passed on to others so they can try your tracks.\nIf you like arcade racers and flying through the air, this game is definitely for you.\nAdditionally, if you don't feel like buying the game, you can play the free version that works just as well without the bells and whistles.","July 3, 2011","true","44.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even if you turn the deadzone up and sensitivity all the way down, it's still way too touchy. There's also no way to map the triggers to accel and brake, so there's no analogue speed control. There are no setup options, no manual shifting, it's just stop or go.\n\nMost tracks are start here, finish there (A to B) rather than having laps like a normal racing game. The stunts are cool, but most races are over in less than 2 minutes so you don't really get to enjoy the driving that much, unless you're trying to get a gold medal, then you're just going to be repeating the same short run over and over. All opponents (AI or players) are ghost cars. To unlock the higher tier tracks require you to get at least Gold on the previous, but because the controls are so touchy and jerky, it can be a pretty tall order.\n\nI don't get why this game is so popular. It's expensive for being so old and simplistic. It would be nice to have a good stunt car game on Steam. There really hasn't been one since Stunts or Stunt Driver, so I guess this (or the sequels) would be it. You can make your own tracks and paint your cars, so that's a plus.\n\nIt's a good game if you're looking for something simple and over the top. It's just racing - no cops, no boosts, no setups or car tuning, no cockpit view (just two chase and one bumper cam). Not all tracks have jumps and loops, but most do. It's a good game, but I can't recommend it at the current price point.","August 17, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 69 people (6%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","6","4","69","2","2"

Couple that with online play that's still going after all these years after release, and you've got a winner.\n\nSeriously, at least try out Nations.

Compared to United, Nations is (I think) restricted to one racing mode and one themed set of tracks/cars. It's a great demo, actually a pretty great game in itself... no reason not to try it!\n\nI've mostly just played Trackmania singleplayer, in time-trial mode (same mode as in Nations). The races are short, some of the early ones just a few seconds long. Restarting a race is instant. Typically when you're aiming for a gold medal time you will restart whenever you make a mistake, trying over and over for the perfect clean run.\n\nI don't really get into some of the massive-retries games like Trials or Super Meat Boy, but for some reason Trackmania hits the spot. Maybe because it's so colorful, fast, and generally gonzo. If games have mottos, Trackmania's is "WHEEEEEEEEE!". :-)\n\nUpdate: this is also a surprisingly great LAN party game, especially in "rounds" mode.","January 2, 2011","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is amazing, and totally worth every penny considering the huge amount of content you get for it. With the Forever Star Edition, you get to race in 7 environments, compared to just the one Stadium environment in Nations. Each environment has its own style of tracks and its own vehicle, which all handle very differently. For example, the Stadium racecar handles decently and can go pretty fast, while the Snow truck has barely any acceleration at all, but has huge handling capability. With this game, you get everything in the free Nations version (which has at least 100 or so tracks if I recall correctly), along with the United expansion, containing a metric ton of tracks from the 6 other environments it adds (Island, Desert, Snow, Rally, Coast, and Bay) in a variety of gamemodes. And Trackmania just isn't Trackmania without the Track Builder. It does take a little getting used to, but once you've figured it out, it's very fun to make your own tracks and publish them to the community via Manialinks. If making tracks wasn't enough, you can also make custom paintjobs for your cars as well. Online racing is very fun, and there's always a bunch of servers with people playing. The online servers might have a lot of UI that might look like a bit much to take in, but you can customize it if you like. The community is friendly for the most part, too, which is a huge plus considering the state of some communities nowadays. All in all, this is a great game for casuals and competitive types alike. Would easily recommend.","June 20, 2015","true","120.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At core the game combines the mechanics of a puzzler with a race driver, but the emphasis is squarely on the driving and the driving is FUN. Unfortunately there's little real racing going on since 90% of your time is spent in "time attack" mode, but online play allows for real-time competitive time attack. There's a bazillion user created racetracks to download and master on top of the built in designs and your success earns money allowing you to buy new cars, track elements. There are seven different track environments and seven car types which are uniquely challenging, and the design of the tracks can become absolutely diabolical when gunning for a perfect score. As a break from beating the existing tracks you can try building your own tracks through the money you've earned and see how creative you can get, it's like a kids slot car toy on steroids.\n\nHighly recommended!","December 27, 2011","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is amazing, and totally worth every penny considering the huge amount of content you get for it. With the Forever Star Edition, you get to race in 7 environments, compared to just the one Stadium environment in Nations. Each environment has its own style of tracks and its own vehicle, which all handle very differently. For example, the Stadium racecar handles decently and can go pretty fast, while the Snow truck has barely any acceleration at all, but has huge handling capability. With this game, you get everything in the free Nations version (which has at least 100 or so tracks if I recall correctly), along with the United expansion, containing a metric ton of tracks from the 6 other environments it adds (Island, Desert, Snow, Rally, Coast, and Bay) in a variety of gamemodes. And Trackmania just isn't Trackmania without the Track Builder. It does take a little getting used to, but once you've figured it out, it's very fun to make your own tracks and publish them to the community via Manialinks. If making tracks wasn't enough, you can also make custom paintjobs for your cars as well. Online racing is very fun, and there's always a bunch of servers with people playing. The online servers might have a lot of UI that might look like a bit much to take in, but you can customize it if you like.

If anyone has ever tried out electric slot cars, remote control cars or even the new mini RC cars, TrackMania offers a similar experience.  You’ll experience giant jumps, insane turns, and tracks set in unique locations such as a castle, the desert or on ice.  You’ve got to keep an eye out on the track, because you never know what could be coming up at the next corner.\nFast, fun and entertaining gameplay is what gaming is all about.  TrackMania is another welcomed addition to our world of entertaining PC games.  From the great graphics, fun gameplay, and amazing concept, TrackMania provides a might punch in a small package.  However, the repetitive music and repetitive gameplay might leave some gamers looking for the brake pedal.  TrackMania should provide enough entertainment value to keep gamers driving for a long time to come.","March 15, 2011","true","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gm027/recommended/7200/","gm027","Goldium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gm027/","48 products in account","Ahhh, TrackMania United, the perfect arcade-based racing game.\n\nI really don't know where to start this. Off the bat, TM: United is an arcade racing game, where you build tracks, perform loop-de-loops, crazy stunts, jumps, and tricks. This game houses several environments to race in (with Stadium being the most popular), and different cars for each environment (some cars may have better handling than overs, however most often the cars are tuned to the environment's racing style). The game's racing action is fairly solid, so handling and steering shouldn't be an issue (except on Coast, if you aren't familiar with rally racing).\n\nThe track editor is also very intensive and detailed (if you click the Advanced editor anyway). The track pieces pretty much go together like lego bricks, so the only way you can mess up a track is if you happen to forget a track piece to add in, or perhaps overshoot/undershoot your car's speed for jumps or sideways tracks. Believe me though, if you spend enough time in that editor, you can pretty well make some very challenging maps.\n\nIn addition to making your own maps, you can even set times on them. You can race your own creations, and try to set the best time, so other people can try to beat your time on your track. You can also choose to share your maps either via TMX (a website that specializes in maps for all the TrackMania titles), or via a Manialink (an in-game, hub store where users can upload their creations and buy them with in-game currency called credits (you cannot buy credits by the way, you earn them through logging in daily or by winning bets on the servers).\n\nThe other thing about TrackMania is that there is a paint option, so you can pain your cars very extravagantly and make them unique. Optionally, there's also user-made skins on TrackMania Carpark and on several Manialinks you can download. So if you feel like that old Stadium car is looking boring, you can download a BMW Z4 or a Mario Kart, or even one of the vehicles from F-Zero and race that instead.\n\nFinally, the community of the game. I will admit off hand, I have logged a good lot of time into this game (was even playing its freeware version TrackMania Nations before I bought United), and in that time, it's tough to find good people there. To sum it up, you might not be that happy if you are a North American player, since the North American community (which is VERY small), tends to rank up on the global leaderboards in the top 10,000-100,000 range. While this may seem intimidating, there's also the EU community (which is VERY large), which can be ranked anywhere from the top 100,000-12 million range. Due to the wider range in the EU community, you might have better odds at placing in events on the EU servers over the North American ones (since the NA servers are few and far inbetween). On the upside though, your car doesn't crash into other players, so the only way you'll end up crashing is by human error.\n\nHowever, if you don't quite want to roll with the multiplayer crowd, there is still the singleplayer, time trial maps you can play to earn medals (which do boost your ranking to some degree). Some of them can get very hard to beat, but it's still a good challenge if you feel like doing those sorts of games.\n\nAll in all, the game can be praised for it's creative prowess in regards to track building and racing, as well as the graphics too (which are still incredibly good despite the game's age). The multiplayer community might leave you wanting to have competition that isn't so incredibly skilled so you can have a chance to place, but the content that the community still pushes out is still impressive nonetheless, and still keeps me coming back for more.\n\nTo summarize, I recommend this game if you are the type that likes a good arcade racer with solid controls, and the ability to create maps.","August 20, 2015","true","49.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TechnoLad97/recommended/7200/","TechnoLad97","Techno_Lad97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TechnoLad97/","64 products in account","Trackmania United is quite fun to play. Before I bought United I've spent alot of time on the free to play Nations. Nations is practically United but your restricted to just the Stadium environment.\n\nUnited offers an additional 6 themes, with United you'll be able to race and design tracks in Snow, Desert, Rally, Bay, Island, Coast and Stadium environments and I'll tell you now. The Island car is insanely fast compaired to the Stadium car.\n\nBut if you're looking for multiplayer servers with any other theme but Stadium, good luck with that because United shares it's multiplayer with Nations and it's very rare to find a Non-Stadium server but, of course, if you've got friends who plays United then you could always arrange a meet-up.\n\nThe simple but advanced grid based track editor shouldn't be too hard if you've got experience from Nations, but with the additon of 6 more environments to play with, each with their own sets of track pieces, offers more variety for your creativity to work with.\n\nSo really United is a Nations upgrade. You can play Nations to try out Trackmania and if you enjoy it. Then consider United if you want more. Trying out Nations is probably the best thing you can do because as I've noticed, United has never had its price cut in a sale.","September 27, 2014","true","86.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
