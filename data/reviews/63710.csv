Ultimately, I recommend against buying it.\n\nPros:\n- The game has a wonderful and cohesive visual and auditory aesthetic.  The levels convey a compelling liveliness and otherworldliness.  The obstacles, enemies, and background "creatures" are inventive and cool-looking. I wish I could go explore the background with Commander Video.\n- The music is great.  I actually bought the album of the band that did the opening credits theme (Anamanaguchi) after hearing it in this game.\n- The mechanics are pretty predictable. It's obvious when you need to jump, smash, etc, although sometimes certain elements can get muddled by everything else going on around it.\n- It has achievements, and I like achievements, because I'm kinda OCD.\n- It has Steam cloud sync, because it's 2014.\n\n\nCons:\n- It's billed as a rhythmic platformer, but falls short on both counts. As a platformer it's dull and the controls are tight. It requires rote memorization in many places rather than reliance on reflexes.  As a rhythmic game it falls short because the beats of the songs actually throw you off and aren't very well-timed to what you're supposed to be doing.  Rhythmic platformers must be pretty difficult to design because they require absolute integration in the spatial and time dimensions, but when the designers fail it actually makes the game less intuitive and more frustrating.\n- At times it seems like my character didn't actually collide with an object, but it registers a hit, sending me back to the beginning of the level. Seems like there's fudgy hitboxes. A game like this requires skintight hitboxes.\n- Just because it's hard doesn't make it fun. The designers deliberately made the game very hard by the exclusion of checkpoints.  You could call this "sadistic" or say it's meant to attract only the most diehard platformer fans (of which I am one), but it makes the game inaccessible and artificially extends the playtime. It's a crutch you see used a lot in indie platformers these days. Super Meat Boy was exceptionally hard but had an enormous amount of depth. Bit.Trip Runner is actually a pretty short and shallow experience if you add checkpoints.\n- Since this is a rhythmic platformer, a large part of the game experience is enjoying the music. But it's incredibly difficult to even get past the first world (of three total), and you don't really hear different music until then.  By the time I got there I was so ♥♥♥♥ing tired of the music in the first world I never want to play it again. Contrast that to Electronic Super Joy, 140, and Super Meat Boy, where I frequently go back and play levels just to hear the music.\n- You have to focus so much on timing your movements that\n- Autoscroll on every level kinda sucks in platformers. That's probably a controversial statement, but it's what I think. Oh, and while I'm at it, Metallica's "And Justice for All..." is their best.\n- The boss battles are inventive, but by the 100th time I tried to beat the first world boss I was ♥♥♥♥ing bored out of my mind. I actually had to write down the order of what comes at me in order to beat it. This isn't Calculus. I shouldn't have to take notes.\n\nI think the cons outweigh the pros, so I can't recommend this one. But, if you like really hard platformers with good music and don't mind nearly-endless repetition, you'll probably enjoy it.","February 18, 2014","false","5.3"," 63 of 85 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","63","85","0","5"

BIT.TRIP is the fourth game in the BIT.TRIP series and is best described as a "Rhythm 2D Platformer" or alternatively as the kind of game that places gamers into mental institutions.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=350588166\nBIT.TRIP RUNNER's world is divided into three zones each containing 11 levels plus a boss encounter. The main objective for each level is to simply avoid all the obstacles in your way as you character moves from left to right. Commander Video is equipped with various mechanisms to avoid these obstacles such as jumping, sliding and kicking. Once the game starts there is no stopping the Commander unless you become entwined with one of the many obstacles placed in his way which will result in the Commander being warped right back to the start of the level. Various things like power upgrades and score multipliers will be placed in your path to boost your gains. These multipliers and upgrades will also have a distinct effect on the games soundtrack adding more and more layers to the electronic soundtrack the further along the level you progress.\n\nAt its heart, BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a game of memory. It all starts out deceptively easy but by the time you start to close out the first zone, levels start to get incredibly long (some lasting upwards of 10 minutes) and it can get incredibly frustrating nearing the end of a level only to slip up and get dragged all the way back to the beginning. Apart from memory, BIT.TRIP RUNNER also demands absolute focus and concentration from its players and I often found the game to be incredibly exhausting (particularly the later levels which seriously increase in length and difficulty).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=350587243\nOften multipliers and upgrades will be placed in tenuous positions that will require some quick fiddling with the controller or keyboard lest you connect with one of the obstacles and see yourself placed, yet again, right back at the beginning of the stage. This is where the mental institution bit raises its head because many a time it will induce the kind of rage that bursts blood vessels, brings on tantrums and produces tears. To the non-initiated it may look very much like the start of madness and often it is. BIT.TRIP RUNNER demands a lot from its players so be prepared to gnash teeth, throw keyboards and controllers and generally swear like a foul-mouthed demon that has just raised its head from the pits of hell.\n\nI enjoyed the 8bit style graphics meshed with modern game design and the electronic soundtrack, whilst incredibly cool at first gets incredibly repetitive as the levels progress. Since you are only given one tune to enhance per zone, if you land up spending hours and hours in one zone be prepared to listen to the same tune over and over and over (which can also induce all forms and sorts of madness on its own).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=350586605\nBIT.TRIP RUNNER is not the kind of game you play solidly for 8 hours at a stretch but as game to occasionally dip your toe into during playthroughs of other games it can be a lot of fun. Just know what you are getting yourself into and make sure that memory of yours can beat an elephants.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","January 27, 2014","true","4.5"," 47 of 64 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","47","64","0","0"

The music that plays in the background helps you keep the pace somewhat and you can probably blindfold this game if you memorize it completely.\n\nBut the bad thing about the game, is that you have one try.\n\nIf you fail in any way, you will start at the beginning of the level. The first few levels are easy, but the further in you get into a chapter, the levels get both longer and more complicated, some lasting up to 4-5 minutes. So the game turns into a game or memorizing every little thing, you have to remember which buttons to press and for how long to press them as well, some things you get barely no warning of at all so the first time you get there, you will die.\n\nFun.\n\nSo the game itself is pretty fun, except the lack of checkpoints, which makes it extremely frustrating instead.\n\nGraphics: It’s pretty if you like this 3d-pixel environment. It works well I think. :)\nThings kind of tend to blur together at times, but might be intentional to make it harder.\n\nTechnically I had no real hiccups, though I experienced some light lags at times, but think it might be my computer instead of the game. 99% of the time it was smooth sailing.\n\nSo should you buy this? Well, I don’t know, some might like this a lot, perfecting levels is a wonderful feeling, but if you are forced to perfect them… Well, it just sucks the fun out of a game. If you don’t mind this, then you should probably buy it. It is a good game in the bottom, but the frustrating stuff really tended to get in the way for me.","August 26, 2013","false","4.8"," 51 of 75 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","51","75","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amestis/recommended/63710/","amestis","Amestis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amestis/","200 products in account","This game is fun and addicting, but it has some major flaws.\n\nFirst of all, the difficulty curve in this game is pretty wonky. Now, I'm not sure if this is because I got used to the game as I progressed, but I felt that some of the later stages (especially from world 2) were incredibly easy when compared to the earlier ones. The difficulty ramps up again towards the end, but you'll still find that it varies greatly from stage to stage instead of following a steadily rising curve as you would expect.\n\nSecond, while the level design will overall test your skills and reflexes, it can be a bit repetitive and sometimes very frustrating. The game will resort to artificial methods of increasing the difficulty by placing obstacles and items at very awkward positions, and since a single mistake will take you back to the beginning of the stage, that translates into annoying trial-and-error gameplay. If you don't mind having your patience tested, then you should do just fine.\n\nAnd last but not least, the game has a motion blur effect that, as far as I know, cannot be disabled. I guess they chose to use this effect to give a good sense of speed and movement, but it would have been nice to include an option to disable it. Not only that effect is going to tire out your eyes  if play this game for long periods of time, but it might also cause you to fail at certain points of the game because the game's art style doesn't stand out very much — obstacles and items tend to blend in with each other, it's hard to tell them apart sometimes, and the continuous blur doesn't help one bit.\n\nThe game is still worth a shot, if you're feeling adventurous. The difficulty is insane and rage-quit inducing, and finishing a tough stage can be very satisfying. Sadly, however, I personally think that the flaws outweigh its qualities. I recommend you try the sequel, "Runner2", a much better game in pretty much every aspect.","June 11, 2015","false","40.2"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","29","41","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/recommended/63710/","Cantisque","Canti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/","2676 products in account","BIT.Trip Runner is a rhythmic, side-scrolling platformer.\n\n\n\nThe player takes control of Commander Video, who will run endlessly until he reaches the end of each stage. You can have him jump and duck to avoid obstacles, kick certain obstacles out of the way, launch himself on springboards or deflect objects with a shield. If Commander Video impacts with an obstacle, the player is forced to repeat the entire stage from the beginning. The game consists of 3 themed worlds, each with 11 stages and a boss stage.\n\n\n\nAside from the main objective of reaching the end of each stage, the player can also attempt to collect all items within each stage (score multipliers that increase the intensity of the music and particle effects, as well as gold bars). Completing a stage with every item collected will give a "Perfect" score and grant access to a bonus stage in the style of an old Atari game. The core mechanic is mostly the same in that you reach the end of the bonus collecting as much gold as you can while avoiding obstacles. Collecting all the gold within a bonus stage gives a "Double Perfect" score.\n\n\n\nGraphics are simple, most objects being composed of low-poly blocks with very basic textures. The overall visual aesthetic is competent, pulling off a retro-inspired look yet remaining in a 3D space, but the repetitiveness of playing stages consecutively undermines the appeal of the simplicity as there is very little visual variation between them. Audio quality is likewise competent and fitting to the overall theme, with the level designs reflecting the rhythm of the music to varying degrees, mixed in with suitable arcade sound effects. Unfortunately, this also suffers from monotony as you will hear a lot of the music repeated over and over as you progress, with only two unique songs for each of the three worlds (excluding boss stages, which again all share the same music) and none of the music is particularly good.\n\n\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive, each stage is mostly a fluid experience with each button press feeling natural in time with the rhythm. Mistakes will be made but they rarely feel unfair, but the game is nonetheless totally unforgiving in that any mistake that causes an impact with an obstacle will cause Commander Video to fall right back to the start of the stage and do it all over again. Later stages may cause players to give up out of frustration, even on easy difficulty (which isn't actually easier at all).\n\n\n\nCompleting a challenging stage gives great satisfaction and the motivation to carry on through the disappointingly bland presentation. It tests your skills and timing rather than relying on stats and/or making it too easy, but this will of course leave some people out of luck if they are finding it too difficult to continue past a certain point, because anything short of perfection will not allow for progression. Despite this, the difficulty curve is relatively steady from start to finish.\n\n\n\nBIT.Trip Runner is a fun game to play in short bursts, but due to the monotony of the visuals, audio and level design, would probably cause headaches and frustration if played for much longer durations.","February 14, 2014","true","29.2"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

The screen constantly scrolls to the right and as you run you have to jump, slide, kick and block your way through the level. It starts off great. Good music, tight controls, and bright colorful graphics put together an awesome presentation. As you pick up gold and "power ups" the music fills in and the your actions in the level fill in the background to the music. It's a cool effect.\n\nThat for me was where the good times ended.\n\nNear the end of the first world, the game becomes brutally hard. There are no checkpoints in Bit.Trip Runner. One mistake will send you flying all the way back to the beginning of the level. You have no health so it's one hit and you die. With some levels over 3-4 min long, the constant act of being sent back to the start every time is annoying and gives you little chance to work on the one tough spot you're having a problem with.\n\nAnd those tough spots? This game leaves very little to no room for error. You have to be precise. At least with games like Super Meat Boy, the level is very short. It lends itself well to quick deaths and restarts because you're working on the same area and you can go at your own pace. That's not the case here.\n\nI finally did beat this game, but my feeling was more relief than triumph. If you're hardcore into platformers you may enjoy it, but there are better titles out there.","January 5, 2014","false","15.1"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

Did I mention that it automatically scrolls to the side? You really have no control over the movement, just the ability to jump over things, kick through them and slide under them. Seems simple enough. The jumping is not floaty at all and takes some true prescision. Even the simplest jump up stairs or jump over a chasm needs to be timed correctly.\n\nThe music is also a stand out plus in the game even if it seems like there really aren't many songs. Just beats in the background. Every time you jump it makes a sound that adds to the melody. Every time you grab a + sign the beat amps up.\n\nBit.Trip Runner is split into 3 episodes each with around 10 levels. Each level will have you trying to obtain + marks on your way to the end. A lot of levels seem like the level is really 1/4th the level and they just make you run it 4x in the level. You will come to know these levels VERY well, because the downside is if you bump into something you will be taken back all the way to the beginning of a level.\n\nIf you are the type of person that loves timing games with beautiful backgrounds and good music then this game is for you.

BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a rhythm-style action plaformer that consist of a protagonist, Commander Video, on a 2D plane. The player controls Commander Video as he runs along the set track from left to right and controls when the character jumps, slides, and kicking. As you progress through the 36 levels in the game (three worlds, each consisting of 11 levels, plus a boss encounter stage), you collect powerups that increase the quality of the music that plays through each level.\n\nThe game is notable for it's unique soundtrack, retro feel, and it's frustratingly difficult gameplay, as the current level is started over each time Commander Video runs into an obstacle that the player failed to acknowledge. The game forces a trial-and-error style of play, and in the end, it can hurt the experience. I myself found that I would get particularly frustrated on nearly every level that I played, as I would have to start the level over simply for pressing a button to early or too late. However, the game exceeds in rewarding the player, as the sense of accomplishment that comes from beating a particularly difficult level is unrivaled by most games that are released on the market today.\n\nBIT.TRIP RUNNER is a unique game that can be extremely rewarding, or absolutely crushing. Be warned: the game is not for everyone. While I didn't particularly enjoy BIT.TRIP RUNNER, it continues to be a game that is loved by the Indie community and the games that follow it only stand to be a testament to their devotion.\n\nA 5 out of 10.\n\nAuthors Note - I, personally, did not enjoy BIT.TRIP RUNNER. I felt that it was too difficult for me and that it simply wasn't my type of game. However, I do highly recommend this game to any and all gamers that have yet to play it. It's a challenging experience that harkens back to the older days of retro gaming, and for that, I can honestly say that everybody should play these games, at least once.","November 26, 2013","true","18.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Easy, isn't the correct word to describe this though, this game is incredibly difficult at times. The idea is to jump, block, slide, or kick your way through each level. If you die anywhere in the level you start all over. This makes it difficult on the long levels.

Runner demands absolute perfection, and in returns provides one of the most precise and satisfying games to ever grace the genre.\n\nAlthough it bares many similarities to endless runners such as Canabalt, BTR is a far more deliberately structured experience than the many flash offerings available, and doesn't actually deserve to be called an endless runner as shares more in common with a rhythm game than anything else.\n\nEach enemy, obstacle, and jump is timed directly to the music playing behind it, an integral fact that is critical in landing your timing and predicting what is coming down the line. As you dodge these hurdles you in turn add your own portion of the soundtrack, fleshing out the melody and adding new layers to each track. Nailing a run perfectly is exhilarating, all the more so because doing so requires such finesse and determination.\n\nIt should be noted and re-noted that BTR is a very, very hard game, perhaps the most difficult one in fact that I have ever successfully completed. It is brutally unforgiving from the onset and doesn't hesitate to send you right back to the start of the level over the tiniest slip-up. There are no checkpoints at any point in the game, and as levels become longer the trial and error design calls for some serious memorization and hand eye coordination.\n\nI don't doubt for a second that most will not complete the game, perhaps not even the first would. It's a grueling task that appeals to a specific sect of masochistic gamers which, although I personally love it to death, is the reason I simply cannot recommend the game to anyone who isn't ready for an immense challenge. Everyone else will find a far better time skipping straight to Runner 2, which is all around a much more easily enjoyable game regardless of skill level.\n\nLevel variety is also a bit of a problem, as with only three different worlds you will be spending a lot of time looking at the same things, and overcoming the same obstacles. This isn't such a bad thing as the music and art are excellent across the board, but it did begin to wear on me after spending so long stuck in the same place. Another minor problem is that for the later two worlds the backgrounds become so congested, that they sometimes obscure obstacles coming toward you which is highly frustrating and one of the few parts of the game that just feels cheap.\n\nNo matter these smaller problems I still adore Bit.Trip Runner. The way the music ties into the gameplay gives it a unique feel and keep the experience feeling fair no matter how often I failed at it. The electronic soundtrack perfectly complements the style of gameplay, and the way it all comes together is much more consistently great than likely any Bit.Trip game that came before it. There is something to be said for the difficulty turning many players away (and you would be right to do so if that isn't your cup of tea), but for those unafraid to attempt to conquer the laborious challenge it presents, Runner is easily worth a try and for provides a sense of personal accomplishment that other games can't.\n","January 11, 2014","true","8.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","5"

"BIT.TRIP RUNNER" is the type of unforgiving rhythm game that will put you through hell, right up until the completion of the last level. But with pain, comes gain, and although most of your screaming will be through anger at hitting that one block or missing the last piece of gold, nothing is better than the reward you feel after crossing that finish line. "BIT.TRIP RUNNER" is perfect for the rhythm gamer, and a definite buy for any completionist, wanting a challenge.\n\n~PanHeath","January 6, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I did not enjoy this game. At first, the game was pretty fun, and I liked it, though I noticed a delay from when I hit a key to when the game responded (I had no lag/framedrop during the time of play) so it made the game difficult to stay on beat, so I found myself starting over quite a bit. This could just be my keyboard, so I don't know. Also, there are no checkpoints. At all. So one little mistake, one little off-beat press of a button, and you are sent all the way back through that 5 minute level you just drudged through.\n\nThe game itself is a music/rythm platforming game, however I wouldn't call it a rythm game. It feels more like a memory game. Throughout the game, you must jump, kick, slide, bounce, and reflect to reach the end of the stage. The graphics made me felt like I was going crosseyed while I played, they look good, but they don't mix well with a moving foreground. It made it unenjoyable, and I got headaches from it. This, mixed with the whole jumping and kicking, made it nearly impossible for me to even see what was going on. The rounds would drag on, and on. So, I had to memorize the course, while the backround remains stationary with a moving foreground, with a delay on me hitting buttons.\n\nHere is the most enjoying part. The music. I loved it, except, every time you die, you get sent back to the beginning. Meaning that the music starts over with it. So you will be hearing the same du-du-dun-dun-dun-du-dun ... du-du-dun-dun-dun-du-dun ... du-du-dun-dun-dun-du-dun over and over again. I know I said I loved the music, but I couldn't love it enough from the constant restarting. Also, a lot of the songs sound the same, the music is put together from you "staying on beat" with the music. Staying on beat is used loosely (see above paragraph). I liked this aspect, you were making the music as you played along. The music progressively got better and better as you played, unless you miss one of those power-ups that up you, and the music. That part bugged me, but it is my fault for not being good enough, it made me want to replay the level and try to hear the music to it's full potential.\n\nThe graphics, they are really good. It's a mix of a stationary backround and a moving foreground, which I hated, but even though I hated how they pulled it off, they looked very good. So credit where it's due.\n\nSo, to close this review, here are the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:\n\nGood music, good graphics, fun to play, bonus levels are repetetive, but fun, a bit of replay value in there.\n\nCons:\n\nRepetetive music, headache inducing graphics, late controls, lack of checkpoints makes the game very unforgiving, not a rythym but instead a memory game.\n\nI did not enjoy BIT.TRIP RUNNER and I do not believe it is worth the $10 it is being sold for currently. I'm glad I paid for it during the sale for much, much, cheaper. I have no words for the sequel, as I have not played it.

Indeed, this game is unfair, the hitbox is confusing until the end, the lack of checkpoints makes it hardcore, it's more based on memory than reflexes, and as a rhythm game, it's basically a failure. Runner 2 fixes all that stuff, so it's logic that many people around here suggest you should avoid this game.\n\nBUT.\n\nI must remind you all that Runner 2 is actually the odd member of the family. Apart from it, ALL Bit.Trip games are this mercyless, and even more (in fact, the Runner games are the easiest ones from the franchise IMO). So Bit.Trip Runner is just another game similar to all those from the same company. It's not fair at all to compare it with a game that has very few in common if you look coldly.\n\nPersonally, the Runner's games are the only ones from this franchise that I enjoyed. And if you have to choose one of them, it's just a matter of interests: if you wanna beat a real challenge and prove yourself you can face a hard game, try Runner 1; if you want to enjoy those kind of arcade games where you main purpose is avoiding things without getting frustrated, try Runner 2. I suggest playing both though.\n\nIn conclusion, you'll read many positive and negative reviews, and all of them will be true. This game is simply not made for everybody, only for people who enjoys challenges from videogames, while its sequel is suitable for everybody.","September 13, 2014","true","15.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Ok, almost every game does that, so what's the problem? Well, since you can't move by yourself and the level isn't randomly generated, it's the same thing everytime. And they can take up to 3-4 minutes. You just have to memorize everything and try not to screw up and get sent back 2 minutes. Also the level's are boring. Do the easy thing 5 times, then a bit harder part 5 times, and a hard part 5 times, and then mix them up. Cool.\nSecondly, the soundtrack's not good. It's the same boring thing everytime. Even for it's retro-feeling genre it's still not good.\nThirdly, the graphics are bland and boring.\nAlso it might just be me, but it's hard to focus on this game. It kind of makes me feel dizzy.\nOne thing it has going for it is that it's not buggy.\nMaybe buy it off of a steam sale for 1€, but not otherwise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/recommended/63710/","irishcream","Whiskey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/","718 products in account","BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a game that hails to the pre-NES gaming era. This game has the player performing well timed jumps, slides and other moves, usually in a rhythmic fashion, to collect gold bars and avoid obstacles. BIT.TRIP RUNNER was a well received game and it seems that this game has a lot of indie cred but my experience playing this game contrasted to what I hear in the reviews has me wondering if I'm playing the right game or if I need to drill down into an option menu somewhere to enable the good content. The art style is distinctive and appealing and the game itself does have it's moments, however it forces you to endure quite a bit of tedium to get to a meager portion of enjoyable gameplay.\n\nBIT.TRIP RUNNER is a game that requires very price timing and rythmn and a single half-second delay will mean restarting the level in most cases. The first 20 seconds or so of each level will insult you by being boring and unchallenging and due to the nature of this game that first 20 seconds of gameplay will be what you experience most as any mishap will transport you back to the beginning. I'm not advocating making the game easier as I appreciate a challenge but I don't appreciate being forced to repeat uninteresting gameplay several times over.  Many levels seem to be laden with challenges that can be fun at first but are repeated ad nauseum and end up feeling like a gimmick (for instance there will be a staircase in almost every level that requires consecutive jumps). These challenges quickly become tedius and only serve as a mechanism to return you once again to the boring part of the level. Levels can get quite long too so the chances you'll be repeating uninteresting gameplay is quite high.\n\nI've read comments about the game's soundtrack and the menu options do feature Anamanaguchi in the menu and credits the actual game's music is boring most of the time as it requires progress in the level to become interesting. I wonder why the game's music didn't feature Anamanaguchi as well.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that's challenging and requires a high level of precision and quick reactions, although the format is different, other popular indie titles like Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV do a better job. Super Meat Boy's short levels and VVVVVV's room based format allow these games to respect the player's time.\n\nScore: 5/10","December 22, 2013","false","1.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

This is not. I saw someone compare this game to shoving pinecones up your own ♥♥♥.\n\nThat's pretty accurate.\n\nThe main problem with this game is that the game throws a lot of stuff at you that you can't predict beforehand, at which point you will die, because you aren't given enough time to react. Then you will be sent to the start of the level, and play through the level (a minute or two) until you get to the same place. If you guessed correctly as to how to beat what just killed you, you get to be killed by the next thing. Just try and beat the last two stages of World 1-- Marathon, and the boss. It's pretty damn frustrating.\n\nTypical level progress:\n\n<- n ->\n[..........] ^\n[--.......] |\n[----....] n/c\n[-----...] |\n[-------]V\n\n=> time to beat level is O(n^2) because screw you that's why\n\nSo why is Super Meat Boy properly designed, when this isn't? Mostly because Super Meat Boy's levels are a lot shorter, and because you can see what's ahead before you throw yourself at it and die. Playing Bit.TRIP Runner is like playing a version of Guitar Hero where any missed note will fail you out of the song. Also, Bit.TRIP feels very rigid. It's a timing-based game where your movements form a song, except the resulting song normally isn't that good and your movements are rigid as hell.\n\n1/10 for effort","February 2, 2014","false","2.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I was thoroughly enjoying the game up until the last level of the first block of stages.\n\nThere are no checkpoints in these levels, once you die you go all the way back to the start. While this presents no issue for the standard shorter levels, this becomes something of a hindrance in the aforementioned one. At first you may trip up on early obstacles which doesn't matter too much, but when you find yourself three-quarters of the way through a level and mis-time a button press for the tenth time you start to get frustrated and worn out. You eventually start making stupid mistakes earlier in the level and then give up.\n\nThere are two schools of thought about this design choice:\n\n1) I, the writer, am awful at video games and should be removed from the public and placed in a retirement home so that the mean games can no longer make me feel like a useless idiot.\n\n2) Not having checkpoints is a ♥♥♥♥ move that artificially pads out the game time and gates it off to people who either don't possess the time, reactions or patience to endure this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nBased on your preference you should know whether this game is for you or not.","February 12, 2015","false","4.4"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","11","20","4","3"

At its best it's a gloriously fluid experience as you meticulously learn the obstacles on a level and the feeling of exhilaration when you manage to pull of a perfect run.\n\nHowever it's also at times an incredibly frustrating experience. There are a handful of levels that are too long which can lead to extended attempts to the point of quitting and some obstacles require such pin-point precision that means failure towards the end of the level is a maddening experience as you watch your character revert back to the start. However if you stick with it your perseverance is rewarded.\n\nThere is much to recommend in Bit.Trip runner, from the visuals, music and the challenge but I would only recommend it to those who like an old fashioned challenge, for those who like their games to be unforgiving and to reward patience and practise as well as precision.","June 8, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every time you jump, Slide or whatever past an obstacle a little musical note is played, Power-ups fill out the background music. So during the best parts of the game a little jaunty tune is played as your kicking, sliding and jumping. Collect all the gold on a level to get a bonus retro challenge level.\n\nSo the game seems to come down to memorization and synchronized button mashing. Once you get to a tricky part and miss something you have to start the level over again. I needed to replay a level many times before getting the timing or whatnot to a tricky part down. And then the next tricky part after it comes along. Needless to say I would eventually make it thru the level. But with only 3 or 4 more levels to go, I just don't care anymore. Now maybe in the bad old days when all you had were a handful of games to play at any one time I would have finished this game. Today I have over 60 games I haven't played yet, So it's time to move on.\n\n\nEdit - It's an OK game, Marginal thumbs up.","July 9, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This title would have been better off with an autoplay feature so the programming could run through each level for you as a mildly entertaining 8-bit music video.

Merely a challenge of how long you can stand the masochism till you give up and walk away. Cluttered graphics that make it hard to tell what buttons you're meant to be pressing, fast-based scrolling which means sometimes you can only win by remembering level layouts, little-to-no margin for error with the only punishment of sending you back the the start of what can be a very long level.\n\nThere's also jittery frame-rates on even high-end systems to add to the difficulty adding to the final opinion that once again Gaijin Games proves that it can make pretty and nice sounding things, but it can't make fun games.","December 21, 2011","false","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However charming it may be, it really is just a series of memorized QTEs, substituting particular sprites in place of button prompts. Every time you reach a new point, you're going to die and start the whole thing over. Because, again, it's memorization -- there's really no skill, simply dying enough times until you know the stage. That might not even be so bad for a bit of fun, except that the stages drag on for WAY too long with no checkpoints, so you're replaying 2+ minutes every time you reach a new obstacle.\n\nBy far the worst part, however, is how scrolling objects look. Even on a high-speed monitor, foreground objects blur, making it actually painful to try to focus on the screen. Add to that that many backgrounds have colors and shapes that make it hard to tell them apart from blocks in your way, and it's all around unpleasant.","December 20, 2013","false","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/recommended/63710/","polly_s_hate","Polly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/","407 products in account","(Finished Wii version, re-boght on Steam.)\n\nBIT.TRIP RUNNER is an auto-runner. You have no control over Commander Video's movement speed, and your only interactions are jumping, ducking, kicking, and blocking objects that block your path.   The main difference between BIT.TRIP RUNNER and other auto-runners is that obstacles aren't randomly generated or placed in every stage, and instead appear in a set rhythm and melody to the music. As you collect gold bars and dodge obstacles, you fill in various bits of each stage's song, and the more power-up cores you find, the more intense the music gets and the higher your score will soar.\n\nThe game is HIGHLY focused on immediate reaction, and if that's not your cup of tea, then your pattern memorization skills will be put to the ultimate test. RUNNER has a relatively smooth start to try and ease you into the experience, but if you're to complete the game then your execution is going to have to be near-flawless. There are no mid-stage checkpoints to save you, and one missed jump means being thrown back to the beginning of a stage to try again. It's easy to get caught up in a flurry of "just one more try"s, but that satisfaction isn't quite the same as you'd get from something like Super Meat Boy or Rogue Legacy. RUNNER can be rote almost to a fault, and it'll probably take people that enjoy very specific types of linear challenges to enjoy it.\n\nIf there's one major issue with the game it's that there are some crazy intense swings and spikes in difficulty. Stage 1-11 - ODYSSEY will probably be enough to shut down most that aren't dedicated to trying to see the game to its end, and there are more than a few other bad apples in the bunch whose level of challenge can feel a bit excessive considering the game's lack of checkpointing. It's all doable with the right amount of practice, but again, if that kind of rote memorization isn't for you, it may be best to pass on this one. Otherwise, game on. It's a fantastic game with great music, a fun aesthetic, and engaging gameplay for those of us that like a little something different in rhythm games.","January 12, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can only describe it as a beautifully executed bad idea. The game is lovely, the graphics are lovely, the sounds are lovely, the animations are lovely, the implementation of the 2.5D is lovely, the controls are lovely. The game behind it all... well again the implementation is good with nice responsive controls and snappy resets to the start of the level that don't break up the flow when you fail. Unfortunately the core idea behind it all is actually pretty weak. The rest of the game is constantly making up for that but it can never quite overcome the fact that if you look behind the curtain at what is happening mechanically there isn't much fun to be had there. What is really annoying is that one or two minor changes would have made it sooo much better.\n\nOn the surface it looks like a standard auto-runner but these are set levels rather than anything randomly generated and they have ends that must be reached to progress and ultimately, if you have the patience, beat the game. The problem is that once you've learnt the controls and learnt to read the meaning of the obstacle you must pass (pit means jump, step means jump, high UFO means duck, low UFO means jump etc) then it becomes just an exercise in pressing the right sequence of buttons with the right timing. You can see what buttons presses will be required next just as surely as if they were presented as flying towards you as they are in Guitar Hero type games. So what is there left to do? Just mindlessly try and try until you succeed in getting the timing right. The music and visuals effectively distracted from the essential boredom of this exercise for awhile but ultimately life is too short.\n\nNow how could it have been better. Well when you pass an obstacle it plays a certain little chime that combines with the background beat to make a little song and that is lovely. It would have been great to see that combined into the game somehow so that you could use the audio cues to help with the timing of your jumps. Or if the button presses had sounds associated with them that you had to insert into the tune at the right moments and thus complete the tune then I think the game would have really come alive. As it is the game is more fun to watch and listen to then actually play.","December 31, 2013","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an excellent side-scrolling platformer, but it's relentlessly unforgiving and hard as hell. Be warned upfront: there are no check points! In retrospect it works well and fits the game, check points would have made it too easy and casual - if that's what you're after then grab RUNNER 2.\n\nIn many ways this game throws me back to the 80s in its simplicity, but it retains a modern gaming appeal and atmosphere that will keep you coming back for more and more... and more... and more. It's one of those 'just one more try' games. The modern take on 8 bit graphics is really good and brings the world to life. The music is great and never became repetitive like some people mentioned in their reviews. In fact, the music was one of the highlights of the game for me and always set the perfect mood.\n\nBIT.TRIP RUNNER occupies a pretty unique space when compared to typical platformers, and I can't think of any other game that competes with it head on. It's perfect for short, fun bursts of gaming and is guaranteed to test your platforming skills, no matter how seasoned you think you are. If you're in two minds about buying it, take the plunge. It's selling at the right price and well worth the money. If you can pick it up on special then it's an absolute no-brainer... even if it's not on special, I'd consider it a must buy and must play.","July 12, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game starts out simple enough, the first few levels only requiring one to use the jump button, adding a kick, duck/slide and block (certain projectiles only) later on.\nThere are 3 difficulties to choose from, Easy, Normal & Perfect. Unfortunately, Normal was testing my patience before I was halfway thru the first zone. The reason being: there are no checkpoints during the levels. None. Sometimes this isn't that big of a deal, but when attempting the last couple of levels in a zone it's incredibly annoying because these levels are way longer than the others.\nUpon completion of a level perfectly (by grabbing all the gold & the plus shaped power-ups), a bonus level awaits with graphics like that of the Atari classic, Pitfall. In these bonus levels one hit and it's over. There's no restarting at the beginning. You will have to complete the level perfect again to try the bonus level and aim for a perfect on it.\nRUNNER consists of three zones of 11 levels (and a bonus level for each one) plus a boss level, which could have you spending quite a bit of time trying to get perfects on everything.\n\nRecommended, but be warned that the lack of checkpoints and the frustrating difficulty might not be for everyone.","December 28, 2013","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have no control over Commander Video's movement speed, and your only interactions are jumping, ducking, kicking, and blocking objects that block your path.   The main difference between BIT.TRIP RUNNER and other auto-runners is that obstacles aren't randomly generated or placed in every stage, and instead appear in a set rhythm and melody to the music. As you collect gold bars and dodge obstacles, you fill in various bits of each stage's song, and the more power-up cores you find, the more intense the music gets and the higher your score will soar.\n\nThe game is HIGHLY focused on immediate reaction, and if that's not your cup of tea, then your pattern memorization skills will be put to the ultimate test. RUNNER has a relatively smooth start to try and ease you into the experience, but if you're to complete the game then your execution is going to have to be near-flawless. There are no mid-stage checkpoints to save you, and one missed jump means being thrown back to the beginning of a stage to try again. It's easy to get caught up in a flurry of "just one more try"s, but that satisfaction isn't quite the same as you'd get from something like Super Meat Boy or Rogue Legacy. RUNNER can be rote almost to a fault, and it'll probably take people that enjoy very specific types of linear challenges to enjoy it.\n\nIf there's one major issue with the game it's that there are some crazy intense swings and spikes in difficulty. Stage 1-11 - ODYSSEY will probably be enough to shut down most that aren't dedicated to trying to see the game to its end, and there are more than a few other bad apples in the bunch whose level of challenge can feel a bit excessive considering the game's lack of checkpointing. It's all doable with the right amount of practice, but again, if that kind of rote memorization isn't for you, it may be best to pass on this one. Otherwise, game on. It's a fantastic game with great music, a fun aesthetic, and engaging gameplay for those of us that like a little something different in rhythm games.","January 12, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It can get frustrating at times as some of the levels require near-perfect timing but when you beat these levels, you get a real sense of accomplishment, unlike a lot of games these days that hold your hand and walk you from start to completion. I would compare this to the Super Meat Boy of runner-style games.","January 12, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The time windows for some jumps are very deceptive, and you're punished by being sent to the very beginning of the level every time for making very small mistakes. I expected a rythm based platformer, or something close to that, but it's almost impossible to follow along with any tempo. You basically just have to play over, and over again to memorize the level layout-- which isn't fun at all.\n\nI would say maybe, just maybe the game would have some redeeming factors if the music was any good, but it's pretty bland. Maybe I'm just really bad, but the game overall feels highly unrewarding.

TRIP RUNNER a 5/10.\n\nBTR is a music and rhythm game, where you must perform a simple set of platforming moves to music. As you progress through the level, you can collect gold pieces or bonuses that allow each gold bar to be worth more. Each of these upgrades adds new levels of musical melody and harmony, making the music more complex and beautiful.\n\nWhenever your character that you control collects a gold piece, smashes through a box, or jumps over a cavern, the game reflects that by making a musical sound within the realm of the song. Your character, in essence, can add to the song, which is pretty cool. The music itself sounds great, an electronic, pulsing rhythm. You progress through 3 "worlds" each with a different setting, and each world has a dozen or so levels. Each world has similar style tunes, and each level within that world is slightly varied from the one before.\n\nAs cool as the levels are though, I still don't recommend this game. The main thing that is frustrating is that you can make zero mistakes throughout the course of the level in order to beat it. While getting gold pieces does make the music sound better and gives higher scores you don't have to get it. But if you run into a block that can't be broken or miss jumping a gap, at all, through the whole level, for each level, you must start over at the beginning of that level.\n\nI am fine for having a difficult game, but some levels are quite hard and require precision, and sometimes the levels can have a lot going on to watch for. This can make it frustrating to practice the level a lot but see zero progress. Many of the later levels especially have a somewhat cheap mechanic at the end of the levels, that throw something random at you just as you feel you are near the end. Think you are done? Nope a random purple block with no leadup from the music or other channels after you are simply running on a flat path for 5 seconds takes you out and you start over, ending your perfect run.\n\nBecause of that I can't recommend it. If you get it for a good price and are up for the challenge or like rhythm and music games, it may be worth a shot.","February 3, 2014","false","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After sitting down for about an hour or so I realized that this plays unfortunately like HarmonKnight by Gamefreak. I suppose I should say it's the otherway around, but I digress...\n\nIt's okay as a whole. There's definitely a challenge to it and it walks you through the game mechanics pretty decently. Just for some reason it feels so strange and I just don't get enjoyment out of it.\n\nCommander Video is clunky like Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, but the game never really gives you time to think out the difficult situations coming at you. You just keep running regardless. Sometimes you run off ledges without getting to jump, which causes you to fall and most likely end up back at the beginning of the level like with any other legitimate failure.\n\nAs a perfectionist I can't stand to not collect every + sign and gold pile on my way to the finish line of each level. The game fights me every step of the way with strange rhythm and occasionally unresponsive controls. The levels are too visually repetitive and it's hard for me to recognize what is coming up ahead before it's too late and I'm back to the start.\n\nMaybe I'm just bad at games in general, but this game makes me feel awful much more than it makes me feel accomplished for completing a level. For that I say, consider getting it because it's decent, but think twice before your purchase! Or maybe try something easier than normal mode?

On the one hand you have a classic rythm expierience, set to catchy 8bit music and a  chalenging game where you get to run full speed through traps and obstacles. I know I have always been a sucker for the   look of games like this. But despite this, all I could think about while playing was the lack of simple CHECKPOINTS! I mean if any game needed to have them this would be it. The new runner2 had these, so why not this one? For instance A tool that could let you place points while you were you wanted while running and would take off points for using them, would have made the game 100% more enjoyable. Every time I almost make it to the finish then jump a split second to soon or late, I felt that the only thing that kept me playing was the same feeling that keeps you trying to win a prize in one of those machines at the mall. You think: well maybe if i just try once more I will get it.\n\nAlso despite it being a classic there was a definite lack of story through the game. Basically your just plopped down in the world and start running, no explanation, no nothing. This being said, I still had fun with it at points and Im not saying that runner1 is a bad game, its just not nessesarily a good game. If you want to try it out make sure you get it on sale.","December 30, 2013","false","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/recommended/63710/","jjst9","Doktor Egg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/","1081 products in account","I've only played the first eight or so levels but I think I'm ready to give my opinion. I can only describe it as a beautifully executed bad idea. The game is lovely, the graphics are lovely, the sounds are lovely, the animations are lovely, the implementation of the 2.5D is lovely, the controls are lovely. The game behind it all... well again the implementation is good with nice responsive controls and snappy resets to the start of the level that don't break up the flow when you fail. Unfortunately the core idea behind it all is actually pretty weak. The rest of the game is constantly making up for that but it can never quite overcome the fact that if you look behind the curtain at what is happening mechanically there isn't much fun to be had there. What is really annoying is that one or two minor changes would have made it sooo much better.\n\nOn the surface it looks like a standard auto-runner but these are set levels rather than anything randomly generated and they have ends that must be reached to progress and ultimately, if you have the patience, beat the game. The problem is that once you've learnt the controls and learnt to read the meaning of the obstacle you must pass (pit means jump, step means jump, high UFO means duck, low UFO means jump etc) then it becomes just an exercise in pressing the right sequence of buttons with the right timing. You can see what buttons presses will be required next just as surely as if they were presented as flying towards you as they are in Guitar Hero type games. So what is there left to do? Just mindlessly try and try until you succeed in getting the timing right. The music and visuals effectively distracted from the essential boredom of this exercise for awhile but ultimately life is too short.\n\nNow how could it have been better. Well when you pass an obstacle it plays a certain little chime that combines with the background beat to make a little song and that is lovely. It would have been great to see that combined into the game somehow so that you could use the audio cues to help with the timing of your jumps. Or if the button presses had sounds associated with them that you had to insert into the tune at the right moments and thus complete the tune then I think the game would have really come alive. As it is the game is more fun to watch and listen to then actually play.","December 31, 2013","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, if you are a couple minutes into your run and you are close to completion but then you flub, you are sent back to the very beginning of that run. In this sense, it is brutal and without mercy. This, parred with the fact that the graphics and the side-scrolling motion have such a negative effect on my eyes, this is unfortunately something that I cannot recommend, but I wish I could because I do enjoy the characters.","April 19, 2014","false","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, it is the opposite of good, it's a rage game. The only difference is that this rage game has the balls to charge you for this crap.\n\nOne of the main selling points of this game is the music. Is it good? No, the music is annoyingly repetitive. Although I admit it does sound good for the first 2 levels of the game before you realise that it is practically the same thing over and over. Not only that, but there is no other sound at all. Just the sounds of jumping over rocks and trash cans. Also, there are these 'powerup' things that go from Hyper to Mega to Ultra to Extra, and they make the game sound more lively each time. Sounds cool right? Wrong. The music does get more lively until you get to Extra, which turns the music into low, slow sounds that break up your pacing and eventually leads to you losing the level. Speaking of levels...\n\nThe level design, don't even get me started on the level design. First of all, no checkpoints? Really? I get that it is a kind of 'music' (if you could even call this music) game so you wouldn't want the 'song' to be broken up, but the game is so insanely difficult that it takes more than 30 minutes for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2 minute level. Who thought this was a good idea? ALso, some of the powerups are in difficult to get places, which is good for a running game like this. The only problem is that some of these powerups are almost completely impossible to get. One powerup involves you jumping down a hole then springing back up. The problem here is that the spring throws you into a wall, which of course kills you instantly.\n\nSo, the rating is probably what you want to see from this random guy on the internet.\n2/10 - Not recommended to all who wish to keep their sanity.\n\n\n\n","April 19, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asluc96/recommended/63710/","asluc96","Vendi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asluc96/","47 products in account","Ok, as you can see this game called bit trip RUNNER is pretty much that, a platformer on rails where you dodge obstacles  and -only if you want to unlock everything like I did- collect floating gold bars, and not much else. This game works great, super fluid, and is compatible with a 360 controller, sadly that's the only thing that I can appreciate from it. Its funny because some people claim that this game is "hard" and "fast paced", and let me tell ya, is none of those\n1) Its not really hard, with some practice you will end up memorizing the secuence of the obstacles, you are just avoiding them without having control of your character, other than kicking, jumping, ducking, reflecting (you have some kind of orange bar that reflects only one kind of proyectile), or jumping higher from a spring, and thats one of the cheapest flaws in the game that makes it "hard". There are some kind of pink tiles that work like springs, all you have to do is press up or the Y button and you can jump higher than the regular jump, obviously there are sections that you need to do this in order to beat a level, how can you screw that up? usually you'll need to press the button right before you miss the pink tile because if you press it too early you'll land 3 pixels behind of the very spot you need to land on because, most of the time, in the spot where you should have landed there was a golden bar that you have to collect and if you landed right behind it you won't touch it and its game over for you if you're playing it on perfect difficulty and you lose whenever you miss anything you have to collect. Another cheap flaw is the perfect difficulty, because as I said before whenever you miss anything like the golden bar you lose, thankfully when that happens you can try again because it takes you BACK TO THE BEGINING of the level.Every.Time. This game wants you to be sooo perfect that when you press one button one instant before or after the instant the game wants or if you don't land on one magical pixel the game wants, hell even if you are almost half of a second late you lose and you have to restart the level at once. That's what make the game hard, because if you play it on normal or easy its pretty much, no, its the same crap, with the only difference of not having to collect EVERY GOLDEN BAR.\n2) fast paced? no, simple as that, this ain't sonic, is just commander video. You can see whats ahead you, unless you're playing the bonus stages where your field of view is reduced\n\nPeople claim that the gameplay is brilliant, I didn't find it like that, at all, not even close. This game gets repetitive in a few hours, there were times where I could tell that the developers recycle some sections in many levels, to the point that I could even guess the algorithm that dodges the obstacles\n\nI gave this game and its sequel a chance, bought them during the sale so I did't spend too much money, but I was so dissapointed that I feel it would've been the same even if they were free\nThen again, you can pretty much tell what kind of game it is ny just looking at it, but I saw some many positive reviews saiying that the gameplay is brilliant, fast paced, and unique. I bought that and ended up dissapointed because I found this game average at its best. Even at the end of the day I didn't expect too much from it, no matter how many people recommended it, but still deep inside I expected something at least better than what it looked like, and this wasn't the case\n\nBit Trip Runner is a bad game? nah, its not, just because you see that red downvoting hand doesn't mean that this game sucks, not really. You may find it entertainingand all but thats about it, not a really memorable indie game tbh\n\nThis game took me around 30 hours to unlock everything, including the freaking achievements because whenever I buy a videogame I want to beat it and unlock everything that I can, and these achievements weren't that hard, just annoying, and made my experience way longer that it had to be, because I couldn't find any replay value, once you unlock everything that's it for this game, same thing happened me with the sequel. And speaking of which, people also claim that the sequel was uperior because they made runner "better" and with more variety, and the only variety there were some minimal thing that didn't make it harder, hell I thought it was way more easier since they made the hit detection more merciful on the sequel, because on the first runner whenever you thought you collected the golden bar you ended up losing because you missed by one pixel. The only variety on Runner 2 is that you can play as other characters and actually find alternative exits that you need to follow in order to unlock stuff\n\nBoss fights are pointless, they are basically an extra level for each zone\n\nOne last thing, this game is supposed to be a rythm game but Guitar Hero was more of a rythm game than this, here you have a generic bgm for each zone (there are 3 zones with 12 levels each, including the "boss" level) and whenever you collect these red crosses the bgm changes a bit, and every obstacle that you dodge makes a silly sound. When you keep dodging the secuence it kind of plays a melody but it doesn't have that kind of an impact unlike GH, some people may find it charming but not me\n\nTL;DR meh, wouldn't reccomend this nor its sequel\n\nwant a hard game?

Only level 1-7 before I just stopped and said enough of this.\n\nOkay, BIT.TRIP RUNNER isn't a bad game. It's just frustrating because it wants you to learn from your mistakes by basically forcing you to repeat the level from the beginning if you hit an object or wall. I won't say I didn't  learn from my mistakes, I just have terrible reaction timing to incoming objects and sometimes hit the wrong button in running platformers such as this. This isn't Mario where you can assess the situation; you literally have to dodge stuff as they come at you; or rather as you're running at it.\n\nOtherwise, the cool rhythm music and simple pixelated graphics are fun and vibrant. But there isn't much of a story and you're literally just pushing the same five buttons to maneuver around objects.

Along the way you have to kick objects, jump over or on them, and even slide under them, as well as collect gold bars. Let me tell you, it's quite the challenge. You have to remember the entire level pattern, so see it as some sort of rhythm game (it really is since it creates music based on your movements) and you get the general idea.\nAnother 'Easy to learn, difficult to master' game ?

Your basic actions are jump, kick, block, and duck -- and combinations of those.  Pretty simple stuff, but the challenging part is to do this quickly without too much error.  This is really a test of hand-eye coordination and memory (due to the levels being the same each time).  Rhythm and music are a key part of this game, but the game also relies on non-rhythmic actions as well.  As for any negatives, I have read some complaints about levels not having check points.  The lack of level check points is actually part of the appeal!  But do consider that the levels take no more than three minutes to complete so it's not as if you are losing a lot of invested time here when you die.  And speaking of dying, you will die a lot but in a fun and challenging way.  In the end, this is one of those games that doesn't look all that fun until you actually play it.

I like the entire series. Some games I like more than others. Void is a strange one indeed. But that's not why we're here! You're here to see what I like about the Wii ware turned Steam title that is Bit.Trip Runner! Well, It's good.\n\nThe games controls are simple: one button is to jump, another is to duck, another is to kick, another is to spring on platforms, and another is for blocking beats. five buttons. The game could've been played on an NES. That said, it is as hard as some NES games. You run at a constant velocity, jumping and sliding your way past obstacles. With each successful jump avoidance of said obstacles, a little note is played with the music. get a pile of gold, another note. Get a little + (they're called Mode Ups) and the music raises in intensity and your score multiplier is raised. fail to jump or hit something and you get sent back to the beginning. Collect all the gold and Mode Ups and you can enter an Atari 2600 style bonus challenge where the stakes are set even higher: You have one shot and one shot only.\n\nWhile it seems simple and devilishly difficult. It's the way that the game is designed that keeps you hooked. As you play, you enter a zen like trance where you anticipate and react to incoming obsticales, all with the music pounding in your ears. It's something that really cant be expressed in words. So let this be a resounding "GET THIS GAME"\n\nThere's also cards for you card collectors.","February 8, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AggreCiv/recommended/63710/","AggreCiv","AggreCiv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AggreCiv/","123 products in account","I wish I could recommend this game. The idea is really cool especially for something that seems like it may be limited since it's a rail platformer. But there are problems... a lot of problems.\n\nGraphics: Look, I'm not going to complain about the graphics being 8bit. That's the style the game wanted to take itself (for the most part), and I'm ok with that. I actually like the basic look of the character and some of the 8bit objects in the world are pretty cool looking too. But then you have to realize that this is a game where the character never stops running. The background, the foreground, the obstacles you have to dodge... it just gets vomit inducing. It just looks so blurry that it hurts to look at this game for very long, and I'm somebody that doesn't get motion sickness very easy. If you get powerups, then the screen pretty much flashes every time you grab a gold piece. In a game where you have to have your eyes taped open to make sure you don't blink and miss a jump, having distractions like that is unforgivable.\n\nGameplay: It's simple, and actually provides entertainment to an extent. At first, it's fun to get pass the slightly challenging obstacles. It feels nice to pass something that seems really difficult on your first try. The problem is this game is seriously one of the most repetitive games I've ever played in my life. I guess you could say a rail platformer that uses only a few buttons will inevitably be pretty repetitive, but they could've done much more with this game. If you play the game and come across a slightly challeging obstacle, you can be damn sure that you'll be doing that same exact obstacle twenty more times through the rest of the game (that's assuming you complete the rest of the game in a perfect run, which you won't)\n\nReplayability Value: As stated above, this game is repetitive. At first, it's repetitive because it's really easy, and not much can be done to change the repitition. Later on, it's repetitive because the level design lacks creativity and just rehashes the same things from the last few levels. After that, starting at about world 3-9, it's repetitive because you get killed by something that's actually a new challenge. Then you hit world 3-10 and it's repetitive because that new challenge is being milked for all its worth and is thrown into the next level 4 times and you get killed after completing it because you misjumped and hit the edge of a staircase. So, the replayability value is bad. Keep in mind, this is a game that forces you to start at the beggining of a level after one screw up. Yeah...\n\nSoundtrack: At first, I liked the soundtrack. It was interesting and kept me playing the game despite its lackluster gameplay. But just like the level design, they got lazy. The soundtrack sounds the same throughout the entire game. There may be slight changes, but it still sounds so bland after playing for a while. You get a headache from the ugly background, the repetitive music, and the fact that you have to keep playing the beggining of every level 200 hundred times because you can't get through these levels like a robot.\n\nDifficulty: Don't even get me started. Personally, this game bored the hell out of me until much later. I'll admit, 1-11 was hard because it was a couple of minutes long, and making a perfect run over a few minutes isn't easy, but I still got through it after several tries. Then the game got boring again. It got boring because the obstacles that I was coming across were the same obstacles I came across ten times in the last map. All of the sudden, I got to 3-9 and out of nowhere the game decided to throw, by far, the hardest obstacles the game has to offer. There was no warning, no slowly scaling diffculty leading up to this point, it just went haywire out of nowhere. But, luckily, it was at the very beggining of the round, so I had a good chance to practice and practice. Finally, I perfected it! Eventually I got pass the level, and even though it was difficult, I stayed positive and continued into the next level. I get through half of the level filled with obstacles I've seen before just to be greeted by this same ♥♥♥♥ing obstacle from 3-9. Then eventually I get to 3-11, and the same ♥♥♥♥ing obstacle once again. I played throughout this entire game and feel like I've only really played 4 different levels.\n\nAnd, don't get me wrong, I don't hate this game because I died a lot. I love Super Meat Boy and that game infuriates me to no end. The difference between this and SMB is that SMB had good level design. They implemented some obstacles you've seen before but they did it in new, clever ways. This game does no such thing. You just do what you did before.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but it has only provided me dissapointment and infuriation. Opinions are subjective, so take what you will from this review, but if I could do it all over again I wouldn't even get this game for free, it's just a waste of time that I've only put so many hours into because I'm obsessed with completing it.","December 15, 2014","false","7.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghz_ghost/recommended/63710/","ghz_ghost","GHz_ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghz_ghost/","333 products in account","BIT.TRIP RUNNER, or as I like to call it "$*&% I MISSED ONE !@&#$ JUMP AT THE VERY END" is a sometimes fun but more often frustrating rhythm game. All of the elements of a great game are there, but they don't quite fall together into a cohesive package in the way that you would hope they do.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay first. This is simultaneously the best and worst part of this game. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a combination of rhythm game and side-scrolling platformer, where you have to jump, kick, and slide in time with music playing in the background. The player's character, we'll call him "Bit", is programmed to automatically run to the right the whole time the game is playing. No input is required to keep moving, and you'll be glad of this because all of your attention is going to need to be focused on doing other things just to stay alive. Jumping over, sliding under, and kicking through obstacles and enemies in time with the music can be pretty fun, and the feeling of satisfication you get once you finally complete a frustrating level is great. Unfortunately, these feelings of accomplishment are few and far between due to the unforgiving nature of the game. While it may be nice to play a game that doesn't hold your hand or offer you to "Press X to Win" like so many other games these days do, it is simply too far towards the other end of the difficulty spectrum for it's own good. It doesn't matter whether you are 2 minutes from the end of a level or 2 seconds, if your timing is off by just a hair, the game punishes you by sending you back to the very beginning of the level with an unrelenting lack of mercy. This leads to many extremely frustrating moments where you have performed every nuanced movement and action seamlessly and perfectly, only to be slightly off near the end of a level, forcing you to start over. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is at it's core a game about memorization and timing, and while this is not inherently a bad thing, a little more leeway, perhaps in the form of a checkpoint or a power-up that let's you rewind time to fix your mistakes, would balance out the difficulty of this game just enough to make it not so mind-numbingly frustrating.\n\nNow, let's talk about the music and visuals of this game. Visually, the game is extremely simple. While this is not in itself a bad thing-any look at some of the top indie games will show you a simple visual style can be both beautiful and interesting-BIT.TRIP RUNNER is really neither of those things. Levels are visually indistinguishable from one another, with the exact same obstacles, enemies, and background elements appearing over and over throughout every single one of the levels I played. Admittedly, I have not completed the game beyond the first 10 or 11 levels, and so perhaps the visual style changes after a certain point, but if this is the case then the game is still suffering from a lack of variety as I shouldn't have to beat 12+ levels just to see a change in aesthetics. There are a few visually interesting and pretty-looking elements to the design, but overall the look of the game is dull, with backgrounds and obstacles appearing in mostly purple or muted gray tones. This leads to the game being incredibly repetitive from a visual standpoint, a problem which unfortunately plagues the music of the game as well. The music itself is very nice at first listen. As a fan of chiptunes myself, I quite enjoyed it for the first few minutes of gameplay. Sadly though, the lack of variety eventually ruins any potential this game might have had in the music department. Every single level I played starts with the same exact basic rhythm as the last one. This rhythm grows and evolves as you play through the level and pick up power-ups that change it's complexity. The melody of the songs themselves comes from the player's own actions in the level. Jumping over an obstacle will produce a note, as will sliding under one, kicking through one, or picking up one of dozens of gold pieces in each level. This could potentially lead to some very fun and interesting musical moments, but unfortunately-partially due to the perpetually unchanging basic rhythm and partially due to the lack of complexity or variety in the notes and sounds created by completing actions-this is not the case. There are a few moments of excitement here and there in the music of this game, but they are completely overshadowed and nullified by it's repetition. One missed moved sends you back to the beginning of the level, where you will once again face the same basic rhythm, level after level, attempt after attempt.\n\nOverall, I really want to like this game. I'm honestly surprised that I have come back to it as much as I did. Still, I am on the fence about whether or not I can truly recommend it, and the cruel and repetitive nature of the game is what is pushing me towards not doing so. Although officialy I will not reccomend it, I will say that if you enjoy being challenged and don't mind looking at the same graphics, hearing the same sounds, and playing through the same levels over and over again, then perhaps you will enjoy it.\n\nFinal Score: 5/10","December 17, 2014","false","1.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

Choosing another difficulty would make the game a lot easier...and less satisfying and not less bad.\n\nI can not recommend this one. I thoroughly enjoyed (and completed on Rather Hard with all gold pickups) Runner 2. Saw this on sale and thought it would be similar and therefore similarly enjoyable. Oh how wrong was I.\n\nBoth of these Runner games are well known for their difficulty and while in Runner 2, the difficulty comes from nailing complicated combinations of kicks/blocks/slides and jumps, making you feel like a badass when you manage it, the first Runner puts MUCH larger emphasis on timing your jumps. Mistime a jump by 0,00000001 second and you are done.\n\nCombine that with lazy level design where the set-pieces  (sets of obstacles or whatever you wanna call it) are reused over and over even across multiple levels to create longer (WAY longer than any level in Runner 2, also Runner 2 has optional checkpoints) and arbitrarily more difficult levels and you have an awful and frustrating experience.\n\nThe game is absolutely brutal. To the point when I finally beat a level after 2 hours of trying, I didn't even get any feeling of accomplishement form it. I felt more like "Oh thank Christ that ♥♥♥♥'s over, now I can finally go play something else."\n\nConsidering this is the first game in the series, it is nice that the developers learned from this game and made the sequel better and more Satisfying to play in pretty much every respect. So in conclusion: Buy Runner 2, avoid this one unless you feel like replaying what's basically the same extremely lengthy level only with obstacles in different order over and over again.","December 19, 2014","false","6.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

But I still don't recommend it because the sequel "Runner 2 - Future Legend of Rhythm Alien" is 10 times better.

This game is not a good game. Well, at first it was. The first ten levels were very enjoyable and fair. They taught me new things as it came along. Then the odyssey level came as the 11th level. And it ruined all joy I had with the game. It was probably one of the stupidest, most horrible and stupid difficulty spikes I have experienced for a LONG time. The level was 5x as long as the previous levels, and the most stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mistake would send you all the way back to the beginning. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the level was full of it. I found myself saying: "I totally slid there!" "I just jumped that hill!" And other things like that. The entire level was full of trial and error, but the boss after it had more, more on the boss later. The game is incredibly sadistic in a horrible way. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, trial and error were the ways I found myself dying the most. And before you think I suck at video games, I have played lots of other hardcore indie games (Super Meat Boy, Binding of Isaac etc) and got a far distance in them. Those games are fair and death is always your fault.When I finally beat the horrible level, I was not even excited that I beat the level. I was just glad it was over with. Then to pile up on a mountain of crap that one level produced, a horrible boss fight followed. There was a short fair level segment before, and then the easy looking boss came. The first phase is fair enough, then the second phase came. I have a habit of kicking and jumping at the same time, and it works alot of the time. But guess what? Right after he drops an obstacle you kick at, he instantly, without warning, descends, killing me with a horrible trial and error death. I was infuriated how an indie classic could throw such a stupid death at me. The third phase is no better. More stupid trial and error deaths that have no warning whatsoever. I never beat the boss because I decided to stop. The game is not rewarding at all. Two horrible levels one after another ruined the entire experience and causes me to stop playing the game. If the levels afterward were good, the horrible boss fight and stupid level beforehand prevented me from moving onward to the probably fun, fair game.\nAlso the music is more repetitive than ever. You get to listen to the almost EXACT SAME SONG for 11 levels. Speaking of repetitive, this game uses the boring and stale retro graphics. Even though they might have not been stale whenever this was made, still got lost points from me.\n\n\nSave yourself from this. Runner2 is SO MUCH better.

Those games are fair and death is always your fault.When I finally beat the horrible level, I was not even excited that I beat the level. I was just glad it was over with. Then to pile up on a mountain of crap that one level produced, a horrible boss fight followed. There was a short fair level segment before, and then the easy looking boss came. The first phase is fair enough, then the second phase came. I have a habit of kicking and jumping at the same time, and it works alot of the time. But guess what? Right after he drops an obstacle you kick at, he instantly, without warning, descends, killing me with a horrible trial and error death. I was infuriated how an indie classic could throw such a stupid death at me. The third phase is no better. More stupid trial and error deaths that have no warning whatsoever. I never beat the boss because I decided to stop. The game is not rewarding at all. Two horrible levels one after another ruined the entire experience and causes me to stop playing the game. If the levels afterward were good, the horrible boss fight and stupid level beforehand prevented me from moving onward to the probably fun, fair game.\nAlso the music is more repetitive than ever. You get to listen to the almost EXACT SAME SONG for 11 levels. Speaking of repetitive, this game uses the boring and stale retro graphics. Even though they might have not been stale whenever this was made, still got lost points from me.\n\n\nSave yourself from this. Runner2 is SO MUCH better. It is fair and fun, with a great artstyle, and other things.","December 27, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Lo and behold, perhaps even worse for its age of being 4+ years old, this game is truly uninteresting.  Boring, poor hit detection, full level restarts on minor errors.

You'll quickly learn the progressive controls and be hopping, sliding, and kicking with ease. The challenge with the game comes with having to be 100% accurate. One mis-step of timing failure and it's back to the start of the level. Some may say this isn't a big deal, but the levels get quite long and so you quickly realize the smallest flaw killed you mere feet from the finish line.\n\nThe soundtrack is what truly makes this game standout though.

This game is not a good game. Well, at first it was. The first ten levels were very enjoyable and fair. They taught me new things as it came along. Then the odyssey level came as the 11th level. And it ruined all joy I had with the game. It was probably one of the stupidest, most horrible and stupid difficulty spikes I have experienced for a LONG time. The level was 5x as long as the previous levels, and the most stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mistake would send you all the way back to the beginning. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the level was full of it. I found myself saying: "I totally slid there!" "I just jumped that hill!" And other things like that. The entire level was full of trial and error, but the boss after it had more, more on the boss later. The game is incredibly sadistic in a horrible way. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, trial and error were the ways I found myself dying the most. And before you think I suck at video games, I have played lots of other hardcore indie games (Super Meat Boy, Binding of Isaac etc) and got a far distance in them. Those games are fair and death is always your fault.When I finally beat the horrible level, I was not even excited that I beat the level. I was just glad it was over with. Then to pile up on a mountain of crap that one level produced, a horrible boss fight followed. There was a short fair level segment before, and then the easy looking boss came. The first phase is fair enough, then the second phase came. I have a habit of kicking and jumping at the same time, and it works alot of the time. But guess what? Right after he drops an obstacle you kick at, he instantly, without warning, descends, killing me with a horrible trial and error death. I was infuriated how an indie classic could throw such a stupid death at me. The third phase is no better. More stupid trial and error deaths that have no warning whatsoever.

Game.\n\nDon't let the splendid retro looking graphics or the actual nice soundtrack fool you. This game has "♥♥♥♥ you" written all over it when you start playing it. It demands precision perfection and that ultimately may turn off a lot of people from this game. I originally wrote a review when only I've played about 7 levels of this game. Now, I'm up to 3-11 in the 3rd world and I can't stress enough how much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ it is.\n\nI'm too emotionally drained from completing this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and you would be too if you had to do certain parts of a level. Over and over and over and over again. Just to be yanked back because, oh, you mis-stepped a ledge, oh, this hurling thing coming at you too fast, oh, how it gets difficult tracking everything coming at once and the camera just shifting up and down. Talk about trial and error with this game.\n\nIt has everything else going for it but that's all just for bells and whistles. Gameplay wise, again, it's all "♥♥♥♥ you". If you are not good at any rhythm based games, then I'd have to take a serious pass on this one.

I hope.\n\nGameplay: similar to Super Meat Boy. Frustrating and requires you to practice so you can get through a level. I was stuck like 30 minutes trying to beat 1-4 level, of which I nearly threw the towel in and uninstalled the game.\n\nYou control an ugly character that can run forward. At first you can only make him jump, but as you progress deeper he can slide and kick. How he can keep on sliding and kicking endlessly while running is beyond my logic though. Unlike SMB, your char runs forward automatically, so you just need to concentrate on kicking jumping and sliding to avoid the walls / obstacles.\n\nLevel designs can be incredibly tedious, as you keep on repeating moves you do in the first one-third of the level and repeat and repeat it. However, because of that, learning curve isn't that steep. As you memorize the first one-third, the rest is pretty easy.\n\nGame has NO checkpoint. If you die one second before you reach the finish line, you will repeat the entire level. No question asked. Imagine if it happened to you? I felt it many times, don't worry, I know the feeling.\n\nGraphic: no further comment or I'll look like a complete hater. I even have problem reading the menus.\n\nSound: Okay, I guess. I am not a fan but I don't dislike it either. Pretty fitting for the game.\n\nReplayability: Based on levels I've finished, it's close to zero. Unless you want to fix your score, then there's no reason to play previous levels.\n\nAnd lastly, as far as I'm aware of, no proper controller support for Dinput gamepads. Even when I try to attach x360ce the game doesn't recognize it. I don't know which one is wrong - as that emulator can hook my controller perfectly for many games.\n\nBuy it or not? I personally would just think this game is a bundle material. And certainly for 10 bucks it is too expensive. Maybe a hardcore fan of Bit Trip games is alright I guess.","June 2, 2013","false","3.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

BIT.TRIP RUNNER takes the mechanics of The Impossible Game and cranks it up to 11. However, whereas The Impossible Game was simplistic, BTR is punishing and convoluted.\n\nYou have a few different commands mapped to different keys (or buttons if you're on a controller) such as ducking, jumping, kicking, etc. Depending on the upcoming obstacle, you have to do one of those. However, the game is sorta 2.5D, and there's a very annoying effect in some instances (especially concerning stairs) where the camera will move enough for you to lose a bit of accuracy in your timing.\n\nLike The Impossible Game, interacting with something will send you to the beginning of the stage. Thank goodness the stages are much shorter, because after crashing into the same exact wall 10 times, I don't think I could have dealt with the level going on for much longer of a distance than that.\n\nThe pickups in the level are pointless. After getting them all, you get a rainbow behind your character, but it doesn't seem to do anything at all. Otherwise, they just add points, but they're so easy to get that everyone must have the same score on every level that doesn't include other methods of getting points.\n\nOverall, I had a terrible time with this game, and I would rather wait for The Impossible Game to get off of Greenlight than recommend this to a friend.","December 27, 2013","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Whoever created "The Guantlet" (a level late in the game, and notorious by this point) must have been wracked with fits of maniacal laughter as they developed the game. That level is a slap in the face to decency, and trollbait for rage-quitters. A close runner up to "Guantelet" is the hilarity of "Odyssey." I won't spoil it for you, but you'll get the joke when you understand that level. And you'll know the joke's on you.

The music in Bit.Trip Runner is synchronized with the game, so when your character jumps over an obstacle, a note plays, but the note plays when you clear the obstacle, not when you start the jump, so if you're musically inclined and start to jump with the rhythm of the music, you'll always jump too late and have to start over at the beginning of the level. Basically, if you can carry a tune, you're boned, because the instant you try to become one with the beat, you lose.","December 27, 2011","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Very fun at first, but eventually gives way to frustration and tedium. I think I spent 4 out of the 5 hours I played on one specific level. Runner 2 is a vast improvement, but this game is still worth playing. The graphics are surprisingly enjoyable (I'm not usually a fan of pixel art), and I really enjoyed the music, though it could use more variety.\n\nIf you have a sense of rhythm and like platformers, you'll probably like this game: 7/10\nIf you don't, you'd be better off banging your thumb with a hammer, over and over again: 2/10\n\nObviously, I fall into the first category. :)","September 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's rather difficult to explain. As a platformer it's frustrating, unfair, the controls are loose, the music is repetitive, level design is grating...but despite its numerous faults if you let it the game will suck you in for hours on end. No matter how it might enrage the player, it is *very* difficult to stop playing. To say a game is that compelling sure sounds like a great compliment, but I assure you it's not. Anger sets in after the first few minutes and builds--not declines--with each successive level. It's a Simon Says at a million miles an hour, forcing the player to perform a series of monotonous tasks to a degree of precision in the milliseconds, and there's not a moment's respite for failure. Expect to see the beginning of each level many times. While the challenge and satisfaction of success could make the game very rewarding for the few willing to take the time to master its nuance, it's plagued by control issues. Suffice to say, the input feels unacceptably loose and many times the player can expect to have quite a defeats snatched from the jaws of victory by a missed keypress or delay of only a few frames. This I cannot overstate: the game expects the player to perform to a level that it itself cannot reach. So why persist? It's succubus! The level isn't *that* hard. You can't be *that* bad at such a simple game. You were *so* close that last attempt. Surely you'll get it *this* time. It's just enough to keep playing, but not enough to feel any satisfaction for a victory.\n\nMaybe I'm nitpicking, but I can't bring myself to recommend a game that demands so much from the player, but isn't precise enough to handle the players it's trying to court. With a little refinement and some tighter controls, I could see this as a great Super Hexagon or Audiosurf-alike, but that's simply not the case.","October 15, 2014","false","11.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

This is a simple game, but it works against you in a way that is just dependent on your abilities as a gamer.\n\nI won't say that the game sucks because you don't know what's coming ahead of you and it's all about memorization. Some people won't like that, I'm not the biggest fan, but I play retro games made that way and manage to find them fun if they feature good design otherwise (good controls, level design, enemy behavior, etc.).\n\nThe game sucks because while the camera is often placed fine, there are very important moments when the action gets fast and you have to make a sudden fall to avoid an obstacle at the top, at those moments the camera stays in place and doesn't give you the focus necessary on the bottom part. (One might not know what I'm talking about if they didn't play later levels.)\n\nAnd you'll notice a ton of moments when the game is slightly buggy or the controls suddenly don't respond in an optimal way. I wonder how I got through the game at all.\n\nI heard Runner2 is an improvement in many ways, in fact a great game. The first game though, it's frustrating for all the wrong reasons and that's coming for a retro gaming fan like me.","November 25, 2013","false","9.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This is in my opinion the best in the BIT-TRIP series,other BT games are based around different styles of gameplay and this one is all about running without dying,it's fast paced and will have you shouting at the screen of unfair pixels grrrr anyway I enjoy runner style games like that of the warioware series and others,this however is the best and is very challenging,my only complaint is that I would sometimes like to speed up and slow down the gameplay at the cost of a time bar or something like that,a good idea for BIT-TRIP 3 !\n\nI play this game every other day and find myself coming back for more even when the challenge can be really tough at times and I feel like smashing the screen in,I take a break and come back to it so it must be good ! The game also sounds great however there is no audio timing to gameplay sync like you are led to believe from other reviews but it's still a fun run.\n\nThere are plenty of hidden goodies including many steam awards for playing and that keeps me going when I get a bit angry with the brutal difficulty that some of the levels display,I am on world 2,the first boss was a nightmare and the pace seems to have calmed down to introduce new play mechanics,I might also add that world 2 is quite refreshing to look at after being stuck on world one for so long.\n\nI will also note that I am playing the game on normal difficulty,I didn't know it could be set to easy and I would recommend others to keep it on normal,my 6 year old also plays this game and he can also complete quite a few of the stages and like me,he is also addicted to the daily BIT-TRIP play through challenge.\n\nGreat game that all old school arcade lovers should play,if you like a solid challenge that is also fun and rewarding then get this game and have some fun but be prepared to also shout at it grrr\n\n8/10 !!","May 19, 2014","true","10.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Dull gameplay, lackluster music.  As a rhythm game, there's not much else there.\n\nThe music doesn't quite line up with the actions you're supposed to take either -- like, the beats will line up with when you pass over obstacles rather than when you're supposed to initiate the jump.  This might be the only rhythm game I can think of that's actually easier when you mute it.","November 17, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Here's a little back story of the game. You play as a stickman from the popular Newground flashes and you have to rescue your girl friend from the main bad game (like that's never done before, Bethesda). Now In the past I've never really had any good experience with indie-games but maybe this one will be better. Lets dive into Bit. Trip Runner!\n\nWhen you first start up the game you start off running and you have no control of your character. I mean no control what so ever, if you try going left doesn't work and if you try jumping it doesn't work. At first I assumed my keyboard was broken but I tried my other keyboard AND I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. Seriously in this game the controls are just not existed.\n\nGraphics look like tehy're staight up indie doo doo, the guy looks like my fat over weight friend mettic.\n\nAll and all Bit.Trip runner will make you run from it seeing how terrible it is.","July 3, 2013","false","1.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","3"

Really good character design there, instead of making an interesting character, just throw random stuff into it.\n\nWow...\n\nYour character decides to run to the right, without stopping. It is up to you to control his jumping, sliding, kicking, and shield. But instead of taking skill, BIT.TRIP RUNNER decides "NO! Memorization is more fun". You die if you touch one thing, and you go back to the beginning of the level.\n\nNo checkpoints...\n\nLet that sink in....\n\nNO CHECKPOINTS...\n\nI hate this game so bad, but luckly, the sequel is far better!

A little weird considering the backgrounds are 3d but the character is a very plain sprite. I didn't really like that mix.\nThere's 3 worlds and there's a handful of levels in each so it has enough content in it.\n\nUnfortuantely, I just didn't think the game was great. One mistake and allllll the way back to the start. Its a difficult game, but its difficulty isn't something it should be proud of like SMB is. Its just a memorization test. Trial and error nonstop. Memorizing certain patterns. I don't find that very entertaining.\n\nI felt like this game was just wasted potential. They should of made it more about score and less about memorizing hard patterns. It also would of benefited from less linear gameplay with multiple paths to choose from.\n\nFortunately, not only does the sequel do that but it also adds checkpoints. Its better in many other ways as well.\nI suggest you skip this one and play Runner 2 instead.\n","January 24, 2015","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The more frustrated you get, the harder each level is to beat, and that just makes you even more frustrated. I've commonly found the best way to beat a level is to quit and come back to it later... often I can get it on the first try, no matter how difficult I'd found it before. It's a game you love to keep coming back to and I've played for hours (often in offline mode, hence my play time).\n\nBit.Trip Runner is an extremely difficult game, but it hooks you with catchy music that will leave you mumbling motions under your breath ("kick. jump, down, jump. kick kick jump down jump kick"). Your curses at each loss (which all catapult you to the beginning of the level) will not be quite so quiet. If you're used to playing normal difficulty at other games, I recommend playing easy on this one, and don't try the most difficult setting unless you are a god.\n\n8/10 would not buy for the full price simply because the game is so frustrating and simplistic, but would pick it up on sale any day of the week.","January 5, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TRIP RUNNER:\n\nPROS:\n-Fun, smooth and unique gameplay.\n-The game controlls well with a gamepad.\n-The music is great and goes amazingly with the gameplay.\n-The game is very challengeing giving you a great feeling of accomplishment when you finish a level.\n-It is mostly well paced.\n\nCONS:\n-The game can be extremely and frustratingly difficult at times.\n-I find that the controlls are quite clunky and awkward with a keyboard\n-Any distractions will most likely mess you up.\n\nSUMMARY:\nBIT. TRIP RUNNER is a fun and addictive platformer with some annoyances, but if you are willing to look past them it's a great and fun game worth the low price.","December 24, 2013","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are superb, in their funky 3D-2D kind of way, and the music is brilliantly entwined with the gameplay. You essentially have to run along an obstacle course, and the better you do, the nicer the sound gets. It's very rhythmic, so those who don't find music to be a particularly strong point of theirs, this game will be tough. In fact, even though I am a relatively good musician (I play a few instruments) this game was exceptionally difficult.

The tracks are bright and happy, if you can say so from music. If I'm correct, you can even play with your own music but I haven't tried it...\nSome stages are pretty hard and, at least I, ended up loosing multiple times in some of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drkeithfetus/recommended/63710/","drkeithfetus","Mega Fetus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drkeithfetus/","226 products in account","BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a fun little musical platformer. Unfortunately, the game has several problems. For one, Gaijin Games doesn't seem to know about the concept of a proper difficulty curve. The difficulty is all over the place. Some levels are hard, some levels are easy, and some levels are just disproportionately hard. Odyssey is one level that comes to mind, as several people haven't even gone past that level, if you check the achievements page. Another problem is that this game is only fun if you are good at it. Otherwise, it's just frustrating. And even if you are doing well, making one little mistake forces you to start the entire level over, which can be incredibly frustrating if it was a long level, and just plain disheartening if you keep making mistakes in a level. And one of the more glaring flaws, is how bonus levels are handled. You get to those after getting all the gold in a level. Unfortunately, you only have one try at them. If you fail, and want to try again to perfect the level, you have to play through the regular level all over again, just to get one shot at the bonus. Overall, it's a really unforgiving game.\n\nNow some of you may be thinking, "What are you talking about? The game's pretty forgiving, it gives you 11 checkpoints in one level! Quit whining!" I've heard that argument before. I am aware of how the other BIT.TRIP games work, but those games had room for error. You were allowed to make more than one mistake, and you didn't have to start a particular section over if you did. And some of you may be arguing that all this challenge and unforgiveness is just reminiscent of retro games. I suppose you could make that argument, but there's a reason why most modern games don't pull off what's done in this game, and those games were made in a time where game designers didn't really know any better, or had different ideas about what made games challenging.\n\nI suppose if you're one of those gamers that can tolerate ridiculously hard games, or are one of those people that think modern games are too easy, and are looking for challenging games, you'll probably feel right at home with this, or heck, the entire series. If you're not one of those people, you may want to skip over this title.","May 28, 2013","true","51.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

This retro-style rhythm-them-up puts your mind inside the music and has you pressing the different keys at the right time to dodge the oncoming obstacles. The soundtrack in each level is different and incredibly funky.\nThe levels are all predetermined so you can be sure that when you fail, your immediate cry of “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!” is not at all justified. After a few levels of pulling off some sick moves, you can really check out your skills it BIT.TRIP RUNNER, and reaching the end of a tough challenge is very rewarding. There are gold coins to pick up along the way that naturally increase your score and clearing a level of gold will send you to an bonus challenge. Here you get no backing track, so you have to face the music (LOL) and make up the rhythm in your head, which is difficult even on the early bonuses.\nThe best thing about this game is the steadily intensifying backing track, and each time you collect a special pickup it gets louder and more involved. It’s also a great way of knowing if you’re near the end of a level, because of the intense bass after all those pickups.\nWhether you’re tone deaf or fancy yourself as a bit of a musician, this game will keep you raving (and raging) all day long. And no, it’s not better than Rhythm Paradise.\n","November 12, 2013","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
