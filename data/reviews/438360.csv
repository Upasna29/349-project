Everything works.  It doesn't even feel much like an indie game, this is a polished product.  I was shocked that a developer actually *finished* a game for once.\n\nSo in this case, we have to consider the game is technically perfect and just focus on the gameplay itself.  Well, I sure would have loved controller support.  This is a twin stick shooter and it even has a nice arm movement (animation) where you can run forwards but shoot backwards or in any direction, and I found the mouse control to work fine but I would have really enjoyed it more with a controller.  The whole game is set up perfectly for a controller if it was supported.\n\nI found the viewing angle to be a little bit short.  As in, you really can't see what you're doing.  Thankfully, you can press a button which brings up an arrow pointing towards your goal, so you can't ever be lost.  You don't really need to see what you're doing in this case, but you'll be playing at the maximum zoom level.  Zoom in only to get a closer look at something, but I really wish I could tilt the camera a little bit further back so I could enjoy the closer zoom because everything is so highly detailed.  You have this one dashing ability which is used as a "jump" in an early platform puzzle and it is also really handy in combat since you can get to a safe distance in a flash, but the distance you dash is very far and it is almost the entire length of the camera view.  So again. it would have been better to allow us to zoom the camera out further so we could be more strategic in where we dashed, instead of just blasting in one general direction.\n\nI liked the auto-healing.  If you are super low on health, let's say 2%, it auto-heals to 50% in just a few seconds outside of combat and the 51%-100% healing is also auto-healing but very very slow.  It's a very good mixture.  I never got far enough in my session to experience any abilities or other weapons, but the whole time I found the combat to be fair.  I died a couple of times, but it was not impossible to consistently win.\n\nThis game did an EXCELLENT job at in-game cutscenes.  They look very professional.\n\nAll in all, I love it.  But I would actually sit down and play it a bit more if I could use my controller!  :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BNUteZSmC0","February 4","true","0.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================\nInfinitesimal Point is an overhead twin-stick shooter with RPG-like character development in a science-fiction setting.\n\nIn the game you play an unnamed man attacked by a creature late at night on Earth, teleported accidentally through a portal to another planet. Losing your arm in the attack, you wake up to find a cybernetic arm, complete with a claw hand capable of firing plasma bolts, grafted to your body. A slightly dysfunctional AI introduces itself as your saviour and asks you to complete an errand for it. And so it begins.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics in Infinitesimal point are excellent. There's great lighting and shadows and the main character model is detailed and well animated. The game makes use of a very convincing DoF effect, blurring the tops of tall objects close to the game camera in order to focus on the action.\n\nExplosions are a bit disappointing, though, and water doesn't look that great.\n\nSound - Sound is good, but mostly not outstanding. Weapons sound a little underpowered, but music and other effects are generally good. The music works up into a more electronic sort of beat that I really like, but which may not be to everyone's tastes.\n\nGameplay - Infinitesimal Point is a twin-stick shooter, through and through. It's crying out for full controller support, but at the moment it only natively supports keyboard and mouse.\n\nRather than going down the path of many games in this genre and have you collect new weapons or money to buy new weapons, Infinitesimal Point instead has you gain levels as you progress, unlocking skills from the skill tree. Spending points in different directions in this skill tree unlocks new powers for your cyber arm, improving upon the basic plasma bolt available at the start. Points can also improve in the direction of your 'blink' ability, which you can use to teleport short distances out of trouble, with each stat you increase giving you different 'powers' from your arm. This allows for some variety in play style.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ great graphics\n+ character progression similar to a RPG game\n+ interesting plot\n\nCons:\n- poor English translation (e.g. "What is this for a place?")\n- no native controller support; keyboard and mouse controls can be a little fiddly\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Infinitesimal Point is a fun twin-stick shooter with great graphics, character progression, and an interesting story to tell. Recommended.\n\n8/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","February 6","true","4.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","10","22","3","0"

I'm giving this game a thumbs-up, but I'm focusing on the negatives in hope that some of these things can be improved.\n\n1) The targeting cursor is difficult to see - especially in brightly-lit areas, and while the cursor is moving.  This is probably the most important issue.  If the targeting cursor was outlined in black - or customizable in the settings - it would be an improvement.\n\n2) The zoom is problematic.  I like being able to use the mouse-wheel to zoom - but I do NOT like the game automatically adjusting the zoom when I'm close to certain objects. If I'm running from several enemies, I don't want them to suddenly be out of my vision range just because I walked too close to a tree, or behind an obstacle.  Other games manage this by keeping the zoom constant, and making players / enemies visible through the obstruction as an outline or shadow.\n\nAlso, the maximum zoom-out needs to be increased.  The player should never have to "blink" to an off-screen location, and hope for the best.\n\n3)  I haven't been playing the game for long, but many of the early upgades border on useless.  The only one of value seems to be the shotgun.  This may change as I play longer, of course.\n\n4) There's no noticable notification when my character reaches a new level.  Even once in a while I'll check, and discover that I've gone up two or three levels without realizing it.\n\n5) The "enemy locator" at the bottom-left of the screen borders on useless.  The red dots indicating enemies are barely noticable.  I've been playing the game for an hour or so, and I just noticed the dots.  Given the limited vision range in the game, a system like this is useful - but it needs to be improved.\n\n==============\n\nAgain - this is a good game, and it has a LOT going for it.  I'm just pointing out a few of the negatives in hopes that some of them are addressed in future patches.","May 28","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
