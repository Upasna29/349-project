In many scenes - particularly action scenes - you often can't tell who's saying what, or what is happening to whom.  Some of the speech bubbles pop up in the wrong order.  If you're looking for the kind of VN that offers choices, you won't find any here.  Also, the whole 'novel' is shorter than this review.","March 18","false","0.7"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","40","47","4","2"

I also have a comic that was attached to the pre-order Witcher 3 and he was worse (primitive story, ordinary drawing), and their comparison in favor of Gyes.\nAs concept art enthusiast, I keep track of Adam Burn works and I want to say that this is not his best creation. But compared with the vast majority of comics that I've met, TFOG stands out for its beauty and enough conceived. The style of drawing is quite unusual, but I like it. It's rare to meet realistic style in comics.\nA small complaint I can make on the text - it would like to have more. Maybe, any kind of lore datalogs or interludes between important parts of novel? Flashbacks? Minds of characters? Just as text, I don't need too much pictures.\nBut I did not have a sense of disappointment, rather I wanted to AR RPG quickly released and wanted to meet with Bella during walkthrough. Still interesting what role it will play in the game's story and what events will take place in New Dallass. I think, there coming some kind of zombie-apocalypse, funny to see this in classis RPG...\nIn th end, this comics fulfilled his main task - he attracts in the After Reset world and showed a small piece of his background. I can honestly say that I liked it.","March 18","true","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Drawback: now can´t wait until AR comes out :D\n\nEspecially liked the sound effects throughout the novel which really support the mood (hope in AR they will be on par, quality-wise!), and the ..well.. can´t say what without spoiling :) Just check it out if you got like 15 - 30 mins of time (depending how fast you read and how long you spend to appreciate each panel). Don´t expect "Hours of story" thou - this IS a small intro/teaser into the world - but one that leaves you waiting for the main game to come out, so definitely does it´s job. So it´s worth it if you like graphic novels, are interested in the After Reset universe, or generally are into dark sci-fi stuff and cool concept art / drawings.\n\nBefore you click the "play the game" button, I recommend to check out the "Backstory" button - so that you know a bit about the world in which the main story takes place.","March 21","true","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
