In my opinion Everquest 2 is the underdog and a sleeper hit never at the forefront but also never to be underestimated. If WoW is not your type of MMO then I would reccomend Everquest 2 if only for completely different vibe then what is on the market today.","October 25, 2014","true","118.1"," 70 of 78 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","70","78","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebel18/recommended/201230/","rebel18","Ɲevermorƺ™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebel18/","159 products in account","Everquest 2 is in the same league as World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, and even the new Final Fantasy MMO, but none of these other games are so evolved they’ve revolutionized the overall experience. This results in an overload of similar content presented through different layers of graphics, lore, classes, creatures and underlying support systems (such as crafting and raiding). Don’t get me wrong, many of the games have “unique perk features” (e.g. GW2 allows you to dodge attacks), but these perk features don’t qualify as bringing MMOGs to the next level of gaming experience.\n\nEQ2 trumps the competition when it comes to overall content, playability, many features and functionality; and in some cases far beyond the other games.\n\n\n1. Mercenary, which is like having another player with you, a single character can solo most of the dungeons and heroic areas/monsters of the game. This opens all players who use a mercenary up to the majority of the content without having to look for a group and rely on others to play.\n\n2. Alternate Advancement, a system that allows the player to decide what percentage (up to 100%) of their experience they want to go to this secondary point system, which opens some new skills.\n\n3. Quests, EQ2 has an unique balance of presentation for it's quests. The players can quickly and blindly click through things to move on through the next step whereas players who are heavy into a storyline/lore can interact and engage with the NPC. The rewards are also well designed and refined imo.\n\n4. Guild, EQ2's guild system brings their players together, sharing their accomplishments and keeping them connected better than any other MMO.  The guild system with automatic notifications toward the player's achievements, level gains, and finding valuable items. It also has a built in Voice Chat which works great. EQ2 has the best Guild system out of all ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes. Period. EQ2's guild system also have the Guild Hall (home of the guild). No other ♥♥♥♥♥♥me comes remotely close afaik.\n","April 29, 2014","true","134.3"," 92 of 115 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","92","115","0","0"

Now as a free player you can enjoy almost every aspect of the game (aside from the best gear and the latest expansion) and walk around in a world that litterally lets you EVER QUEST (oh yeah, pun intended there).\nAnd that world is quite beautiful indeed. Every zone has it's own setting where you can pick up new quests and explore for hours to go. The only sad thing is that the zones are not directly linked, but you get a loading screen from zone to zone.\n\nCrafting in EQ2 is probably one of the best systems I've seen in any MMORPG. You can actually influence the quality of the outcome, or fail misserably. And when you're trying to make something that's real hard to fabricate, you can even be hurt during the process.\n\nIn all, I thikn EQ2 is a pretty well done MMORPG. Sadly though, I'm a bit out of MMORPG lately but might pick up EQ2 at some later time again.","March 27, 2015","true","101.7"," 63 of 78 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","63","78","3","0"

I had a "Yes" to recommend this game a while back. It got a fair amount of "helpful review" likes. But a few months back I deleted that review, because I can no longer recommend this game, to anyone.\n\nIs the game good? Yes. But the quality is going downhill, at least to me with how it used to be. This is just my review so take it  how you wish.\n\nThey are a very small team now, so I can't blame them with much smaller content updates. But the pricing is outrageous on a lot of things like a new race or a "campaign". Expansions with small amounts of content (little over 100 quests, 1 or 2 zones) selling for full price ($40).\n\nThe biggest reasons is yes, the pricing. This game is great as a free to play game, but if you are looking for an MMO to be with for the long haul, I wouldn't recommend this one at all. I don't know what the level cap is for a free player anymore, but you will have to buy the latest expansion to get all content. The amount you get for free is great, don't get me wrong, it just starts asking for your wallet if you want to do more end game things. Which is likely with lots of free to play titles.\n\nI still watch the forums, I still check update notes, I still want to go back. I have been with this franchise since 1999, and it saddens me that I now have to say "No" when asked if  I can recommend  it.\n\nIts free, so you can't really go wrong I suppose. Just don't expect a large player base, although they are looking into merging servers (finally). Good luck!\n\n10/4/15: Editing to say: I am playing again, but only on the timelocked servers. I can recommend those, but they require a subscription. I still do not recommend this game on the regular servers. New "expansion" was announced, price did reduce to $35, but still not worth it in my opinion, but will have to wait and see what happens.\n\n11/8/15: Steam is currently saying I have played near 200 hours past 2 weeks of this game. I played maybe 3 hours. No idea whats going on their lol. I also realized I didn't really say anything about the gameplay as reviews already kinda have. I was just focusing on the free to play model and pricing mostly. The game is very fun, I will say that. But once you get to past Velious, its just downhill and no longer very enjoyable. I think the only thing I enjoy are the advanced solo instances after Velious.\n\nThe game has well over 8,000 quests, and it will take you an insane amount of time to find and do them all. Not sure anyone has done them all. Its a great game for questers, but as said above, after Velious the quest amount goes down, alot. Next expansion says over 85 quests. It used to be hundreds. I am a quester and I think thats why I dislike it, aside from the pricing. Buy an expansion and be done with every quest in 2 days or less, then its just dailies/repeatables.","July 14, 2015","false","072.4"," 87 of 119 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","87","119","6","0"

I've been playing the game for about 1 and a half years (a bit more then that actually) but I can safely say the 2000+ hours I spent on it have been amazing. Great community, great gameplay and although the graphics aren't godly they are still pretty good. There is no P2W in this game the closest things are the heroic characters. You buy them at level 90 (originally lvl 85) and they get good armor for the levels. But then you realize the gear you get from raids and Tradeskillers and hell even quests are better. There are no special bonuses on the heroic characters. Now going back to the great community, there are a bunch of servers you can play on. I personally go on antonia bayle (great server) and let me tell you this. If you are friendly to the people and don't use them you can ask just about any of the crafters to see if they can make you some equipment and they will happily oblige. Another great thing about EQ II is the housing system, each character (refered to as toons in most communities) can have upwards of 20 player homes and let me tell you this the player homes don't feel like a hassel to decorate and it is honestly one of my favorite things to do. Would I say EQ II is perfect, no. No mmorpg is perfect EQ2 has it's flaws namely some of the animations are a bit off, and the lack of a playable wolf man (similar to the worgen in WoW) is an annoyance but overall the game is great, the music oh don't even get me started on how great the music is. Long story short if you are a fun of RP and MMOs EQ2 is a great choice and if you want to get into MMORPGs EQ 2 is a great place to start. I give the game a 8.5/10 if they fixed the animations then it would easily be a 9.5 or even 10 out of 10. I give this game the thumbs up, so come join in on the fun and be absorbed into the world of Norrath.","October 27, 2015","true","802.9"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

While you can follow the quest line and get pretty high soloing, the game in my own opinion is more fun just running around with a group killing camps and dungeons.\n\nI've gotta say, right now, in comparison to other MMORPGs, this game's graphics are very nice. I've always loved that feeling of such darkness in some places in Norrath, and such light in others. Personally, it's worked charms on me. I love the style.\n\nYou may be thinking 'this guy has spent tons of money on this game', but really, I haven't spent a dime on EverQuest II, though it definitely deserves it. With tons of races and classes, this game reaches maximum variety of choices. It has many little features that are cool like SOEmote with face tracking, now it has voice chat for groups/guilds, and it's graphics are stunning for a modern MMORPG.\n\nAlso, I thought I should mention...

Everquest 2 is hands down one of the best MMO's out right now. The ability to create everything about your character, quests, the player community is all great. Development Staff try their hardest to fix bugs within hours of being reported. Sadly, there is no more PvP unless your a paid member, but the experience and friends I have had while playing Everquest 2 outweigh all the cons, which are very few. One of them is that if you put in a support ticket, it can take up to a week for a response. One pro is the new expansion: Terrors of Thalumbra, that went live last month. This content actually requires strategy, teamwork, and a lot of thinking to be done. And this game is friendly to everyone.

This was by far the most fun I've ever had in a generic style MMORPG.\n\nI did play WoW for a while but the graphical style of WoW and the over simplified skill system kinda bored me to death.\n\nEverquest utilizes an in depth skill system that requires you think before using points in a particular tree. Granted classes are not really open like in some of the new MMOS but the class itself has a lot of customization.\n\nExample: A wizard has class restrictions forbidding the use of heavy armor and a variety of weapons. But it allows a rounded out skill selection including element proficiency and damage/debuff modifiers.\n\nAll in all I strongly recommend this game for any and all MMO players. F2Players are not restricted like in many other F2Play games. Level cap is 85 and the auctionhouse requires F2Play auction tickets to use otherwise buying the All access pass makes most everything free besides Expansion stuff.","November 12, 2014","true","23.9"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","30","39","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noooitsYETI/recommended/201230/","noooitsYETI","nooo its YETI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noooitsYETI/","62 products in account","This is a very well made game.  For those of you that come from World of Warcraft(WoW), it has some of the same qualities; raids, PvP, and Guilds.  The one thing that surpasses WoW is its races and styles to choose from.  It has more the blah 4 or 5 races on each side to choose from and the basic 5 styles to play.  It has three sections to pick from as well instead of horde or alliance.  It has your three basic Dungeon and Dragon alliances, chaotic good, neutral or evil.  Within those there are a variety of races to pick from each with their own speciality, but not restrictions, so pick away the style you want.  After that the 5 basic styles are there but each has 2-3 sub-styles to choose from.  So just from the start you can build you hero/villian any way you want that would fit your way of play.\n\nThe Advanced GUI Experience:\n\nThe next big thing is the GUI format.  It has way ahead of WoW, you can move everything want for starters, putting things where you would like them.  A big plus for this is towards us druids and spellcaster alike.  You can not only move the hotbars around, you can also scale them.  For example you can make them nice and big if you only have a few spells, or when you get into the game and I am only talking about level 20(when you can start doing raids/dungeons[the only downfall I see from WoW where you can raid anytime you like at any level]) you can make them soo small that you casn have 5 hotbars and they barley take up any room on the screen(like WoW were when you get into a raid you can barley see what is going on, only a variety of colorful hotbars covering your screen[this is without any mods of course]).  Another nice factor that blow WoW out of the water is the ease of editing your hotbar.  You no longer have to delete the whole hotbar in order to make your own.  You have two choices; 1. you have to right-click the spell to get rid and click delete or if you are just replacing one spell then drag and drop your spell of choice from the spell menu and drop it on the one you want to replace. 2.  You can choose a setting that lets you slide the spells around freely whenever you like.  So now you can just click-hold and drag the spell to a new slot and if a spell is there that one is now automatically grapped to be placed anywhere and soo on.  It does like WoW have a local hotbar delete all button.(just to point out, each hotbar has its own settings, so though one might be small the next one on the screen will be big.  after making one however, every new hotbar you make from here on out will be the size of the last one you have.  Now this is just the GUI.  Now the real game begins.\n\nBasic Leveling and The Amazing Skill Choices:\n\nSo like any other MMO you do you missions, grinding out farm kills, etc.  The interesting point to this pre-level edit.  So when you go to choose the passive skills and all that good stuff, you notice a dropdown box in the right hand corner.  It already has 3 pre-made settings; solo, PvP, and Group(raids/dungeons).  Now those are for those purposes only and are role specific.  For example, if you pick a druid-substyle-fury, you will have three styles of play, healer, tank and dps.  It is a good for being stable during solo play, which is mainly dps and healer for the most part.  But in group it will mostly go go down healer with some tanking. If you go PvP mostly DPS with basic healing and tanking to just be sustainable. Surpise though, you can make your 3 custom slots as well.  When you do this it will give you the MAX amount of points that you will get.  These points however are seperate to your normal leveling.  They are points you get every so often(I will be honest forgot the exact name but when you look at the bar with your experience recieved and to go, the button on the right will have three different options and one shows the bar for these attribute points) and are used for your tree build, spell specific passives, your trade skill, etc.  You will start off with 321 and you can either use the points you think you have or just use them all.  Now caution be warned, the order you put those points in will be the order they are used when you are leveling. So try to think what you will need. But don't worry if you do not like what you have then just go back and restart from the point you think it all went wrong.  But another caution, some of these come with extra spells, so if you do not go down the path of before then you will loose that spell but it will yet remain on you hotbar.(the only bad thing I saw when it came to leveling and the hotbar spells. Going on, you will notice that when you pick these points you have 4 choices at the top of the window, these is for your subclass, spell specific passives and one that the DLC is needed.(btw the premades use the DLC but they are not added to you sooo keep an eye out on that because you will be wasting points early on)Then you also have choices along the side and each one of these has its own points to use and will also be given when you level in that category, so remember to harvest, gather etc so you get points for that.  Now basic levling will come with its own set of spells, but it also has passives, this is your basic leveling again. Every so often you get a point to use for you character specific passives(usually is every 9 for some. every 10 for others(total of 10 for 9 and 9 for 10.) And these are usefull so check them out before hand to see if they will work with the skill points you have chosen.\n\nNow the rest is up to you.  Go out and game, level, join up with others and farm away.  The game in itself is a great game.  It has great grpahics and you can zoom in and out of first person(think of skyrim).  If you are a fan of WoW then you will love this game.  It is free-2-play(outside of that you can choose silver member for $5 and get two more character slots plus can use expert level spells and make your own guild or your basic WoW charge for 2 more slots, Master level spells, and more) But really it is not needed.  You might only have 2 slots for character off the bat, but $5 for 2 more and expert level skills and make your own guild(you can join any guild however without having to pay anything.)you can not go wrong.  I will say it is fine with out going silver.  You have everything you need if you are just someone who makes one character and just plays the crap out of it.  While you are playing go into the settings and write a Bio of your character(has a limit) and let people know who you are, how you play, and what you wish to attain.  So go live it up!! Make your character now and get started, and it is all for free, how can you go wrong?!","December 31, 2013","true","21.5"," 38 of 55 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","38","55","0","2"

Clearly I like the game if I've put that much time into it.  Imagine my surprise when I went to purchase some in game currency and was prompted through the steam site.  This was the first time I've tried to add funds via steam and nearly fell out of my desk when they wanted to charge me a $10 tax to my $20 purchase.  Went through the site where I've always gone and it was a $1.65.\n\nI've always enjoyed the game some expansion less than others but there is a million things to do and other than equipment and spell restrictions you can experience a great deal of it and not feel burned by free to play.  Not a pay to win game where you can purchase items on the market it's mainly for appearance items and xp boosters.  If you decide to play and end up liking it enough that you put some money in, don't ever go through steam for it.","July 23, 2015","true","114.4"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","26","34","3","0"

I stopped playing the game right after the Age of Discovery expansion was released in December 2011.\n\nIn the first few years, the game was addictive and time consumining and had a lot to see and do.  The story line and side quests were interesting and faily immersive.  All this was great for a single guy with loads of time on his hands.\n\nFast foward to the F2P changes, and the game started to lose my interest.  I preferred a subscription based experience versus the micro transactions.  I had to pay to unlock gear I had already obtained amongst other things. Content seemed to get boring - doing the same mundane tasks over and over again.  I didn't care for the grind and was never an end game type of player.  I liked playing for the feeling of accomplishment and exploring.\n\nThe game started feeling more like a SIMs type game with all the interior decorating and appearance items.  Ignoring all this, the game wasn't too bad. I did enjoy displaying trophies and artifacts, but it started getting repetitive after a while.\n\nAs a side note, the card game Legends of Norrath is very interesting and fun to play.  It does allow for you to get ingame items for either EQ or EQ2.  I have found though that I enjoy Hearthstone much better, and I have never been a WoW fan.\n\nI do not know the state of the game as of this writing, but based on my experiences, I would say the game is worth trying as it is "Free", but do expect to spend a lot of time, and money now due to F2P, to really get a lot out of the game.  I loved the time spent playing this game and would even go so far as to say my friends would have considered me an EQ fan boy. Having said that, I would not recommend the game due to the changes made over the years.  I feel the original vision of the game was abandoned.","March 13","false","417.4"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","26","36","2","5"

(for a limited time) the character creation also rivals other MMORPG games of today's standards.\n-Questing, the quests you will experience are quite fun, and really immerse you into the game quite well. (a few early in the game fail at role play due to a slight hint at tutorial type info). Questing will generally provide useful rewards to keep you out of market place well enough.\n-Community, a HUGE plus for me was the community. It is full of people who have been a part of Ever Quest for a very long time, as well as people interested in beginning their journey. Veterans are often a pleasure to run into, as well as provide very useful tips or even old bags they don't need, which can help you greatly. especially in free account status.\n-Parties!, when you hit a certain level you will be able to que for groups with other people seeking, in order to either quest, or farm gear. The people in que, will get put into a pool and level's will be balanced out, and the dungeon run will be made to fit the groups' party, which seems to work...? if anything you might get a crazy tank that can basically solo everything and is just bringing you along..\n\nNow for Con's of free membership:\n-Market place, The biggest problem by FAR on free membership is the auction system. you CANNOT buy or sell items at all as a free member, unless you pay 5 USD for 10 tokens. which means 50 cents per auction or market transaction! ...damn.. that right there will force you to pay the membership fee at some point.\n-Chat system, in theory, people could do what we used to do in EQOA before the game ever had an auction system.. shout in a main city that you're selling, or buying things! I miss those days... kind of... but here? Nope.. not if you are a free member. The chat channels are only visible to you as a free member.. you cannot use them.. but you can however send tells, or use guild/party etc. but not general, not auction, I failed to attempt the LFG channel, due to the LFG system.\n-Housing system, while I consider the housing system to be one of the best features of the game, free to play users seem to get shafted pretty hard, but not game breaking. The housing system is great! You can decorate it, get huge houses, or small ones.. multiple ones.. etc. you can even open it to the public and sell things out of it! there is a lot of fun to be had in housing. However, I do not think free players can utilize a lot of the housing system's features. Such as selling from it.\n-Character limits and limitations, there are 2 races, and 2 classes that are not available until you purchase them. There is also a character limit of 2 characters for free membership these limitations may not effect you much, but is worth noting.\n\n\nOther things to note:\nI really did enjoy my experience here. I wish the market place was available, but I understand the income side of the game, (doesn't mean I need to agree with it!) and to be fair, you can progress quite far without it. The game is old... 2004 old I believe.. and while our computers have definitely increased in ability, it would seem the game has a very bad graphic coding issue. I have quite a powerful machine, capable of running every game I have on maximum settings at 60+ fps (cept...GTA V.. that one is kind of crazy..) but this game.. suggestion from me to you is to use the preset options. When I set them at their maximum (which I believe said "No machine can run these settings, experimental.*" sense 2004) I run smoothest, but I still get stutter issues in heavy areas. Seems like rendering or processing just takes a dump... but if I set things to max on my own, I run into lighting and shading issues.. as well as sum funky effects from weapons.. anyway.. Great fun for an old game, but a temporary game for a free member, and for the size of the game you are about to download, for temporary enjoyment.. well..

It's pretty much the first RPG I ever played, and I've been playing it since 2006. It's gameplay is kinda like WoW's, although it wasn't always that way. The graphics have a more "realistic" look as opposed to WoW's stylization, giving the game a bit more of an aged look. The combat system is what you'd expect from an '04 MMO: button clicking and cooldown timer watching. Population has declined greatly from when I first started playing, but with the ever-improving F2P model numbers are slowly rising again.\n\nThat being said, what, aside from my nostalgia, makes me like this game? It has a TES-like amount of lore and backstory, interesting world design, great music, an engaging active story, interesting quest timelines (although it also has a lot of "kill 10 rats" type stuff), and a large amount of character customization, with 20 races, 32 classes, and an Alternate Advancement tree that allows you to further refine your stats and abilities.

I can not speak for the free-to-play portions as my account is automatically silver-level from years ago when I paid to play.\n\nI can say that currently, the silver level account has far less content barriers than it did when they first went free-to-play.  Can now equip Legendary armor and weapons and I can choose from any of the original EQ2 classes/races without paying extra for them.  You can also create one character or upgrade an existing character to level 85.  If you want more automatic level 85's, you'll need to pay for those.\n\nSince I've only soloed during this free-to-play era, I will say the combat is functional, but obviously dated.   The housing system is just as good as when it was pay-to-play.  All ground-mounts are now 120% runspeed and you'll get a basic horse mount around level 15-20.  Harvesting components for crafting is easier now as you can now harvest anything you want and the only reason to skill it up is so you can have a chance at harvesting a rare component.\n\n\nSo what's the reason I don't recommend this game?  Hardware performance.  It's just as bad as it's ever been and better hardware will barely make a difference at all.  This game is very much CPU intensive as it's engine was originally built with single-core CPU's in mind and was created with the belief that CPU's would just become faster and faster as time went on.\n\nOver the years, they've added multi-core support (a very poorly implemented 2 core utilization only) and GPU shadows (that were never fully optimized in my opinion).\n\nWhile I would recommend it to those who played it years back and want to do some soloing down memory lane, I can not recommend this to anyone new to the game.\n\n\n\n\n","February 4, 2014","false","45.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

If it were a real life drug then it would be cocaine mixed with a climax. I started my addiction with EQ back in 1998. I try to get off of it, I really do. But the game is too alluring for me... it always pulls me back in. I always want more, regardless of how crappy the newest expansion may seem or if the population slowly withers. My Steam hours are not my only logged hours on this game. I have been playing on and off since launch, and can guarantee my overall play time is well over 2,000 hours when the game was stand alone.\n\nThis is the best time to play if you're wanting to try out a new MMO. As of mid-to-late 2015, they released a progression server for this game. What is that you might ask? Well, they made the game classic again, with no expansions added to the server unless the entire community agrees to add the next one in. How amazing is that?! You get to play the game like it just came out, and get to experience everything fresh with everybody else. Classic EQ2 was unforgiving as ♥♥♥♥, and I encourage that. Give it a try if you like being addicted to things.","February 17","true","231.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","2"

Player economy\nSo This is a big one that counts in MMORPGs to me, The fact you can make money on here simplily by selling stuff from exploreing or just crafting objects to sell for people that need them Instead of just going quest to quest you can make money by selling junk,loot,craftable objects and ect, It just puts a more realistic and fun way to enjoy a mmorpg\n\n2. True meaning of freedom\nSo here i will name some games that defy this title (SWTOR,WOW) In these games you are given missions to level on all classes, That is a main objective pretty much, With this mmorpg, you will be either in combat,Exploreing,Crafting,Fishing,harvesting or just sitting around in a guild hall chatting to people, There is too much to do in this game which will keep you gaming forever, This game does not get stale\n\n3.Huge wonderful worlds\nThe maps on this game are one of the biggest in my opinion, you can buy a house to set up your operations in almost every main city and enjoy the artwork put into this game, Although its dated its still very enjoyable\n\nSo in my opinion, and if your looking for a game that will keep your entertained for a long time, then EQ2 is for you, I recommend it for a try atleast","April 11","true","51.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game has a lot of Love for those of us that played the first EQ, but it is also just a darn good game for those that did not play EQ1.\nWith a very large list of classes and races to play, as well as an excellent trade-skill class system that is rare in MMOs, it has great diversity of play. The old "something for everyone" saying truly stands the test in EQ2. Combine that with an amazing plethora of amazing locations and interesting monsters to play in and against and you arrive at a very enjoyable MMO experience.","December 9, 2011","true","713.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyneFan/recommended/201230/","UndyneFan","☾Zombie † Queen☽","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyneFan/","107 products in account","TL;DR- It's a dated game with a lot of content and a style all it's own.  Absolutely worth a try.\n\nI've loved this game for years but had a lot of trouble really getting into it.  It's a lot easier to solo for most classes now and they have made a lot of things easier like skills and such (possibly too easy honestly) but personally I think the game is still a lot of fun even with the funky looking graphics.  EQII has always had a look all it's own and I have always liked it for that fact first and foremost.  Any game can repeat other games (and let's face it, most MMOs do just that now) or try to wow you with lame "super awesome new combat!" gimmicks but personally I think this is a huge deal for being a free to play game.  it's incredibly massive, probably too massive now with the player count.  You have tons of classes and races to choose from even allowing for neutral characters that can start on either side of the coin.  There are four different starting places but I feel letting go of the original ones (the two main cities for either side) rather then just upgrading the items and content; was a horribly lazy and stupid thing to do.  Maybe some players were tired of it but I liked the atmosphere with those two originally way more then any of the new ones.\n\nPersonally, I love the trade skills.  It isn't about buying some item to get a 100% chance of success in crafting, rather it takes time and patience often times making the crafting itself into a mini game that used to actually be lethal at higher levels.  I wish they hadn't made that part vanish either.\n\nMounts are for everyone all the time.  I really appreciate this.  This honestly is a huge game and being able to get a mount from one of the new starting areas was a good idea all in all.  They range from ordinary, cheap horses to flying disks, gliding rodents and leaping lizzards.  Every type of fascinating mount thought of is used in the game and fits in very well with the art and style in my opinion.\n\nAnd speaking of art and style, the fact that players themselves can craft items such as house furniture, cosmetic outfits and weapons is a really awesome part that I am glad they introduced.  Seeing the different things people are capable of making is extraordinary and fun to me.  Along with the face cam that I don't usually use but it produces more laughable results then anything.  Making your character make a huge "O" face is something hilarious to me but the technology is there and it's very fun to use if you have a good enough camera.\n\nIt's not a Pay-2-Win game in my opinion, as things pretty much stay cosmetic or help with adventuring, crafting experience, etc.  You are able to play this game just fine without pulling out your wallet every few seconds.  I want to get a monthly sub just because I want a monthly sub, not because I feel it is needed in order to gain more access to the game or any of the content within.  That is a big plus to me personally.\n\n","February 13, 2014","true","274.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to say the play is still very engaging and fun. The graphics are a bit dated..but I am not that concerned if the game can grab my attention and stay fun. Also this is one of the few games, out there, that can accomodate my close group of friends in a single group. We normally have 6 players, and most games limit you to 4 (maybe 5) person teams.  EQ2 supports 6 - for us this is a BIG bonus.\n\nI was leary of SOEs implementaion of free-to-play (f2p), having been irritated by many titles being f2p (free to PAY AND OFTEN) instead of f2p (free to play). Sony has this one set (imho) perfectly.  I have run into very little restrictions (text chat in game is frustratingly gimped for f2p, but after dealing with the foul-mouth trolls that commonly make the chat useless, I FULLY approve!)\n\nI do understand that at the highest tier (I mean 80+ level here) there is money involved if you are f2p, and I am absolutely OK with that.  If I have played on their servers, over their network, and enjoyed their hard work for that long, then they damn good-and-well deserve something from me in return.\n\nThere are also two races, and classes that you pay to have access to, that is OK too. These are mostly cosmetic and have a fun idea behind them. There are still so many free choices that if I decide I want to play one of those other races or classes I can (again) pay for them and not feel I am having my credit card ransomed. Fianlly you will get pop-ups when you log in for things to purchase, and another shortly to take advantage of the Sony All Access. Again this is a minor annoyance and easily closed. (Also at $10 a month for subscription access to most SOE titles and more coming online it sure beats $15 a month for most paid MMOs)","March 6, 2015","true","93.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I was a player of the original EQ, right from the start of the vanilla days and through at least two of the expansions. I've played other MMOs since then, and coming back to Norrath after all this time is a bit of a trip through memory lane. It's held up amazingly well, considering what it's up against in terms of competition, and F2P till 90 is pretty damn good considering so far I haven't run out of things to keep me occupied and interested. The learning curve varies a bit... I'm still figuring out how the AA system works and crafting has taken a bit of banging my proverbial and pixel head into the wall a few times, but the fiance and I are having a terrible lot of fun running around doing quests and tag teaming groups of mobs together, and that's what counts!\n\nWould definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of variety in their MMO. There are a LOT of race and class combinations to choose from, several different starter zones, and a lot of options for how to play the game. You can solo for a pretty long time if you so choose, hire a mercenary to accompany you for tougher zones, or just spend hours gathering and crafting for your house. I just wish there were more RP servers in Europe. I'd love to see what the RP community in this game is like.","June 18, 2015","true","201.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Played it since it came out and sadly had to take a break from it due to school and just not having the time anymore. One of the top Multiplayer games out there right up there with WoW (EQ2 is better). Best raiding experience any game has to offer hands down imo, PvP is a blast at max level, the lore in the game is amazing and still after 11 years it still intrigues me. Community in and out of the game is very strong and even with Everquest Next in the works the Devs still keep the game up to date and listen to the community. Even if you are not the most social person and want to get involved in guilds and raids this is a great solo game too. Easily reach max level all by yourself without any help.\n\nIf anything download the game and give it a try. Its F2P and a easy game to learn and get into. Also i may not have time played on steam but trust me ive spent way too many years on this game.\n\nHeres my profile so you know im not lying. Main character with 169d on it.\nhttp://u.eq2wire.com/soe/character_detail/884765510222","January 4, 2015","true","19.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I recently discovered it on Steam (i prefer having all my games in 1 place, and steam lets me do that)   I have paid the subscription fee, and played as F2P ... and in either case i truly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe World is huge, with many ways to level your character to end game, as opposed to other games that take a more linear approach.  I currently have 4 end-game chars (85+) and several crafters. This is one of the games i actually enjoy crafting in.\n\nThe Dungeons, instances, and raids are still fun after all these years.  Since launch i have made 20+ chars, and still play with them all. (not all at the same time, as that would be technically impossible lol)  No other game has gotten me to continuosly return nor grabbed my attention as heavily as this one ...

They are both extremely similar, with their own pros and cons evening out to make them both equal. At this point in time, though: WoW has a subcription fee, but also has more players, better support, better graphics, and Blizzard behind it. EQ2 has more classes, more races, is more complex, and is free with an optional paid service and a premium shop, but doesn't appear to be pay to win. Pay to have convenience perhaps, but not pay to win. For that reason alone, I'd highly suggest trying it out if you're a WoW fan, or if you're new to the MMO genre.

A very atmospheric and open world that you can feel free to explore, graphics that just add to the atmosphere, a great game to play with your friends (especially considering it's free!), and the only thing that i don't like about the game, is that you can't explore the world too much considering the monsters that exist limit your exploration abilities depending on what level your character is.

However this game has hit its climax a long while back and has been going downhill for a while simply because nobody plays it anymore. Pretty much all of the servers are scarcely populated and so PVP servers aren't really PVP anymore. This game is really good, it is, way better than ♥♥♥♥ MMOs like WOW (I tried playing it), sadly Sony hasn't really ever marketed their games that well and fantastic games like this one have just faded away.

The very first WoW I have played in my life. It's relaxing and I find the world more atmospheric and explorable than that of WoW! Leveling up feels good, and learning new powers and attack/abilities feels just as good. I would reccommend this game hands down! A very atmospheric and open world that you can feel free to explore, graphics that just add to the atmosphere, a great game to play with your friends (especially considering it's free!), and the only thing that i don't like about the game, is that you can't explore the world too much considering the monsters that exist limit your exploration abilities depending on what level your character is. But other than that.... Play this game! You've got nothing to lose, it's FREE.

Mail is still locked to paid members and the Broker is buy only. other than that the game is good but we need more players on Nagafen (PVP) server and less on Antonia Bayle (RP), there is a tun of content all arround the world. Big thing is the sheer load of content open to the public with a mature community that you will not find in games like Wildstar, WoW, FFXIV, and alot of other games.","January 7, 2015","true","291.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However this game has hit its climax a long while back and has been going downhill for a while simply because nobody plays it anymore. Pretty much all of the servers are scarcely populated and so PVP servers aren't really PVP anymore. This game is really good, it is, way better than ♥♥♥♥ MMOs like WOW (I tried playing it), sadly Sony hasn't really ever marketed their games that well and fantastic games like this one have just faded away. I recommend this game because it is good, but unless you're really into the franchise I advise you to look elsewhere because this Massively Multiplayer Game is no longer "Massive".","December 30, 2014","true","24.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/recommended/201230/","Sevandres","Sevandres","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/","164 products in account","EverQuest II\nEverQuest 2 is an MMORPG that has come free to play on Steam in December of 2011. Originally it was a subscription based MMO that released in November of 2004. Before it came onto Steam, you could get a very limited access, free to play account. Now that it's on Steam, the limitations have mostly been lifted.\n\nWith 21 races and a whopping 26 classes to choose from, you can be just about anything! Well not with out a little bit of effort. There are Good races and Good classes that require a good race, and the same goes for Evil races and Evil classes. Additionally there are neutral races that can pick any of the classes. But what if you want to be an evil race with a good class? Through the process of a lengthy and repititious quest chain (Which can be started once you hit level 10), you can turn your Ogre Shadowknight to an Ogre Paladin!\n\nWith your Ogre Paladin at your command, you are ready to start adventuring! Don't worry, you can further customize your Paladin with the use of Alternate Advancement (AA)! You have, quite literally, hundreds of AAs to choose from to enhance and shape the way your Paladin plays. What's the catch? In order to get these points, you have to fill an AA experience bar, which siphons regular experience from your character as you kill monsters and complete quests. With the free to play account, you're left having to put 50% of your experience gained to the AA points, which will really slow you down and put you behind other leveling zones. In order to remove this restriction, you have to pay the monthly subscrition fee.\n\nDon't want to pay? Well don't worry, you have plenty of areas to level in! There are plenty of quests to do, along with shiny collectable objects lying on the ground for you to acquire and complete collections, which can then be turned in as mini quests. Additionally you can also group up with other people and tackle dungeons to acquire loot and experience, in the typical MMO fassion.\n\nIf adventuring is not your thing, you can take up a profession, or tradeskill! You have 11 to choose from, from Weaponsmith to Alchemist, Tinkerer and Carpenter. Carpentry? Yes, it's a thing. Carpentry is used to make furniture for your very own house or guild hall in game!\n\nHow is the customer service? Amazing. For the longest time I had shared an account with my Father, and eventually I had several high level characters. Recently he had pushed me to get my own account. I agreed, but I didn't want to sacrifice my characters. So I contacted customer support and of course, for a fee, I was able to get my characters transfered within a day of submitting in a ticket. I was incredibly happy with the customer support from SOE, as they were very kind and understanding.\n\nEverQuest 2 is everything you might expect out of an MMORPG, but with the free to play version, there are a few things I wish they would lighten up on, mainly the Alternative Advancement slider. That's really the biggest turn off from this game for not just myself, but many others as well. It reminds me of a pay-to-win model which is nothing anyone enjoys. You could also argue that it encourages you to go to different zones to quest to get up to level, and it is easy enough to get to one of the zones in question within 5 or 10 minutes, but not everyone wants to leave a quest chain in the middle of it to go half way across the virtual world to level up a little before coming back.\n\nOne more thing to mention is that not all of the races and classes are available to play with out paying for them. Out of the 21 races, 19 of them are playable for free. Out of the 26 classes, 24 of them are playable. This really doesn't sound too bad but it is $20 dollars per race*, and $25 dollars per class.\n\nIf you don't want to start off with a level 1 character, you can spend $35 dollars on a level 90 character with 320 AA points, equipped powerful gear. Once again the pay-to-win model comes to mind.\n\nIs this game any good? For the amount of content and what you can get out of this game as is, it is definitely worth it. The AA slider issue is something you can work around and can be a blessing. Where some are higher level than you, you may be just as powerful because you have more AAs. Additionally it encourages you to check out other zones. You can be just about anything, you can do just about anything, and yet it all cost next to nothing. Why not give it a try?\n\n*Some races come with extra bundles that costs an extra sum of money.","January 11, 2015","true","72.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If it wasn't for TLS servers, this game would still be thumbs down for zero gameplay challenge, but i changed it because of TLS.","February 11","true","123.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Many, many moons ago I played EQ 1 and it was awesome.  Addictive, unique, and always changing.  EQ 2 is a pretty fun game too, enough that I thought I wanted to become a member.  But that's why I had to stop playing.\n\nMembership is the standard $15 a month, but it is missing huge pieces of content.  Classes, expansions, game options.  Ok, no problem.  Most games you need to buy the latest expansion to get the great stuff right?  I looked at the expansions.  But after playing for a while, hitting the message boards, and reading various tips and guides I relaized that even if you get the $15 membership, then the $50-80-$130 expansion, you STILL DON"T HAVE THE WHOLE GAME.  Crazy right?  No, you have to buy a couple new races.  Buy a couple new classes.  Oh, and buy mercenary access.\n\nYou won't find any explaination of the mercenary stuff easily.  It takes digging and asking questions in game.  But to really give you the idea of the money bleed of this game: The special edition $80ish expansion comes with a very nice mercenary.  BUT NOT THE MERCENARY ACCESS.  I would say they nickle and dime you, but they don't.  They $15 and $25 you, because nothing costs less than that except for the silly appearence stuff.\n\nFinally, the items you buy and the access you get really do affect your gameplay.  There are entire sections of character development that can't be accessed without an extra $20, 30, or 40 on top of everthing else.  It's just not worth it.\n\nI hope this gave some other folks a little more information that I had to dig and research pretty hard to find.","January 30","false","13.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Most people have at least heard if not played the Everquest games. By far the ORIGINAL Everquest as played by "Project 99" is the best and most fun due to challenge and gameplay,but not graphics. Everquest 2 attempts to upgrade the graphics and mechanics,but in so doing they ruined the original feel of the game. This is 'cute" looking (like WOW),but can't even compare to it.

I've been playing this game for a few years (though my Steam account would say otherwise xD) and have come to love this game very much in doing so. It is a very large game, with tons of other players. You get a set list of servers to play on, and you do get a limit to how many characters you can have on your account.\n\n\nCharacter creation&Basic Character Stuff:\nThere is a vast horizon of options to choose from for your character's appearance. I have always found anything besides character height, race, and head/face options a bit unnecessary, since most of the time your armor (appearance and/or actual equipment) will cover it. But, it's still fun to give your character that tattoo that nobody will see, right? ;)\n\nNames are also an interesting thing in this game, because once you reach a certain level, you can give your character a last name. I can't list too many games off the top of my head that will let you give your character a last name. There are also two different equipment tabs. One of them is the equpiment that you wear for the item bonuses such as stat boosters and whatnot. If you don't have any appearance equipment, the other equipment tab, then this is the gear you'll see. Appearance equipment is also another interesting aspect of this game; tons of players with different combinations of equipment in their appearance slots mean it's hard to find two players that look the same.\n\nMounts are another wonderful aspect of this game. With tons of different mounts, there really is almost no limit to going places.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay of this game is rather simple, in all reality. You get a ton of spells that you use, and the amount increases with progression through the game, and go into hotbars. A majority of combat in this game is, in most cases, just clicking of the icons in your hotbar. The animations for your spells aren't too impressive in themselves, unless your graphics are cranked up, however, don't let this deter you.\n\nThe story for each character class is fairly different, being that in the end, each character begins on a story to get their epic weapon, the weapon for each class that will become their signature (though often, becomes replaced in-game due to stats not being impressive enough) weapon of choice. Each expansion adds to the story, too, that goes beyond your epic weapon. Even if you aren't paying attention to the stories you get into in too great detail, this game is just fun to play.","July 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Lagging is normal, and you can actually see objects pop up while your harddrive is working like crazy to load it all. I have played EQ2 sice launch, and quit a couple of years ago when i found out they where increasing the monthly payment. greed, something you better get used to if your going to play this old game.\n\nCons:\n-Price. greed greed greed. Montly payment isnt worth it. Can buy several new games for that price.\n-50% less xp for free to play accounts. Thats right, you have to double up the grind to level.\n-50% less tokens for free to play accounts.\n-Horrible old engine, loads slow, laggs and dosnt support new hardware\n-Free to play accounts are not allowed to sell items on broker. If you want to sell anything there, you have to buy "broker  points". For real money. (can still sell items in trade chat-channels)\n-Free to play accounts cant send mails\n-Player base is dieing (wonder if it has anything to do with greed?)\n-If you start from the beginning with free account, then maybe you will be max level in 10years. maybe..\n-Free accounts cant use etheral items (best gear in game)\n-Free accounts cant use grandmaster spells/skills.\n-Free accounts get pop-ups in game, also get a pop-up when closing game. (telling you to buy gold account)\n\nPros:\n-Content, if you start from the beginning theres alot of stuff to do. You will never run out of quests.\n-Crafting. Probably the most advanced crafting system ive ever seen. Simple but very functional.\n-Veteran xp, you get at max level(current lvl100), for free accounts thats 20% xp, for gold accounts thats 100% xp\n\nIf your considering playing this game from level 1-100 on free account, forget it.\nOnly way to go now is gold account, if your rich and can pay monthly fee. If you live in EU then be prepared to pay more then US for monthly fee. (around 10-20% more)\n\nmy advice is to avoid this game, and find a new game that can actually run without laggfest and monthly fees.\n\n","December 12, 2015","false","124.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I had heard such good things about this game.  I know it was one of the pioneers of the MMO genre, but it seems to have gotten stuck in the past.  I would still probably recommend it for introducing kids to online gaming.  Simple enough to learn, but complex enough to hold their attention.\n\nFor myself, I'm looking for something more.  The run of the mill, click click MMO's have grown stale and boring.  Every new game just rehashes the same old game mechanics, seemingly only being a platform to drain money from the playerbase.  These games are nothing more than high end slot machines and the gaming companies are more like online casinos now.\n\nSomebody needs to step up and take it to a new level.  The software exists.  There are many single player games which have already pushed the boundaries, so it just takes some commmitment to making a quality product instead of a money pit.  I thought Bethesda would be that company, but TESO was just more of the same ol same ol.

You have to have a gold account (costs money) to have any moves that have any real impact (masters) or any of the better gear. Ontop of that, even if you DO have a gold account you still have to pay for trivial things that boost the hell out of your combat abilities like Mercenaries, or Reforging. This would be okay if anybody had to put any REAL effort into making either of these two things, but plainly it is no big change and took no effort to create but it impacts combat entirely and Sony wants good money for it so if you are hoping to PVP without spending money or even without spending money on gold, you have just signed up to be cannon fodder. If you want to see what the game is like before you spend money, downloading it is alright - but not for any other reason - this is NOT free to play. Also - just a personal assumption so don't take this as absolute - the way things are running it really feels like Sony is just trying to squeeze money out of this game before Everquest Next comes out and have no intention of making anything better.","January 16, 2014","false","219.4"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

I have no nostalgia coming into this game.  I never played Everquest when it was popular, as I was way more into consoles at that time.  I did get a chance to play Champions of Norrath 1 & 2 (probably still two of my favorite hack & slashers) on PS2.  Lately, I've been playing a lot of free-to-play MMORPGs and this was on my list of things to try out.\n\nI couldn't even make it past the first beach with the crabs.  Combat is clunkier than every title I've played in this genre so far.  I wasn't even sure if I was hitting the crab and who was winning.  The health bars all kept disappearing behind terrain and some fantastic glitches, my swings were choppy and there was no noise to signify connecting, and (without lag, trust me) combat moved so slow that combined with those horrible controls I have to rate this experience as painful.  I have no comment on the epic tiered equipment as I have no desire to get to level 2.\n\nIf you've never played before, pick up a different MMORPG.  There have to be at least 5 in the fantasy genre on Steam, and you'd be doing yourself a favor not starting with this title.\n\nI don't need to recommend this if you've played it before and enjoyed it, so if that's you, keep enjoying it.  This was a top game at one point, and there is a reason for that.  I just don't think it's as fun as some of the other free-to-plays on Steam right now.","January 29, 2014","false","0.6"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","11","28","0","0"

There's like 15 races and 20 classes or something like that. To me that's a downside, I dislike when a game puts limitations on you before the game starts. I highly prefer games where you make no class choices at all, but rather your 'class' is somehow determined by your own choices during the gameplay.\n\nAnyway, after the excessive choices pre-game, you're thrown into the same thing that you're thrown into in any other MMO: kill monsters to levelup, move to the next area, rinse and repeat. Quests are just that; kill monsters, collect items from monsters, walk back and forth from NPC to another clicking through uninteresting dialogue. Receive new generic items, sell old ones.\n\nGraphics are not very interesting either, everything is large scaled so the world looks vast in scale, but this just equates to a bland unmemorable landscape and more walking in the end. Houses seem to be copy pasted quite a bit, every single door looks the same and you'll run into buildings that are a carbon copy of another building. I suppose that happens when you try to make the world too big.\n\nI should disclose though, that I'm not interested of endgame content and therefore did not look into it. I play MMOs for the journey, not for the goal.\n\nOn a technical note, opening the game resets my monitor calibrations, and closing the game restarts all my tabs on firefox. Really bizzare and obnoxious behavior.","April 5, 2015","false","3.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

I don't want no excuses that this game is unoptimized to run on multiple cores blah blah blah. I've heard that so many times. Guild Wars 2 is also unoptimized to run on multiple cores and has little to no multi-core support but yet that game runs better than this and it looks better. That's two advantages right there and a big reason to chose that game over this one. You may think I'm lying and that I just want to talk bad about this game, I don't I was actually suprised when making a character the sheer amount of variaty and options to choose from, so many classes and races that I just thought to myself, WOW but the performance is just not up to scratch. This is a game from 2004, I should never expect the amount of frame rate drops that I have had, my frame rate dropped as much as 80-90% just by turning the camera around. Completly unnaceptable. Word is that the developers won't bother to even optimize the engine for newer computers because its an old engine. Their loss!\n\nIf you're looking for the evidance to show that this is how my performance really was then here's the video, go ahead and check it out and see for yourself the major stuttering and fps drops: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLz74fdBpls","January 11, 2014","false","2.5"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","24","0","0"

To play, you need to get a (free) account with SOE. Chances are, however, that when you then try to log in, you'll get a 'Wrong Username or Password' error.\nTheoretically you'd then submit a support ticket, but to do that you need to log in to their website—which is exactly what you can't do because of the aforementioned error message. SOE's suggestion on their website: create a temporary second account and use that to contact Support. Guess what: you get the same error, so you still can't file a support ticket. Same thing with a third account and the fourth account (for which I pretended to live in the US, in case it might help).\nSOE Support doesn't have an email address, but if you can't log in, you can either contact them by phone (which adds up quickly if you have to call from abroad), or contact them through Twitter (@SOEHelp). Unfortunately, the help they provide through Twitter is limited to 'contact us through our website.' Yeah, very helpful if being unable to log in is why you try to contact them in the first place.\nI've spent almost two weeks trying to get some actual help from SOE Support.

This game is great.  The housing system is actually the best one I've seen in any game - so far, EverQuestNext looks as though it's going to have an even more amazing system.  Questing is fun, but pretty repetitious and remains so for quite a while.  Not sure if it's a low level thing, but it's a barren wasteland of very few players.  I would assume it's just level related, since the server I'm on always has a "heavy" load.\n\nJust an all around decent F2P MMORPG - check it out.

Here goes.\n\nI may have played this game for 2 hours in all, butthat was because my computer crapped out on me and i had to put it in the shop.\n\nAFter two weeks, it came back to me, completely wiped to factory specs because of a nasty virus.\n\nTwo hours of gameplay, however, is enough to me to recommend this game.\n\nThe character customization itself is enough to keep me occupied for 45 minutes or so, as there are a large number of races that include the "average" fantasy races like dwarves, wood elves, dark elves, and even two different kinds of fae (we'll get into that in a moment), but there are also unique and interesting creatures like the Frogloks (good aligned frog people), Ratonga (Rat folk the size of dwarves) and two different species of lizardfolk.\n\nAlso, this game gives you the option between good and evil. there are a surprising amount of evil aligned classes (and good, too, for you light siders out there) and the choice of alignment changes starting areas and such.\n\nThe deity you decide to worship (much like neverwinter) will give you buffs and items. UNLIKE neverwinter, the deity you worship actually matters in the game. Depending on the amount of of worshippers, the god or goddess can materiallize in the world as an Avatar, giving server wide buffs to worshippers and offering quests.\n\nAnd if you're like me, you will want to spend thousands of hours playing this game purely because of collectables. Artifacts and books (much like Rift) are scattered everywhere, and they seem much more common in this game than in Rift. I can't really walk 40 feet ithout finding something interesting, whether that's an artifact, wierd enemy, or absolutely beautiful view.\n\nThis game is VERY pretty, in my opinion. I have it on lowest settings because of preference (I want performance, not quality) but I've seen some things in my TWO whole hours that make me think "Wow."\n\nThe good starter area, for instance, is on an icy continent/island/archipelago thing, and the ocean is VERY deep. I was a froglok, so i could breathe underwater, and i stopped before finding the bottom because i kind of wanted to play instead of swim downward for a lifetime.\n\nDefinately give it a try, better than WOW in my opinion, mostly because they don't try as hard to suck every penny out of you.\n\nYes, there is a cash shop, but you can definitely play without spending a dime. I know, i looked around in it.","July 16, 2014","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When everquest 2 extended came out I downloaded it too but never ended up really playing it as I just couldnt get into it.\nFinally I decided to play it again now that it was Free to Play. Fist I downloaded the standalone client and played for quite sometime and began enjoying the what I was able to do in this game and what the future had in store for this game. When I noticed it was on steam I reinstalled it on here and Iv been playing non stop eversince.\nOne of the huge perks I found as I was playing was I had recieved tons of free ingame goods such as housing items, 500 Station Cash I didnt know I had and tons and tons of other bonuses I had recieved from purchasing and registering the game back on 08. This really had me sucked in now as even though most of the goods were not entirly powerful or usful for adventuring it really gave me a glimps of what I could do in the game. Especially with housing.\n\nGraphics:\nThis is obviously a game that is getting up in age and the graphics do show in this way, however it seems like this was the perfect time for graphics engines because a lot of these games still look really good. Its not all blocky and cluncky like a ps1 game or everquest one but its smooth and has really nice looking landscapes, armor sets ect. It all just rolls out to look so good for its age. There are tons of settings that you can dink with to make it look as good good as you need it and its garenteed youll probably be able to find what looks best for you depending on your pc spec.\n\nIn some of the main hub towns, especially freeport, the frames dropped crazy low. Im not sure if its a server issue or my internet. Its not so laggy that its unplayable by any means especially due to the fact that main cities are more or less used for grabbing quest, crafting, trading which means you wont need as many frames anyways to do these smaller faster taskes.\n\nGameplay:\nIv sunk so much time into this game so fast too. I dont think iv been able to dedicate myself to an mmo from the start as quick as I did with this game; despite me not giving it the chance in the first place. Im still not even at the level cap of 95... Wait I read they raised it to 100 hahaha. Thats pretty awesome in itself to me because it means i still have a ton of content to buzz through plus the latest expansion pack. So far as of this review Im level 54 and I dont even really feel the game is a grind. It just leaves me wanting to play more.\nThe questing type for the most part is standard kill so and so or get me this many of this thing but it does thow in some quests where unique items are given to you and that item is used to summon a boss for instance or special goggles to help you find clues. Even though it has so many of the standard quests I actually prefer them over the other quests wheree the special items are required. There usually less tetius and go quicker and this results in faster xp and gold and sick ♥♥♥ quest item rewards. This being said I still love the bit of variety it does have and it keeps me wanting more.\nThis game has made me fall in love with running dungeons. In the Guildwars games dungeons were always pretty fun with friends or a good group but they generally require you to wait around for a group or use there sick ♥♥♥ dungeon finder to get a group together. This is all well and sweet and pretty flawless for guildwars 2 but I like how I can freely run a dungeon alone or with a group here in everquest 2. It just depends on your level and ability. Theres the flipside to that. You can also run the dungeons with people when your at a lower level or whatever so that option is obviously still there I guess the problem with it is though, is finding a group of people around who want to help you and not just clear the whole place out a few seconds before you. I tuely feel that there dungeon matchmaking needs to be improved because I find it confusing as ♥♥♥♥ or not very functional at the time. It would be amazing if they incorperated a mega server type idea like Guildwars 2 as that solution in my opinion is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. I swear if Everquest 2 and Guildwars 2 had some awesome ♥♥♥ sex, that would be my dream game born.\nThe game is free to play and is probably one of the most honest free to play games I looked into for the most part. Although most f2p models are coming around. It never forces you to purchase anything and you honestly have little of a need to spend a dime. I however got sucked in a bit but paying to research some skills faster or upgrade them to the Master Tier. I also bought some cool white armor skins which you obvously dont need. Iv also spent some station cash for instant repairs of my armor because I didnt feel like traveling back to town but repair men are all over and not to hard to find for the most part. I also sub'd last month and this month so I could adjust my alternate experience slider to give me more adventure xp for a few months but this was just something I wanted to test and it is a nice added feature but the free 50 percent option is still more the viable and works behind the scenes so you dont even need to think about it. Being at 50 percent Adventure experince also didnt feel like a grind when I was playing free, it just felt standard and A nice shinny option that was there if I ever chose to pay to use it.\nMy best purchase so far though that most people may want to concider adding is the Mercinaries pack which allows you to hire an AI companion that helps you in battle. Not only does it make leveling a little faster before level 50 it also makes it alot faster and combat will be alot easier with a merc, escpecally when when fighting mobs of heroic characters. I chose to purchase this extra fairly early on in the game with my real world cash as the higher the level you are in the game the more ingame gold he will cost to hire. Buying this pack also allows you to summon tour merc no matter where you are. I dont use him a ton unless im running a dungeon alone so he is not to pricey for my in game budget but it is something that I sort of felt like I was missing before I purchased the addon. This just might be me though. Playing the game without a merc is entirely doable you just might need to find a buddy instead and be a little social or if you have the addon find some buddies and bring mercs too. ♥♥♥♥ will hit the roof im assuming.\nI guess I was a little slow in the head because I didnt find the storyline quests in my log until my early 20s I think. Man I was jacked when I found these though. They gave me more to shoot for. A reason to play and read these quests. I was having a ton of fun just running sidequests and getting the rewards and when I found the storyline quests and they even better loot they offered I got pulled in more and it gave me all new reason to keep playing. One of the story missions game me a Raptor like mount for a reward. I was pretty pumped about that even though I already bought a horse. The raptor was slow though and had the ability to almost jump and glide. The gliding was cool but I was like ♥♥♥♥ this things way to slow so i never used it. Now however im in higher level areas which require more climbing or going around mountains. While I swapped to my raptor and there was no more going around big long hills I could now set my tracker to where the mobs were and jump right over the big cliffs until I got there. Its been saving me a ton of time. Now im just in the middle of the content and im still having a ton of fun.\nDaily achievments are also pretty fun and quite easy to get. Completing 2 will give you loyalty tokens that you actually want to spend. Now I have 33 token and im saving up for a wild ♥♥♥♥ing mansion for 65 or something. Its worth it and easy to collect.

No it's not WoW, but I see that as a good thing. WoW is a monolith of it's own and deserves a notable step forward in online gaming for the time it was released.  Everquest 2 is geared to a more mature/higher attention span audience.   You won't level from 1 to 92 in a couple weeks, but the leveling can be fun if you mix your play types just right. There is so much content that has been added to this game over it's going-on 8 year run. The graphics still look very nice, and there is a great community to be tapped into (although some of the community has been diluted since free to play).

I have played Since 2004 - Everquest I and II. Since Everquest II came out around the same time another big MMO name came out, they seemed alot like the same game. But the changes and the hard work that the developers have put into it, listening to players; allowed the game to evolve. The game has become easier to use while still a challenge to play. I am very excited that they decided to go Free-to-Play, it allow us to play it and taste the game before deciding to dedicate ourselves.\nThe key elements that I love about this game is the storyline and the combat system. The monsters and bosses in the game "learn" as you fight it , making it harder and harder as time passes. The story and the system make it so realistic and enjoyable no matter what you are doing. You dont only have to fight monsters to enjoy the game either, theres an entire other side to the gameplay. Which involves crafting; creating items for housing and for characters to use. You can specialize in armour making or even just making wood crafted furniture for housing. It has a simular leveling system and somewhat of a mini game to each attempt to making this product.\nI enjoy the creativity, I enjoy the flexibility, and I enjoy the friendly community.\nWith the constant acceptance of feedback to the GM's and the staff, both players and the employees at SOE create a wonderful game that anyone can enjoy.","March 7, 2014","true","70.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No it's not WoW, but I see that as a good thing. WoW is a monolith of it's own and deserves a notable step forward in online gaming for the time it was released.  Everquest 2 is geared to a more mature/higher attention span audience.   You won't level from 1 to 92 in a couple weeks, but the leveling can be fun if you mix your play types just right. There is so much content that has been added to this game over it's going-on 8 year run. The graphics still look very nice, and there is a great community to be tapped into (although some of the community has been diluted since free to play). But due to the fact that it is now free to play, and you don't have to spend $250+ just on expansions like I've done as they came out, give this game a go!! There is much to be enjoyed here.","July 12, 2012","true","226.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here goes.\n\nI may have played this game for 2 hours in all, butthat was because my computer crapped out on me and i had to put it in the shop.\n\nAFter two weeks, it came back to me, completely wiped to factory specs because of a nasty virus.\n\nTwo hours of gameplay, however, is enough to me to recommend this game.\n\nThe character customization itself is enough to keep me occupied for 45 minutes or so, as there are a large number of races that include the "average" fantasy races like dwarves, wood elves, dark elves, and even two different kinds of fae (we'll get into that in a moment), but there are also unique and interesting creatures like the Frogloks (good aligned frog people), Ratonga (Rat folk the size of dwarves) and two different species of lizardfolk.\n\nAlso, this game gives you the option between good and evil. there are a surprising amount of evil aligned classes (and good, too, for you light siders out there) and the choice of alignment changes starting areas and such.\n\nThe deity you decide to worship (much like neverwinter) will give you buffs and items. UNLIKE neverwinter, the deity you worship actually matters in the game. Depending on the amount of of worshippers, the god or goddess can materiallize in the world as an Avatar, giving server wide buffs to worshippers and offering quests.\n\nAnd if you're like me, you will want to spend thousands of hours playing this game purely because of collectables. Artifacts and books (much like Rift) are scattered everywhere, and they seem much more common in this game than in Rift. I can't really walk 40 feet ithout finding something interesting, whether that's an artifact, wierd enemy, or absolutely beautiful view.\n\nThis game is VERY pretty, in my opinion. I have it on lowest settings because of preference (I want performance, not quality) but I've seen some things in my TWO whole hours that make me think "Wow."\n\nThe good starter area, for instance, is on an icy continent/island/archipelago thing, and the ocean is VERY deep. I was a froglok, so i could breathe underwater, and i stopped before finding the bottom because i kind of wanted to play instead of swim downward for a lifetime.\n\nDefinately give it a try, better than WOW in my opinion, mostly because they don't try as hard to suck every penny out of you.\n\nYes, there is a cash shop, but you can definitely play without spending a dime. I know, i looked around in it.","July 16, 2014","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracohandsome/recommended/201230/","dracohandsome","DracoHandsome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracohandsome/","206 products in account","My referral link (can use existing account if you haven't played for 6 months): {LINK REMOVED}http://alturl.com/t74og\n\nEverquest II is an open-world MMORPG whose basic controls are similar to World of Warcraft, but whose integral mechanics and interface are quite different (and really, dramatically superior.)\n\nAs an SOE game, Everquest II shares its Station Cash currency with all other SOE games: Everquest 1, DC Universe Online, PlanetSide 2, and even Free Realms. Because of this, taking advantage of SC-related offers in one game is redeemable in any other game.\n\n\n\nLORE AND SETTING\n\nEverquest II takes place in a low-mid-fantasy world. Although it has fairies and lizard people and other stuff, they are portrayed relatively realistically. Early locations in particular are quite grounded and not really all that fantastic or colorful.\n\nFortunately, Everquest II doesn't take its seemingly-serious setting very seriously, especially compared to WoW, and much of the setting is self-deprecating (try learning Faerlie.) Despite that, it has a few rules in its lore that limit the player just a smidgen.\n\nFor instance, the playable classes are aligned good, neutral, or evil... as are the races. If you pick a "good" class, you can't pick an "evil" race, and vice versa; even though you can Betray your alignment and play as the opposite once you reach level 10. This is a bit of a bummer.\n\nOn the plus side, you will automatically start with knowledge of your race's language (in addition to "Common") and thus not have to do a quest to learn it.\n\n\n\nCOMBAT\n\nLike World of Warcraft, you have strafe and turn buttons, left-click turns the camera without turning you, and right-click turns the camera while turning you. You must target -before- using a skill and are subject to "implied target" (e.g. casting heal on an enemy will heal your friend being attacked by said enemy instead), two things I've never been fond of. However, you don't have to be facing an enemy at the time you choose to attack it - your character will just turn and face them before attacking.\n\nSome enemies are linked together in parties called encounters, and attacking one of them will cause -all- of them to retaliate. Encounters can get into the dozens for creatures like herd animals and raiders.\n\nYour character's "auto-attacks" are a bit slow, especially at the start of the game. Your primary means of sustained damage will therefore be skill spams. Although skills consume Power, it's very rare (at least in the early levels) to run out of it, as it isn't spent very quickly and it renegerates more rapidly when not in combat.\n\nThe game uses the logically questionable hate / threat system wherein you can force NPC enemies to only ever attack your tank despite any reasonable combatant knowing that your healer or mage would be better to take out first.\n\nDeveloping your character's combat abilities relies on several factors.\n\n- Ordinary experience gain and level, which will give you most of your skills and raise their Rank;\n- Character and Focus traits, earned on level multiples and giving you further boosts to certain skills or stats;\n- Alternate Advancement (Lv 10+), earned alongside of but separately to level and spent to obtain new skills and power up existing ones; and\n- Research (Lv 20+), allowing you to increase skill Mastery (separate from Rank but every bit as important.) You can research at any time but it will take hours to days to finish research.\n- Prestige (much higher than Lv. 20) is basically badder-♥♥♥ AA.\n\nYour account status determines how high you can raise your skill Masteries via Research.\n- Free accounts can only raise up to Adept (3rd level of mastery.)\n- Silver account (one-time $5.00 charge to keep permanently) can raise up to Expert (4th level of mastery.)\n- Gold account (subscription) can research up to Grandmaster (6th and final level of mastery.)\n\nYou don't have to have these account status to USE the skills at that mastery, or to acquire them through non-Research means - you just need that status to Research up to that level.\n\n\n\nMENTORING & CHRONOMAGE\n\nGot a friend to play? Already level 60 when your friend just started at level 1?\n\nNO PROBLEM.\n\nParty with them and you can temporarily lower yourself to match their level. Your skills and gear will power down too, but it will still be better than a natural of the target level.\n\nWhat's that? You want to go hunt low-level gear for Transmute but you're too high so they don't drop? And you don't have a friend of that level?\n\nNO PROBLEM.\n\nGo find the Chronomages in Qeynos and temporarily level down to any multiple of 5.\n\n\n\nCRAFTING\n\nOf all MMO's I have played, Everquest II plays second in its crafting system only to Vanguard. Like Vanguard, crafting level is separate from adventure level and the player participates in a small minigame to craft, but it isn't anywhere near as engaging or strategic - you merely craft in four-second increments and press one of your six skill buttons to counter problems. Unlike Vanguard, crafting of any kind is integrally tied to adventure, or else you won't be able to safely gather ingredients yourself. You will also more or less be unable to mastercraft.\n\nCrafting also benefits from its own separate Alternate Advancement, and with Chains of Eternity you can also get Crafting Prestige. However, these AA's are earned with crafting experience and not adventure experience.\n\n\n\nMOUNTS AND AESTHETIC\n\nGuess what? You can use mounts in combat. No worries!\n\nEverquest II is also smart enough to realize that costume items shouldn't give you any stats, so they don't.\n\nAnything you can put in an equipment slot that changes your appearance can be put in the equivalent appearance slot (including mounts.) The only drawback? You can't put "nothing" in your appearance slot unless you purchase the invisible costume items during a city festival (e.g. invisible gloves so your hands look bare.) However, you can toggle on and off your headgear, your cape, and your mount (Character window --> Options.)\n\nUpon reaching level 20, you can give your character a last name, which can be changed for free once a week. You can also change your prefix and / or suffix title whenever you want, assuming you've earned one.\n\n\n\nCLOSING\n\nEverquest II is a fine game by modern standards, though it has a few quirks I would change.\n\nRemember to Transmute all equipment you no longer need or else you will be gimped in Transmute until you can chronomage at level 20.","December 9, 2013","true","257.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sequel to Everquest 1, this game is a continuation of the mmorpg that basically birthed mmorpgs. This game gives you access to anything and all except for a few things. it even gives you all expansions packs except tears of veeshan for free. You have access to all the races except the Freeblood vampires. You also have access to all classes except the two new ones, included when purchasing tears of Veeshan. The priest class known as channeler, and the scout class known as beastlord. You are able to level all the way up to lvl 85 with no purchases, and then 86-95 with tears of Veeshan. In all i HIGHLY recommend this game to any and all people who would want to be apart of an amazing community and an amazing story to go through. 10/10 my friends. Download this game.\nAlright with the release of another expansion pack it's time to update my review again. Altar of Malice the new expansion pack features a new race, areas etc. The new race is called Areyrkn or something along those lines. They are part human part Draco. Huge dragon wings and horns sprouting this way and that from their head they are actually pretty cool. No new classes were added sadly but then again. This game has a ♥♥♥♥ ton already in it.

This is a great feature for where EQ2 is in its lifetime. It allows you to pay to get a level 90 character of any class/race along with appropriate gear and 320 alternate advancement points.\n\nYou don't have to pay to try out any race/class combination. There is a try before you buy option which lets you play for as long as you want with that class at level 85, but once you reach level 86 the character becomes locked.\n\nSince the strong point of the game was always the classes as I stated in my initial review I think this is a great opportunity to give EQ2 a try. You'll be able to experience a lot of different classes and explore a lot of the world.\n\nI plan to play this off and on until EQ Next just to see some of the lore and great locations the game has to offer. I am changing my initial review. I definitely recommend jumping in and just exploring and trying out the different classes for free at level 85. I'll continue to post updates to this review on what I actually think of the content.\n\nOriginal Review (6/21/14):\n\nEverQuest 2, the sequel to the best MMORPG of all time. For me this game came out at a bad time because I was still heavily into EverQuest 1 so when I first played it I found it so different that it made it hard to like it. It just didn't feel like EverQuest; the classes were extremely different and the agro and combat system was different. Looking back, this is to be expected and is probably a positive now, but at the time I couldn't get used to it. I ended up playing EQ2 for maybe a month or two past the free month and got close to level 40. It was fun visiting old zones from EQ1, but they didn't resemble the zones much and some of them didn't connect like they did in EQ1 so it made it even more confusing expecting a certain zone to be nearby and it wasn't.\n\nThis is a review for EQ2 in its own right though, not a review of the transition from EQ1 to EQ2. Since my initial time with EQ2 I did revisit the game on multiple occassions and it continued to grow and continued to get better. The zones are really interesting, but don't quite have the charm of EQ1 zones. I like the combat, but I could never get into the agro system where NPCs are grouped together. The art style I found to be ugly at times, the game has some weird blur effect to it. The class system is great and honestly is the sole reason I would recommend playing this game, to try out different classes. The housing system has also gotten really good over time and even though I haven't really taken part in this aspect I've toured some homes of friends and you can do some pretty impressive stuff. I have no experience in end game with EQ2, but like EQ1 there is a dedicated few still active and I'm sure the lore is top notch like EQ1 was.\n\nIf EQ2 would have came around a year or two later I may have been really into it, but I think it was released too early when I was still into EQ1, and ultimately EQ1 is the superior game. I am impressed with where they took EQ2 over the years and some of the stuff I've seen looks really cool, but I can't recommend this game due to my lack of experience with it so I can honestly say I don't know everything it has to offer, but I will say what I did experience was pretty good. It won't be that difficult to jump into EQ2 because it is more up to date as far as MMORPG mechanics go, so should be a smooth transition if you choose to try it.\n\nI would recommend skipping this one and looking for EverQuest Next sometime in 2015 (probably), it looks to be doing really good things in the MMORPG genre.","June 21, 2014","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dolomitesprint/recommended/201230/","dolomitesprint","dolomitesprint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dolomitesprint/","35 products in account","I was very excited to come back to EQ2.  I was there pre-launch when we all lived on the forums speculating and planning our new guilds and played for a couple of years everyday until my first kid was born; I was amongst the first group to betray from evil to good (back when it was a long involved quest) I think I was the very first Ogre to do so.\n\nI was even there when Sony made the pvp release announcements, deleted every thread and post they'd ever made saying they would only concentrate on pve in order to make it the best it ever could be, then flat out called everyone who protested a liar - challenging them to find the now deleted posts.\n\nSo, after a good few years away I come back and to be honest I was underwhelmed.  I still had my old toons (not that I could access them all), still had my fancy house filled with many objects, decorations and pets, some of which are probably pretty rare now.  But as I walked around, revisiting the places where I fought for days on end for tier 1 nodes and generally having a nostalgia trip, I just felt that it had changed too much for the negative.\n\nI can't quite put my finger on it, I revisited EQ1 too and was grinning to myself the whole time wielding my now collectible Sceptre of Destruction, so it's not because it's dated.  I don't know what it is, but there's nothing exciting there for me as a returning player.  It seemed too easy and linear now maybe?\n\nSo why the positve review?  I can see that if you give this game a chance, pay to play and find a good guild, you could well find it a brilliant alternative to WoW.  Generally there's fewer idiots, fewer overly serious manchildren and a better community in general.  'Go back to WoW' was an oft heard slur aimed at those that whined about difficulty in the early days and rightly so.  EQ2 is a bit grittier and less cartoony.\nIt should have beaten WoW as the number 1, of that I'm sure.  Lack of advertising hurt it, even finding somewhere that sold the discs could be a challenge, so it was never to be.  But this is the better game.\n\nI never got in to high end raiding on EQ, EQ2 or WoW, so I can't comment on which is best for the serious guys.  But for the rest of the people, the ones that just want to play, EQ2 is recommended.\n\nJust don't expect the same level of teary eyed joy as you get from EQ1 if you're a returning visitor to both.\n\nI hope that was helpful to someone.\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 13, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Crafting has always what i enjoy most, but EQ2 crafting is a really tedious game of whack-a-mole, constantly countering spells and getting whacked if you don't.  What i have found over the years is that mentoring has to be one of the greatest features in the game. Being able to down-level to help a friend or to just do low level quests is fantastic. i would give this game a B+","February 27","true","406.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's just a shame that nowadays the game is pretty much dead. Back in its glory days, EverQuest II was such a magnificent and addicting game, and although now the game is still enjoyable, it gets somewhat saddening to see what's become of it. If you've got a large group of close friends all looking for a fun MMO experience, then please, I urge you to play EQII together, because this game is honestly a blast.

It has so much potential as a free to play game, but you cant play free unless you are in a clan. tradeing is limited, and thus so is your ability to play free. you can not buy krono if youre a free player, and you can not sell things on the auctionhouse to get the plat for krono. if you can see past limitations and want a good game to explore, this game is for you.\n\nthe crafting system is a nice feature, though the sounds may put you to sleep as it is very relaxing.\n\noverall, the game is more of a 7/10 for what it has to offer, but bear in mind that you can expect some pretty steep limitations if you just want to play free.\n\nupdate: I dont know what the hell happened but the game is now riddled with bugs. you are officially better off playing runescape!","November 23, 2014","false","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Time i believe is the most valuable thing we have as our biological clock is ever ticking. Believe me i could be doing way more important stuff than writing this crap. I have 6 hours on record I wont lie to you. Game is good, Try it. It has everything an mmo needs to have and more. The game isnt ruined by what people say. It isnt pay to win as everything can be earned by just playing. If you are looking for that classic feel look no other. This games got history. It has attidute and it will consume you.
