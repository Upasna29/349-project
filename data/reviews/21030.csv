Part 2 has the same basic Beat-Em-Up gameplay, but manages to be more repetitive and overall worse. Just like in Part 1, the storyline itself is actually a strong point. It's a separate storyline from part 1, and shows a possible explanation for why Rorschach and Nite Owl Split. It touches upon some interesting themes such as the difference between what is legal and what is ethical, and has an interesting gameplay twist at the very end, so the plotline is decent.\n\nWhat isn't so good is the gameplay. In part 1, you could unlock new moves, which kept the gameplay from getting completely stale. In part 2, you start off with all of the moves from part 1 unlocked, which makes sense, but you don't unlock anything more. You end the game with the same skills you started with, meaning there is no progression and the difficulty curve is more of a difficulty flatline. Furthermore, part 2 is the same length as part one (about three hours), but has half as many levels (a total of 3), meaning you're stuck in the same area for twice as long and fighting the same enemies for twice as long (and just like part 1, there's really only two or three enemy types, just having different models on each level). The effect that all of this has is that every fight in the game is essentially identical, and since the game is almost nonstop fighting, you're going to have a bland time. Furthermore, the final level is just annoying, as it consists of you chasing the villain through a mansion. Everytime you catch up to said villain, she says something essentially boiling down to "HAHA YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME WATCHMEN" and then runs off to another room. This repeats several times in a row and just felt like a lame way to keep you moving through the level.\n\nOverall, can't reccomend this one, even though the story is decent.","July 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 64 of 79 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","64","79","0","2"

Also if you read my review of the first part its pretty much the same with this one. So Beat em Up Fans if this game is in sale its worth it if not then let your hands of it. The combos are also the same as in the first part maybe some small changes you dont notice really much of it.\n\nMy total playtime for both parts if you play one character to the end was 10 hours and also tested the other character so the maximum to play with both would be between 18 - 20 hours not more.\n\nThumbs up if this game is in sale.","October 2, 2014","true","3.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","3"

I bought them both for a couple of pounds in the sale well worth the money i've had great fun playing theses 2 games. What i like most about these games is you can jump in and out when you want classic Beat 'em up game not loads to learn easy to get to grips with. A word on saving, The game auto saves a certain points where you can restart from when you die, but if you exit the game you have to start from the beggining of that chapter it keeps you hooked.

Other than that, if you like Final Fight, Double Dragon, and games of that sort, you will find this a decent button mashing brawler. The theme is a bit more adult than the last one and seeing Rorschach's brutal moves used against the female baddies...well, it was brutal, lol.\n\nHere is my review for the first one. Like I said, pick it up on sale and you get a decent brawler that tries hard and manages to miss the mark yet is still strangely fun.\n\n"4.9 hours in aaaannnd, we've beaten this beatemup! I do recommend it, conditionally. It has its good points and bad but for the most part it delivers an entertaining few hours of smash and well, more smash.\n\nThe Good:\nThe moves are pretty smooth and easy to pull off.\nThe story fits the mood of the comics/movie well.\nIt's not bad if you get it on sale for 1-3 bucks.\nIt's like a modern Double Dragon or Final Fight.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe graphics are dated. They do the job though, barely.\nNo replayability really.\nRepetitive. You fight. It's a modern Final Fight.\nThe combos are ok but you mainly end up doing the dodge/counteratttack move.\n\nThe Ugly:\nDon't pay full price for it.\nIt's short. I logged the 4.9 hours and I napped in between a couple of levels with the game open, lol.\nThe options are abysmal.\nNeed more playable characters.\nThe gore looks cheesy.\n\nBottom line is this. If you can get it on sale and enjoy a button mashing fight fest with a gritty undertone and slick moves then this game is for you.\n\nJust be aware going in about exactly what it is you are buying here.\nNOTE: If you use an XBOX 360 controller (wireless) be sure to change the setting to use the wired version. Otherwise you get a stuck camera angle and non-responsive controls. The wireless mapping is hosed.\n\nAnyway, just my opinion here but I didn't hate it, didn't love it, got it on sale and don't regret the time spent with it"\n\n","November 8, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Rorschach get's a video film a girl so he and Nite Owl team up to get her back from her captives.\n\nGameplay wise the game is the same thing as part 1, nothing is changed. There's nothing new to change up the gameplay.\n\nGraphics are the same. Very bad textures and nice comic style cut scenes. The levels do look nicer this time since they added more colors to the game.\n\nAudio design is still as bad, the games audio cuts out and only comes back a few moments later, and the soundtrack is reused from the first part.\n\nThe game is way harder than the first part. They added new female enemies and they spam attacks that take away your health incredibly fast and the checkpoint system is messed up, the checkpoints are very far between which means dying is not an option. So your best chance of survival is to let the AI partner go in the battle head first while he takes out everyone and you just run around trying to avoid taking damage.\n\nLevel design this time is abysmal. The final level by itself is a confusing mess, really sloppy level design and everything pretty much looks the same.\n\nGame is even shorter than part 1, only three chapters. all about 30 minutes long except for the final chapter which is about 45 minutes long. This is a tip for people who will have to play this game later on. Complete the level before exiting the game cause when you quit and return it's back to the start of the chapter. You can also play through the game twice trying out different characters. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT. There is a battle between two main characters giving the game two different outcomes.\n\nThe game is also not buggy, apart from a few texture pop ins and character models spazing out and not to mention the  incredibly stupid partner AI.\n\nThe game is even worse than Part 1, This is not worth your time or money. Skip this no matter what. There is nothing good about part 2, awful level design, garbage combat and insane difficulty spike at the final chapter. Not worth the money. I give Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part 2 a 2/10","July 7, 2015","false","2.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xander77/recommended/21030/","Xander77","Xander77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xander77/","921 products in account","This is a really terrible game. You might be nodding along now, your finger reaching for the purchase button since this is on sale, echoing my own thoughts at the time "of course I'm not expecting a *great* game - just a forgettable brawler". Well, allow me to reiterate with a bit of emphasis - this is not a forgettable game, this is not an average game, this is not a mediocre game. This is a REALLY TERRIBLE game.\n\nBoth parts took me about 6 hours to complete. It felt way, waaaaaay longer than that. And not in a good way. The game is padded to hell and back with really terrible content. Let's break it down, in no particular order:\n\nThe combat consists of Light blows, Heavy Blows, Block and Throw (you can't throw most of the tougher enemies), and some combos of the above. Also, you get the occasional QTE to finish an enemy. You can't jump. Night Owl can't even pick up weapons from the environment.\n\nThere are regular enemies, fast enemies and strong enemies. Each has 4-5 different models throughout the game, but they all fight exactly alike. Sometimes they carry melee weapons.\n\nThere's no online co-op. I'm not sure how local co-op works on steam. I suspect it doesn't.\n\nThe result is a fighting game where the fighting less diverse and interesting than the original Streets of Rage / Final Fight, 20 years later.\n\nSince fights aren't very fun, the game obviously has... wait, it doesn't really have anything else. You trudge through encounter after encounter, in the exact same poorly designed and aesthetically unengaging alleways, fighting the same 4-5 enemy models. Every so often you have to tap F to open a door. There's an arbitrary lockpicking minigame that - as far as I can tell - lets you skip some fights. That's it - no bonus abilities, not hidden content, just the chance to fight fewer enemies, because that's something you want less of in a well made fighting game.\n\nDon't buy this game. Don't accept it as a gift. Your time is more valuable than that.","January 26, 2015","false","2.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The follow up certainly makes up for what Watchmen fans were expecting out of the package.\n\nWhere as Part 1 hardly connected to anything Watchmen related (Before Watchmen, or the original Watchmen graphic novel,) and could be skipped,  Part 2 features a lot more fan service.  Surprisingly we learn a lot about the nature of Rorschach and Nite Owl's relationship not yet explored in any other Watchmen media, uncovering what led to their long hiatus as partners.\n\nPart 2 is tied in just before some flashback events in the original comic.  [Part 1 takes place 1973.  Comedian is murdered Oct 12, 1985 (Watchmen starts).  The Keene Act is signed August 3, 1977 (flashbacks of riots). January or February 1977 Part 2 begins ending just as Keene Act is signed.]\n\nSurprisingly the game fits perfectly into the story line.  Before Watchmen came out 3 years after the game yet it offers a great resolution to the Nite Owl's comics (which followed a 15 yaer old Nite Owl II) while leading right into the main story.","November 25, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This second installment of Watchmen plays, without exaggeration, exactly like its predecessor.\n\nThe stylish combat I enjoyed so much in the first game returns but tires quick. Right from the get-go, every attack is unlocked. Consequently, you'll find yourself settling on one combo for the rest of this two hour game. There's no sense of character progression as present before.\n\n"New" enemies feel identical to the old ones but with a makeover. The new settings look nice, but are not much different from the first game's. The plot is boring and weak. There's simply no good reason as to why Watchmen was split into two parts when they are so similar.\n\nThe only positive is that Part 2 fleshes out the relationship between Rorschach and Nite Owl, explaining why they separated. But if you aren’t a Watchmen fan, would you care? If you don't, save your money and just stick with the first game.\n\nGrade: D+","April 29, 2012","true","3.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is even shorter than the previous one and quite repetitive. I thought that this game would finish the story from the first game, but here is a different story with no connection to previous part.\n\nIf you want more fighting with Rorschach or Nite Owl, buy it in some bundle with first part in some sale.","January 4, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I´m quite disappointed, because I spent infinite hours chasing Twilight Lady, I´ve fought countless foes of the same kind, in an insanely repetitive manner (it seemed like it would never end), and I´ve even defeated the villain herself, only to have to find a final fight against my only friend in the whole game. I´ve purchased the game because I liked the graphic novel and the movie, but I sincerely wish this game had never been made.\nI mean, it was cool to run around (in a straight line) and beat the heck out of bad guys, but how many guys can you beat before you say "enough, I want out"? It is a short game that seems way too long, I couldnt wait to finish it just to get rid of it.\nI´m seriously considering forfeiting the final fight and moving on to something else.\nSadly, I cannot recommend this game.

I really enjoyed the first Watchmen game, and I went so far as to recommend to anyone who enjoys punching things at all. (And let's face it, most people enjoy punching things) The sequel is... a problem. The biggest issue here is that the game design left the building. The original End is Nigh ended when the game got done exploring its design. I would expect the sequel to add new elements, such as more combos, different enemy types... no, it did not. It's the first game, repackaged into new environments with three times as many physics objects.\n\nSo the gameplay is a let down, let's talk story. The original End is Nigh had a noir-esque narrative centered around the watergate scandal, and this one tells a more personal conflict. The city is up in flames due to a police strike, and in the midst of it all, Rorschach is most concenred with the well-being of a kidnapped girl, who was forced to star in underage pornography. Now, Rorschach has a problem with sexuality. A big problem. He seems to outright hate sex and anything sexy, probably due to his previous experiences.\n\nHis crusade to find and rescue the girl is justified only by the fact that she's underage, and Rorschach and a reluctant Nite Owl tear their way through a strip club and a brothel to get to her. Then, as it turns out, the "kidnapped" girl wasn't underage at all, and was instead there of her own volition. Nite Owl attempts to tell Rorschach that there's simply nothing they can do, but of course, he isn't having that. This culminates in a battle between the two of them on the rooftop, which ultimately ends their partnership.\n\nIt's actually a pretty neat story that dives deeper into both of their characters and motivations. You always get the impression that the two are an explosive mixture, and the way they do eventually break apart is realistic and interesting.\n\nAs an animated short film, this game's narrative would've been a blast, but one has to suffer through atrociously boring and uninspired gameplay to even get to the good parts, which are around 5 minutes total of the two hour experience.","June 14, 2015","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was somewhat confusing since part 1 left you on a cliffhanger.\n\nThis game is not nearly as good as part 1. It is even shorter, having only 3 chapters, but this time they are much longer, but also very, very repetitive. All you seem to do is beat on a bunch of guys, then the reinforcements that come after you beat them, then open an annoying door that requires both characters and takes too long to open.\nThen you do it over again...and over...and over...This is tolerable for the first two chapters, but the third chapter just seems to drag on for an unnecessarily  long time. Part 1 seemed to do a much better job at fleshing everything out.\nThe story is not at all interesting, if you can call it a story at all. But what would you expect from a 2 hour game I guess?\nI would say to anyone looking to buy this, stick with Part 1; this isn't even worth the money.","May 29, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
