In Mushroom 11 you ‘take control’ of an amorphous organism and guide it through increasingly difficult obstacle course style chapters. The apocalyptic world you find yourself in is full of strange mutated creatures which either act as collectibles or bosses.\n\nPresentation\nThe game’s presentation is easily its strongest aspect. The organism itself looks great and fits well with the rest of the game. The backgrounds are incredibly well designed, each chapter having a different one, they really give the game the ‘destroyed world’ feel that the devs seem to be going for. There’s not really any UI during gameplay but it’s not necessary to have one so that’s fine. The menus are nice and simple but I did have one problem with the menus, no confirmation dialogue when quitting to menu. I misclicked during boss fights a couple of times which resets the bosses, a simple confirmation would have meant this didn’t happen. It’s not a major issue but I found it bothersome.\n\nGameplay\nSo you’ve got yourself a giant blob of an amorphous organism and an obstacle course, how exactly do you get through this obstacle course? Movement is pretty much just erasing parts of your organism so that it can grow back on a different part of your blob. It’s difficult to properly describe how this movement is achieved but the game’s simple tutorial explains it rather well. Movement is only possible while your organism is in contact with the ground though so when you’re in the air you just have to hope you make it across to whatever you’re trying to reach. As for the actual erasing you simply use the LMB or RMB. The LMB is a large eraser generally used for movement while the RMB is a small eraser that’s generally used to cut off certain parts of the organism or to make more precise changes to the organism’s shape. The simple control scheme for the game definitely works well.\n\nThe puzzles/obstacles you encounter vary but for quite a few of the obstacles in each chapter they’re just more elaborate versions of what you see in the first couple of chapters which leads to little variety, apart from difficulty, over the course of the game. That said new obstacle types are introduced from time to time and some of them are a lot of fun, such as slides and cranes.\n\nFrom time to time you’ll find you’ve either managed to erase too much of your organism or you’ll find yourself up close and personal to a trap which kills the organism, such as a lava pit. In these situations you’ll find yourself at the last of the regular checkpoints that you passed.\n\nAs well as these puzzles/obstacles you’ll face a boss fight at the end of each chapter. There’s good variety between the different bosses and they all provide a decent challenge, the later ones more so than the early ones as would be expected. The bosses also introduce interesting mechanics such as bombs which, if they go off close to you, will burn through your organism.\n\nAudio\nNot too much to say about this one, the sound track and sound effects are both good quality and fit well with the game.\n\nMiscellaneous As far as I can tell the game doesn’t really have a story, not necessarily a bad thing but something I wanted to mention.\nSometimes it felt very much like trial and error when figuring out puzzles/obstacles due to how you have no control over how your organism actually grows, only what you erase. While this is very much part of the game, and it probably wouldn’t work without it, I wanted to mention it in case it’s something you really don’t like.\nPersonally I don’t think the price tag fits what the game offers. Unless you go back and replay every mission to get all the collectibles there’s around four hours of content and due to the lack of variety it can feel like less than that. Somewhere around £6.99 would be more reasonable in my opinion.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing on Sale.\n\nMushroom 11 is a challenging puzzle game with a great look, good world design and fun gameplay which is let down by its high price. If you’re a complete puzzle game nut you might get your money’s worth but if you like a puzzle game every once in a while I’d suggest waiting for a better sale.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","October 15, 2015","true","5.7"," 96 of 111 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","96","111","3","4"

First five chapters are quick, but then the difficulty escalates a lot.\n- Controls take a bit of time to get used to. Flipside: Once you get used to them, it feels fluid. Just because they're different != bad\n\nSummaryWonderful presentation, solid gameplay - It took ~6 hours to complete, and is very hard to 100% (no one has done it). It explores the "erase to grow" concept really well. Overall, a puzzle/action game worth the asking price.\n\nNote: I got a copy from the developer, and gave an honest review in return. In truth, this has been one of my most anticipated games.","December 13, 2015","true","8.1"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","42","47","0","0"

To start with our character is blob of green cells, he must be some type of mold or mushroom.  I'm gonna call him a blob from this point on and I hope he doesn't take offence to this.  I grew quite attached to him during our journey and have great respect for his determination to achieve his admirable goal in the game.\n\nWe control our blob by erasing parts of him, but don't fret he grows back to the same volume as before almost instantly.  We can get him to traverse some pretty funky obstacles in the game by using the two erasers supplied (LMB and RMB) one is a large eraser and the other one much smaller, better for slicing or fine adjustments.\n\nSome have complained that the game is too tough, but the levels are designed as such to place very regular checkpoints before and after each puzzle.  Maybe the frustrating parts can come from some of the obstacles having seperate sections.  Clearing the first couple of sections and then failing the third and having to restart does create some "NOOOOoooooo!!!!" moments for sure!\n\nThe puzzles are really well designed, have a great variety and most importantly are fun.  So replaying them until I succeeded wasn't an issue.  The few that caused me real headaches I stopped playing and came back to later with a fresh mind and found I completed them fairly quickly after.\n\nThe game looks nice, it has a grimy art style which works really well for our blobs environment.  The sound track is created by Future Sound of London and its ambient style suits the game perfectly.\n\nI felt a feeling of accomplishment completing the game but checking some of the achievements...  some of them require one-shotting levels....  wow!!  Good luck!!\n\nI highly recommend Mushroom 11.  It's a really original and well-designed platformer with well-placed checkpoints which counteract the sometimes seemingly impossible puzzles!","January 17","true","11.6"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","5"

Other than that it’s fun though I have to say a tad overpriced. So if you’re looking for a rather weird, some might even say bizarre, puzzle plattformer … It’s safe to say you’ve found it.\n\nStoryThe story unfolds itself as you progress through the levels. Since there’s no dialogue you’ll have to pretty much put the pieces together yourself.\nAt the end you will found understand where exactly you emerged from.\n\nGameplayRight click and left click. Those are your very best friends in the game.\nLeft click is called the Big Eraser and the right click is basically his lil’ brother the small eraser. Two brothers are aiding an amorphous organism to understand the true nature of devastation from which he emerged.\n\nBasically you guide, let’s call the organism Dave for the sake of the review, Dave through the levels by erasing him. Sounds a bit weird at first and might even look rather weird but hey that’s just how it works.\nAnyway. Whatever you erase will grow back. That’s the beauty of it and the tricky part. In order to move Dave around you have to erase certain parts to make him expand in a specific direction.\n\nDuring your journey alongside Dave you’ll have to help him overcome certain obstacles like moving plattforms, lava and even a purple-ish fluid that will destroy you if you don’t erase it.\n\nThe best part about the game is by far that every level is unique and there’s a huge difficulty spike throughout the game which might be off putting for some people but I enjoyed that quite a bit.\nThe game actively forcing you to think (so better use that thing between your shoulders!) to overcome certain obstacles or even boss fights. More about the bosses later on.\n\nFor example one part of the game requires you to be picked up by a crane and the being flung over a pit of lava. So you have to have enough momentum to overcome the  pit and you have to expand Dave just in time to connect with the ground else you respawn at your last checkpoint.\nExactly the game does, god bless, have a checkpoint system and to be fair it’s quite good. By that I mean the checkpoints aren’t that rare in the game which is quite the help since you find yourself more than ones literally erasing yourself.\nTechnically you can’t entirely erase yourself since there’s always a tiny bit of organis that just refused to be erased … Dave’s pretty stubborn like that.\n\nYou can sabotage yourself though if you erase too much of yourself. While that’s a reason to be annoyed or even frustrated I always found myself cringe at my own stupidity.\n\nSo far I’ve managed to get to the boss of level four and let’s just say the game gets weirder and weirder. Which is a good thing by the way since it’s rather interesting.\n\nOther than that the game’s pretty straight forward. It present you enough puzzles that you probably just would like to pull your hair out … or rip your face in tiny pieces but it’s excellent at what it does.\n\nLet’s talk a bit about the bosses.\nThe bosses are quite a nice addition to the game. Especially the way you approach them. In order to beat the first boss for example you have to destroy certain parts of him while he’s trying his best to annihilate you.\n\nThe boss in level three was my favorite so far and also the easiest.\n\nI won’t get too much into the bosses because that’d be a huge spoiler but let’s just say that every boss is unique in design and the way you have to approach him.\n\nVisualMushroom 11 looks as weird as it sounds. Which is quite a good thing!\nThe level design is interesting and unique and the whole scenery just gives you a pretty good glimpse at what’s coming next.\nThe beauty is that your organism moves so fluid. It squeezes, squirms and just moves around in a fantastic manner and it just looks rather awesome to watch it shrink and grow again.\nDave’s pretty dope!\n\nAudioThe music just fits. I especially like the sound your organism does while moving around, growing while you erase it.\nThe whole music and sound effects in the game are rather subtle though but that might just be me since I haven’t found myself paying too much attention to the music.\nWhether that’s a good or a bad thing well I guess that you’ll have to find out for yourself but the overall soundtrack was quite nice.\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Mushroom 11 in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nYou just have to like the release date of the game. October 15th. That’s the national mushroom day folks. That’s not the only thing there is to like of course!\n\nMushroom 11 is a visually striking and quite bizarre puzzle plattformer.\nThe whole idea of the game’s rather unique and fun. Erasing yourself in order to grow back and get through the levels was quite something.\nThe puzzles are not too hard but do require a fair bit of brain power.\nThe only thing that bothers me is maybe the price … Personally I think that it’s just a tad pricey but that might just be me.\nOverall it’s a really solid game which I can only recommend to every puzzle fan out there.\nOr to everyone who just wants to play something rather weird and unique.","October 15, 2015","true","8.2"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","34","46","3","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madlumi/recommended/243160/","madlumi","Lumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madlumi/","300 products in account","The game gets points for trying out something new and it is indeed an interesting mechanic. Heck the first 45 min of the game are actually fun! meaning the 3 first chapters out of 7. Don't worry the later chapter take longer to wrap up and impossible to get achievements will keep you playing for long if that's your sort of thing.\n\nNow why don't I recommend this game? Well past those first enjoyable 45min, the game switches the feeling it is transmitting from novelty and fun, to sheer and utter frustration. The intrinsic mechanics of the gameplay, where deleting some of the mushroom makes the same amount grow more or less randomly on another part of the mushroom "cloud" gives you limited control on what you're doing.\n\nMost of the time I passed what I guess are supposed to be challenging obstacles I didn't feel the "I finally got it feeling", but instead I got a "Finally, luck was on my side!". Just to give a quick example: in the last chapter there is a section where you need to form your mushroom into a disk in order to make it roll down a hill with enough momentum to catch a sticky liane at the far side of a deadly gap. Now that liane is actually slightly swaying back and forth! Enough to make you miss it if it has moved a few milimiters further than what you need to catch it. If you managed to make the disk perfectly and got maximum momentum, you'd have to pray to get a good "cycle" on the liane. The above and other examples result in repeated deaths and massive frustration.\n\nSo in the end, what could be argued to be a difficult game, just feels like a frustrating experience due to an interesting concept that fails during implementation. I finished the game and joined the club of 3.5% of owners who did so, and it only took me 4h. This tells you much about how little people bother to finish the game past those initial enjoyable 45min.\n\nI wanted to like the game, it started out well, but turned out bad later. I like an increase in difficulty, but the gameplay needs to be responsive for that. Mushroom 11's mechanic is all but refined and would have benefited much more from an overall accessible progression with the added twists it already implements in each chapter. Adding extra difficulty was unecessary in my opinion. Suffice to say that after finishing the game I came to hate it rather than even just like it.","January 12","false","4.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

The last one I can think of is Frozen Synapse and now there's this. It's been frustrating seeing it unreleased for so long, but now seeing the final product I understand the long delays. The visual polish is absolutely amazing. Slowly navigating through its post-apocalyptic wasteland reveals an infinite set of painted vistas. There's just enough visual storytelling to make you wonder of the purpose of the strange blob creature, but no more.\n\nThe closes comparison for gameplay is World of Goo with it's analog manipulation of complex physics systems. But otherwise it's entirely original. Nothing out there is quite like it and anything similar that follows will be branded as derivative. It encompasses every inch of the good ideas in this design space and nothing more. No filler.\n\nSome of the later puzzles are a little difficult, but mostly they demand patience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/243160/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Games often explore the human psyche in post-apocalyptic worlds, but what about the life of an amorphous organism? Mushroom 11 shifts the focus to a giant green blob as it travels through dilapidated environments, and though the game appears simple on the surface, it reveals layers of complexity synonymous with fantastic puzzle platformers. The core principle of cell reformulation takes some getting used to, but once players overcome the initial learning curve, a compelling adventure awaits.\n\nWhen you open Mushroom 11 and see how polished and innovative it is, it may be hard to believe that it was produced by a team of only four people. However, that is exactly the case; the indie studio behind the game, Untame, is composed of two husband-and-wife duos with a passion for creativity in game design. They were the brains behind the award-winning iOS game Rope Rescue, and Mushroom 11 is their first project for PC.\n\nMushroom 11 wastes no time—players jump right into chapter one with no mention of backstory or narrative. The game builds its personality through art design, which appears to hint at some kind of end-of-the-world scenario. Nevertheless, the core mechanic of the amorphous organism and its movement exists as the main draw of Mushroom 11. Players use the mouse to remove cells from the organism, which then appear on the other side of it. Doing so at a rapid pace results in a rush of momentum that allows the organism to move along the environment. The controls feel a bit awkward at first, and thus Mushroom 11 takes a little while to truly grab the player's attention. That patience is rewarded, though.\n\nThe initial chapters appear straightforward, but that's not to say they're a walk in the park. The mechanic of removing cells so they appear on the other side provides all kinds of opportunities for mistakes and blunders. I had to cross my fair share of lava and poison pits, and let's just say I took a few too many tumbles along the way. I didn't always feel like it was my fault, but once I familiarized myself with the controls, those mistakes slowly started to disappear. Despite some frustrations along the way, it's a case of practice makes perfect.\n\nEventually Mushroom 11 becomes even more complex, and the platforming aspect of the game transitions into a series of puzzle elements. At that point, it's about executing on an idea rather than executing in general. After a few chapters, I started wracking my brain to get past a bunch of obstacles, whether it involved hitting multiple switches at once to open a door or splitting the organism in two to bypass a seesaw contraption. The gradual introduction of more complex obstacles works in the game's favor, even though there are spots that felt a bit too challenging at times given the game's controls. However, the difficulty of this game is only occasionally frustrating. There are plenty of checkpoints, most of which occur immediately after puzzles, so solving them feels rewarding.\n\nEach chapter in Mushroom 11 culminates in a boss fight, and they provide a nice change of pace from the slow and methodical levels that lead up to them. Although bosses attack the organism, death is never really a threat. Instead, they often stand as a test of platforming skills, such as the first one in which players must circumvent a creature's wildly swinging legs to reach a series of weak points. Another one involves using the organism as a platform of sorts to launch bombs up to the boss' weak points. There are some clever ideas on display in each boss fight, and the inventiveness helps compensate for the lack of challenge on a few of them.\n\nThe landscape is littered with deteriorating buildings and other decaying objects that you must maneuver over and around. There are several types of pools you can encounter as well. For example, lakes of lava will burn you up, so make sure all of your mushroom isn’t submerged at once or you’ll die. The purple goo is poison, infecting you gradually and eating away at your fungi; if you’re in contact with it for too long, you could disintegrate entirely. Water won’t hurt you, but it behaves like water does in real life, so it can be tricky solving puzzles while swimming.\n\nWhile you travel, you’ll find several little bugs to gobble up. These don’t noticeably increase the size of your mushroom, but there are achievements for successfully eating all of the bugs on each level. This additional challenge encourages extended exploration or replaying levels after bosses have been defeated.\n\nMushroom 11 doesn’t have an explicit story, per se. There aren’t any cutscenes scattered throughout the chapters, and there isn’t any narration. The player is left to determine the story through scenery and subtext. The epilogue is lovely and minimalistic; though it continues the trend of no narration, it is still very expressive and leaves you filled with hope for the future.\n\nThe game contains original compositions by The Future Sound of London. This rough, sometimes haunting, electronic music is the perfect match for the dystopian environment. Also included are a host of ambient sounds that intertwine wonderfully with the artwork to create a full backdrop.\n\nTo conclude there is no denying that Mushroom 11 left me very impressed. Untame deserve a lot of praise for attempting such an original concept and pulling it off. It may not quite nab a place in the platformer hall of fame, but it should be enough to satisfy fans of the genre who are looking for something outside the box that is packed full of dark atmosphere and intricate puzzles.","May 8","true","11.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","2"

It has obviously had it’s glory moments, “Rock Paper Shotgun” has picked it as their “Best Platformer” of 2015 and it also has gotten a lot of other awards. The game is a puzzle platformer with a very original concept, there are overall 7 chapters all set in different locations in a nuclear/ apocalypse type of world.\n\nIn the game you control a weird green glowing radiant blob that rebuilds the parts that you destroy of it. Sounds weird? It is pretty weird. Like I said, this is a very original concept for a platformer. You control the blob by deleting parts of it at the back and then it rebuilds them at the front. So to move for example to the left you delete to right of the blob. By doing this you can gain momentum which allows you to do things like turn into a circle or turn into a stick because it fills the area that it’s in.It’s a hard concept to explain but the video at the bottom will show a demonstration. The blob can squeeze through tiny holes and can be broken into small pieces or large chunks. The way you move and break and do anything in the game is with the eraser tool. Holding left click makes the larger eraser and holding right click makes the smaller one. The bigger eraser is using mostly for moving yourself around terrain and the smaller eraser is used to make precision cuts in your blob for the more delicate puzzles. There are also blue glowing checkpoints that appear throughout the chapters. With these tools you can do a lot of pretty awesome things such as molding yourself around a small block for example or make a sort of hinge or you can turn yourself into a bridge or a ramp to get objects across gaps.\n\nIn each chapter, there are 10 or so puzzles that you have to get through, each chapter making the levels harder and adding new mechanics to keep the game fresh. Most of the puzzles were fun to solve and felt satisfying to complete but some of the puzzles were not. During the later chapters in the game you find puzzles that are just down right more frustrating to solve than fun. Sometimes I would just leave the game and come back later because I was getting so frustrated by some of the puzzles.\n\nAlong the way, in the chapters you see all kinds of plants and other glowing things that you can collect and they are known as “DNA” points, in a chapter there are 50 of these DNA points to collect and collecting all of them by the end of a chapter unlocks an achievement. There are no upgrades or anything of the sort that you get by collecting these DNA points, they’re just there for perfectionists and achievement hunters mostly. A few of the points are pretty easy to get and sometimes you even get a few after defeating a boss but they are usually in tough spots to find and are hard to collect so I didn’t really make an effort to collect all of them on any chapter.\n\nAs you progress through each chapter, you get to fight a unique and pretty sweet looking boss at the end of each one of them. The bosses in this game might be my favorite part about it because they are all super colourful, special and just sorta fun to kill. They are also pretty terrifying, you come up to a boss and it’s standing or floating there shooting deadly lasers at you or spitting weird acid in your face  while you are just a green blob that has to use the environment to actually defeat them, so watch out.\n\nVisually, the game is exceptionally pretty, the dark, misty but colourful art-style makes the game visually pleasing. It sort of feels like if you took “LIMBO”, set it in a nuclear wasteland and added colour to it. Each level has it’s own unique visual theme (Scientific Laboratory, Jungle ext). Animation in the game is also superb especially on the bosses, all looking very clean and smooth.\n\nThe music in the game is alright, it’s nothing too special and I mostly found myself putting on my own playlist of music when playing through the game. The boss fights again I think take the lead here even with the music since the boss music was the best music in the game in my opinion.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with this game is that’s it’s extremely short.I finished the whole thing in around 6 hours if you take out all the extra things I did with the game. Is that such a bad thing? No not really, but when the game is asking for 15 dollars it is. The game is great but standing on its own in the store the price for it is just a bit too large I feel. I got the game in January’s “Humble Monthly” which was a great get because it came with other games for a price lower than 15 dollars.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMushroom 11 is a great 2D puzzle platformer with an original concept and great art-style, it’s extremely frustrating at some points but also has it’s glory moments. The price they’re currently asking for the game is a bit too high which is one of the most negative things about this game at the moment.\n\n8.5/10\nFor more reviews like this, check out my curation page  here!","January 20","true","8.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

In a marketplace full of rigid game genres, annualized franchises, and me-too clones, It's a very rare occurance when I can say that a game is 100% unique. If novelty is your thing, look no further than Mushroom 11.\n\nI truly have never played or even seen a game like this one before. Mushroom 11 is based on the surprisingly simple mechanic of forcing your "mushroom" (it looks more like a green mass) to grow by destroying parts of it. Basically, it grows opposite of where you prune so if you want it to grow left, you cut the right side of it and vice-versa. Using this mechanic, you must navigate the desolate wasteland of a post-appocalyptic Earth.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/243160/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Mushroom 11 is a charming indie puzzle platformer game with interesting erase-and-move progressing system.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\n5 minutes of my Mushroom 11 gameplay:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyYWfTZwoDo\n\nWhat is happening in the game:"Delete it and it will grow." That's what the Store page says and it's pretty much the most accurate description of this game. You are an unusual green organic creature ("the blob") that consists of certain number of cells or blocks. Every time you erase a part of the blob, exactly the same amount of the blob grows from the blob in its other side. This way, you are able to move. You are placed in a world of fun and hard puzzles and boss fights.\n\nPros:    The Idea | I wouldn't come up with that in a hundred years and I have to say that the idea is brilliant. We all know that the market is already flooded with tons and tons of different platformers, so a change is certainly welcome.\nPuzzle Complexity | The puzzles were a lot more complex than I was expecting them to be. By that I don't mean they were necessarily hard, but the way they were thought out is just brilliant. But they're sometimes also just plain hard.\nThe Graphics | You probably noticed that if you checked out this game's Store Page, but I'm gonna mention it anyway: this game is beautiful. It's not in stunning Ultra-HD, but it's still really pleasant to look at. I especially like the green shiny look of the blob.\nThe Soundtrack | This game also has a really good soundtrack! They figured that out and made an OST DLC available for purchase. However, it costs 10$, which is really not worth it.\nGameplay Time | I confess: I haven't finished the game yet. It's so damn hard! But I played it for quite a few hours already and it's still fun. Therefore, I'm sure that you can get at least 10 hours of fun out of it. I also feel like there is some replay value as my save files got deleted and I still enjoyed replaying the first levels.\nOS- and Steam-related stuff | Erasing mushrooms is now easier than ever even on SteamOS and MacOS. Achievements and Trading Cards are of course included. However, there is a catch regarding save files. See cons.\nCons:    Game Saving Problems | So, this game's saves are apparently locked to your Steam Community name. Not to your account, not to your computer, but to your name. If you change your name, your saves are gone. In my opinion, this is a really strange way of saving a game's progress and they should switch to using Steam Cloud as soon as possible.\nDifficulty | This game is charming enough to keep me interested even after failing a number of times, but I'm pretty sure that some people won't last that long. As I mentioned already, this game is pretty damn hard. It starts of pretty easy, but then gets harder and harder. And harder. And it shouldn't, at least not as much as it does.\nThe final verdict:This is a good-looking platformer that actually brings something new to the table. Erasing mushrooms and growing them back are never yet seen in the platformer world or in any, to be honest. That's why it's worth its price. If you look at the trailer and all the screenshots, you should be able to figure out pretty quickly if this is a game for you or not. I can't decide if this game is balanced in terms of difficulty or not. I had a great time playing, but games just shouldn't be as hard as this one is. Almost everyone I know that played this game didn't finish it, but they all really liked it. I would suggest lowering the difficulty somehow as this would bring the player through the whole game and make him feel a lot better. Other than that, I have no major complaints except that save file issue, which is really weird.\nYou might or might not know what this game was highly anticipated before it came out and the players weren't let down when the game was released. The initial players with such hype are usually disappointed because games are never that awesome as they appear before the release, but Mushroom 11's fans were quite satisfied with the result. This means that you will probably be as well.\nAnyway, if you like puzzle games, put this on your wishlist or just buy it. It has lots of playtime and it's not that expensive. And it looks nice.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Are they all correct? Pretty much. There is nothing out there like Mushroom 11. Its unique take on platforming is refreshing and fun. Did I mention the art and musical direction? Well it's fantastic. It sets up the atmosphere very well, it surrounds the unique platforming concepts admirably. Are there any flaws? Some, I think replayability can come into question, I honestly didn't feel compelled to play levels again. Some stretches of the game were "the same" in a way, just slightly altered. Overall though this is an extremely fun ride I would enthusiastically recommend to platform genre fans, casual fans, and definitely anyone looking for something "different" (but good) to try.","October 15, 2015","true","8.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The first couple levels are promising and fairly easy, but past them the difficulty spikes quite a bit, with either timed platforming or puzzles where you have to get the Mushroom into just the right shape to progress, usually while hoping the game's physics cooperate. Sometimes it's both at once.\n\nI disagree that controlling the Mushroom is completely luck-based, but it doesn't feel precise enough for a lot of the stuff you have to make it do. I got up to the middle of Chapter 5 before my patience ran out, so I feel I gave it a fair shot. This was after a patch meant to minimize frustration, so I'm curious how difficult things were before. I don't have any suggestions myself about any further changes, and if the developers have it the way they like, that's fine. I'm just not sure it's a game most people would want to play, even ones interested in difficult games.","January 31","false","5.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Thankfully it regrows almost as fast as you can destroy it , I assume it's powered by photosynthesis, nuclear fallout or just magic.\n\nThe game contains seven large levels set in a post-apocalyptic world and in a twist you move right to left on screen which takes a little getting used to! Each levels contains multiple puzzles like climbing stairs, riding rotating metal bars, an Indiana Jones cart sequence to running ahead of rolling balls creating bridges with your blob so it can pass by. There is plenty of inventiveness here and many of the puzzles in the last two levels are quite demanding.\n\nThe control system couldn't be simpler, left click to destroy a large part of the blob, right click a small part. Sadly here is the only weakness in the game, as the blob randomly respawns when you eat away at it some of the tougher puzzles are more trial and error and just plain frustration instead of fun.\n\nBeautifully presented, Mushroom 11 is a very good game only let down by a control system that can't quite keep up with it's demands at times.","June 1","true","13.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Some parts of it are done really, really well, while other not so much.\n\nGood things first:\n\n1.  Control scheme. Your play as a hive-mind fungi colony. And it has a pretty unique way of moving - you must grow to move. However, you cannot grow out of thin air; you are a living form, so you need fuel to do that. You must sacrifice parts of your colony, to make another part grow. Here comes the tricky part - you can't control the exact part of colony which will grow, you can only rely on it being on the opposite side of the destroyed part. You can also divide your colony, if you need to, but remember - the smaller part will die. Basically, to succeed you must think as hive-mind fungi colony.\n\n2. Level design. The authors decided to go with visual narration for their story, so the levels and backgrounds will tell you what happened. Wander through traps and debris of the abandoned world and absorb the history of a now-dead civilization. There are also hazards waiting for you, but they are generic: toxic liquids, spikes, fire, etc.\n\n3. Physics. It brings at least half of the fun. Let me give you an example. There is a puzzle in the game, where you attach your colony to a rotating gear, and then detach a tiny part of the fungi at a right moment, so it will reach a higher place, and then you do your best in destroying the main body (which is still on a rotating gear mind you), so the colony's small part can make it. It's pretty fun.\n\n4. Challenge. To overcome every obstacle and reach the ending, you'll need an agile mind along with good reflexes to back it up.\n\n5. Have you ever tried to defeat a level boss, playing as a fungi colony?\n\n6. Music. Developers went with electronic ambient music. Not a bad choice at all. It sets the mood and highlights some tones of crumbling world.\n\nAnd last two things that are not that great:\n\n1. The game is pretty short, just seven levels. It's kinda classic, but inevitably leads to next point.\n2. The difficulty curve rises very, very quick.\n\nNevertheless, it's very interesting to play.\n\nSo be prepared! The world of Mushroom11 is forsaken by good and is full of evil.\nHave fun, though!\n\nP.S.

As it is, only a very small fraction of players will have the skill and patience to finish the game - and that number will dwindle to zero for the less skilled casual audience.","October 19, 2015","true","7.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Truly amazing graphics. The gameplay and controls are much smoother than it appears at a glance. Addicting puzzles. Not the same style, but definitley on par with Portal as far as top-notch puzzle games go. 4/5 Worth the $15\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nMushroom 11 is very unique. Right from the beginning you know you've gotten into something strange...different.....fun. The gameplay and controls SEEM wonky until you actually try it out and get going, then it is actually VERY fluid. You essentially prune away at your amorphous blob to get it to move along the level. That's it. These levels, though....puzzles, obstacles and even bosses. That's right, there are some really fantastic boss battles in this little puzzle platformer about an amorphous blob. In fact, the boss battles are one of my favorite parts! I got that same feeling I got when I played Portal for the first time after accomplishing some of the puzzles, thinking to myself "Hey, you're pretty damn clever, Gamer Guy (In a Suit)!". The visuals are very beautiful, especially considering you are basically exploring a post-apocolyptic wasteland. The music is also well done, and (again) I am not big on most video game music. I cannot wait to dive in for more. This game is superb. A solid 4/5.

Mushroom 11 is a physics based puzzler, but one of the most innovative I have seen in a long time and calling it simply a physics based puzzler sells it short in the creativity on hand.\n\nFrom the control scheme to the bosses to the world that is hinted at, Mushroom 11 is interesting. The game is also really, really challenging near the end, but generous checkpoints stave off most of the pain that would otherwise be caused from having to comprehend a completely new way to play a game and puzzles that are non-intuitive at first because of the novelty of the systems.\n\nHighly recommended for the stout of heart who can deal with the difficulty.

Controlling the character with the mouse was unique. It had a learning curve to it. The game explain how to do it somewhat, but i feel some more instructions could help here. Its possible to move through most sections fast, but it isn't intuitive how to do it. This made the game annoying. However, the game made interesting use of its mechanics with interesting physics "puzzles". I especially liked the rocket riding challenges in Chapter 6. As someone who played a lot of Portal 2. If you like spending hours trying to make stacks of cubes or wall portal climb to try and break a chamber, this game feels like a good fit for you.\n\nOne thing that often felt unfair about this game is that your body can often get split into pieces and the camera follows the wrong one. Then when you try to get back together by erasing the other side and the side you wanted to stay is already going off the screen which destroys it, so you die. Another problem with the camera was that it would sometimes shake erratically causing lots of lag, while your trying to make a precise move. This doesn't happen too often, but I would propose to fix it by giving an option in the options menu for the player to control the camera. This couldn't be used to look ahead because the player will still get killed if they move the camera away from the character.\n\nOne great feature of this game is that all levels save individually, so if your trying to get 100% on one, and there's a tricky one you can't get, and you want to try a different level no deaths, then you don't have to lose progress on that level. This is something I didn't realise at first thats a really smart feature most games don't have.\n\nDon't expect to get all the acheivements from this one. The last chapter (level 7) is extremely hard to get no deaths. I don't think it's worth it. There is also a extremely well hidden "Strand" in each level. If you have lots of extra time and are looking for a challenging search this is a great part of the game, and adds replay value. If you don't have other games to get on to they're fun just to get. Check where they are on an online walkthrough video. Some acheivements are vague, and I can't find any information online about them.","May 31","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And it's great!\n\nThe underlying movement mechanism - where you destroy some of your cells to force it to grow back in a different shape - is very simple, but the beautiful design, endlessly changing landscapes and inventive puzzles means that it never gets old.\n\nIt's so beautifully slick, too. Your organism gloops, squeezes and squirms around with a fluidity that is by turns graceful and hilarious.\n\nProgression through the level is fairly A-B, with a few optional side-roads to find collectibles. You generally take on one puzzle (or speedy action sequence) at a time, with plenty of checkpoints between.\n\nThere's only the occasional bit of needless frustration - you finish off an end of chapter boss, only to have to perform some slow, painstaking final climb up a difficult chain just to finish the level, for instance.\n\nMy impressions so far of chapters 1 to 3 is that the game is quite gentle introducing itself to you - the puzzles don't get tricky for a while (variations on button pressing, simple see-saw physics puzzles etc), with the trickier bits coming more from when you need to somehow squeeze across a pool of lava without falling in. But I'm itching to get back to it - I can't wait to be challenged more.\n\nGreat soundtrack, too.

Buttersworth [E-308]","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068982092/","346 products in account","I finished this game yesterday and it was a very nice and unique puzzle game.\n\nThe main game feature is something I had never seen before. Your character is what I assume is Mushroom 11. A kind of goo with the ability to always regenerate itself to it's full mass. And the only input you have is some kind of eraser. You have to "erase" some part of the mushroom to make it regenerate on the other side.\n\nYou do this through 7 levels of increasing difficulty, each with tons of new features. The levels take 20 to 40 minutes each to complete on the first run. The game never gets old because you rarely have to do the same thing twice. You ride a cart and do sick jumps, you ride rockets, you race boulders and buildings falling down and you sculpt yourself into a bridge. There is also 7 bosses at the end of each level and each feel like a unique and fun challenge.\n\nThe worse that can happen is to get frustrated because of how hard the puzzle can be. Seriously, f*ck level 7. It took me 2 hours 20 to beat and the last boss wasn't even fun. I wish it would have been 2 shorter levels instead. Anyway, maybe that's just me being bad. I just want to do a heads up : This game can get frustrating.\n\nThere is one last thing I'd like to adress. Have you seen the video How to do Lore RIGHT in Video Games by gbay99? As a summary, he talks about his experience with lore in video games, specifically Runescape where the lore is not forced on the players but there to explore and discover.\nAnd Mushroom 11 feels exactly this way to me. Earlier, I wrote "Your character is what I assume is Mushroom 11." That's because I was never told that. There is no cutscenes, no cinematics, no hidden diary. You just start there and walk through levels. Just the first level gives you the setting of the story and I feel like there are a lot of details about what hapenned in the last two levels. Each boss feel like a weird concrete representation of those hints. Some kind of incarnation of what happenned there. The ending also leave you with more questions than answers. I think this is amazing and very well done!\n\nUnique and challenging puzzle game with amazing environnements and setting. Require both agility and wits, but you'll have a rough time if you don't like challenges.","January 31","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Basically, you have a... mushroom, I guess? When you erase parts of it, it regenerates the lost mass. In this way, you can erase it in one direction to make it move in the other,   erase parts of it to make it fit through holes, etc. There was some potential, but the actual mechanics and level design completely ruin it. When you erase a part of your mushroom, the mass is added back randomly throughout it. This means that if you want to mold it into a shape, say, a hook, you need to continually cut parts of mass off of it until it molds into your design. This leads to constant repitition, a very slow pace, and a generally monotonous, unfun game. The puzzles that accompany this mechanic aren't much better; none of them require any thought, and the challenge lies more in getting the game to do what you want than actually getting it done.

I feel that there wasn’t a whole lot of contrast between the colours, which isn’t my favourite look, but again, fits what the developers were going for. I think the highlight of the presentation is the way the goo grows, and the sound effects that come with it. It’s really well designed, and feels satisfying when you get the goo to go the way you want.\n\nMechanics Speaking of the way the goo works, it’s really difficult to explain. Even if it looks like it at first glance, you don’t actually play as the goo. You play as a sort of god-like guide for the goo, who’s only power is to erase the goo. That sounds really weird, and it kind of is, but basically you have to imagine it as though there is a certain amount of goo that has to be on the screen at all times. If you erase a section of the goo, it will grow back the same amount you erased only from different parts of the goo. This allows you to shape the goo in whatever way you please; you even have a much smaller “brush” that can make relatively fine modifications to the goo. The game continually presents new challenges to the player, and many times, like portal, it’s about thinking outside the box or approaching the situation differently.\n\nStory The thing that was disappointing for me i terms of the story, is that it isn’t well contextualized, and that’s why I compare it to the first portal. Though, even then the first portal had more of a heart to it than this game. Because, really, it feels like a tech demo, and that the whole game is just a stage to show of this one mechanic and not really much more than that. Another game that comes to mind is the first Assassin’s Creed. It pretty much totally lacks a story, and while it does have the post-apocalyptic world, it felt like you could have re-skinned it with anything. Would this game be different if the goo was instead cotton candy in a cotton candy factory? Not really. Not in any big way.\n\nSo this is what I mean. Portal 1 didn’t have the character and charm required to really be a masterpiece although it was still a great game. Portal 2 built upon the foundations that Portal 1 laid, and made a truly ground-breaking game that got, and deserved, universal acclaim. This game feels like an even more bare-bones version of Portal 1 -- so it shows so much promise, and was fun to play and is an all round really good game, but it was also an empty vessel. It doesn’t really have a soul to it.\n\nVerdict So as I mentioned before the game has 7 chapters and each will last, give or take 20 - 30 minutes. I think my longest was about 45 minutes, and my shortest was 13 minutes. So you’ll get about 3-4 hours out of this game, and maybe more if you go after the collectables which I didn’t do. $15 is reasonable for that amount of gameplay, and it’s pretty worthwhile gameplay too. It’s certainly fun, and becomes very challenging in the last few chapters so be aware of that. I’m recommending it, but if you’re only “kind of” interested in this game then wait for a sale. $5-10 for this game would be a steal.\n\nIf you’d prefer a video review have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJuFGP8hABk","October 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","10","21","2","0"

It also seems to be using its own unique engine rather than the unity engine that is prone to producing stutter making this one of the few 2D games in my library without stutter. Unfourtunately, the game becomes too tedious and hard on chapter 5 and downright impossible on chapter 7. Strangely chapter 6 was easier than both. Its relatively easy to find solutions to puzzles, the real challenge is in actually executing them and unfourtunately that can be too difficult to accomplish. Since only a really hardcore player would be able to finish this game, I can't recommend it to the general gaming population. This is a good example of why it is important to have a group of testers play through a game and see if they enjoy it before actually releasing itt. It's so obvious that only the developers playtested the game.\n\nupdate: turns out the devs did use unity.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/243160/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","A very novel sort of puzzle “platformer”, Mushroom 11 sees you in command of a ball of cells. You cannot move it around directly, but you do have the ability to erase cells, which causes the ball of cells to regrow said cells in some other location so long as the cells are touching a solid surface. By erasing cells, you can navigate the ball of cells through the levels, and even do such things as navigate through mine carts and steer rockets – all without any control over that the ability to delete cells where you want.\n\nThe game’s challenges are all fundamentally built around this central mechanic - growing along walls, creeping through tunnels, and otherwise making your way through the world. It is a very creative mechanic, and the game shows that there are a wide variety of things you can do with it. The early stages of the game feel very good, and you get to explore what it feels like to move the cells around and flow through narrow spaces and run over ground, both even and uneven.\n\nUnfortunately, while the game shows that you CAN do a lot of things with it, by the end of chapter 6 you are left with the question of whether or not they SHOULD have done many of these things. As the game goes on, the puzzles grow ever more sophisticated, but chapters 4, 5, and 6 introduce a number of new stage mechanics which ultimately prove to be extremely frustrating due to your lack of control over the cells. The aforementioned mine carts are somewhat frustrating to deal with – if you touch the tracks the mine carts run on, all you cells die instantly, in sharp contrast with other challenges in the game, where only the cells in contact with the hazard die (or in some cases, where the hazard creeps through the cells and kills them). While this section is generally not too troublesome, there are a few places where you’re likely to touch the tracks while trying to set off the mine carts in the first place, which is very frustrating. Moreover, your inability to actually directly control your cells starts to rear its ugly head here, as you must fling yourself through the air to complete many of these obstacles – and flinging yourself through the air feels very finicky and hard to control, as very small differences in your starting trajectory make a huge difference.\n\nThis only gets worse over the course of the game. Later puzzles much more frequently involve such “flinging” of your cells, which is often very frustrating for how erratic the outcome tends to be. You also end up with an entire set of puzzles – air currents which buoy your cells through the air – which is entirely based around being in the air and unable to control yourself in any meaningful way after you’ve launched. Such sections feel less like puzzles and more like trial-and-error gameplay as you try to get things just right so you get flung on the right trajectory. What you need to do in these areas is obvious, but actually doing it is very difficult and oftentimes frustrating.\n\nChapter 6 introduces rockets which your cells can ride through the air, and which explode when they (or the cells) hit any wall. It is here that your lack of control is at its very worse – while the rockets can be controlled, they’re very difficult to steer, and just after you get the hang of steering them vertically, you start having to steer them horizontally, which is even more of a crapshoot. These sections are, again, not really puzzles at all, but rather, again, trial-and-error gameplay of the worst variety, and are extremely tedious. The fifth and sixth levels, due to their mechanics, took upwards of 90 minutes to complete apiece, and much of it was spent tediously trying to get just the right trajectory, rather than coming up with clever ways to exploit the game mechanics.\n\nThe collectibles in the game, too, are kind of obnoxious. Many of them require very tedious processes to reach; rather than being about your ability to solve puzzles, instead they test your willingness to sit there and do something like build a very tall tower out of the cells, or your willingness to sit there and try to achieve the right trajectories while flinging cells. While some of these puzzles are quite clever, others are quite tiresome, and worst of all, if you beat a stage and have missed some of the collectibles, they all reset – you have to get all 50 collectibles in a stage in a single run, which is very annoying given that you have no idea where you missed the collectibles and the more tedious-to-reach collectibles must be grabbed in the same tedious manner as they were the first time.\n\nAll that being said, there are definitely some bright spots to the game as well. The bosses get increasingly difficult as the game goes on, but are actually reasonably enjoyable to combat, and all of them are puzzles to solve which are mostly not too bad to fight against, especially as progress while fighting them is saved. Having to fight a boss while not being able to directly control yourself sounds obnoxious, but in reality, it is surprisingly fun and flowing around the boss and setting them up to damage themselves or to reach the points which deal them damage is mostly reasonably enjoyable, and the attendant puzzles are mostly not too annoying – even the boss you must fight with rockets isn’t that bad, though, again, the annoyance of the uneven trajectories rears its ugly head again.\n\nVisually, the game is very beautiful, with the cells, enemies, levels, and backgrounds all looking excellent. The devastated, post-apocalyptic world of Mushroom 11 is pretty to navigate through, though it is likely that your concern with the puzzles will cause you to tune out the environment to some extent.\n\nAll in all, Mushroom 11 is interesting but deeply flawed. The fun of the early levels gives way to the frustration and trial-and-error gameplay of the later ones, and while the game is certainly a very interesting and novel concept, at times it gets so caught up with the fact that it can do something that it loses sight of whether or not it should be doing it.\n","January 1","false","11.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This means that damaged or "erased" cells will re-grow to the creature. The main mechanic in the game involves erasing part of the creature which makes that part of the creature re-grow somewhere else which you use to move the creature and solve the game's puzzles.\n\nThe game does a great job using this mechanic to create some interesting puzzles and boss fights. For the most part the mechanic works really well but the game does occasionally run into situations where the game keeps adding the new cells to an area of the creature where you didn't  want them to be moved to. This means that you sometimes have to waste time erasing the same part of the creature.\n\nWhile I haven't finished the game yet I am through four of the seven levels and I have played the game for a little over three hours. I am guessing that the game is around six hours long.\n\nIf you think the game's concept sounds interesting I think you will enjoy Mushroom 11. If you are a little more unsure about the game, I think you should at least consider purchasing the game during a sale since it is a really unique experience that I think most people should enjoy.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 15, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Unlike Portal, the game does not show a lot of playtesting and tuning.  In Portal, you always felt that the game was being fair.  If only I was a little bit smarter, I could figure out this puzzle.  In Mushroom 11, you will often be in a situation where the solution is clear, but you can't get your little cells into the exact place you need, while avoiding the hazards in the very strict time limit.\n\nI am a big fan of this genre.  Other games in this genre that I have liked are Swapper, Limbo and (to a lesser extent) Braid.  I found Mushroom 11 too frustrating to recommend.  It's too bad, because there is an awesome game here, waiting to be found.  Take out the frustrating bits and let the player skills grow organically like in Portal.  Distill the puzzles down to their fundamental elements.

I should have realized that when gravity is the dominant challenging factor that it was going to hurt. Once the organism starts rolling, there's precious little to be done about it; Even while regenerating it doesn't lose any momentum. I'm not sure about the physics of that. I just wish that the puzzles could exist more like a lab experiment, something you can think about and less of tests of agility and timing. Time is spent carefully paring the organism to make it reach a ledge. But I kept forgetting to let go of the button and I'd accidentally bisect the thing and lose my work. I think that the game design has a fundamental flaw: As you kill cells the organism regrows in random directions, away from your cursor. And there are spills of separated cells that you need to clean-up or else they could become something greater. Because it is random, you can't control what you're getting. So it becomes a cycle of kill, groom, klll, groom, kill, groom, etc. And your effectiveness at being able to do this and keep the thing reasonably under control will determine whether you succeed or fail.","October 25, 2015","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a novel twist on the platformer genre, adding physics puzzles to a biological blob. Initially, the levels are fun and the puzzles are challenging, but by the time you reach the final levels you realise things stop being fun, and just become frustrating.\n\nThe game excells in the art department however, from the nice detailed backgrounds, to the feel of the diverse biology, the post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and the ambient background music.\n\nThe control scheme of using a mouse to click and grow a tol that burns away the blob work well initally, but when you need more precise control later on it becomes difficult to use. Mostly because you have either a very small brush, or a big one that changes in size. This, plus the mechanic seems more geared towards a touch device where you can touch directly on what you want to change, rather than dragging a cursor around.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are initially simple, and soon become challenging, but solvable. But eventually they require very precise movements to complete, which in my mind are simply too difficult for the control scheme provided.","May 10","false","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First 3 level I loved the game. Next 2 levels I was baffled at how rather good levels had terrible boss designs. And Then Level 6 anihilated ani resemlbense of fun and enjoyment that I had with this game. So I just quit at about the first third of level 7. I just can't do this anymore.\n\nThis game has really good art design, fantastic soundtrack and great idea with the organism you indirectly control by removing parts of it, so it regains its mass in other parts. You can only control how bif the "erasure" is, so WHERE the mass appears is not controllable and with simulated physics, a lot of other mechanics are also out of your control and aren't set in stone. So, for the first few level developers fully acknowledge how much random chance dependent this game is and design levels and puzzles accordingly.\n\nAnd then they stop giving a damn. And level 6 is one huge "woops, you got unlucky" chain of events without real challenge or fun, just pure frustration and amazement that the developers thought that this is good design. It's not even the first game that falls into this trap - a fantastic game with liquid simulation also on sale here on Steam called Vessel also became rather annoying at times for the same reason of how absolutely unpredictable and random gameplay was. Except, that game never really hit rock bottom of bad design choices, just had missteps (and even fixed\rebalanced a lot of things with patches so the game is more fun). Mushroom 11 goes all the way with horrible.\n\nAnd it sucks. I loved this game when I started playing it. I was having a lot of fun. To see the game break itself so hard is unbelievable and inexcusable. If you want to check it out - you WILL enjoy the first few levels. They are genuinely fun. Just don't be surprised if you start hating this game the longer it goes.","May 14","false","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I thought I might get tired of the whole 'take any shape' mechanic, but I haven't yet because it's put to use in so many ways. The bosses are aggressive puzzles you have to figure out and the art design for the creatures and world is excellent. The story is told through what you see rather than dialogue, so you'll have to use your brain for that, too. It's really neat to go back over the chapters and notice new visual clues about what happened...\n\nJust one warning: the difficulty spikes are sharp in this game, especially in the last chapter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DariusRaider/recommended/243160/","DariusRaider","DariusOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DariusRaider/","1156 products in account","I´m kinda conflicted with Mushroom 11. On one hand looking back the experience was reasonable enough, but on the other this game manages to capture a lot of what is wrong with indie puzzle platformers. I think the polish and details elevate the experience somewhat, so keep that in mind as I list off the flaws.\n\nFirstly the gameplay pretty unique, and it´s unique because it´s bad and other devs haven´t gone with it for a good reason. Every moment feels like you are just abusing the mechanics as everything is heavily physics/RNG based and moving through the game is a constant struggle for that next save point. Moving around is enjoyable enough as long as it remains novel.\n\nDifficulty-wise first 2/3s of the game flows past nicely, but at a point the level of challenge and the physics-based gameplay come to a head and just unleash a torrent of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ obstacle after ♥♥♥♥♥♥ obstacle at the player.\n\nThe length of the game is good but it does say something about the game when after about 2.5 hours one is done with it. Short game is short and for a very good reason.\n\nAudiovisual design is what benefits most of the polish and tons of custom visuals, but the only actually good looking screen in the game is the main menu. The rest has a lot of effort put into it but it doesn´t translate into anything that I would consider beautiful or memorable. It is one great main menu though.\n\nOn the whole Mushroom 11 is a very forgettable experience that couldn´t really be fixed without replacing it entirely. Slightly smoother difficulty would make it painless but that wouldn´t actually make it good, and the mechanics are IMO flawed from the start. The visuals are good but would require so much more than tweaking to make actually interesting. Experiencing this game mechanic for the first time was fun enough on the whole but past novelty there isn´t much here.","May 4","false","7.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

As I read further and realized the emphasis would be more about puzzles, I supposed it might be a little more like Nihilumbra, meaning slow-paced + puzzles. After actually playing for a little more than an hour, I can say for sure that Mushroom 11 is much more a puzzle game than a platformer.\n\nIs that good or bad? I don't know, depends on which of those genres you like better. Personally, I'm usually not into complex puzzle games. I often find them tedious and generally uninteresting. This one, however, just like Nihilumbra, has a unique feel to it, that got me curious enough to keep going.\n\nWhen I first launched the game, I picked up my Xbox controller and was expecting to play with it. When the game wasn't responding to the controller, I checked the options menu, expecting to find there an option to activate it... except there was no such option. I imagined Grumpy Cat look at me and say "No controller for you, dumbass! Deal with it!". So I went on and started playing with the mouse. The control felt really awkward for me at first. It took me a while to figure it out, but I have been learning along the way. Also, the game is quite challenging. Most of the puzzles got me thinking for a while before I could find the solution. Same for the bosses, and I'm only at chapter 3 (out of 7).\n\nThe game looks and sounds well, the level designs are really cool, and maybe most importantly, it runs smoothly and quickly. Nothing too fancy about it - no extra weight.\n\nUgh... what now? Oh, right - the bottom line!\n\nWell, the bottom line is, that this game is mainly about patience, creativity and solving problems. You don't need fast reflexes or a good eye-hand coordination to play, but you do need to be patient and think. If you think that's for you - Mushroom 11 will definitely be a lot of fun for you. Otherwise, it might get tedious and frustrating very quickly.","October 15, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

With the Left Mouse Button, you erase it on one end, and it'll appear on the other. Using this, you can move across levels, or squeeze through multiple cracks. It's so satsifying to solve puzzles that might require you to build yourself into a tall tower, and then slowly fall over, or consume an enemy from ontop so it doesn't poison you. Pressing the Right MB will give you a smaller erasor for more precision.\n\nThe art style looks beautiful. From the background desolate city, to the foreground lifeforms. My main worry about the game was that it could have easily used its main mechanic as a gimmick, however it manages to present some really fun and clever puzzles.

The objective is to traverse a post-apocalyptic world with your green blob. The gameplay is extremely simple but works well. You delete cells in your blob with an eraser and immidiately new cells will grown in another place on the blob. You move around this way and can split up the blob and make it grow in different directions and sizes.

You have to evolve and adapt by 'erasing' or destroying parts of your own organism, which then grow back - but not in an order you'd expect.\n\nThis allegory carries through to the game's post-nuclear plot. An organism that evolved to survive nuclear fallout would definitely have to be a highly adaptable and quickly-regenerating one.\n\nBeyond that though, my own interpretation of this game is that it also has personal and political implications. When facing a tough challenge (and believe me, the challenges in this game are tough), be flexible and adaptable enough to erase your own outmoded ideologies. You will regenerate and in the process adapt around even the most daunting challenges.\n\nThis game is a work of art.","May 6","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are logical if difficult. If you are observant you will see what you have to do, even if it seems unlikely to be able to do it. Experimentation is better than walkthroughs for this game, The epilogue is a neat final puzzle that could be read different ways. Sometimes momentum works in your favor - though I wouldn't call it luck - the flow of physics in the game is sometimes unexpected, forcing you to alter your strategy.\n\nThe game is neither easy, nor arbitrary. The difficulty often is related to the fact that earlier puzzles have many different ways to solve them. As you progress, it is clear that the designers have 2 or maybe even one solution in mind, and you have to try to figure out what that is.\n\nDexterity and precision with the mouse is required.","May 14","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enter Mushroom 11, where you can't control your character directly - all you can do is erase a part of it. What you delete will regrow in a few seconds, randomly across the bulk of the fungus. Result: if you persistently delete the right side, the entire bulk will move to the left. And basically that's all.\nFor such an odd mechanic to work, the puzzle design needs to be ultra careful, and this is one area where the game shines - most of the tasks ahead of our hero are well thought-out, rarely very difficult, and the checkpoints are thankfully frequent.\nThe other aspect worth mentioning is the incredible background art and atmosphere.\n\nMushroom 11 is not without faults, either. One is a direct consequence of the base mechanic - whenever you need to do something with accuracy, you need a lot of luck or a lot of patience. The latter can run out easily when you're shaping your fungus into something elaborate for the umpteenth time, and still end up eg. falling down.\nThe other is more strange - at some points, the game seems to interfere with the physics, forcing a certain solution path. I met this only 2-3 times - one example is the cart ride in level 5 where I found it impossible to keep the fungus in the cart at a certain jump.\n\nBased on the above, there's a little secret to enjoying Musroom 11 - take breaks, even frequent breaks, depending on your skill. There are not many very difficult puzzles in the game (levels 5-7 are more difficult than 1-4, but not dramatically so), but the randomness tends to wear you down after a while, and you'll feel the game is unfair while it's only doing its thing relentlessly. Quit and come back tomorrow, it will feel fresh again.\n\nUntame has done a great job with Mushroom 11 - made a very brave move with the base mechanics, and designed an interesting and visually superb world around it. Definitely recommended.\n","May 14","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This leads to occasional, "Ohhhh right!" moments as you realise something you thought impossible is both possible and vital to the puzzle.\n\nIndie games FTW.","May 26","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very interesting mechanics that sometimes fight with you but in the end, they make you really think out the platforming puzzles.  The artwork is stellar.  The story is told from scenery and backgrounds but still feels really interesting.\n\nPros:\n-challenging\n-Gorgeous Art\n-New mechanics/Ideas (Original)\n- Good platforming and puzzles\n-Each boss is creepy, weird, beautiful, and memorable.\n-Each level feels unique and thematic\n\nCons:\n-If you hate games like super meat boy where you wanna scream and break stuff this is not your game.","May 25","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is interesting and creative with its amazing level and boss design. This game kept me hooked because of the re-playablility and almost-impossible difficulty. 3.5/5, loved it.","May 21","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You might think it's must not be much of a platformer without haing to mash the jump button but the game works great using its unique mechanic of morping you green goop with just the mouse.\n\nFor me the game was very easy, with most if the obsticles taking one or two tries to complete. It balances difficulty with checkpoints between difficult obsticle and allows for you to contine the boss fights even when you die. I found this game to be enjoyable and great for relaxing after work or some mindless fun on a lazy sunday afternoon.\n\nFor those who find the game too easy there are acheivments that will make the levels much more difficult to complete and might be quite stressful.\n\nWith beautiful graphics and flawless gameplay as well as the G rated content (no naughty stuff) I would this game for kids and adults alike.","May 13","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics, level design, everything is top-notch. Any bad thing I may have to say about the game is due to my disagreement with the devs' decisions, not due to the devs failing to execute their decisions well enough.\n\nThe core mechanics is really innovative and different. For that alone the game deserves a recommendation.\n\nSimply completing the game is moderately hard. Unlocking all the achievements is really very very hard. Think Super Meat Boy level of hard. If you don't intend to attempt to unlock all of them, the game may appear too short for its price. This game is really targeted at the masochistic kind of people who will replay the same level again and again until they finally manage to do it perfectly.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me was that all the puzzles only test reflexes and manual dexterity. I wish the puzzles were more similar to Portal or Braid, clever riddles that you have to strain your brains to solve, and once you solve them you'd get a new broader understanding of the game's mechanics, and the puzzle will appear obvious in retrospect. Alas, the devs decided to go another route.\n\nConnected to the previous point, I wish the core mechanics would change in later levels. Something like reagents that temporarily change your cohesion or make you smaller/faster/sticker. There are new elements that appear in later levels, but they're all in levels themselves - new objects to interact with, new liquids and traps. The mushroom itself stays exactly the same during the course of the entire game. Which is a shame.","June 2","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
