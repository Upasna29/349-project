A total of maybe 8 short voiceovers, less than a dozen items you could pick up (just to look at in slightly larger pixel format), and a trite, unmoving story.\n\nI'm sorry for the negative review, but I think people deserve to know the negative aspects before buying a game.\n\n(edited for what I guess was spoilers?

Turns out I didn't.\nFirst, it is stingy with the voice bits: I found interesting items that I thought would certainly trigger a monologue, such as the swing behind the house, which I thought would lead to a digression on the character's childhood. But nope, nothing happened when approaching that one and several other landmarks.\nSecond, it has one of the poorest implementations of invisible walls I've ever seen. There's for instance a big open wooden gate leading towards a house in the distance, but when you try to cross the threshhold, you simply can't advance anymore. Several other areas won't let you advance any further without even so much as fences to try and mask the invisible walls. Stinks of laziness by the dev's part.\nFinally, the landmarks that do have audio bits are very far apart and don't have any indications, meaning you'll spend most of the playtime walking slowly and aimlessly, trying to guess where to go next.\n\nThe only thing this game has going for itself is the faily soothing and melancholic atmosphere, which it manages to pull off despite the outdated graphics. It's super short and, even though I got it in a sale at the Humble Store, I still feel cheated off my money, which is something I've felt with very few games ever.\nIf you like exploration games, Gone Home, A Story Of My Uncle, and Mind: Path to Thalamus are all much better options.","May 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","42","54","3","1"

The title itself derives from a poem by T.S. Eliot, quoted below. It is a very short game but surprisingly rewards interest; voice acting and general ambience is spot on. Lacks many of the pretentions inherit in this genre of video gaming, namely in the form of Dear Esther. The narrative is relatable and has a simple beauty; its presentation is accessible and does not intend to overawe the player with literary jargon. Well worth the little fee I paid for it.\n\n“Home is where one starts from. As we grow older\nThe world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated\nOf dead and living. Not the intense moment\nIsolated, with no before and after,\nBut a lifetime burning in every moment\nAnd not the lifetime of one man only\nBut of old stones that cannot be deciphered.\nThere is a time for the evening under starlight,\nA time for the evening under lamplight\n(The evening with the photograph album).\nLove is most nearly itself\nWhen here and now cease to matter.\nOld men ought to be explorers\nHere or there does not matter\nWe must be still and still moving\nInto another intensity\nFor a further union, a deeper communion\nThrough the dark cold and the empty desolation,\nThe wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters\nOf the petrel and the porpoise.

Almost everything is told through the dialog which is limited to only English and has no option for subtitles, making this a game you can really only get the most out of if you can hear and understand what’s being said. Some basics of the girl’s past can be gleaned without the dialog, but the player will miss her personal feelings on things and a lot of the detail. Since there is no branching or any sort of time dependent events, the game lacks any replay value unless you’re looking for achievements. The achievements are fun and completing them all means you’ve found all the interactable items, dialog triggers, and “secrets” in the game, which gives a sense of completion. Partly because of there being no time related events, combined with the scenery and dialog, the game has a very relaxing feel to it that asks the player to simple sit and experience the story. The exploration is free form and everything except the last area (which unlocks after all the required dialog is triggered) can be done in any order. Along with this free form theme, the player isn’t given an explicit goal when starting the game. After exploring a while, it’ll become clear that the goal is to trigger the story and once you’ve found it, figure out a way to open the locked tool shed. There’s no puzzle to this part, you only have to explore the proper areas to trigger the necessary dialog before you’ll be told where to get the shed key and it’ll become obtainable. Another somewhat minor annoyance in the lack-of-direction department is that the player can indeed crouch in the game, but nothing tells you this. It’s only needed to get one side dialog, but for players trying to get the related achievement the game leaves you to figure that out on your own. Overall I found the story a wonderful although short experience. Players that are a fan of non-stereotypical female protagonists will also notice that the little girl in the story is a fan of electronics and space and has a gameboy in her room.","June 10, 2015","true","1.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","29","34","2","0"

It’s an experience where every object has been carefully placed to tell a poignant story—a story about childhood, hope, and the miracle of memory. You play as a little girl from a broken home somewhere in the American South. Exploring the lonely countryside reveals clues and vignettes which help the player answer the question of where home is—and how one can get there"\n\nalthough maybe some of that is actually a bit more ambiguous in the game itself.\n\nThat said, it was a pleasant little journey around the little girls home, and the triggers for unlocking memories were cool (or rather, the items and places were....). It was just a very nice way to spend a half hour or so. Definitely wander around and click on any objects that are different than the normal trash lying around, and wander everywhere. There are invisible fences (that are sort of indicated by visible fence posts, lol), so you really cant wander off that far and there is generally something to find in every direction.\n\nAs always, I sort of wish there was a fast walking option, but that is just a personal thing and not a requirement for the enjoyment of this game. I think it's worth visiting and give it 8 rememberances out of 10 while looking back upon your maybe less than idyllic youth.","August 31, 2015","true","2.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

Ten or so different voice overs, each of which is vague enough to be computer generated, and I really do mean that, no specifics. They have no connection to the scenery or what I'm interacting with. Or pulled from random pages of a journal so they don't have any shared context. There are perhaps 13-14 items to pick up and touch, though there is no real information you gather from them.\n\nThe music is really nice, though loops for a while and then just stops. Visually, half the assets are nice, and half are awful. Having them all in the similar quality vein would have been much preferred. There are achievements, yes and if you wish to do them all, it might take an hour, maybe a little bit more. There are *technically* multiple endings, but... even then they are vague and bring really nothing to any sort of central plot or story or even bring much context to the life of the main character.\n\nIt's an incredibly empty experience. Short enough to not leave any impact, or have long enough to build up any sort of story or plot or really anything. BUT HEY IT'S ONLY 3 DOLLARS RIGHT? Wish it was 20 bucks for like 10x the game.

It was hard to choose between a positive review and a negative review, so please keep on reading and understand my points\nStory:First off.. the storyline of the story is that you're a girl, remembering her past and childhood memories/experiences around the trailer and the areas around. What you're supposed to do is explore and find things that trigger a memory to the narrator and after a certain amount of items are found, you are given an 'objective' to find the key and you use it to (Spoiler ahead) open a locked shed, which in there you find a bicycle of when the narrator was young and you 'win' the game by riding on it.\nOpinion:I'm not sure what I want to say. Mainly, this is not the game I expected. I thought this would be more interactive and that there would be a solid story, not bits and pieces that don't really add up to a whole story. It was still a fun game, it kills off some time and some stuff are a challenge to find so that you may achieve all the achievements. The main goal it has set is to gain all the achievements, there are 8 of them and this requires you to find objects and interact with them and find places where it would trigger a memory to the narrator.\nList of Pros and ConsPros- Stunning Graphics\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=583096226\n- Good writing\n- You can choose your Screen resolution and graphics quality\n- Short game (Depending on what you prefer)\nCons- No save button\n- No solid goal\n- The world is of limited exploration\nTo buy or not to buyI would buy it if it's at a cheaper price than the original, it's not a bad game but it's not the greatest game. It's a game you play once. I'd rate it 5/10.","December 24, 2015","false","2.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","2"

The game is about a girl who explores the surroundings of her house after having missed the bus. The area that you explore is filled with secrets and details revealing your character's story, without being too much "in-your-face".\n\nGRAPHICSMade in the Unity engine, the game looks beautiful: everything, from the shadows to the lightning, feels photorealistic.

You are free to walk about and find points of interest to trigger more memories.\n\nThe Pros:Vague but Inticing back-story - I cannot comment on it, as it is very short and I would spoil the whole plot, but the narrator gives little information about her past, but which can be deduced upon to reveal the situation.\n\nCalming Music - While you explore, beautiful music will join you, which is quite relaxing in my opinion, and combined with the wonderful environments make this walking simulator enjoyable.\n\nEasy Achievements - There are 7 achievements, 6 of which can be completed in a single playthrough, and most of them concentrating on paying atention to story details and acting upon them, or simply discovering interactable items or locations.\n\nCheap - While usually I don't factor in cost when reviewing a game, this short story also asks very little of your wallet.\nCons:Very Short - The game took me around 35 minutes to fully complete and explore, leaving very little replayability.\n\nLittle Narration - There are only about 10 short auditory narration triggers. The story told is more visual that audible. Could have been much more.\n\nMediocre Visuals - While the game looks good, and the lighting is just right, it suffers from low anti-aliasing and dodgy shortcuts, such as textures that rotate with you and flimsy foilage.\nConclusionThis is a good one-time-only exploration game with a lovely athmosphere and an apparently shallow, but deep backstory. If you are into short visual story-telling and walking simulators, pick this up, especially due to its low price.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 23, 2015","true","0.7"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","15","24","2","0"

Developed by David Wehle, I bought this game for the low price and the high rating that it had, I had a feeling that I wasn’t going to be disappointed, and I was right to feel that way.\n\nHome is where One Starts begins when a young girl misses her school bus one morning and decides to roam around the trailer where she and her father live, and the beautiful nature that surrounds it, while she recounts how she felt that morning, and many other of the days she spent there. The game is a soft and straightforward story of exploration and discovery, but the narration that you unlock as you walk around tells you of a dark past of a scared, lonely girl, and her alcoholic father.\n\nIn terms of the main character, not much can be said. Details are kept so minimal that she could be absolutely any girl, but it is her feelings and wishes that are made clear to the player, us. As the morning goes by, the early sun shinning through the trees, you walk around finding lost toys and forgotten things, sometimes throw away on purpose, amongst the trash that is scattered around her trailer.\n\nThe game takes about 20 to 30 minutes to finish, and there are a few alternative endings depending on the things you were able to find, on the aspects of her story she ends up telling you about, and the direction that you decide to take when everything comes together and it ends.\n\nAll in all, Home is where One Stars is simply what the title tells you, a story of self reflection and perhaps self discovery. It is a short but satisfying story, with beautiful music and amazing graphics I originally wasn’t entirely expecting. For a mere 3.29$ on steam, I would say that it would be completely ridiculous for you not to go buy this gorgeous and touching game, and play it in one sitting.\n\nSmall con: The game has no save button, but considering how short it is, it is very easy to finish in one sitting.\n\nBig pro: Gorgeous graphics.\n","March 30","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While I don't think it ends up being as great as Gone Home it’s still quite good.  The dev has said that he was inspired by Gone Home and Dear Esther and I can compliment the game in that it’s much more like Gone Home and it’s down to earth humanity and getting the player involved through exploration instead of Dear Esther which was too busy verbally masturbating all over itself to form any kind of meaningful story, character, theme, emotional resonance, or player engagement. The atmosphere in HiWONS is really damn good, the writing is grounded and nicely done and the voice acting really gels with and adds to it as well. There's also enough things to find to make the game interesting, there are still things I need to find that I missed in my first playthrough. Considering that this game was pretty much made by one dude that only did it as a hobby it definitely puts some games to shame, it sure as hell puts Dear Esther to shame.\n\nOverall if you loved Gone Home and other exploration based narrative games you will enjoy this. It's not long but I felt what was here was quality stuff. Hopefully the dev doesn't just stop here and makes more because this a nice start.","May 13, 2015","true","0.6"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","13","22","2","1"

Sadly, I left feeling disappointed overall for several reasons.\n\nThe setting was what drew me to the game, but it was also the biggest disappointment. The American South has a lot of unique cultural attributes, very few of which are in the game. There's no kudzu on the trees, the dirt is a generic brown instead of southern red clay, and the whole map lacks a sense of verticality that I associate with the south. The map draws you inside of its history, and it makes you feel boxed in, but things are subtly "off" enough that I can't get really immersed.\n\nThe interior environment also has some missed potential. There are mentions of oj, milk, beer, and mushroom soup, but nothing of actual southern food. A mention of grits, iced tea, chicken-fried-steak or something else could really help contextualize the setting as being distinctly southern. There's no mention of religion or the type of work the father does, which could have given him some needed personality. Lastly, the examinable book in the father's room is The Middle Parts of Fortune, which seems like an odd choice. It's a book about WW1 by an Australian author, does it have a special relevance to the author or setting? If not, Twain or something would have been a better fit.\n\nFinally, a few things stood out as strange to me. The family lives in a two bedroom trailer designed for mobility, but there are two bathtubs inside, which is rare. There aren't many clothes in the closets. The rooms feel unusually barren, especially without the trash. I'm also a bit confused on when exactly the game happens. The protagonist mentions Princess Leia, and there are VHS tapes in the living room, which makes me think it's set in the 80's or very early 90's. However, the protagonist owns a computer, which is uncommon for that time, especially for such a poor family. Speaking of the computer, it's a bit out of character to leave computer parts strewn around the floor where they could get dirty or stepped on. It's one of her few means of escape, so she would logically want to take good care of it. Lastly, there are three identical gardening books stacked on the same shelf, and other repeated assets that don't really make sense in context.\n\nA lot of my complaints here may be petty, and may be limited by the development time or the engine or something, but I think it's important to go into detail about what didn't work. This is a game about childhood, so people will be looking for things that trigger nostalgic memories. This is a walking simulator, so players will be pondering about the deeper significance of what's going on. In both cases, attention to detail is paramount, and it's where Home is Where One Starts lost me.\n\nHaving said all that, I still think positively about Home is Where One Starts. There's a beautiful idea for a game here, and a little more polish would have helped it really stand out. Currently, there are free games on gamejolt that are of a similar caliber to this one, but I don't mean that as an insult. Was I disappointed? Yes. Does that make it a bad game? Not necessarily. David Wehle exposed some of his humanity on this project, and I respect that a lot.\n\nI look forward to your next game.","April 3","true","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This is one of those "video games as art" pieces that may or may not give you the feels, but is certainly all about evoking a feeling or an emotion in an experimentally narrative way. There really isn't a traditional story with a start, middle, and end, nor are there lots of fully fleshed out characters. You aren't going to find drama, plot twists, or anything that feels like it's heading anywhere to some sort of conclusion. Instead this piece puts you in the frame of mind of someone else for a brief (and I mean brief) period of time in a way that let's you inhabit that person's mind and perhaps share something of their perspective. If you loathe games like Going Home, or the Moon Sliver, then you should probably avoid this one, but if you are open to something different and you want to have a brief, but possibly sweet, experience, give this one a go. You've probably dropped three or four quarters in an arcade game or pinball machine before and ran out of lives/balls within 5 minutes.

She misses the bus to school and chooses to explore while her father is at work. The first-person narration describes what the girl is like and how bad her home life is, mostly describing memories, and finally, describing one big decision the girl has to make to change her life for the better.\n\nI don't like the tag "walking simulator" because it implies that story-driven games like "Home is Where One Starts" are just walking around and looking at stuff. I mean, if you strip it down to its bones, that's exactly what it is, but... in order to enjoy games like these you have to find a way to connect yourself with the emotions that are being presented in that walking around and looking at stuff. How does the scenery in the game make you feel? How does the music make you feel? Are you worried about the protagonist and what might happen to them?\n\nIf you pick up a bloody knife in a survival horror game, it's just a weapon to you, right? But if you were to pick that up in a, cough, "walking simulator" game, you have to imagine what the protagonist would feel when finding something horrific like that in an empty house. You can't think of games like this is "games", you have to think of them as books or movies where you control what happens. You have to think of them as experiences. That's when you can start to enjoy them.","July 13, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

So it's got the attention of people, now. Where the game fails isn't in the main story, which. Is still very underwhelming. But it fails in that some things you'll need to explore to learn about, and with the slow paced walking and boring looking visuals and lack of music to keep you occupied until you find these things. That's what makes me feel like this isn't worth my money\n\nIt says that this game is in the same style of other games like Gone Home or Dear Esther, I've never played Gone home, but i have played Dear Esther. And the thing with Dear Esther was that the narration in the game was focused on the main path, if you strayed off the path there wasn't anything to gain but for you to maybe admire some fine scenery or purely curriosity. And what Dear Esther had as an advantage for you to actually explore was it's interesting enviorment, atmosphere (and for an idea game) really good looks and that is what actually motivated you to explore further, even if there's little if even any gain for doing so.\n\nThis game faults in the thing that it's more open world, it's not liniar. You're free to walk around in an open plain but yet limited by invisible walls in this game, in Dear Esther the island you were on was very open, but it only allowed you to walk where you actually could, there wasn't any invisible walls or anything, at least not that i came across. They always made sure that if there was some place you couldn't go to, it was because it was either too steep hill, a fence blocking the path or just a vast ocean. This game is limited even if it offer exploration, with its invisible walls everwhere and frankly the visuals aren't that nice or too appealing to give you that desire to stop and admire the look, neither does it to explore as the are is very booring. I feel that you would have been best off in this if they focused more on telling the story a bit more, rather than letting you walk around on a small plain and find a few things here and there that you honestly might not care about. Like if you walk up to a graveyard the narrator (which is the girl) will more or less just say how she one time got spooked going there. I mean, sorry. But what is there for good in me knowing that? In Dear Esther they spoke more unclear, and with metaphores meaning you'd have to think, and puzzle the story the narrator explains toghether, so you can't just walk completely braindead, but in this game you can.\n\nI feel this game failed to suck me in with any atmosphere and the fact that it cost almost half of what Dear Esther does (when not on sale), a game that has more land to explore, greater atmospher, better narration and more interesting vissuals just makes me unable to call this a worthy purchase. If you feel it's worth a try, i'd say go for it. There isn't anything in this game that'll occupy you for 2 hours, so you can refund the game after you've played it.\n\n\nIf this story was written by the dev who went through this as a child, then i'm sorry for what you've gone through. But i simply dislike the way the story is told. Not the story itself.","November 13, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Well, there are some things that should be said from the get go. It's a Unity game, it's a "walking simulator" and it's very very short. If these three things are things you avoid in games, HIWOS is not going to be the quintessential interactive narrative game that'll blow you away. It is, in my opinion, pretty good though. The writing is sparse but good. I like the voice actor. The game is pretty but it's Unity pretty so it's the kind of pretty you've seen a hundred times over most likely. The interactive elements are very few and far between which is a shame. If there was just more content and more of a story, this could truly be a game to remember. Instead it's just a pretty setpiece with some genuinely good writing every 5 minutes. Home is where one starts is less a book than a poem. It's a nice poem, but it's like most other poems. You read it once, think "oh that's nice", but it has no lasting impact on your worldview or emotions. It was only a dollar on sale though, so if you don't mind spending a dollar to listen to peaceful music and hearing some nice voice acting and writing over 40 minutes, then go ahead.

The setting is beautiful, the music is good, and the melancholic tone of the game creates an atmosphere of sadness, though puncuated with the beauty of what could be. It's a game that leaves you feeling a little empty, though hopeful, I suppose. You are free to explore a very  wide open area, with some very interesting features listening to the pleasing voice acting, and discerning the time and place of this young girl's life and what constitutes normal for her.\n\nIt's not a game that I'm likely to return to, though after enough time I may boot it up to explore the surroundings again. It's worth the price of admission and does a good job of what it attempts to do. It's a short story the player gets to walk through, and it's aesthically beautiful, and tonally melancholic.","March 24","true","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game "play", if you can call it that, boils down to walking around aimlessly hoping that the object you find will trigger some sort of narration or plot development.  Without a walkthrough you will be walking around a long, long time. I explored this and tried different avenues and objects for 20 minutes, succeeding in only unlocking about a minutes worth of dialogue. Despite having unlocked most of the major dialogue, the game wouldn't let me progress because I hadn't found a football.\n\nThere is also no save function or autosave, so be warned that quitting will reset the walking simulator (or "game", if we're being generous) leaving you to plod to all prior locations.\n\nTl;dr: Painfully drawn out and seemingly devoid of content.

I'm not sure whether I should recommend this or not.   There is a scarce amount of dialogue here.  The game could take you maybe an hour if not less to complete all the way through - that includes finding all the dialogue areas and items you can pick up. The incomplete story could be intriguing to some players, as you find yourself thinking of the different outcomes.  Some people like that.  Some people do not.\n\nPossible spoilers below\nI was a bit annoyed that some items and areas did not have dialogue, and that beyond the fence was completely blocked off. You find yourself walking circles to find what little there is because it's completely scattered about. I figured I would hear a speech about the swing, the broken down vechiles in the yard, the neighbors houses, more to the cemetary that is oddly placed in her backyard...\n\nThere's lots of odd items that you can pickup that do not give you any additional information. You simply can pick them up and look at them, which isn't all that interesting if it serves no purpose to the story or the ending.\n\nHome is Where One Starts...  has potential , but it leaves a lot to be desired in the meantime.\n","September 5, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For value for money, that's pretty good considering this is closer to a film than a traditional game.\n\nAnyway... you are a young girl in the throes of younghood exploring the world of her drunken father and miserable child-dom in the ♥♥♥♥ end of nowhere. You have 'areas of interest' which trigger wonderfully emotive voiceovers as you explore a memory(?) of a past experience - a siginficant time where she realised her youth was slipping away. There are invisible boundaries but this is cleverly played as a result of fear of leaving the area, missing school, fatherly retribution, etc. and you must conquer her fear somehow plot device but well done.\n\nLooks-wise, yeah it's good. Environmental design and layout is pretty good, actually, considering it's a small sandbox. It feels like there's an equally grim and desolate world of beautiful sunlight and hay bales outside of the invisible boundaries. It also hints at that nostalgia of the 90s childhood where the world is wondrous and we all dreamed of a better, higher place like space, or how far birds can fly before school utterly crushed it in a miserable hate-fueled horrible education system. The sound design is also rather lovely and it knows when to shut up and just let you enjoy the ambient sounds. It's brevity is almost its strongest point. to the point, but still /alluding/ to beatings and hiding in bedrooms rather than blurting it out (bar one moment where you go looking for a 'hidden' item). It's cute, whimsical, sad, and like childhood, reflects that transient happiness/sadness/naivety. There's no pretense, no smarmyness or 'look at my huge depth'. It's to the point without losing the emotion it attempts to rise in ya. This is the thing about smaller developments with only WASD and right click - atmosphere and looks are bolsted and in a way which positively impacts upon the story\n\nSure, it's trying a little too hard to be other, better walking simulator deep and sad/happy games *cough*gone home*cough* but considering this is a two-person development with at least two playthroughs worth of gameplay that looks, sounds, and is quite lovely and never outstays its welcome and is literally two quid, you'd be silly not to buy it.

There are no puzzles, no enemies (at least not in the traditional sense, i.e. no combat), no stats or levels.  Please know this when you're buying the game so you know what you're getting.\n\nLet me just say that I love this game.  It is VERY short, but I don't feel cheated by the cost as it's only $2.99 at full price and I feel like the atmosphere and exploration is worth a few dollars.\n\nThis game is entirely based on exploration.  It feels like you're essentially walking through a child's memory of a single day in her life where something a little unordinary happens.  You aren't force-fed the details of her life; it's up to you to look around, walk around, see the items and scenery, listen to the occasional narratives, and then build your view of her life from that.  There are many things you can see that don't have attached narration, leaving you free to form your own ideas.  If you take time to really pay attention, it crafts an intriguing (although extremely sad) look into a broken home.\n\nThe music is soothing, calm, and very pretty and fits the atmosphere.  The narrator does an excellent job, believable and not melodramatic.  She sounds like an ordinary person, which is exactly how she should sound.\n\nGraphics are decent, not necessarily top-of-the-line but I felt they painted the scene nicely.\n\nSo if you like the exploration/walking-simulator genre of games, this is certainly worth a playthrough (or two, if you missed things).  If you feel the price is a little high for the length of the game, wait for a sale, but I felt that the full price was reasonable.","May 26, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's not for everyone, but for those that like "walking simulators" (BTW ♥♥♥♥ that name) will most likely enjoy this beautiful little piece of narrative driven story telling.\n\nYou play as a unnamed (Six?) year old girl as you walk around the area of your home. The game's way of telling it's story is by letting you find places or items that the voice of a older woman ("us" in the future) will start to talk about, it's very exploration driven. This game is basically a woman retelling a special morning of her childhood.\n\nThe visuals are very nice, not the best I've ever seen in unity, but it definitely sets the mood along with the sounds which are quite nice.\n\nThe music which mostly consists of The Tumbled Sea's song called "//", a very nice piece of ambient/post-rock(?) music, however the quality of the song is somewhat downgraded in-game which has been a small annoyance but nevertheless works well and fits the environment.\n\nEven though the game's length is usually 15-30 minutes, you can still search for achievements which I did (I have them all now).\n\nTherefore, I suggest this game, it's price, it's length and atmosphere. It's too good to not recommend.\n\nSo check it out.","May 14, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

It's short (I doubt it will take anyone more than half an hour to complete) and more of a mood piece than an actual story, but it's creatively solid and quite poignant, giving the feeling of inhabiting a single, important memory.\n\nSteam is becoming infamous for quick, lazy cash-grabs made of Unity assets; this isn't one of those. It's very clear that the game was made on a low budget, but the developer has worked smartly with their limited resources to make something with a cohesive and solid atmosphere, helped by great music and voice acting. And I absolutely loved the ending, for reasons I won't go into here- simple but powerful, like the rest of the game.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the game area is quite large and cluttered with trees and other objects; this gives you a wider area to explore but can also make it unnesecarily difficult to track down the points that trigger narration. I think a more compact world would have worked better.\n\nAgain: if you hated Gone Home, don't pick this up thinking you're going to like it. It's even more Gone Home than Gone Home was, if that makes sense. But if that game grabbed you and you're looking for a quick fix while you wait for Fullbright's follow up, definitely check this out.\n\nI hope the developers go on and to bigger and better things, they've clearly got some real creative chops.","May 28, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This one comes closest to being a net positive for me, but the walking speed is atrociously slow, and it simply takes too long to explore and find the interactive objects and locations. I'm not saying that it needs to be a race to the finish, but I can't imagine moving as slowly IRL as the character in this game does, it's agonizing at times when you want to check a place and have to slowly trudge there step by step. The setting and story are interesting, and I expect could really resonate with people who dealt with such issues as an alcoholic parent. There's no real direction for how to finish except to find things that happen to trigger memories and advance your understanding.","May 6","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not anymore, at least. And I don't mind walking simulators. There are some good ones out there like The Stanley Parable... and the Stanley Parable... and did I mention the Stanley Parable?\n\nHome Is Where One Starts tells the story of a girl returning to an old trailer that she lived in with a drunk father, and you get to explore the area that she once lived in, as she recounts of her memories there. Under normal circumstances, this seems just like the kind of game I'd like, isn't it?\n\nBut these aren't normal circumstances.\n\nFirst off, the world you visit, while pretty to look at is very stale after a while. There's only a handful of interactive items interspersed in this world that you can find, and actually finding them seems more like a chore, as the dog food and flask seemed more like a game of a scavenger hunt, but I wasn't promised a prize at the end.\n\nAlong with that, there really isn't anything unique to learn about the girl. Her dad was an abusive drunk, she liked space, and she liked to live out on her own, to create space from her father. Beyond that, she mentions little to nothing of her neighbors, her friends from school, her friends from out of school, her mother, her other relatives, the relationship her parents had. For a world she lived in, there aren't a lot of memories to be stimulated. Just a lot of things to look at with her voiceover telling you their significance.\n\nIf this game looks like the sort of artistic walking simulator that will whet your appetite, then by all means buy it. I'm sure you'd get more entertainment from it that I did. But I'm, unfortunately, giving this one a 5/10. I actually did want to like this game, but the lack of complexity or uniqueness makes this an ultimately forgettable experience.","April 30","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There were a few objects that you are able to examine but a lot of them did not trigger any sort of dialogue which left me feeling that there was really no point of being able to look at it.

There isn't that much of a 'story' in the game but the narrator's history will come out piece by piece (and it will make a story kind of). There isn't much to do in the game and the area you can explore it is pretty small, but it was still bigger than i thought it would be. The game is really relaxing, and the graphics are amazing, as well as the lightning. There are some objects you can pick up, and that was a pretty cool add to the game. At one point i got pretty frustrated because i didn't know what to do, but this game is about exploring, and you'll eventually complete the game. It was pretty short, but at the end if it was longer, i wouldn't have enjoyed it that much. IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you'll get all the achievements. If i didn't do all of them, i would've missed about 50-60% of the game, so make sure you'll see everything, cause it's totally worth it. Overall, i really enjoyed the game, and recommend to play it. It could've been done better, but for a 0.89€ game i'm 100% happy with it.\n\nPROS:\n\n- The game looks amazing (Graphichs & Lightning. Super awesome)\n- Cheap, i got it for only 0.89€\n- Even though it wasn't long and the story part was kinda short, it was still really awesome.\n- Awesome music\n- Free exploration, which made the game really relaxing. You don't need to hurry anywhere.\n- Someone said there are no subtitles. Yes there are, only English tho.\n\n\ncons?:\n\n- At first, the invisible walls which suddenly appear when you walk too far. BUT in the end there actually is a pretty good explanation for them, so not that much of a con.\n- The game seems to be made with a low budget, but for a low budget game it's hella good.\n\n\nOVERALL ~ If you have a little money left on steam, and feel like you want to play something relaxing and you're kinda bored, this is a perfect game for you then. I really like games like this, so i would totally rate it at 9/10. Recommended.","September 6, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did enjoy the story told by the girl and the moment of pure freedom the ending provides but the walks between important places/objects were dull at best due to the terrible walking speed paired with an explorable zone that, while not overly large, is big enough to make your lethargic movements a problem. The fact some objects are also very well hidden kinda goes against the fact the player'd be able to experience the story...why do I have to wander the woods aimlessly to find an important object? It's not fun and serves no real purpose.\n\nAs mentioned before the fact many objects can be picked up and examined but provide no voiceover is also a shame...sure I can imagine a story for them but I think it'd have been much better if the girl told us why they seem meaningful enough to be picked up and how they ended up where they are.\n\nHome is Where One Starts sadly aeppeared after games like Dear Esther and Gone Home gave us much better examples in the genre and it suffers from it. That said I still enjoyed my time with the game and that's why I'm giving a thumbs up despite its problems.\n\nShould you buy it? It depends. If you're ok with the aimless wandering or with following a guide so that you can cut on the painfully slow exploration then go for it, the story has enough merits to warrant a playthrough. If not you can safely skip it and go for better games in the genre. Just be sure to get it for the 1$ sale price or on a bundle.\n\n","September 3, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play an anonymous girl/young woman taking a look at her old home where she spent her childhood (I think...).\nYou walk around, you look at things while the character eventually narrates over it, you explore the place (the nature and her childhood home). There's nothing else to do. You don't have to avoid or fight obstacles and enemies, you don't have to use strategy and you don't have to collect objects (except for one).\nIt's a game you can finish in one short sitting but the reason why I still needed 1.6 hours for it was because I tried to find all the relevant objects which is not always easy (finding them can get you an achievement) and because the character never runs, she just walks rather slowly which also eats up time.\n\nCan I recommend it?\nIf you wanna try this "walking simulator" that offers you not much more but a good portion of atmosphere and nostalgia for about 30 or 60 minutes, go ahead. But stay away from it if you demand a minimum of action and adventure.\nBut nevertheless, I don't think it is a must-have.","September 11, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was gentle, peaceful (for the most part), and for me personally, nostalgic - in way both good and bad. The life of the protagonist was obviously difficult, but not without joy. I image them growing up to be an astronomer or electrician just as the game hinted they would. The narration was also very believable and nicely done. I continually found new things on following playthroughs that even kept it interesting past the developers intended playtime. (Apparently people are speed-running it... somehow).\n\nI have always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with walking sims. I either adore them and their slow method of storytelling (as I did Rapture) or despise them (sorry folks, it was a great experience for some, I'm sure, but Dear Esther just didn't do it for me.) This one however was long enough to draw me in and I honestly wanted to see more of the young protagonists life and memory. This was kind of a flaw for me in that I would've loved to have more and the ending felt somewhat abrupt. I wonder how much of the game was inspired by experiences the developer had as a child - I can't image where else certain things in the game came from.\n\nThere are a few glitches that could use work - I occasionally walked through scenery, the game occasionally crashed, and appears to freeze when attempting to close, but this could be to do with my only being able to play on PC, and not owning an Oculus. I imagine that would not have such a problem.\n\nPros.\nBeautiful graphics and music.\nBelievable narration well merged with the plot.\nSubtle, but believable storytelling.\nEmpathetic protagonist.\nCons\nSome mild gltiches with scenery\nOccaisonal crashes with seeming no consistency.\nVery short and with a quite abrupt ending.\n","May 11","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
