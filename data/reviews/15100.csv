"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/recommended/15100/","Ank501","Ank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/","1595 products in account","Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft.\n\nThe first of the series, this game tells the story of Desmond Miles, an assassin descendant who tried to escape his life as an assassin and try to live like normal people. Instead he got kidnapped by the Abstergo Industries. There, his real adventure begins. Desmond is forced to interface with the Animus, a device that is capable to replay genetic memories of the user's ancestors. The Abstergo seeks to uncover information about Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, a legendary assassin from the Third Crusade.\n\nThe gameplay of Assassin's Creed is quite interesting but also very repetitive and linear. It's repetitive because before you assassination missions begin, you need to conduct some side mission to get information for your main mission. The side mission include pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interogation and completing various task of your fellow assassin's which include, killing guards, race or flag capturing. You will do those side missions everytime you're going to assassinate someone. The good part is, you are free to choose which side mission you want to complete, only 3 from 6 side missions needed for the main missions to unlock. The freedom of the game is also quite big. You can explore the whole city of Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Kill guards from behind, help civilian from rogue soldiers, find and kill templar soldiers or climb a tower and perform a leap of faith. You can travel from a city to another city with horses. Despite all these freedom, the game is till linear.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and amazingly detailed. The textures are just, amazing. The animation are also very great. The physics effect are also good, you can watch dead guard roll over the rooftops and eventually fall to the ground. The lightning is perfect too. The environment combined with the AI make the game feels more alive with the civilians walking around, the guards patrolling about and some beggars will try to annoy you.\n\nAssassin's Creed is a good start if you want to dive into the world of Assassin's Creed series as this game contains the foundation of the whole story. Even with linear story, you still have the freedom to do many things in this game. I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","June 1, 2014","true","18.6"," 73 of 78 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","73","78","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/15100/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","- Personal Rating: "Single Playthrough"\n- Traditional Rating: "7 / 10"\n\nThe first game in the now very popular Assassin's Creed franchise. While this entry wasn't as popular as the following sequels, it's still a pretty decent game even now in it's own right. In this entry, you play as the arrogant Altair (and Desmond controlling him through a machine called "The Animus") as he is forced to recover his original rank among the Brotherhood after a mission gone wrong.\n\nNow, bearing in the mind that this IS the first game in the series - the game has two "stances" combat and movement. In movement, there are further two stances - Blended mode, movement is slower but makes you less conspicuous, even less so if you use the "Blend" command and then there's the "Free Run" mode, where you hold down a key/button and movement will be much faster and will be able to automatically scale walls, jump from buildings, etc as well as do a more "flashy" assassination maneuver. The combat stance is accessed when you are locking on to an enemy and have a weapon drawn. By holding the same key/button you use for "Freerun" is the same key you use to block incoming enemy attacks, the rest of the moveset is a your standard attack, grapple and step (dodge) - by holding the block key and pressing the attack key will initiate the Counter animation (when unlocked). It's not a very complex system but it works and is fun to experiment with.\n\nAltair has with him an arsenal that gets bigger as you progress through the game (Yes story, not collectibles). You start out with a standard sword and of course your handy Hidden Blade. Later on, you gain the (overpowered) throwing daggers and a better standard sword. Now I made a mention of the daggers per se because you will be using these a LOT. They one shot enemies off combat or if you're far away from them, they work on Assassination targets fights by decreasing their health by quite a lot and staving regular enemies off easy.\n\nNow the real meat of the game is, of course, exploration and assassinations. Each city and the road in between them is filled with bustling life that looks and feels very natural as well as enemies and NPCs react to what you're doing very realistically - like say if you're scaling a wall, an NPC will say something according to it. Every city, like Jerusalem, Acre, etc - is very detailed themselves and is a visual treat to see. The enemies and NPC models are pretty well varied across each city with minor details changed up in faces to distinguish some people from others, their facial expressions and the such are also pretty decent, though not as good as Altair's.\n\nAs far as your objectives in the game go... it's nothing very interesting, at all. Each city has about the same objectives everytime you're sent on an Assassination mission - you're forced to climb up to Synchronization points scattered through that city until you find "Investigation" missions, which serve more as game padding than anything else in my opinion because they aren't varied enough. Two of them involving fellow assassin's have you racing from Point A to point B within an alloted amount of time, another has you "stealth" killing special enemies - other missions involve "Interrogations, which have you following an NPC around till you feel it's a correct time to beat the information out of that person, another has you "Eavesdropping", a mission that has you merely sit on a bench and listen to two NPC babble on, and one that involves listening to NPCs babble on about some special item, whom which you "Pickpocket" from them. You only need atleast 2 or 3 out of the usual 6 per Assassination Mission to actually access the Assassination mission. And this process will repeat about 9 or so times throughout the ENTIRE game. One issue I had with the game was that it felt a little too random at times. There were times where I failed an investigation mission, had to kill the enemies or die so I could restart it merely because there was a group of enemies walking by that for some reason notice you while others don't. It was irritating. - However the actual assassination missions are amazing, and easily the most fun you will have in the game. You can complete most assassination missions without being seen and resorting to combat since there's no set timer and the game forces you to think your options through and act accordingly. Some later missions sadly force you to resort to combat, which lessens the impact the assassination has because it's a bit random, you can be fighting a group of enemies and then another second when you counter ANOTHER enemy, you'll see Altair jump on top of the target and kill him randomly.\n\nAn issue I did have with the game that may put off a lot of people - combat. The combat is generally really slow and clunky and is really random. At first, the enemies behave pretty predictably and are easy to kill - more so considering that they actually wait until you kill someone else first and just stare at you brutally murdering them THEN decide to attack you, or some enemies actually flinch allowing for an easy chain kill - then they start countering your moves as enemies get stronger. Unlike what you may read around, no, later on in the game, most counters will NOT one hit kill enemies, Altair may just push them back and you have to do that killing yourself by attacking the downed enemy. Something that I felt was rather random was sometimes the counters don't seem to work outright, and you end up taking more damage than what you needed to, sometimes because of things outside your control. Later on aswell, the enemies take a liking to grappling you a LOT and that can get REALLY annoying. Not to even mention that you CANNOT hit the boss enemies when they are grounded. The AI is also really stupid - in closed areas of the game, if you get low on health, just run circles around the enemies until you get some health back.\n\nAll in all though, I had fun with the game. I actually do recommend it lightly to those that enjoy the thrill that is careful preparation and to those that love seeing worlds that feel alive. Annoyances like the NPC beggars (whom will actually block movement sometimes and are EXTREMELY annoying), the random and clunky combat, and the repetitiveness of the Investigation missions will seem more forgetable after you get to the better parts of the game. Altair becomes a more likeable character and the story itself, while not as clear (sequels) will actually keep you wanting to see more of what the game can offer - and of course the amazing Assassination Missions, the reason you're playing this game.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, this game DOES have collectibles in the forms of Flags scattered across the world. I personally didn't go after them in the game as they have no real incentive or motive to collect them other than for collectionists' sake.","December 29, 2013","true","12.0"," 112 of 135 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","112","135","0","4"

Which would have been pretty bad if I didn‚Äôt seeing as I binge traded for pretty much the whole franchise.\n\nThe main impression I got from people was that the story was good but the gameplay was repetitive to the point of you just wanting to get to the end ASAP. Which, in ways, it was repetitive. But for me it was more than tolerable. The story kept me interested enough for me to not really mind all that much.\n\nIt has a ‚ÄúBatman Arkham City‚Äù feel to it. Or at least for me it did. The world is open but there are a limited range of activities you can actually do.\n\nStory wise, I enjoyed it! I constantly wanted to know what was going on and I wanted answers, dang nab it! At points it messed with my head, made me think of all kinds of weird possible plot twists and weird philosophical theories on truth and reality. Which is great! Might just be me but you gotta love games that poke at your brain a little.\n\nThere was a whole element to the game that kind of comes up in-between chapters that I didn‚Äôt even know existed. You don‚Äôt really see that side to it in the trailers so that was interesting to me.\n\nI played through this with (well, at the same time as) a friend whilst on call and from the profanity that came from my mouth and just how angry I was getting at times it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if he thought I hated this game. A few times I did actually shout ‚ÄúOH MY GOD I HATE THIS GAME‚Äù.\nBut it was lies! Point being that even though I raged quite a lot, I still really enjoyed it.\n\nThe mechanics for the game are great, the parkour kind of free-running stuff is really fun when it‚Äôs not being annoying (although you get used to it), the combat is fun but was the main part I raged at to be honest. (Probably just horrific at it). The assassin/stealth parts of the game are also really good. Makes you feel all badass being able to be really sneakily stealth kill some suckra then free-run your way out of it.\n\nOne thing I kept in mind the whole time whilst playing this game was that this game is pretty darn old. It was released around 2007 or somewhere around there. I think it‚Äôs been touched up since then, but still for how old it is especially, it‚Äôs a good game.\n\nAll in all, I like it and I look forward to continuing the franchise!\n\n\nTL;DR : Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (although it‚Äôs not that bad) but it makes up for that with an interesting story. Awesome stealth/assassin/parkour/combat mechanics and all around an awesome game for how old it‚Äôs getting these days. Definitely worth trying this.\n","March 18, 2015","true","28.9"," 73 of 79 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","73","79","10","26"

Not to mention it's only like $10 anyway!\n\nSo what's so fun about it you might ask. Let me tell you. After you finally start running around and killing the enemies the game becomes fun! I have once spent 80% the mission just hunting the guards and doing all the other random things. For me, the selling part of this game is running around and jumping on the rooftops.\n\nControls. I understand that this game was ported from a console so controls for PC only users will be funny. I didn't not try to reset them because they are still well put. But, its not your normal WASD + ctrl and space. You will just have to get used to that.\n\nWhile playing this game you don't often notice the sound effects and the music, but I can tell that it plays its part in delivering the whole picture very well. Its nothing impressive, but what is important that it does not spoil the experience and only enchants it. Although I have not tried, but I can see myself actually playing some other music while running around the city.\n\nThe very first time I ran this game was actually in 2007. The computer I was running it on couldn't even handle it. That is partially the reason why I only came back to the game now. At the time of release the graphics very amazing. The foggy city environment impressed me in particular. The models of characters are very well made as well, buildings are quite detailed. Nothing really to complain about as 7 years later it still looks good.\n\nYou might say, what an unfair review, where are the negative things? Well they are here as per any game. For example I don't quite like how character moves sometimes and how he cant do certain jumps and things. But its all negligible I think. Oh, and once I flew from my horse really high. The worst thing is that it only saves your game when you have completed something which can be quite an annoyance.\n\nThe story is not all there is to do. You can actually explore the cities to find some random flags. I am not too sure what they going to give you at the end, but there's quite a number of them to be found and  they also might be in places where you wont be able to reach from the first time. So a few more challenges. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the Templars. They are very hard to deal with, but there are always ways to abuse the system( find out for yourself).\n\nRe-playability is low in my opinion, because once you finish this game you can get the next one and then the next one and so on. You will be playing the same game but with the different filling inside.\n\nSo in overall, I think the developers made a externally good game( which evolved into a big sequence of games). I would recommend this game to pretty much anybody.","July 5, 2014","true","20.2"," 75 of 83 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","75","83","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/15100/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Assassin‚Äôs Creed was released for consoles amidst a sea of controversy. Despite its critical praises for its beautifully designed locales and fresh storytelling perspective, it was slammed by some for being too repetitive. Every mission is carried out in the same manner: interrogate an informant, pickpocket a citizen, and eavesdrop on a conversation. These actions would lead towards an assassination, which would complete a mission: rinse and repeat.Assassin‚Äôs Creed puts you in the shoes of an assassin named Alta√Ør and takes place in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD. Alta√Ør is the ancestor of modern day bartender Desmond Miles. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and strapped into a device called an Animus machine, which allows the user to revisit his ancestor‚Äôs past memories.The concept of the game is quite out there, but it does work. Every so often Desmond will have to ‚Äútake a break‚Äù from the machine, and you‚Äôll get to walk around in the real world to learn a bit of history behind Desmond‚Äôs family tree, as well as the true intentions of the organization holding him. The story progresses in a manner that simply draws you in.Surprisingly, Assassin‚Äôs Creed breaks the action game trend and delivers exquisite dialogue and voice acting. Despite the fact that Alta√Ør clearly has an American accent, his voice actor delivers his lines with an uneasy seriousness to them, which allows you to take the character seriously, and draws you closer to the game‚Äôs world. The free-running controls are excellent. If I had one complaint, it would be that they were too easy to use. Parkouring and climbing is almost automatic when you‚Äôre sprinting, which makes some sections too easy.Combat-wise, Assassin‚Äôs Creed doesn‚Äôt do anything revolutionary, but it gets the job done for the most part. Battles are comprised of a simple system of blocking, striking, and countering.Combat itself is pretty fun, even if it‚Äôs not all that complicated. The biggest complaint against Assassin‚Äôs Creed is the similar manner in which missions are conducted. There are four towns in the game, and one hub world. Each town has a poor, middle-class, and rich area, and you will visit each during the course of the game to murder a specific target. The events that lead up to the actual kill are always the same, but the confrontations are vastly different from one another.If you can get past the game's mission-based structure and lack of replay value for the common gamer, you'll find an epic tale of betrayal and intrigue in Assassin's Creed that really shouldn't be missed.Overall 8/10.","October 12, 2014","true","13.3"," 68 of 75 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","68","75","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/15100/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","Yet another PC port by Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed is crazy fun if you know what you're doing.\n\nThe story behind this Assassin vs Templar universe begins here, but it curiously takes place concurrently in the present day as well as in the past. On the one hand, we have master assassin Altair letting his inflated ego get the better of him, causing him to slip up in a big way, breaking all three of the Creed's most sacred tenets. We follow his path to redemption through the task of 9 assassinations - a task that sees Altair change who he is for the better of all in the guild.\n\nThe story of the present day centres on Desmond Miles. This story is intermittent at best, as the majority of the game is played out in Altair's time, but to sum it up, he has been captured and forced to relive Altair's memories through a device called an Animus, able to 'view' the genetic memories of the occupant. For those that haven't played, there are spoilers, so I won't go into the details.\n\nThe strange dual-story actually works quite well, as subsequent games have proven in their popularity. I have played all games up to and including AC3, so in hindsight this game set the scene well for future sequels.\n\nControls can be clunky at times. It's easy to get used to, but something simple like running at top speed requires W for moving forward, holding down right click on the mouse to change into High Profile (think: more obvious to be spotted) actions, the space bar as well to hit the sprint and auto jump at building edges or to jump over gaps automatically... and to top it off you have to hit Shift if you want to catch yourself with a grab if you don't quite make the jump. This is an extreme case though, and it should be noted that you are encouraged to move slowly and take your time with your movements so as to not arouse suspicion from guards.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Running and jumping - hell even walking and jumping, is made still more ridiculous by the fact that half the time you'll end up somewhere you didn't want to go, or weren't aiming for. Case in point: walking down an alley, you suddenly decide you want to climb the walls and windows up to the rooftops. You turn around and start a run up to the wall so that you'll start climbing when you reach it... only there's this fence you'll brush past on your way there. By some fluke or quirk of fate you'll find yourself climbing the fence instead... even though the fence is at the same level as you are. You'll find yourself hanging on to the end of this fence for dear life... because you wouldn't want to fall! The ground is literally right at your feet. Naturally you'll agree with onlookers when they start muttering "Somebody should stop him, before he hurts himself" and "What a fool!"\n\nSo movement can be either really funny or really frustrating depending on the situation. Weapons consist of fists (useful for getting information out of people), swords, knives, and of course the signature hidden blade we all know and love. <3 You'll find there's a pretty even spread of circumstances for using these, and once you get the counter-kill and grab-counter moves combat will be nothing more than an annoying trifle on your way to the next part in the story.\n\nBeing the 'assassin'-type game that it is, I find it disappointing that everything so easily turns into a bloodbath. Check my screenshots if you don't believe me. Whether it's a mission assassination or just trying to walk past a patrol, you'll soon discover people from all over the world want to throw themselves on your sword. Sometimes it takes as much as twenty bodies on the ground before your opponents realise they can't win too, and then even after you wipe out a massive group and finally become anonymous again, another patrol comes around a corner and the whole thing starts all over again. I open the map sometimes just to see if the city population changes - I'm sure I killed that many.\n\nGameplay consists of various mission types and collectibles in addition to the main 9 assassination missions. In order to 'access the memories' you have to do research about your targets - these can consist of taking out rooftop archers for a brother assassin that can't do it for some reason or another; a race; eavesdropping; punching up the town crier for info, then killing him anyway ^_^; pickpocket missions, and a couple of others.\n\nThe assassinations themselves, while I appreciate the variety of set-ups and environs, don't satisfy me as much as they could have. Unlike any nuffie guard you could off then walk away without being detected (even in front of other guards, I might add), every single core mission sees you enter these weird nowhere places where time doesn't seem to flow and you can talk to your victim regardless of the fact you just stabbed him in the neck. Afterwards you employ the 'run like hell' strategy, because somehow the whole city knows what you've done even before you get there. And there's about twenty guards in hot pursuit, because most times you dont have the opportunity to clear the area before you go in for the kill (not without alerting your mark anyway).\n\nLike I said, the game is a blood bath, with far too much combat and contrived scenes, and not enough stealth.\n\nThe graphics are passable for it's age, although I find the colour palette lacking. Jerusalem is all grey, Damascus is all terracotta, and I think Acre is a different shade of grey. To be fair Damascus is pleasant, it was definitely my favourite of all the areas. Inside the Masyaf fortress is a close second.\n\nI think the variety of characters is good. There are the drunks, wandering aimlessly through the streets and somehow always knowing when Altair is around so they can push him around. The town criers and their propoganda speeches will stay with you well after you finish playing (not in a good way). The beggars can get really, really, really annoying, but remember you can punch them when guards aren't alerted - they won't do anything. "No! You don't understand - I'm poor and sick and HUNGRY!" *BAM* Let's face it, everyone punches beggars.\n\nWhere the game really shines for me is its soundtrack. Especially when everything goes to hell and everyone knows you're a villain - because the music will go crazy! The chase and combat music during the core missions simply cannot be beat, I believe it's Access the Animus. It's worth a listen to. There are other great tracks as well - all done by Jesper Kyd, notorious for his awesome work on various games now. I highly recommend checking him out.\n\nDespite the problems I encountered, the freezes, glitched collectibles (!*$@# FLAGS!), crazy amount of guard killing and stupid auto-jumping ...

See Conclusion\n\nNote: This being the first game in the franchise, I will review it as if the sequels did not exist.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nAssassin's Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise of the same name. It is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy Lands during the medieval period, more specifically, during the Crusades. It was originally released for the consoles back in 2007 with a PC release the following year.\n\nThe game places you in the shoes of Desmond Miles who, using a machine called the Animus, accesses the genetic memory of his ancestor Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad in an attempt to retrace a series of events that would lead him to an unknown artifact called ‚ÄúPiece of Eden‚Äù. Journey across the war torn Holy Lands and watch history unfold as every action Alta√Ør makes, unravels another piece of a greater mystery and conspiracy that stretches across several generations.\n\nPROS:\n+ Good Storytelling with a refreshing mix of historical, and sci-fi elements.\n+ Good combat, stealth and core gameplay mechanic\n+ Graphically beautiful despite its age at the time of this review\n+ World and level design are well done\n+ Beautiful atmospheric surroundings\n+ Lots of NPCs which make the Holy Land feel alive and immersive\n+ Interesting and memorable characters\n+ Good sound design and voice acting\n+ Top notch animation quality\n+ Large semi-non-linear map to explore\n+ Target assassinations can be completed in several ways\n+ No Uplay account requirement\n\nCONS:\n- Combat becomes repetitive\n- Counter-attack can be seriously abused\n- Not much to do outside the Animus (while you're Desmond Miles)\n- Useless and unrewarding collectibles which results in...(see next con)\n- Not much incentive to explore the vast game world\n- No progression system to speak of (not a lot of upgrades or weapon variation)\n- Master Assassin Alta√Ør cannot swim (living in the desert is not an excuse)\n- Lepers and Beggars\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAssassin's Creed is a good game with a very interesting story which mixes together historical background and sci-fi elements. It has a vast atmospheric world and together with the beautiful graphics and sound design, makes for an enjoyable experience. I kinda wish they had more rewarding side missions though. Combat is fun, stealth is satisfying and the core mechanic, although it can feel repetitive at times, rarely gets boring.\n\nOverall its GOOD and a GOOD BUY. As it stands, buying the game at full price is not bad but since the game goes on sale frequently, I suggest waiting. It's a good game to have in your library as a collector's item if anything else.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/15100/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5490 products in account","Did you ever think to yourself...  "Wow, I wish I could be an assassin," indiscriminately executing evil doers and fiends alike?  I certainly know the answer to that question for myself was a passionate yes!  Occasionally as a child I would don a white sheet around my neck, painted with a red cross.  I would stealthily sneak around  my living room, surprising my family members with a cardboard dagger, I created from a produce box..\n\nI would pounce from behind the couch and pretend to slash my father, my mother, my brothers, it didn't matter who.  Ahh those glorious days when I was a wee lad and my imagination could run wild for hours.. or until the ADHD compelled me to find something else to do.\n\nWell Assassins Creed may be just the game to fill your childhood role-playing fantasy's in reality.. after all it's far better and cheaper than trying to actually become an assassin am I rite?\n\nTo start off with it needs to be said that Assassin Creed is the grand daddy of the Creed series, so the AI is kind of dumb and undeveloped, the game play is repetitive and the combat is slightly boring.  Yes I said it Assassin Creed on paper isn't a very good game at all....  I'm talking in 2016, where as in 2008 when the game came out it was fresh and new, so quite a few of the issues which plague the game were forgivable.  It wouldn't be a good review if I left out that the game feels very dated now.\n\nTHE STORY\nStarts you off as Altair an assassin on a mission, I won't spoil what you're after, but if you put two and two together you'll figure it out (It's pretty much a tutorial getting you familiar with the game..)  After the fairly short tutorial mission you'll awaken to find yourself in the shoes of a man named Desmond Miles..  He's being held hostage and forced to enter the Animus, a machine which can somehow bring out the memories of your ancestors.. I won't go into anymore detail as I wouldn't want to spoil the fun of discovering the story.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\nThis is the meat and potatoes of any game, the actual game play.  In Assassin Creed unfortunately the gameplay gets rather repetitive, it's set up on a series of memory blocks, which are self contained stories which combine together to form the story arc.  In the game or the Animus you are greeted with 6 or 7 different investigations, 3 of which are required to access the unique Assassination.  These are generic Eavesdropping, pick pocketing, Interrogations (nearly identical to pick pocketing, only this one requires you to beat up the target for information).  The few others scattered in are timed flag captures, assassinations, and destruction mission..   This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't repeated on every stage, about 3 times per map.\n\nYou also have two types of collectibles, each of the 5 major areas has it's own set of collectibles.  Flags, view points and citizens... the flags offer little to no reason to actually collect them, I suppose on the console versions collecting all of them would net you an achievement or trophy, but the PC version offers nothing.  I guess this was just left over from the console version..  Competitionist will probably enjoy tracking down these little boogers, but the rest of us will just ignore them as you gain nothing from collecting them.  The view points are far more valuable as each one removes fog off the in game map, and reveals the locations of investigations, and citizens which you can rescue from harassment.  The Citizens unlike the flags actually have the added benefit of placing either a roving band of Scholars which allow you to easily escape from guards or citizens who grab and stop guards from chasing you.\n\nTHE COMBAT,\n\nThe combat appears to be a button masher at first, but you'll quickly discover the true way to be a master assassin is using Counter Attack, which often times turns combat into a long drawn out affair.  Instead of mashing down the buttons and quickly ending the guards, you're left to wait for an attack.. It can take the Guards anywhere from 5 - 15 seconds to attack.  Early on in the game you're assassin seems much more capable of killing guards, normally a counter attack means the guard dies.  Later on the guards can take three or four counters to actually die.  Many encounters have the potential of having 10+ guards.  So do the math... the game is called "Assassin" Creed though, so you'll figure out that it's much easier to run away and hide than try and fight them all..\n\nTHE GRADE,\n\nin 2008 when the game was first released, I'd give it an easy 9/10, it was revolutionary for it's time, and presented a unique experience which was fairly lacking at the time.  In 2016 the game feels very dated.  Considering video games aren't wine being dated isn't a good thing.  So I'd say it's probably a 6/10.  Not a great game but certainly not a bad game either, far greater choices exist in 2016 which were absent in 2008.\n\nI'll recommend this game as it's the game which started the Assassin Creed franchise, and most people like myself just can't hop into a series in the middle.  So be Leary if you buy the game you may very well find yourself going gah, I have to do this again?  Just suck it up and plow through, the second game is only 15 - 17 hours away...","January 12","true","17.2"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","43","45","10","2"

Unlike the sequels this game is far from the open world collectathon that the Assassin's Creed series has become. The majority of the game is fairly linear and consists entirely of assasssinating specific characters. Completing the assassinations progresses the plot and unlocks new abilities for you, this game is far more similar to something like Hitman than what the modern Assassin's Creed games are. Unfortunately there are plenty of faults in this one too. The side activities are almost non existent and by adding fast travel between cities eliminates the majority of the open world exploration in this game. This game is also very guilty of not explaining a lot of the mechanics to the player and providing very poor tutorials. However I still think it's a very unique and interesting game despite all of it's flaws. One of the things I really enjoy about it is the fact that you can play through the entire game with all of the on screen HUD disabled only relying on ingrame visual and audio queues.\n\nDefinitely worth the going price now.","November 25, 2013","true","15.7"," 48 of 58 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","48","58","0","0"

When it was released, though, the hyped expectations of the whole gaming world were... turned down, sadly.\nWhile without a doubt that was a high-class, AAA product, with prodigious depth of open-world gaming experience, fascinating visuals, thoroughly reconstructed medieval cities and intriguing story. Yet all that was not enough. The creators of Assassin's Creed made almost everything right... but lose the fun-out-of-the-gameplay somewhere on producing stages.\n\nI remember playing the game right after release, and I was grown tired of it in second city, no matter how much I was stunned by the prologue and the first city. Inglorious Re-Peeat-Ability is the thing that killed the hype of the game and downgraded its undoubted merits. The most usual Ubisoft story, as it seems.\n\nBut, as we look now, after the dust is settled, the first Assassin game was not bad. Quite contrary, it is still pleases us with visual feast. The reconstruction of medieval world is one of the best in known fiction worlds, would that be games, books or films. The fighting theme is ten times bested by the Shadow of Mordor title... but it is still engaging. Stealth is no match in terms of cunning and diversity with games like Hitman... But you know that too, you get used to it so long ago!\n\nSo, that that's I'm gonna tell you: if you've missed that game so far, try it now, it is definetely worth a shot. Just... don't play it like an open-world game. I can't believe I write something like that, being a huge fan on open-world gameplay, but in case of AC1 that's the point. There are just not enough rewards for the whole additional activity Ubisoft added in the game. No point in opening chests, collecting flags, and so on. That's that killed my fun when I was making my first approach there.\n\nJust play the scenario missions and kill occasional tampliers on your way, while exploring and sightseeing the great cities which was putted into that game. As I said already, there are no other thing, which will give you so complex experience of life in the medieval Mid-East. Just for that Assassin's Creed 1 deserves a place in your games collection, aside from a fact it was a father for superb Assassin's Creed 2, which stands proudly as one of the best games ever created.\n\nMy mark 7.5. Not a diamond, but still glimmering and even shines, if you know, how to look at it.","February 7","true","62.9"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","33","37","4","5"

Losing them and having this repeat over and over and over gets really unfun really fast.\n- Doesn't work with Steam overlay, at least on my system. Fraps and Greenshot would also only give you black screen. MSI Afterburner worked.\n- It's repetitive as hell\n\nSo I'd say... if you really like the setting, and want to play the original ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• creed, maybe give it a shot. But if you find it tedious, just google the story or something and skip right to the sequels.\n\nI managed to actually finish all the challenges, climb all the towers and do all the stuff except finding all the flags, because there's like 500 of them. So it was not THAT bad.\n\nOh, if you do give this a try, V-Sync can fix the really weird bugs, like missing the hay cart in the scripted jumps.\n\n\nRating: 2.5 silver sloths","May 8, 2015","true","17.5"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","34","40","7","10"

But I really liked it. Why? Well the story is okay, but the assassinations, THOSE take the cake. Not all are equally good but all felt satisfying. The combat is fun as well although having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive after a while. The later ugrades that Altair gets make the combat even better. Falling into water kills you in this game which is rather immersion breaking (why would a trained assassin not be able to swim?) but not game breaking. The horse riding is cool although sometimes the horses handle poorly. Many people do not like the Desmond timeline but I do, it adds flavour to the story. Overall a cool game that has some bugs and boring/annoying parts which get mostly negated by the smooth combat and assassination system.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/15100/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Assassin's Creed is a very strong game that will satisfy individiuals that love history and war, but also the real main story of Assassins Creed.\n\nSetting: The game is set in the Third Crusade times, the battle between Islam and Christianity. It features Desmond Miles, a protagonist in 21st Century America, which is kidnapped by the antagonist company Abstergo Industries. This company uses the Animus, a generic-memory stimulator, on Desmond to recall his memories through his ancestor Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad.\n\nThe cities involved are Masyaf, the assassin creed's home city, Acre, ran by the Knights Templars, and Jerusalem and Damascus, both cities ran by the Templars and enemy Saracens. There is one more city however I won't spoil it. The landscape is different for each city, but only noticable in each city. There are three districts, poor, middle, and rich district, and you would assume there are higher quality buildings as the districts become richer, but again, you can only notice them.\n\nPlot: The plot line is certainly intriguing. Having played AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations, and having not finished AC I, all the storylines from the sequels made actual sense once I completed this. Onto the plot though, there are two separate plots that do intertwine. To clarify that, there is the story of Desmond and the story of Altair and the plotlines intertwine through the story of Altair and Desmond mashing in present 21st century America (hard to explain I know). Just know, the plot makes absolute sense once you play the games. From the perspective of AC's release in 2007, it was very very intriguing to interpret the plot without knowing the sequel storylines, so the plot from that perspective is a massive plus. The finish was very surprising as well might I mention.\n\nAlso, I completed the game in 18 hours, which included the core plot and the main side-missions. I did not complete finding the flags and killing the templar guards as I found them to be irrelevent. I had only played 14.9 hours on Steam, however 18 hours came from I playing about 3.5 hours of the game and me realising after three hours that Steam didn't realise I was playing AC, so there was a glitch in the Steam Client.\n\nOnly nuisences regarding the plot is the side-missions. As you progress into the game, they become more of a chore than actual for fun, for example, when there is an investigation side mission, the guards keep on coming later in the game and is ridiculous as they are alert, and spot you without even looking at you, meaning you failed the investigation. So yes, there was a few unbalanced AI involved with the missions, but other than that, it relieves you in the end once you know all are completed.\n\nAnd to note, I realised why I got so bored of the game about three hours into it on my first playthrough last year, and that was because the horse riding from Masyaf to the other cities is so long, it would take at least 15 minutes to travel, ridiculous and boring especially when 'The Kingdom' is just a transition area with no real meaning.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay is very solid. For a game released in 2007, it is surprising to see how smooth the gameplay is. For a game that emphasises parkour and combat, I see it as a major positive adding to the game. Only negatives regarding gameplay is how basic some actions are. For example, you will notice the same amount of counters to attacks and blocks, something that I felt could have been explored further.\n\nSound/Dialogue/Graphics: The graphics are very good for a 2007 game. I praise that.\n\nDialogue is good as there is mostly variety in individual dialogues. Only negative for dialogue is the 'Save Citizens' missions, the dialogue is extremely repeatitive. There was also some minor speech issues that I had noticed.\n\nSound: Serviceable. There was rare audio issues that I encountered.\n\nNegatives: This review may seem very positive, but gee these negatives are really that annoying. Overall, there are several bugs and glitches I'll name a few, for 'Save Citizens' missions, you would get glitches where you could not trigger the person to speak to after completing the task. Another was camera's getting stuck on the player, especially moderately when walking through doors, completely annoying.\n\nOverall: A very solid game and a good first-entry to the Assassins Creed series. If you didn't bother reading the review, the plot was consistent and intriguing, the graphics were very good, the sound was servicable, the dialogue was good, and gameplay was very solid. There were several bugs and glitches within the game that completely nagged me. The game is currently worth $10 on Steam, I'd say buy it, no harm done, sets up the good foundation for the series. Now, the rating is low compared to what I mentioned in the review as it was not an excellent game by all means. 7.5/10\n\nEDIT: I didn't note, but since the game took me 18 hours to complete, for the individual, I would assume it would take 20+ hours to complete by doing all tasks.\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

While you're in this procedure you experience the life of the assassin named Altair who lost his rank due his selfish actions. You get a second chance from your master to prove that you are again worth the rank you had.\n\nAs you may already know this game is very repetitive in its whole gameplay. You travel from place to place with the mission to kill a very important person after you found a few information about the target and for sidequests to find flags, rescue inhabitants etc. etc. But what starts very boring at the beginning gets more and more interesting caused from the story. So don't stop playing at the start as I did... twice a time.\n\nThe controlls are from time to time a bit difficulty so I recommend a controller here. However, the graphics are quite wonderful and the places are build with real passion for detail. Here and there you may find minor bugs or ragdoll problems, but it's nothing really gamebreaking.\n\nIt's not as good as the following games of this series but it's a good option to gather information about the beginning of the whole assassination story.\n\nR√©sum√©: It's absolutly worth the full price of 9,99$ - The gameplay might be repetitive but the story makes it up to play through it. Get it when you want to start with Assassin's Creed or when you still don't have this episode!\n\nPersonal rating:\n\n8.0/10.0","May 15, 2015","true","15.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","2"

As the first game in the series we are introduced to Desmond Miles - a man kidnapped and forced to access his assassin ancestors memories through a device known as the ANIMUS. As the story unfolds Desmond gets to witness his ancestor, Altair, break the three tenants of his assassin's code of conduct in pursuit of the historical figure Robert De Sable. It's here that he learns of various locations around the globe that hold powerful artifacts that could possibly predict the end of the world. Also as the game closes it becomes apparent that a former test subject has left Desmond messages only he can decipher and decode.\n\nAssassin's Creed plot is a little overwrought and simply exists as a brew to add historical figures with a dash of the outlandish and conspiratorial - in other words its pure Hollywood fluff. But for the purposes of fiction set within a historical and modern day context its serviceable. The game still looks just as good today as the day it came out so that speaks volumes of the hard work put in by the development team in producing a sumptuous and often strikingly beautiful looking historical action piece that appears to have lost some of its sheen in the subsequent sequels as the digital worlds grew larger.\n\nIt is such a pity though that the game is bogged down by mind-numbing repetition as each mission fails to deviate from the next. For all the moves and different play-styles you are encouraged to embrace it's an utter disappointment that you can get by through the mashing of a single button (the attack button). Also the enemy AI can come across as incredibly daft and often infuriating and will have you scratching your head many a time at all the missed opportunities the developers had with a game of this nature.\n\nStill Assassin's Creed makes for an entertaining diversion just not one that is easily consumed in a weekends worth of gaming as boredom and fatigue quickly set in.","November 23, 2013","true","21.9"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunny18/recommended/15100/","sunny18","Sunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunny18/","436 products in account","****TL;DR AVAILABLE BELOW****\nAssassin's Creed is an excellent Historic-Science Fiction Action/Adventure Game mainly inspired by the novel Alamut written by Vladimir Bartol way back in 1938. The Game introduced many brilliant concepts and a totally different mindblowing plot which is very well connected from past to the present and you can devise many theories based on it. It was turned down by many people because it lacked variety and yes it did. I'm gonna list out the positive points between this game and its successors and also the reason why I think it's still an awesome game of the franchise. It had a special charm that none of it's successors had and will ever have.\n\n1. The Game is simple and doesn't involve customisation or anything and doesn't feature money,etc to buy stuff and stays true in assassinating your targets. Whereas the other games got deviated into buying stuff and oh god the renovation business started.\n\n2. Had some great concepts such as synchronisation for example, its not actually health but how close you (Desmond) could faithfully recreate the actions of ancestor, like if you carelessly fell off from a building or punched some civvy, etc. you lose the synchronisation, because the ancestor didn't do such thing in his life and was careful. It will regain over time and become stable when it is lost.\n\nWhere as in other games you have health and armor and the way to replenish it is to drink some health tonic. Death in all these games is actually just a bad sync-up where you replayed the ancestor's memory event so bad that you lost touch with the original one's completely, so the Animus reinitialises back to the point where it made sense before you screwed it up entirely.\n\nSo basically Ezio, etc. actually dies when you run out of it. Checkpoint restart is just a game mechanic. You can say that the Animus is still re-initialising the scene, but you died from lack of health, not loss of synchronization, So the Synchronisation no longer makes sense, so technically it was very well implemented and made some real actual sense in this game. And there are some other concepts which were not only solid and made sense but also gave a definite depth to the game.\n\n3. It has darker and gritty atmosphere with well suited background scores as you scour for information about the target in various ways which gives you this 'Assassin' feeling. While the other games had peaceful and relaxing score not stating that they're bad but this one had better and showed how dark and unsafe the world is and was perfect for its Middle-Eastern setting.\n\n4. The Chase Theme (Access the Animus as per OST) of this game is just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• EPIC. It reminds you that you are not a bloodthirsty berserker, nor an invincible warrior cutting through waves of guards - you are but a blade in a crowd, someone, who doesn't exist...until the blade has pierced your targets throat. As the bells echo throughout the city and the guards draw their swords against you, you realize it is time to run...run and become incognito once more.\n\n5. The dialogues are surprisingly deep and interesting, only downside to it was it didn't feature any subtitles and sometimes cannot make out what they are saying because they sometime speak foreign language and won't speak simple english at all.\n\n6. Unlike other games where you scale a building like spidey, it is slow paced and that is great because it is realistic, but oh well people are just too impatient.\n\n7. Every assassin in the order abide by the three tenets of the creed as in the game's title. In other games there is no mentioning of the creed and completely lost the meaning of the game's title itself and became a milking title instead.\n\nPlot wise, the game is very short without considering the repetition but its really well made and it is just the beginning of the story as it throws you at a cliffhanger at the end. The Visuals are pretty neat too. It was so demanding back then in its time of release and even after all these years, it still really looks good.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\nMindblowing Concepts\nEpic story\nSuperb Graphics in its time\nA Great History Teacher\nRealistic slow paced free running parkour\nThe Most challenging game in its series\nDeep and interesting dialogues\nSound FX, even the tiniest sounds can be heard (Such as while climbing)\nDark and Gritty atmosphere\nOnly AC game which gives you the 'Assassin' feeling\nWell suited Background scores by Jesper KydCons:\nCan be awfully repetitive\nNumerous collectibles\nCan't swim lol\nSome unwanted parkour glitches\nMissing minor features a game should have (ex: blank radar,subs,etc)\nRepetitiveness cast aside, it's a gem that's pretty rough around the edges but it's sad that many people don't see it that way. Also this is the point where Ubisoft acquired the Tower Fetish Syndrome\n\n9/10","April 26","true","28.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mstrchiefalexed/recommended/15100/","mstrchiefalexed","Stadarooni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mstrchiefalexed/","75 products in account","The first game in the Assassin's Creed series is the game you should either start the series with, or go into with lower expectations. That's not to say this game is bad, it's just one that has sequals which far exceed the original.\n\nAdvertising itself as a "next-gen" (beginning of Xbox 360/PS3 era) game, in retrospect this game definitely looks (emphasis on the "looks") that way. Set in the 12th century during the Third Crusade, AC1 tells the tale of an underground battle between two opposing factions that has gone on since the begginnings of our species, and you play as Altair, a member of the Assassin Order. The plot is not the most exciting part of the game, but the ideas about human nature were enough to keep me interested into it to a certain extent. The characters are forgetable, besides our protagonist. Altair is a rather brash Assassin who fails a mission in the opening act of the game, and this game details his journey to get back to his previous rank within the Assassin Order. Besides the out of place American accent (ugh), Altair is a rather badass and interesting protagonist who keeps the plot afloat.\n\nOn the other hand, the world which the game is sent in is rich and engrossing. The graphical quality greatly reflects the world of the Crusade, and cities are full of NPC's which go about on their day. The sheer size of the maps will surely impress if this is your first AC game. Immersion is also something this game nails on the head, despite its numerous flaws. The soundtrack may not be entirely memorable, but it nonetheless fits the game extremly well. Voice work (minus Altair) is definitely of a high quality and fits in as well. However, do not look to this game as a history lesson that is 1:1 with reality. This game does take history and makes it fit into a video game, and isn't entirely accurate (which the game acknowledges).\n\nThis goes into a part of the game that is really up to opinion when it comes to the story: You're actually reliving the memories Altair, who is the ancestor of our true protagonist Desmond. Here you meet Lucy and Videc, one of which is a rather bland assistant character, while the other is an evil scientist. While these characters came across as rather boring to me, Desmond's character really makes them seem like works out of Shakespear. Desmond is an EXTREMLY bland character, and one that I honestly didn't care about. The game pulls your out of the Animus (the device used to relive memories) after every chapter, and these segmants are real pacebrakers, despite some interesting conversations between Desmond and Videc here and there.\n\nAnother issue I have withe the games story is how abrupt the ending is, and a plotpoint that comes up near the end of the game without explanation and just feels like it's there to break immersion and be picked up later on. While I wont go into details, the game definitely makes it feel as if it NEEDS to have a sequal, whether you as the player likes it or not.\n\nWhile it may seem as if I hate this game, I must say I actually did have an enjoyable experience with the gameplay. Sure, the game is repititive with the same objective structure being true for 85% or so of the game: Complete 3 missions, and assassinite your target. While this may definitely be a problem for some, the gameplay does work quite well to break this problem apart.\n\nA staple of Assassins Creed is its parkour and stealth mechanics, and both are present and enjoyable to do here. Soaring across the games three cities is enjoyable, and stealth can be very rewarding in the game as it is quite difficult to pull off compared to the sequals. Combat is also very rich, and has many sides to it (even though it becomes pathetically easy with counters). You can dodge, block, grab, and slash at your opponents with various tools at your disposal: a sword, a shortsword, throwing knives, and the iconic hidden blade (and also your fists, of course).\n\nThe objectives your are required to complete before assassinations are quite repepitive however, and may be something you may not enjoy. I personally found informer challaneges to be very tricky, while pickpockets and interrogations were far too easy. And eavesdropping is... well... sitting on a bench, and that's that. Assassinations are, however, very enjoyable and can be done in a variety of manners, and are followed by extremly intense escpae sequences that will keep you on your toes.\n\nWhile there are some optional activities (saving civilians, collect-a-thons, and scaling every viewpoint), the game doesn't offer too much else. and is purely an action adventure game rather than an RPG (like its sequals). This is why Assassin's Creed is honestly a game that doesn't have too much replay value, even though the adventure is about 15 hours and is overall enjoyable, if not repitive for 85% of the journey and telling of a story that isn't too memorbale, despite the immersive world presented. $20 may be a bit too much for how shallow AC1 is (and considering you can buy the more polished sequals for the same price), and if you're curious I would advice that you wait for this to go on sale and to have an open mind. However, the game should keep you entertained enough to be interested in AC2, which is definitely a GOOD thing.\n\nOverall, AC1 is a decent first game into the AC franchise, and one you should approach with some caution, and avoid if you've played the other AC games (unless you're extremly curious). I would give this game an overall 7/10, however if I had to take replayability into account it's definitely a 6/10.","April 6, 2015","true","16.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. While this fluid and beautiful game is often the victim of mixed reviews by fans, it serves a very important purpose. The first time I tried this game, I put it down as a result of becoming bored too quickly, but this game is worth investing in. That is, if you have taken a shine to any of its sequels. It is my strong and undying opinion that you‚Äôd be doing the developers a great disservice by skipping the heart of the best selling series. While the later games are more entertaining and hold more appeal, one needs to play Assassin‚Äôs Creed in order to truly understand the elaborate groundwork laid out for its successors.\n\nStory: The game focuses on the use of an immersive computer system known as the ‚ÄúAnimus‚Äù, and its latest subject called Desmond Miles. While Desmond may appear to be an average bartender from an average world, he is actually a descendant of the legendary Assassin Alta√Ør Ibn-La‚ÄôAhad. Through the Animus, the player will bear witness to the genetic memories of Desmond‚Äôs ancestor, and the events between two secret societies as they unfold during the Third Crusade.\n\nOverall, I felt that the story was weak, but it took some revolutionary steps towards creating a solid foundation for a marvelous series of sequels. While the story might initially seem confusing as the player nears the end, it is surprisingly well thought out, so give it a chance.\n\nGameplay: As stated previously, much of the game is disclosed through the eyes of Desmond Miles as he relives the memories of Alta√Ør through the Animus. Inside the Animus, the player will be introduced to a computerized interface displaying all of the mandatory information varying from health to inventory, and a third person view of Alta√Ør.\n\nIt is important for anyone unfamiliar with the franchise to be aware that Alta√Ør moves in real time opposed to turn-based. The  movement in the game is possibly its most notable feature which permits the player to scale buildings, catch ledges, jump over gaps, and more. Assassin‚Äôs Creed has a love for utilizing a diverse set of active (high profile) and passive (low profile) approaches, so if you manage to draw unwanted attention to yourself, you‚Äôre probably going to need to find a haystack - fast - unless you feel like fighting a band of poor unfortunate souls (otherwise known as guards).\n\nUnfortunately, even with easy access to multiple weapon sets and various combat skills, the gameplay of Assassin‚Äôs Creed can only be described as repetitive. The game makes a habit of recycling the same formula for most of the key assassinations, which becomes tedious. Despite that, it‚Äôs still worth buying - If this is too repetitive, simply rush through this game. There is a lot more to do in its successors, and the developers improve the ability to enjoy the tasks in the future. However, as I stated, skipping the groundwork does the entire franchise a bit of a disservice.\n\nFurthermore, as Alta√Ør the player will also need to familiarize themselves with the art of synchronization. Synchronization is measured by the Animus as Desmond follows his genetic memories, and reflects its user‚Äôs faithfulness to the memory in question. In other words, is Desmond re-living the memory as it was, or has he diverted from its path? Straying too far from the objective will result in a loss of synchronization, which will result in forcing the user to start over from an earlier point. Needless to say, not ‚Äúeverything is permitted‚Äù.\n\nFinally, the last aspect that I really feel called to touch on is Eagle Vision. In short, Eagle Vision is a seemingly dormant sixth sense in most humans, however it manages to aid Alta√Ør in his tasks throughout the game. Utilized, this ability will help the player to locate targets, gauge intentions of others, and ultimately seek out his mark. I found this aspect to be fairly interesting, and hope you enjoy using this ability as much as I did.\n\nControls: The controls of Assassin‚Äôs Creed are extremely friendly. I used my 360 controller, and the game provided me with excellent controller support. However, I did try to play the game with the mouse and keyboard setup, and I cannot recommend this to anyone. This game is best played with a controller.\n\nIn general, the targeting is a bit tricky, but that is something you can work around.\n\nGraphics: As I stated at the beginning of the review, I tried playing Assassin‚Äôs Creed once before. What I failed to mention was that my first attempt was on the XBOX 360 years ago. On the 360, the game looked polished and pretty. However, it‚Äôs original appeal has nothing on the dreamlike quality of the graphics on the PC. I could hardly believe that the game was originally released in 2007 when I first booted it up. Sure, there are some technical glitches here and there, but the PC version has definitely left a deeper impression.\n\nI feel like it is an understatement to report that the views in Assassin‚Äôs Creed are breathtaking. In fact, they are polished, atmospheric, realistic, and lifelike. It is absolutely fascinating to me how well Ubisoft managed to present the world in this game.\n\nSound: In Assassin‚Äôs Creed, you will come to hate that one stupid beggar that manages to find you in every single town, who just absolutely has to tell you ‚ÄúMy family is sick and dying‚Äù... What I‚Äôm really trying to say, is that the continuously recycled voice tracks are just as repetitive as the gameplay itself. If it doesn‚Äôt annoy you, I envy you your patience. With a bit more polishing (and perhaps a few more lines recorded by their voice actors) the NPCs could have been a much enjoyable thing to encounter.\n\nOn a positive note, the music is gorgeous.\n\nOverall the sounds of Assassin‚Äôs Creed are realistic and immersive, fitting for a game that places a heavy focus on its atmosphere.\n\nReplay Value: I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd play it again, unless I wanted a refresher of the story, but it is definitely worth at least one playthrough. As always, the replay value is entirely dependent on the individual holding the controller, and I can see a great deal of replay potential in this game. While the story is questionably weak, there are a lot of remaining individual elements to explore and to enjoy - Particularly if you enjoy exploration and immersive combat.","November 1, 2014","true","28.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrookinCrepsley/recommended/15100/","BrookinCrepsley","Brookin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrookinCrepsley/","46 products in account","After over 50 hours into this game, I can honestly say that Assassin‚Äôs Creed 1, is a magnificent game. This game is the first one in the series and I have to admit that I do regret my latecoming to the series, but I am glad that I decided to go straight to the beginning rather than AC2, which has been said to more ‚Äòimproved‚Äô in lots of areas. I will spilt up my review into a couple of ‚Äòsections‚Äô before giving my overall thoughts and score. Please note that throughout this review, I will try to be as spoiler-free as I can be.\n\nStory -\n\nThe story is the real meat of AC1 and it is the game's strongest point. You, as Desmond Miles, are captured by Abstergo Industries whom wishes to access your genetic memories in order to obtain the memories of Alta√Ør, whom is Desmond's ancestor and is an Assassin whom you play as while in the Animus - a machine that allows you to access Alta√Ør's memories. There are a lot of things you don't learn straightaway like why does Abstergo want Alta√Ør's memories but later on, through Alta√Ør's storyline and Desmond's, you discover that Abstergo desires something specific found within Alta√Ør's memories. You begin the game as Alta√Ør who is in Solomon's Temple with two other Assassins, in a mission to retrieve the Piece of Eden. While there, Alta√Ør finds Robert de Sable (Grandmaster of the Templars) and attempts to kill him, breaking all the tenets of the Creed with his arrogance. As a result of this, an assassin dies and Masayaf (The Creed's Base) gets attacked by the Templar Order. As this was Alta√Ør's fault, Al Mualim (Leader of the Assassins) strips Alta√Ør's rank as a 'Master Assassin' and demotes him into a novice. For the majority of the game, Alta√Ør is on a mission of redemption and regaining his rank as the only way to do so is to kill nine Templars. Well, the story is much more complex and interesting than that as you learn that these Templars are all tied-together and that Al Mualim didn't choose these nine for the heck of it. Throughout the course of the game, Alta√Ør learns many things and he undergoes a large character development, in his quest for redemption. The story is engaging and gripping - so much so, at one point, I played three days straight just to learn more on the story. That's how good it was!\n\nCharacters  -\n\nThe game has a strong cast of characters in my view (At least in the main story on Alta√Ør's side) - Alta√Ør, Al Mualim, Robert de Sable, The Nine Templars, etc etc. All of these are very strong characters with Alta√Ør's arrogance and Al Mualim's wisdom, which makes the main story ever so interesting and engaging. There are minor things that could have been better like the fact that even though Alta√Ør is middle-eastern, he has an American accent, which is entirely realistic. Another thing concerning Alta√Ør is his backstory, as I would have loved to learn more about his character as we learn very little of his past in the game. But now, we shall slip to the other side and talk about Desmond Miles. Desmond Miles, is an 'okay' character in my opinion, I heard a lot about the criticism on his character and storyline, and I can see why as we know very little on Desmond as well (Alta√Ør is a strong character though, so it works for him) but Desmond in itself is a little bland. We don't see much personality from him and I, found myself, wanting to go back to Alta√Ør, a lot. I should note that I don't hate Desmond as a character nor his storyline as I saw potential, but I'm unsure if in the other games whether this changes or not. I should also say that towards the end of the game, that was the point when I was interested in his storyline before recieving a large cliffhanger (Thanks, Ubisoft).\n\nGameplay -\n\nThe gameplay is the biggest flaw in the entire game. Okay, you have three cities to play in - Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Within those three cities, you have three districts - The Poor District, the Rich District and the Middle District. The gameplay connects with the story of killing the Nine Templars - in preparation for the nine Templars, you have to the SAME thing nine times. You have to climb viewpoints within each district in each city to unlock investigations (things like pickpockets, interrogation, eavesdropping etc etc) which helps you acquire enough information to assassinate the target. In the first three targets, you have to do 2 investigations, and for the rest you have to do - 3 investigations. So, you pretty much do the same thing nine times. Climb up high places, unlock investigations, do the required amount of investigations then finally assassinate the target. At first, I thought this was an interesting mechanic and added more immersion to make it seem like how an assassin would really do it - as stealth and information are key, however after doing it numerous of times, I found it repeitive and frustrating. So much so, that I sometimes wished I could cut to the chase and get to the actual killing; thankfully the game makes each Templar unique with interesting and compelling stories. I was patient enough and managed to push myself through the repetitive gamplay solely for the story, and I sincerely hope that the gameplay had been improved upon in AC2 and all of the games in the franchise.\n\nCombat  -\n\nIn AC1, you have 4 choices to fight with - throwing knives/a fighting knife, a hidden blade, a sword and your fists. I myself loved the fact that I could jump around the roof and take out my hidden blade and stab the unsuspecting guards. The controls for fighting are a struggle at first as you have a lot of skills to remember and in combat, you can fumble around and confuse one ability with the other causing you to mess up in combat, but I eventually adapted to it and learned to use it. I could tell from early on, that this game was intended for controllers rather than a mouse-and-keyboard but honestly, it's not "too hard" with mouse-and-keyboard but it is a struggle at the beginning, and is one concern that should be addressed as it may not be what certain people would like, so I would recommend you to be patient - take advantage of the fighting tutorials and use them to help you get better at the controls, or if not - use a controller, as the game seemingly wants you too.\n\nSetting  -\n\nAC1 is set during 1191 - in the middle of the Third Crusade, and the majority of the story takes place within the Holy Land. This was rather a nice and unique place and time to play in, as I didn't know many games that was set in during the Crusades and the Holy Land where King Richard 'the Lionheart' and Salahuddin are in a war with each other, for either the protection of Jerusalem (in Salahuddin's side) or the capture of Jerusalem for Christianity (in King Richard's side). When I first heard about the setting, I was really interested as this was quite a nice place and time to set a game in, and while I admittedly do not know much on the Holy Crusades, I am very interested in history. It should be said that this game shouldn't be played for it's historical context, as obviously it wouldn't be historically-correct but it was a lot of fun to see Jerusalem and see how the Third Crusade affected the Holy Land, so I consider this to be one of the game's strong points.\n\nOverall  -\n\nOverall, my final verdict for this game is an  8/10  with the game's strengths being it's story, setting and intriuging characters such as Alta√Ør as well as the fun parkour. However it's major flaws are its repititive gameplay as well as the 'clunky' controls for combat yet I recommend being patient enough to deal with them, as this game has a compelling story and an amazing setting. Thanks for reading!\n\nMy Scoreboard ‚Äì\n\n1/10 ---> 4/10 ‚Äì Not worth it.\n\n5/10 ---> 6/10 ‚Äì Below Average/Mediocre.\n\n7/10 ‚Äì Above Average.\n\n8/10 ‚Äì Great.\n\n9/10 ---> 10/10 ‚Äì Outstanding + Must Own.","September 8, 2015","true","55.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","3"

Yay! You play Desmond Miles, a man with two first names pretending to be a last name. Oh, and he's also a former assassin (apparently, it never really elaborates on that beyond the initial introduction) who's forced to explore the memories of his ancestor, Altair, during the crusades of the late 12th century. This is done through a device called the Animus which probes and records "genetic memories", the knowledge passed down through a person's entire lineage via their genes and allows them to live out those moments in their mind as if they were their own experiences... Yeah, just go along with it, coz that's more or less what the game asks you to do since that's as much as it bothers trying to explain it. Altair is a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, and after failing a mission and breaking the three main rules of the Brotherhood (don't kill in daylight, never get water on your target, and never feed them after midnight), is demoted and sent on a series of assassinations to restore his name and rank, but along the way discovers there is something much bigger at work connecting all his targets. Dun-dun-duuuuun! But this is where my first problem with the game crops up.\n\nThe story just didn't grab me at all. It's incredibly ham-fisted in what it's trying to do, and rather than find it interesting or pushing me forward, it felt like it got in the way of the gameplay, and if anything, maybe even held it back. Had it been done without all the half-*ssed science fiction elements and instead remained tied to its time and setting it would have been a perfectly enjoyable story about the hidden histories that shaped the world and the shadowy organisations behind them. What we're given instead just feels too underdeveloped to truly care about in the end, much like the main characters, in fact. Desmond/Altair doesn't really have much range or depth, having about as much personality as a balloon with a serious face drawn on it, and at times comes dangerously close to being unlikable. And what's especially infuriating about them is how nosensical their choices seem or how nochalant they are about their situations, making it difficult for us to care about them. The voice acting is largely passable, but still very much of the old-school gaming mentality of sounding like a Saturday morning kid's show where half the characters sound like they're reading from a script and throwing subtly out the window rather than feeling like real people having real conversations. Any sense of naturalistic interaction is lost completely and only adds to the difficulty of being able to invest in the story or its figures, which is all the harder to bear given how much they focus on them being a thing you should care about. In fact, having come fresh off of finishing Portal 2 and hearing all the amazing voice work in that, it's made even more apparent just how mediocre it is here. But all that could be forgiven and forgotten, because what really matters is the gameplay, right? Well, actually... that's where the next problem comes.\n\nThe structure is fairly straightforward. There's three main cities in the game connected by a large hub area, each city having three districts which are gradually unlocked one by one, and each district having a main target for you to eventually kill. You run around a district completing objectives which give you information on your target before having enough to finally do the deed itself. Objectives range from eavesdropping on conversations, interrogating enemy cohorts, saving citizens from vicious beatings, assassinating smaller targets, or several other tasks of little consequence. Unfortunately, though, that's pretty much the entire game right there. You'll go to one district, do all the objectives, complete the mission, then move on to the next one all excited to see what other fun and creative tasks you'll be given, only to find you have to repeat almost exactly the same events all over again. And that's the cycle the game repeats from start to finish. Once you've played the first district you've essentially played them all. There's nothing fundamentally wrong about the gameplay at its core, I just wish they'd given me something more to do over the 20+ hours I put into it. Sure, there's collectibles scattered everywhere in the form of flags... hundreds and hundreds of flags... but there's no real point to hunting them down. There's nothing awarded for finding them all, and beyond acting as intermediary save points they may as well not be there. Maybe if they had've unlocked files for real world information about the locations or the historical figures or the crusades themselves then they would have made for some compelling artifacts, but nah, nothing.\n\nIts main saving grace, though, are the View Points, buildings that can be climbed to uncover the map of the immediate area and locations of objectives. Monkeying your way up a structure then diving back down to street level can be fun sometimes, but largely it's the chance to take in the cities as a whole that impresses most, and they really are impressive. That's really the star of the game, in fact. The sheer scale of each city and the huge crowds that fill it along with the meticulous detail everywhere is clearly where a lot of work and love went here. The surface of almost every wall has something climbable if you look for it, and a vast array of beams and poles and scaffolding connects the buildings at every turn. I never tried it, but I wouldn't be surprised if you could make your way across the rooftops from one end of a city all the way to the other without your feet ever touching the ground of the streets and having to interact with all the filthy plebs below. I don't envy the people whose job it was to check that every structure was spaced correctly and that movement could be maintained as fluidly and enjoyably as it is. So I really have to take my hood off to them for that achievement.\n\nBut while movement is a joy and tends to work just fine the majority of the time, combat is a whole other matter. The game really owes a lot to Prince of Persia, from the way it looks and feels, to even the majority of the animations which appear to be almost identical, but the mechanic I wish they'd abandoned from it is the combat. It was fine in small doses in PoP, but there's too much of it here that largely feels clunky and boring, with a fairly small weapon and move set, and little or no variety in enemy types beyond a palette swap or doing and taking more damage. Maybe if some enemies were in armour that gradually had to be stripped away, or some were on horseback or had other types of weapons that brought their own unique challenges it wouldn't have been so bad. Sure, there's always the option to run and hide, but even that can be tedious at times, given how often you'll have to engage with enemies.\n\nOverall, while it's not a bad game, with plenty of enjoyment to be had, it's just one that holds so much potential, yet, sadly falls short far too often. Had it been given another 6-12 months development time I'm sure it could have been a classic for the ages, but as it is, it's merely a good, enjoyable stop along the road to far better titles.","September 10, 2015","true","27.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is built up around assassinations, as you might have guess, but the actual assassination sequences are rather dull, linear and poorly designed and not really worth doing at all. The rest of the gameplay however, the gameplay that's been put in there for no reason other than to claim it's an open world game, is specatular. Running around the cities, jumping from building to building, evading guards is one of the best open world experiences I have had since Prototype.\n\nYour are put into the shoes of Miles Desmond who, through the magical wonder of a machine called "The Animus" get to live the life of his ancestors, or in particular, this one ancestor who happens to be a 12th. century assassin during the crusades. I guess they got lucky when he didn't have to live through the life of that other ancestor that was a 15th. century bar wench.\n\nThe story gets quite a bit complicated as the life of Miles and his ancestor gets intertwined in a web of conspiracies and ancient secret societies. You know, the usual stuff. It's not a case of bad writing but it does get a little contrived towards the end and the lack of any strong and memorable characters hurts it a lot.\n\nThe fighting is mostly a case of parry and counter facing numerically superior enemies who are, fortunately for you, quite weak. Learning the tempo to this is quite easy however and you'll get bored quickly with the regular combat.\n\nThe assassinations, performed mostly with the trademarked "I cut my finger off for laughs" hidden blade, are usually a scripted sequence and often involved a chase scene of some sort. It's not particularly interesting and the amount of fighting and running that needs to be done means you'll never really feel like an assassin.\n\nThe open world is where the action is at, the movement is fluid and quick and the scenery is beautiful. Running around the city being chased by a slew of guards is open world at it's best and I'd recommend the game almost purely on that fact alone.\n\nWhen it all comes down to it, it's a game that fails at what it's trying to do and succeeds at what it's not. It's a strange combination but still a good open world play, even if what was originally intended as the core gameplay is somewhat disappointing.","November 27, 2012","true","84.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Who made it? Ubiso... Well, nevermind.\n\nAs far as my memory goes back and as strong as it is, I will tell you something about the Story first. You are playing as Ezio Auditore... later in another game... No, you are someone else in this game. You are the allmighty overpowered and underestimated Desmond Miles (who happens to be the main character but nobody gives a sh*t). Thanks to modern technology you are able to lay down and virtually slip into the Anime (or what ever that thing was called) to connect with the memories of your grand-grand-granddaddy's.\n\nEven so that in later Episodes of the game you have been given live to the next generation and still are genetically able to relive the life of your Grandparents story, you are pretty much unable to resist doing what the evil doctors tell you when they first put you in the Animu (or whatever) to become Alta√Ør, first of the Assassins in your Bloodline.\n\nNow, even so that Raymond is unable to fight back with an simple "No", Alta√Ør is able to climb the highest buildings around, take a snapshot from above, jump and fall a gazillion miles into an haystack precisely and is still able to get up after and kill a bad guy just before he takes an relaxing walk through the town on the rooftops. Shame on you Superman, you will never be that cool.\n\nAs the Story goes on, you will find out that your major target as an assassin are the Knights of the Cross, which are all over the place. After their search for taking the land and in search for the wholy grail they slowly running into your blade with open arms. You for your turn as the player would wish for Coconuts instead of the endless horsetrips through the outbacks of mountains and deserts. It is not that it doesn't look good, it is more about the "running in circles" that is taking the fun out of it.\n\nDesmond gets out of the Anonymus from time to time and sniffs around, when it is possible, to become aware of the connections between the past and present lifes until "Spoiler" the game almost ends.\n\nAs clever as it is and as good as it sells. All we want is to climb up the buildings and play death from above on every single enemy in town.\n\n\n7/10 Lonesome Cowboy","May 23, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","8","11","6","0"

I had issues loving Ezio Auditore as an Assassin, despite the fact that I am also Italian, because we witness his character's development through 3 games, and the last of the three being very, very boring (Revelation should've been a DLC from my point of view). As I enjoyed the character of Edward, and Arno I also enjoyed Altair's. Why? Because in one game only, we sort of ''fall in love'' with the character.\nTheir character develops massively throughout the entire game, they start as skilled, arrogant and cantankerous assassins to later become wise and clever. Edward initially thought about getting only money, but as soon as he witnesses the death of his loved one's, he understands the ideals of the Creed and realises that ''if more people valued home above gold this world would be a merrier place''. Same goes for Arno and Altair.\nWhat the player wants is to identify with the character or to sympathise with the character he plays as. I think it is best to see your assassin reach his golden age or highest peak in one game, because it makes your gameplay (and his story-arc) much more enjoyable.\nMany would argue saying that ''Oh ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you, he's a badass assassin tho, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you 12 year old kid!!!'' and I would simply answer that you could give Mickey Mouse an assassin outfit, a hidden blade and a baritonous voice and he would look badass too but would be a boring character (as was Connor). I sincerely found annoying that I needed to play til AC Revelations to say that Ezio was such a badass Italian, because he had suffered a lot but yet was wise and clever and had finally reached his highest peak as an assassin.\nWhat makes a great Assassin is not how badass or cool he is (...well also that), but how he learns to become one by enduring pain and suffering!!!\nAltair, Edward and Arno are by far my favourite assassins and fav AC games!!!

It's very well presented and entertaining, albeit repetitive and mundane at moments. My favorite aspects of the game are the story and general ambiance.\n\nThe plot follows Desmond, a bartender who's kidnapped by a corporation due to his lineage to assassins. After he's forced into a simulation that recreates the past by using the user's DNA, the player assumes control of Altair, a Crusades-era Middle Eastern assassin. After failing to follow a tenet of his organization, he's ordered to assassinate a set of targets in order to redeem himself. As he investigates his targets, he and Desmond begin to unearth a series of conspiracies. It's an interesting, well-written, and believable story. While it isn't remarkable, it manages to entertain.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere, the game has a simply sublime aesthetic due to it's blend of a Crusades-era Middle Ages and a modern-day subtle cyberpunk setting. The art direction is also great, and as a result it's visuals are arguably better than some later iterations in the series.\n\nHowever, gameplay-wise, it fails to live up. The story segments are enjoyable, however, in order to reach these segments, Altair has to investigate his targets. This consists of repeatedly racing across the map, beating up a target for information, and so forth. The game is also infamous for it's collectibles, which are arduous to collect and fail to provide a proper reward.\n\nOverall, Assassin's Creed is worth playing if one's interested in it. It's a game that was simply too ambitious for the time, and was rushed out in order to sell to the new console generation.","June 16, 2015","true","61.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But there is variety in these challenges, and all of this is stitched together with the most beautiful sandbox cities since GTA IV. You set your own pace in this gorgeous game.\n\nMy complaints are few: no indoor environments in cities, too much late-game swordplay, and dreadfully long mandatory cutscenes.\n\nLastly, AC offers fluid swordplay, and a parkour-like experience scrambling over rooftops. It's just fun to play, and the right length.  Thumbs up.","April 17, 2012","true","24.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Is the original game still worth playing? Yes. Absolutely. If you can get it to work.\n\nPOSITIVES: The roots of everything that made the franchise famous are in the first Assassin's Creed. The parkouring and climbing work well, the cities are large and colorful with unique atmospheres, there are plenty of collectibles to while away the hours collecting. The story is pretty good. It doesn't climb the heights attained by Assassin's Creed II / Brotherhood / Revelations, but Altair's journey as an Assassin who has fallen from grace and needs to redeem himself is great, even if it's been told before in other mediums. Graphics are decent (DirectX 10). The game world actually feels larger than some of the other Assassin's Creed games, since you don't fast-travel from one city to another (not at first); you travel on dusty dirt roads through mountains and villages from one city to another. There is a lot of country to explore, and none of the areas feel re-used (though sometimes they can seem extraneous).\n\nNEGATIVES: The game crashes, sticks, and stutters from a variety of issues. My issues were solved by unplugging my internet while playing. The servers that Ubisoft used to authenticate this game are now offline, causing the game to briefly freeze any time I tried to load a save or the game tried to create an auto-save. Lack of an internet connection tells the game to not even bother checking, so gameplay becomes smooth. Even for a game this old, it's hard getting a constant 60fps. If you're running the DirectX 10 version, I recommend setting the Compatibility Mode to Windows Vista SP2.\n\nINDIFFERENT: Activities and ambient conversations recycle constantly. Stealth doesn't have much variety: hide, walk slowly, or mix with monks. Combat is actually boring ‚Äì once you get the counter ability, countering everything results in a one-hit kill. If you're out exploring the Kingdom, enemy guards are extraordinarily suspicious unless Altair walks at the slowest speed possible. Takes away from the pace of the game. Oh, and don't fall into the water; Altair can't swim, and dies instantly.\n\nVERDICT: A pretty good Assassin's Creed game whose repetitive side-activities don't undermine a decent first attempt at a stealthy open-world-parkour-hack 'n slash hybrid. Hopefully, you can get it to work properly.","November 16, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pro_zac/recommended/15100/","Pro_zac","Prozac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pro_zac/","138 products in account","Ok. So I was postponing playing this game for a looong time now (b'cause, you know - ubisoft. Plus I tend not to play highly hyped games right away, unless they are titled Mortal Kombat). And I have to say this game is lovely regardless few glitches here and there.\n\nPros:\n- Action takes place in early middle ages (crusaders in middle east). Personally one of my favourite chapters in history.\n- Climate. Impressive, large cities. Architecture is amazing, brings up the spirit of the times. Music adds gracefully to this.\n- It's a climbing simulator.\n- It has "find the flag" mini-game.\n- It has story line! (don't get me wrong. If AC was only climbing simulator with find the flags mini-game it would be joy enough). Story is pretty interesting although not earth shaking. I like the feeling of ambiguity that Altair's last chats with his victims bring in.\n- You can try to play stealth if you wish.\n- Action oriented. Assassinations are pretty flashy and possible interactions with so many objects in the game can cause interesting twists. (I.e:  scored one templar kill by accident: was being chased, attracted attention of some templar I hadn't even noticed. He fell down the roof leaving me happy, although somewhat puzzled).\n- Antagonist and Protagonists: they are interesting in design. They don't feel cliche.\n- Open ending.\n\nCons:\n\n- Weird one time glitches:  Damascus contact's face started to melt down while we were chatting. Altair froze mid jump from horse back, and memory had to be reloaded.\n- Sometimes game breaking bug may happen: dead body carefully put on the ground might twitch and fell of the roof, causing havoc on the streets. Dead bodies can even jump high to the sky, before they fall. Pretty creepy.\n- Repetitive:  people who might not enjoy flags finding as much as I do can find this game repetitive. In each city there are flags, and sub-quests (view points, rescue civilians, some informer missions) that are either the same or very similar (informer missions may slightly very).\n- Out of 3 major cities, Damascus and Jerusalem feel the same (except one has yellow and the other green filter on). Travelling to Acre I could feel that this conquered by crusaders city is different and had it's own western-like touch to it.\n- Fighting mechanics is simplified and a bit clumsy, especially when you face a lot of enemies.\n- You will not exit this game easy on PC...\n\nIn general though: game is fun to play. And I think I do understand now, how this title is so popular. It's just joyful climbing simulator re-skinned packed with action moments. ;)","November 5, 2015","true","61.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You relieve the memories of Altair an assassin from the year of 1191. The story in this is great and makes you feel like there are two stories instead of one, the story of Altair's fight and stuggle against the templars and Desmond's involvment with Abstergo. Has one of the best twists I've seen in a game since it came out. 9.5/10\n\nGRAPHICS: The graphics in this game are of course dated since this was made in 2007. Still though they're pretty to look at and the 60fps wins me over with it's smoothness and textures but still it's dated. 7.5/10\n\nGAMEPLAY: Wow what can I say about gameplay, of course comparing the stuff you can do in AC compared to the others there's not much to do you only have 4 weapons, your fists,knive and mini knives,sword, and the iconic hidden blade but you do receive upgrades in the game as you progress through the main story. There are sidequests and with the PC version I was able to grab 4 more, annoying but helped in the main game. You can collect flags but to me there really was no point into them. Then there was the parkor and the view points....holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• their amazing. With the awesomeness of free-running and viewing the map piece by piece by the climbing on top of a tower and viewing it while an eagle is in the background just screams badass. Even though there's not much to do except do main and side missions you still have your own bit of fun. 8/10\n\nCONCLUSION: AC is a great game and again in my personal opinion is ranked 2nd best in my book due to it being the starting point to the series and NO FULL SYNC! Hope to make more of these soon and thanks for reading my first steam review.:)\n\nBUY RANK:1","February 12, 2014","true","35.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You get a mission in one of five regions, you arrive, you do all the pre-requisite "open world" missions to prepare (such as surveying the area from a perch and stealing valuable information that you can use to better approach the target), then you start the actual assassination.\n\nWhile others seemed to get annoyed with the preperation phase, I didn't mind it so much as it helped push the sense of how preparation was key for things like this, though some variety wouldn't have hurt.\n\nWhile Assassin's Creed requires a dual-core procesessor, it does perform quite well on anything that meets the minimum requirements.

Realized needed to step back a few hundred years and see what Altair was all about. Got hooked! Line... and... sinker...! The series offers more than a good RPG backdrop but a continuous storyline that stretches beyond a typical RPG. After completing this installment (had been playing ACII when stopped during memory sequence 4 to play 1st AC/Altair) I finished ACII.\n\nThe rich storyline and a deep one at that, surrounding Ezio makes playing this RPG series compelling, entertaining, and challenging. You will be challenged on many levels while playing this series. AC will seem simple after playing ACII, but if you like reading a book series, puzzles, different skill challenges, and realistic game play, you will enjoy this series... on some level. Looking forward to more Assassin's Creed story line and gameplay.\n\np.s. the music sound tracks are soundtracks are awesome and worth getting... ACII, ACIII, ACIV\n(Note: have not finished and/or played ACIII, ACIV but do have the soundtracks, the music in all three are worth the purchase)","December 25, 2013","true","65.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's due more to Assassin's Creed 2 than this game, but if you're going to play it, you should start with this one. From the creators of Prince of Persia, the animations are top-notch.  Climbing, sword-fighting, and horse riding never gets old, and it has a great story as well.\n\nI played the first game on PC. AC2 had some issues with their online DRM, so I avoided that and played AC2 on my PS3. I found that I preferred to play this series in the living room, so I got Brotherhood and Revelations on PS3 as well.  But the game plays just fine on PC and I believe Ubisoft removed the online DRM, so that's no longer an issue.\n\nSword fighting is graphic and bloody, and it only gets moreso later in the series, so probably not for the kiddies. The game contains some religious themes and tells a story that conflicts with the bible, so if that kind of stuff bothers you, you may want to stay away. Otherwise, it's an excellent conspiracy theory.","January 5, 2012","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I ended up just giving it away to my cousin for his birthday after a few hours of playing.\n\nHowever many number of years later I just now bought it again for a $5 deal and I really fought to give it a second chance with a more mature mind and a better capable gaming platform. I am now a newly found Assasins Creed fan despite how horrible I viewed the game when it first game out and on console.\n\nTook me a bit of getting used to to understand the potential of the game once I fought through my first impressions and explored what it had to offer. Gameplay kind of seems like a unique style of "travel" instead of the old impression I had of it being a rock climbing simulation. Large sword battles and knife throwing action end up being really fun mixed with a pretty interesting story I now really like the game and finished it a few minutes ago.\n\nIf you're like me, try giving it a second chance when a deal hits!","October 13, 2014","true","25.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The series is one of the biggest things in gaming for me and many others. It is one of those games that are very easy to pick apart critically but are entrancing anyway. The sense of history is unparalleled as is the general entertainment value.\n\nThe first entry is more a sketch of things to come than a fully realized game. It is clear just how much thought went into the story and the lore, but the actual gameplay is still quite limited. The variety of tasks is narrow indeed, and repetition is unavoidable. Development process was apparently cut a bit short and Ubisoft was quite surprised by the success. This is also a rough console port, with a menu system very possibly designed by Satan himself.\n\nAltair is a hard man and hard to like as well. He is completely asexual (in this game at least) and more intellectual than emotional in temperament. Yet this uncompromising attitude has it's benefits and Altair does not wear out his welcome. His voice actor, however, is a completely flaccid line-reader. Peter Renaday (Duncan from Dragon Age) steals the show as Al-Mualim. The gifted Jesper Kyd began a tradition of truly outstanding soundtracks here. Desmond Miles, in turn, began a tradition of being incredibly unnecessary in every single way possible.\n\nI would recommend the series as a whole for anyone interested in sprawling action-adventure games. Stealth is but one small ingredient. There is little to no challenge in the Assassins Creed series but it is a world to disappear into, with it's own logic and laws. I would also recommend playing II followed by Brotherhood before this.","September 29, 2013","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's easy to mistake it for a game of 2015.\n\nGameplay:\n+ The mechanics were smooth and natural, creating a realistic flow of movements.\n\n+ The climbing system is supreme.\n\n+ The fighting was very enjoyable both because of the kill moves and the crowd control. You learn new moves throughout the game as you progress but unfortunately you don't really need to put them in practice until the very end when you have to fight off some 25+ guys at once. Then all of a sudden you can't do without learning the moves. Personally I would also have preferred a more offensive character, the crowd control is built on holding your ground and waiting for the enemy's move.\n\n+ Open world\n\n+ The fact that Assassin's Creed is a stealth game without the 'sneak' or 'crouch' option is interesting to consider.\n\nCons:\n- The difficulty could have been better balanced. Three quarters of the game was just leisure, supereasy, then came missions that were irritating and the final battles were superhard. The irritating part involved begging women blocking your way, madmen pushing you around when you least wanted them to and guard chases that were just the same as in the beginning. After a 100th time they were just distracting game elements that you kind of had to grind through without feeling rewarded for it.\n\n- The missions were quite repetative which made the story linear. I felt like the game didn't take full advantage of the open world possibilites.\n\n- I didn't feel motivated to collect all the flags because there were way too many of them and I didn't see any reward behind it.\n\n- I never understood the necessaty of the fixed camera positions in the bureau scenes.\n\n- Did encounter a few glitches like character getting stuck in weird places, occasional frame rate drops but nothing game-breaking. The biggest issue was probably the game not responding to keystrokes at times, especially when initializing run or sprint.\n\n- Exiting the game was a weird lengthy process. The easiest solution was to just force quit it.","September 10, 2015","true","27.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you are, it may get boring for you and I will explain why. As others have said before me you just have to climb specific towers or buildings to unlock an area of the map usually between 9-11 in every assassination. Then you have to interrogate a person, pickpocket another one, eavesdrop yet another, gother some flags in under 3 mins or kill some guards in 3-5 mins. You will be assigned with 9 assassinations in total which for me the whole proccess is as described by others REPETITIVE.\n\nBUT\n\nPros:\nI really liked the story, even though it was short it was intelligently written. The gameplay for me it wasn't boring because in every assassination you unlock new moves which keeps you wanting for more. You are able to kill any guard or citizen you want ( even though you instantly lose life when you kill a citizen ) and of course you have to face the consequences.\n\nOverall for me it's a great game worth playing and I recommend it to anyone that loves action games.","October 26, 2014","true","28.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Desmond Miles (present day) is captured by Abstergo Company and forced to re-live the memories of his ancestor Altair Ibn La'Ahad, through the Animus. Altair was a member of an Assassin Group in the Middle Ages.

Plus, pretty good soundtrack, hard to notice while playing, however.\n+Great graphics/shaders/models, considering the fact that the game was released in 07\n+Simple combat system, but still, the animations are awesome\n+As a fan of history, a concept i enjoyed.\n\nCons\n-Graphics not that great, with some potentional glitches.\n-No replayabiliy. Few are the people who finished it more than once, most likely. It gets boring to do so.\n\n\nConcluding, totally worth buying. If you have no A.C. experience yet, start off here.

(tl;dr at bottom)\n\nWhile that might not be exactly a breathtaking score, you will get 20-30 hours of gameplay out of this bad boy if you take your time and allow yourself to be immersed into the world, which I think makes it worth the price tag. When it first came out, everybody in the right mind knew that this was a good first step for Ubisoft's new IP. I owned the Platinum Edition of the game on Xbox 360 (which had fixed almost all the bugs and glitches) and I must say that it is easily one of my favorite single-player games of all time. Collected every flag, slayed every Templar, and unlocked every achievement. So to play it again on PC was nostalgic to say the least.\n\n-Pros-\n\n1. A rich and immersive story that has never been done before. That is, if you can look past the repetitive nature through which it is told (more on that later). You can see a lot of things being set-up, and with the help of the setting it takes place in, you might just find yourself doing what I did. Which was looking up stuff about the real life Hashashin and Templar Order, and researching the Crusades and places within the game, which they did a stunning job of recreating, especially for when the game came out. Their alternate take on history is crazy-cool, but the only way to truly do it justice is by playing it for yourself.\n\n2. Stealth works quite well, although it is significantly improved upon in later editions of the game. Blending in with the masses or groups of scholars fits and is quite seamless. As things progress the city guards are on higher alert, and you'll notice more of them on the streets, and also that there are more elite guards on the look out for the infidel. They provide a fair challenge until you get a grip of the combat (which is fairly basic), and that's good because Altair is supposed to be a total badass anyway, and a master swordsman. This allows for three primary different playstyles: stealth, open combat, or a mixture of those two.\n\n3. Another major thing to mention is the climbing works well. It is what gave that magical feel to this game when you play it for the first time. An open world where I can scale buildings and run through the streets of these beautifully crafted locales using parkour? Honestly made me want to go do it in real life. And some people did, just check YouTube! This is another mechanic that was trademark of the AC series, and only got better for the most part with each new installment. For its time though the system was awe inspiring, and fit the nature of the game perfectly, allowing you to truly bring out your inner assassin.\n\n-Cons-\n\n1. I won't spoil anything actually important, or something that would ruin the story. The story and lore is great. But the gameplay that tells it... repetitive. For me, a kid who played Mercenary: Playground of Destruction several times over, this wasn't much of a problem. It was easy to look past this and appreciate it from an artistic standpoint. Still, it must be mentioned, and if you ask anybody, this is probably one of the biggest gripes on Assassin's Creed I.\n\n2. While the Director's Cut and Platinum editions fixed a lot of stuff, the game can still be buggy as hell. I *DO NOT*... repeat, do not recommend this game if it is not compatible with your PC. Like me, you'll run into occasional crashes (the game has a great autosave system though), outright unobtainable and missing flags or Templars if you want to 100% the game like I did on the 360, and simply hilarious! glitches with guards dead bodies and even Altair. Annoyingly, sometimes when performing a Leap of Faith, he'll go through the entire animation and everything only to oddly bounce off the haybale at the bottom, sometimes resulting in your death. Nothing you can do about it, although it seems to only happen in specific places.\n\n3. The game is not keyboard friendly at all. In fact, the controls aren't even described in-game for mouse and keyboard, saying things like "Press the Head button to use Eagle Vision" but you'll be screwing around for minutes trying to figure it out. I recommend a controller. However, this also has issues setting it up. Majority of people, including myself, had to do a quick internet search, download a patch to get the game to recognize the Xbox 360 PC controller properly. Even still, keyboard and mouse with the Assassin's Creed games just feels awkward and wrong. I recommend a controller, and spend the ~10-15 minutes fixing it if needed + learning the controls of the game. At least if you learn them now, you'll basically know how to play the rest of the series.\n\n4. The graphics did not quite withstand the test of time, but you shouldn't go into this game expecting anything like that. They were awesome for 2007 as far as I'm concerned, and hopefully you can look past those kinds of vain things to appreciate what lies beneath the surface. They're not terrible or anything, but lacking by today's standards... although, again, don't know why you would bother with such unfair comparison.\n\n---\n\ntl;dr is if it is compatable with your PC, buy it. More than likely, your computer will be 'too good to play the game'. Of course, if you don't mind dealing with occasional glitches and bugs, most of which are humorous but might detract from the immersion, go for it anyway. Your call. The story is fantastic, and you should definitely pick it up if you want to play and understand the following installments. Worth the money with plenty of content and mild replayability, and a definite gem of 2007 despite its repetitious nature.","January 8, 2015","true","19.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A game which started off as a spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia series quickly grew into massive IP of its own. Although it's the first in the AC franchise Assassin's Creed is far from a great game. It has its pros that grew to define the franchise for what it is and also several cons that needs to be address. The game is set in the year 1191 during the height of the Third Crusade between the Muslims and Christians. The game covers several Middle Eastern locations which are rarely seen in gaming such as Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. It's great to see Ubisoft tackle this sort of environment in a more historical setting than what modern Middle Eastern looks like. The environment feels immersive in its on way with Crusade guards along corner, horse riding in the frontier and also sword fighting. You play as Altair, an arrogant master assassin in the Assassin Brotherhood who has lost his title due to his own pride. Throughout the course of the game you're tasked with eliminating nine Templars while questioning the motives behind the assassination an your Brotherhood itself. The story is rather forgettable because it basically involves you moving from one city to another assassinating on Templar member to another which felt repititive. The only redeeming factor is probably the plot twist at the end.\n\nThe gameplay of Assassin's Creed is more of an action adventure game with added stealth mechanic. You can hide with scholars, on benches with citizens and also in hiding spots like stacks of hay. Movement in this game is rather annoying as Altair's running feels more like robot than an agile assassin with a poor camera control on top of it. Climbing also suffers from the same problem with some aspect of the building looks climbable but actually isn't. The combat of the game also doesn't par that well. Although it is still requires more skills than in future installments. You can't just swing your sword to easily kill all of the enemies as some enemies can actually counter and block. There's also no button prompts for counter so timing your counter is crucial. The stealth section of this game is kind of useless because sometimes guard can even detect you even if you're behind a wall. Even with all the research and eavesdropping about your current target, assassinating them stealthily is still a challenge bacause of the bad AI.\n\nWith all that being said, Assassin's Creed is still a worthwhile game especially for die hard fan of the series. Even though it has its flaws here and there it is still pretty enjoyable being able to run across rooftops and escape from guards and also fighting hordes of enemies at a time. For a of a franchise the game is okay as it leaves a lot of room of improvement and I would gladly give it a score of 6/10.","May 6","true","16.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/15100/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Assassin‚Äôs Creed is a game with lots of cool ideas that ultimately fail to come together cohesively. You just get the feeling that the developers were forced to release whatever they had done for the 2007 holiday season, whether it was ready or not. In that way, it reminds me a lot of the first Mass Effect - lots of great ideas, cool story and universe, but ultimately not as good as it should have been (which, like AC, was mostly rectified with the second game in the series).\n\nBut first things first... let‚Äôs break down what works and what doesn‚Äôt. As mentioned above, what works are the ideas the game puts forth, both in terms of story and gameplay. The story centers on a clandestine battle between two orders - the Assassins and the Templars. You play as Desmond Miles, a present-day descendant of Assassins, who has been captured by an organization named Abstergo (the modern day corporate face of the Templars). Using a device called the Animus, Desmond is forced to re-live the memories of his ancestor, an Assassin named Altair, in order to find a mysterious artifact.\n\nThe game is played from Altair‚Äôs point of view and takes place in the cities of Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, circa 1200. It is here that you can see where the majority of the work was put into the game. The cities are sprawling, alive, and built with tons of detail. You really do almost feel like you could be in those places at that time. It‚Äôs quite impressive, technically. Gameplay centers around two main mechanics - free-running and combat. Free-running allows you to run across streets, rooftops and climb buildings in a fluid manner. When it works, it‚Äôs great fun, but oftentimes you‚Äôll accidentally fall off buildings or jump in a completely wrong direction or climb something you didn‚Äôt want to, etc. Clearly the developers hadn‚Äôt worked out all the kinks yet. The combat is interesting, but nothing special. There are lots of options and it looks great in motion, but it‚Äôs not particularly difficult or engaging. Simply mashing buttons usually works in most cases. However, you can clearly see the potential in it. So again... good ideas, but not yet implemented as well as they could be.\n\nWhere the game ultimately fails is in the design. Assassin‚Äôs Creed 1 can basically be boiled down to the following: go to a city, climb a few towers, beat up a few people (or some other menial task), assassinate a high-priority target, return to home base. Repeat this 9 times and you‚Äôre done. It‚Äôs all very tedious and gets boring quickly. While there are a few different types of tasks and side missions that you can do in the cities, none of it really rises above being mediocre. The most interesting parts of each chapter are the final assassinations, but even in these cases, the verdict is mixed. Instead of actually being able to sneak around stealthily and assassinate your targets, many of these encounters just end up turning into a big brawl (not exactly what one would expect in a game involving secret assassins).\n\nUltimately, the game is promising, but flawed. The ideas underlying the story are definitely cool and the environments are really nice (for their time), but as a game, it is simply average in most respects. It also doesn‚Äôt help that the Altair character isn‚Äôt terribly compelling and nothing really interesting even happens until the very end. That said, this game is worth checking out if the premise intrigues you and you think you might be interested in the series as a whole (which, for the record, DOES get better). If you think that might be the case, my recommendation would be to either skip this game entirely and watch all of the cut-scenes/ending online, or play through it doing only the barest minimum needed in order to continue.\n\nGrade: C\n\nNote: I don‚Äôt recommend playing any of the Assassin‚Äôs Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.","February 7, 2013","true","23.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I haven't actually touched the Assassin's Creed series yet. I own 1-4 and Brotherhood/Revelations. It was always on my "to do" list and it kept getting pushed to the side. Well I finally got to playing the first one.\n\nIf like me you've played any of the modern "Prince of Persia" games Ubisoft released a couple generations ago, then it won't take long for you to get into the gameplay. The game is built on the concept of parkour, scaling walls and running over the city rooftops and pieces of environment. It's basically a free running sandbox, with the goal of stealthily killing select targets in your missions.\n\nI have had people tell me that Assassin's Creed 1 has got nothing on 2, but I decided to play through 1 anyway, and for a first in the series? It's pretty solid. It did feel like it was missing a key element or two in it's formula, and that's what I assume 2 addresses. But for a new IP it's definitely a strong start.\n\nOnly real complaint is that you never pull off an assassination as cool as the opening FMV. At least, I couldn't figure out how to do something like that anyway. The game is still quite enjoyable besides.

I've played through AC1 - Revelations on consoles and have decided to revisit AC1 - AC3 and eventually the rest on PC with 100% completion.\n\nThere are two mind sets I would review this game in; 1. Completing purely for the story and background. 2. Completely the game 100% (All collectibles and missions etc..).\n\nIf you're more of a number 1. then by all means purchase this game and enjoy the backstory to the others and if you're like me then play the rest. The only real downside the completing the game like this is sometimes the parkour movement will seem clunky especially late game. I won't spoil when I started getting frustrated with it.\n\nHowever if you're the wanting to full clear this game with all collectibles found and all missions completed then you may or may not want to skip this one depending on your patience.\n\nProblem 1. As I said the parkour in this game can be clunky if you're not going straight forward. As can be expected it's only the first in the series.\n\nProblem 2. The side missions are very repetitive. You will essentially have a cookie cutter copy of missions through each district in the game (a total of 9). The only thing changing will be the final assassination.\n\nProblem 3. Since I had decided to do a full completion run I found myself constantly Shift+Tabbing to a steam guide for all the locations. Now for some reason this game does not take that too kindly and if you remain in the Shift+Tab state for too long the game will simply crash. I have tried to numerous fixes I could find but not of them stopped the problem entirely. Thank fully AC1 auto saves after every collectible pick up so I never lost data. Just patience.\n\nIf you are going to go for 100% completion make sure you have Vertical Sync ON for the ruins in the kingdom. As one of the jumps in which you will need to ledge grab for a flag is impossible without this setting! You will know it when you see it.\n\n\nNow for just general gameplay:\n\nProblem 4. Speaking of the final assassinations (don't worry no spoilers here). I found that most of them cannot be "stealth" killed. Now I don't entirely remember if the following games have improved on this to allow the player to stealth or styalise their final kills but in the first game it is essentially find the target, kill all the guards and then kill the target.\n\nTL;DR\nThis is a great game for the first in its series and I highly recommend it for pure story playthroughs. If you are willing to go through 25+ hours and occassional crashes + clunky parkour at times then it will also be great for a full completion (all collectibles / missions).\n\nEnjoy and Happy Assassinating!\n\n","July 20, 2014","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game possesses a very historically-centric plot and the parkour gameplay foundation that the franchise, and many others, now use.\n\nFirst off, the gameplay has aged somewhat badly, particularly if you've played any other parkour movement games released since. The movement in this game is noticeably slower than its sequels, especially when climbing up the sides of towers and buildings. The combat, however, is both better and worse than that in the sequels. It is much simpler, not allowing nearly as many options in combat and can be very slow when fighting multiple opponents. On the plus side, it is more difficult than the newer Assassin's Creed games, actually providing somewhat of a challenge in combat.\n\nNow, the real highlight of this game is the plot. While it may be told in a very weak way, with you doing the same things over and over in different locations and being rewarded with a monologue, it is a very thematically/morally strong plot. It addresses the nature of good and bad on a very deep level and if you enjoy philosophy or analyzing morality, you will love it. It's truly a shame that they dropped this plot strength in the later iterations of the game.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the game, as I feel it is still great fun, and the message is simply unforgettable.","April 6, 2015","true","62.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a sandbox nature game with remarkable visuals, sound effects and story, which is based on historical events and people. There are two overlaping stories in this game: Desmond Miles and Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, through machine called Animus. Within the Animus, Alta√Ør's memories reveal that he was attempting to stop Robert de Sabl√© from taking an artifact from a Solomons temple, but broke all three of the assassin brotherhood's tenets in the process. The brotherhood leader, Al Mualim, demotes Alta√Ør to the rank of novice, and assigns him the task of assassinating nine people, all of whom are Templars, to regain his former status. As Alta√Ør assassinate them one by one he realises something is wrong about this assignment and that these people somehow are connected. Overall pretty good story,\nThe gameplay consist out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim. To achieve this goal, you must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional "recon" missions before attempting the assassination. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.\nOverall it‚Äòs pretty good game, worth your attention but it does have downsides. The bad: It‚Äòs repetitive and does not provide much graphic options for high end pc, combat is clunky and sometimes feels awkward.

It's a fantastic place and the cities are a sight to behold.\nAlso, even I, clumsy as I am, had a blast jumping, climbing and stalking through these scenes - this games makes you feel much more competent than you are, which adds a lot to the fun.\nThe story has an interesting spin (you'll see right at the beginning).\nAll in all very recommended. I'm looking forward to the other entries in this series.\nHere are some play tips (very mild spoilers):\nDon't try to collect all flags. This is seriously madness and not needed, unless you are unhealthily obsessed :-)\nYou can skip "save the citizens" sidequests BUT every 15 finished sidequests (informer quests, view points scaled, citizens saved) your hit point increase by one and you may even gain extra abilities, which helps a lot. You max out at 20 (two bars), so plan accordingly.\nI'd always scale all view points. These discover side quests and reveal the map, which is helpful when fleeing or planing to strike.\nYou don't need to do all informer quests (3 out of 6). The info gained is not that helpful either. But - see above.","June 21, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This year I finally bought tne entire AC Series, and of course, started by the first (even with all AC II fame).\n\nI regret to have taken so long to buy the game.\n\nEven on 2014, Assassin's Creed has a huge counter weight when compared to newer games, with more advanced technologies and more detailed graphics. With a unique artistic production and game system, you initially see yourself stuck to climb buildings all the time. Then you begin to sink into the story, and your bind with Alta√Ør only grows.\n\nYou watch an assassin make his path to redemption and, along with him, begins to wonder about the course of history, and if what you are asked to do is really the right thing.\n\nThe combat system is initially somewhat confusing. The complexity of it, however, is quickly outmaneuvered as you progress in the game, it even becomes a little boring and instinctive. Still, when confronted by multiple enemies, a wrong move can cost a lot. And if you need to flee, the adrenaline is guaranteed (specially with the amazing soundtrack).\n\nDefinitely I'm not disappointed with any aspect of the game (a little with the combat system that gets a bit boring along the way).

I have always been a big fan of Assassin Creed, and owned all the collectors editions on my Xbox, but as I transitions to PC, I really missed Assassins Creed. AC really kickstarted my gaming hobby, and now that it has finally been released to PC, I am more than happy to say it made a smooth transition, with slightly better graphics than on consoles! Director's Cut is not much different than the original game, but is still a respectable port to the PC. I cannot say much about the graphics as they are very outdated by todays standards, but keeping in mind this assassins creed is over 6 years old! Gameplay feels fast paced, challenging, and smooth! Story is pretty basic, and the entire game is basically repeating the same 3 primary missions, over and over again. The whole climb everywhere feature is amazing, and still beats most games to date! I love that we finally got a PC version of Assassins Creed, because it's an outstanding series!\n\nConcept: Honestly very basic, the storyline is very repetitive, following one basic task to the next. 75/100\n\nGraphics: For its time, it's outstanding, everything has a suprising ammount of detail, and is very respectable. 90/100\n\nSound: Sounds effects are great, but the overall soundtrack is very boring, and feels like it was left to the last second while in development. 75/100\n\nPlayability: Using a keyboard and mouse feels great and was very well implimented!

That alone will sell it for some people, so I figured I'd start with that.\n\nStill here? Alright.\n\nThe controls for freerunning are mostly handled by the game, you simply hold the right buttons down and push the direction you want to go. I'm usually skeptical about letting a game try to decipher what I wanted my character to do based on very little actual control, but in this case, I almost never fell to my death based on a decision the game made for me, which is good. The combat is pretty easy, and the controls are as tight as the sequels. The swordplay is intuitive. Usually, the only time you will get destroyed is if you happen across an elite enemy early on, with many of your advanced skills missing. The combat in this game is very much for fans of the "one-man-army" idea. There is very little actual stealth required. Even if you screw it up and the entire city is out to kill you, you can defend yourself without a problem if you can counter. That said, the stealth is not unfun. The game is very up-front about giving you feedback on everything you need to know about who or what is or isn't your enemy, what you can and can't get away with, and when you are and aren't visible, at all times.\n\nThe story is good, but it's better in the sequels. It's also pretty repetitious in this game. After your first or second assassination, you can probably decide for yourself if you will enjoy the rest of the game. The only break from the norm is near the end, where you will be forced to play out the "one-man-army" scenario mentioned above, so again, I emphasize, this is not really a stealth game. It's a hack-and-slash with stealth elements, where both are mostly optional. This means, though, that you are given the choice of how you want to play the game. You can hide in plain sight, mocking your enemies from the crowd, or you can be a total delinquent, make the guards very angry, and kill the beggars that throw rocks at you (the game stops penalizing you for that once the story is completed). The assassination missions also have multiple solutions. You are given a lot of freedom in terms of gameplay, again, except at the end. Stealth is impossible during the final chapter. Overall, I would recommend playing through Ezio's storyline (Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations) first, then giving this one a try if you find yourself a fan. The sequels are superior, but this one is also worth looking at.","December 8, 2013","true","39.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a good game, but it becomes borderline monotonous and repetetive.\n\nI loved the story and the settings the game takes place in, being able to ride horseback, the "stealthy" parts of the game. Practically everything. What I hated was, no ability to save your game (it autosaves and you can't skip cutscenes so if you exit and start back to a point you already where...you have to wait), it becomes a real pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• at times. The storyline missions become very repetetive and are basically almost the same until you get to the intended target. Go into city, find person, kill person, etc... It gets very tedious if you try and finish the game in one go. Thankfully you get "fast travel" which cut down on the repetetive nature slightly. I got so bored at one point, I started pretending I was Batman and killing guards 'cause they kept bragging about their parents. The timed missions were annoying (some more than others, but I think you can ignore them for other quests to progress if you aren't 100%'ing the game) and one I felt was poorly designed (the timed one where you break the stalls which puts guards on you in seconds which takes precious seconds away, the time is too short, people scatter and you can't exactly grab people and bring them there without automatically throwing them). They couldn't add an exit button to the main screen, so you gotta go back into your profile and exit. My favorite, the main character has Aquagenic urticaria. You touch water and bam dead which was fun when he kept missing simple friggen jumps.\n\nThe repetetive-ness and the lack of a proper save option were my two main gripes but the rest of the game makes up for it. If anything don't expect to binge play this to the end. I kept playing in blocks, If I played straight through, I'd have been extremely bored. As always, your opinion may differ.\n\nEdited this (Jan 22 2014) to clarify some things better","January 17, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty much everything is climbable. The implementation is not perfect and will sometimes frustrate you, but it is for the most part solid and works well. Without doubt, the satisfaction of scaling buildings and jumping across rooftops lasts the duration of the game.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning for its time. In particular the draw distance is very impressive. Standing at the top of a tower in one of the game's cities and being able to see past the city gates and to the rolling hills beyond is a lovely eye-candy experience. This is definitely a strong point of the game.\n\nI must, however, point out that the game is very poorly optimised - something I believe is largely endemic to the Assassin's Creed series on the PC. Aside from the frame rate being hard-capped at 60fps, I very rarely found myself hitting this number and instead would hover somewhere between 30-40fps.\n\nThis will turn a lot of people off and sadly there is no good reason or excuse for it. Obviously, this will annoy some people more than others. If you can "tolerate" a console-level refresh rate then you have nothing to worry about. For those used exclusively to frame rates of 60fps and above, however, you might as well give it a miss if you aren't willing to compromise on this aspect.\n\nAnother major criticism I would level at the game is its lack of variety and its reptitiveness. After I progressed past the initial levels and into the game proper, I often felt like I was playing an extended tech demo. It's clear that the title was built upon the climbing mechanic and that the plot and design came second.\n\nThis wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing were it not for the fact that you pretty much do find yourself doing the same few tasks over and over throughout the course of the game, with random spatterings of narrative here and there.\n\nAs someone who likes to complete all side objectives and acquire every collectable in my games, I found Assassin's Creed distinctly unrewarding in this regard. There are an (infamous) number of collectables in this game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What makes it is problem, however, are the literally non-existant rewards for actually finding all of them. The game also provides no tools to assist in your collectable hunt, instead simply relying on you meticulously combing every single inch of the maps in search of them. I disagree with this model simply because it takes up too much time unnecessarily. At any particular moment there are thousands of good games worth your attention - can you really justify spending an hour or two poking around a map looking for that one last pickup?\n\nPersonally, I say no - especially when the game doesn't reward you for it.\n\nDespite this, I would say Assassin's Creed is worth most people's time, if only to set yourself up for the other installments in the series. One thing I have been told repeatedly is "Don't play later Assassin's Creed games before playing the first" and I can imagine why this makes sense. The game is novel provided you haven't played similar titles or other games in the series, and the meta aspect of the plot can be compelling, although you ultimately learn very little by the end of the game.\n\nFor this reason, I recommend Assassin's Creed, if only to set yourself up to play the later installments in the series.","April 27, 2014","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Smooth combat and facial animation put even recent RPG games to shame. The middle east during the times of the crusaders is believable and feels very authentic. This game is executed to a very high level and is definitely worth the full price even after so many years.\n\nAssassin's Creed on the PC is however not without its faults. Make no mistakes, this was made-for-console. Any PC gamers will immediately find the PC controls clunky. There are many console-nastiness such as checkpoint saving and ridiculous combat controls which plainly does not work on a mouse and keyboard. I gave up trying to remember all the different keys for all the combat moves and used only block/retaliate which requires only right and left mouse buttons.\n\nThe gameplay can also get quite repetitive and it's a chore to do the tasks because 90% of the time you are wading through people and trying to blend in. Run a bit and you get caught. Bump into someone, you get caught. It's fun the first few times, but gets really annoying after a few hours. Sometimes people just wanna play and walking slowly doing nothing is not playing. Replayability is poor because after 20 hrs, i just wanna get it over with.\n\nAll the funky console issues aside, I would definitely still recommend all RPG fans to get this game.

Sure there's more to it than that, but what else do you need, really?\n\nHow about a great story with interesting characters?  Would that entice you?  Here we have Altair, an experienced assassin who's gotten a bit too big for his britches, so the leader of his order has decided to knock him down a few pegs.  In order to get back in the good graces of his mentor and his colleagues, he has to go track down several targets by the book and get back in touch with his roots.\n\nBut not all is as it seems . . . the morality of what he is doing begins to trouble Altair as he learns that his targets seem to be doing evil but also seem to have good intentions at heart.  And signs begin to point to a larger plot threading these targets together, bigger stakes to be won.  Eventually Altair has to learn what is going on, discover who he can really trust, and find a deeper understanding of himself and his creed.\n\nBut hey, let's not downplay the throatstabbing!  And the gutstabbing!  And the knife throwing and the sword fighting and the many other ways there are to murderize your enemies.  Plenty of running around on rooftops, jumping people while their backs are turned, and escaping into the crowd before the guards crack your skull open.\n\nThere are a lot of great ideas in this game!  Of course . . .\n\nThe Bad\n. . . a lot of those ideas are not fully realized.  The first Assassin's Creed very much feels like the testing ground for a lot of promising stuff, and sadly not all of it clicked right away.  Many of the missions and sub-missions are interesting at first, but lack variation, gradually becoming dull through constant repetition.  The combat can likewise become something of a chore, mostly just standing there waiting for your opponent to attack so you can counterattack, then waiting for the next opponent to attack so you can counterattack, ad nauseam.  Fast travel hadn't been introduced yet, so just getting from the central hub to any of the destination cities could take a depressingly long time.  Many of the stealth elements were handled in a very strange way . . . Altair can slowly plod around cities in full assassin regalia and a ton of weapons strapped to his bod, for example, and garner no attention whatsoever, but if he dares try to move even as fast as a somewhat brisk walk, the guards immediately sense he's up to no good and start viciously attacking.\n\nIn short, AC is dragged down somewhat by its own carefully constructed drudgery.\n\nNow this may all sound like I went back and played this game after playing the others am thus judging it unfairly against the progress made by those that followed, but I must point out that this is not so!  I started here and have been working my way through the series in order.  These problems are all things I noticed my first time through, and I was pleasantly surprised to find afterward that the later installments fixed a lot of them.  And despite all of that . . .\n\nOverall\n. . . it's still an immensely fun game to play!  The greatness in the series overall is very easy to sense in this game because it's extremely close to the surface.  Unpolished, perhaps.  Clunky, in a way.  But still quite serviceable and attached to a very good story.  Definitely worth buying and playing.","June 28, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some side-quests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplay-wise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again\nI'd say too it's something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassin's Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels\nFirst of all, the game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the target's town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassin's Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine: leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics: very interesting, I won't deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity\nSecond, Assassin's Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as anti-villains and well intentioned extremists. Their final speeches are the main highlight of the game's plot, in my opinion\nSuffice to say, I really think Assassin's Creed the first is the only worthy game of the series this far, with Assassin's Creed III coming very close to give me the same feelings","July 12, 2013","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The menues feel as though there should just be something MORE, but once in the game and once you start understanding how to interact with the world, you embark on an interesting quest. The truly unique thing about this game that seperates itself from its sequels is that IT IS the Assassin's Creed. That's the story. The Creed that the Assassins follow. It introduces a philosophy that is not only true in so far as the word "Truth" is... really... ony just a metaphysical (none-physical) idea... but compelling.\n\nCome.

As for the controls, I managed to play with the Xbox 360 gamepad so they weren't as clunky as mentioned with Keyboard+Mouse. Although, since this game is the first of this annual release franchise, there was many aspects that was clunky and boring. I'll get to that down below!\n\nThe game itself is linear and repetetive, but the amazing art style(which makes the game feel kinda "dusty"), freerunning mechanic and combat made the game a revolutionary success!\n\nPROS:\n+Intriguing story that keeps you guessing until the very end (both the animus and real reality),\n+Interesting visuals and especially the artstyle (Impressive graphics even to this day).\n+Amazing soundtrack (Jesper Kyd really truly rocks! It's great that he's back with AC2, AC: Brotherhood and AC: Revalations. Sadly, Ubisoft discarded this great composer for AC3 and AC4).\n+Freerunning gameplay adds some exploration to the game.\n+Escaping "your assassination" pumps your adrenaline! Sad this feature was removed on the other AC games as you actually feel like an assassin there.\n\nCONS:\n-Experienced a few game crashes and freezes so maybe it can be attributed to Windows 8.1 although, I haven't left any game progress!\n-Audio stuttering.\n-No subtitles (closed captions).\n-Repetitive submissions, tasks.\n-Can't swim!\n-Eagle Eye vision mode cannot be use while moving.\n-Annoying NPC that hinder your progress during freerunning (namely the beggars, drunks, etc).\n-HUGE amount of collectibles that serves no real purpose besides collecting (Flags).\n-Last missions requires you to SOLO fight multiple enemies at once and that repeats a few times. If you haven't mastered the controls by then, you'll be restarting quite often!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nYes, I really recommend this game if by some chance, you haven't played THE GAME that spawned a big successful franchise. You may become bored though once you finished the game so for the replayability factor, it can be either low or high, if you really liked it. In my case, since I haven't played it since 2008, it was worth a revisit as I was due to catch up my Assassin's Creed craving.\n\nRATING:\n8.0 / 10\n\nNothing is true, everything is permitted.","May 19, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh, sure, the assassinations drive the plot, and they are probably the high points of the game, but a lot of this game made more sense to me when I discovered it was originally concieved as a Prince of Persia spinoff. And that really is the case - the chase sequences and getting around the open-world environment generally consists of hopping and swinging around. It lacks the motivational buzzsaws and spiked pits of its forebear, but the combat and platforming is really remisicent of the Sands of Time series.\n\nA lot of people complain about the controls, and the "one-button" platforming can result in some annoying moments. When it works, it's delightful as you leap from beam to beam effortlessly. But sometimes, you'll be running across rooftops, trying to flee some guards, and running into a small raised portion you expect to spring over, when suddenly you cling to it like a koala as the guards surround you. The fault, to me, is largely in the environments, which at times have obstacles or areas the controls really aren't designed for.\n\nThe missions are the simple fare you'd generally expect for an open-world game - go here, fight there, etc. Most missions are repeated over and over, making the assassinations a fresh breath of air between having to rescue scores of civilians. If you don't worry about completing every mission, I understand this game can be powered through in a few hours, like many open-world games. Most of the missions are simple and not terribly difficult, with the exception of some later stealth missions that are a frustrating exercise in trial and error.\n\nDespite being over half a decade old at the time of this review, the game is gorgeous. The environments are immersive and great, and the missions where you climb up to the top of a viewpoint never got old for me on account of the amazing vistas. About the only criticism that really can be leveled are the somewhat wooden faces during cutscenes. As far as game art goes, it's a great artistic achievement, with a distinctive environment.\n\nCombat is much like Prince of Persia, only the main issue is that basic timing with counterattacks will win nearly every fight. Most of my fights consisted on spamming attacks, and as soon as an enemy attacked, counter. The game often tries to punish you for transgressions with hordes of guards, which are easily dispatched to clear your wanted status. It's similar to the fighting systems from later games like Arkham Asylum or Sleeping Dogs, only plagued with one good solution to many issues.\n\nThe story and setting are interesting and unique, even if the overall plot ends up a bit lacking. The assassination targets are often interesting and blatantly cast in shades of grey, often leaving it to the player as to whether or not their death was warranted. Unfortunately, many of the assassinations boil down to a plain fight, often without a means to perform a "clean kill". Despite the Crusades-based setting, it doesn't play heavily into the plot, and doesn't delve too much into matters of history, instead focusing on its own conspiratorial mythology. The modern framing sequences are interesting in their implications, but are hampered by strictly being a narrative device, not allowing the player any agency and a bare minimum of exploration.\n\nDespite the flaws, I'd generally recommend giving it a shot if it still sounds interesting, especially since it's regularly on sale during the Steam sales. It's a good barometer for deciding whether or not you'll enjoy the following games (which are major expansions and refinements on the gameplay presented there), and honestly it's worth trying as something quite different from an AAA developer. It's an experiment in a lot of ways, though, and you have to go in understanding it's a fairly flawed gem.\n\nEdit: Also ignore the flag collectibles entirely. It's one of the worst collectible systems devised and is entirely skippable, and you earn nothing more than having a spot filled in on your pause menu.

Since it will not resonate or inspire their imagination as much.\n+ Supporting the previous point: the historical accuracy/plausibility is brilliant, considering how history is normally retold in the media.\n+ In connection to the first point: The main character is not as bland as he seems (nor does any other character to be honest). We have seen multiple main characters in many other games that said and did less. Clearly this main character hasn't resonated with everyone in the audience, but not everyone is capable of understanding the depth behind his statements, the fact that they're at times laconic gives them more depth (however, not everyone perceives it so).\n+ A great many small details which show the care of the development team (ex: the changing of the sword which you carry as the game progresses, this is not easily noticeable. Enemies that are not hit fatal blows will yell and bleed on the floor in agony, just as real sword battles should do. You can even end their misery. Ability to switch between weapons and fighting styles, very easily. Environmental ambience, architecture, music, character modelling, and actors. They thought of having the A.I react to you climbing, by throwing rocks at you. Having an enemy climb down a ladder while you are on it, they will kick you. Ability to push enemies off roofs to their deaths mid-combat. Tons of details)\n+ A wide range of new inovations or smoother implementations of mechanics and aspects are presented in this game, which makes it more noteworthy. (i.e: freerunning, melee combat, horse riding)\n- Game is made for consoles, so the PC version has more bugs and glitches. Full HD resolution is also unstable, which is why it is greyed out in the menu. I have replayed this game on xbox without facing any bugs, however I tried to revisit it on PC and it was a bit bothersome, especially with the game randomly crashing at times (since, I was trying to play it in full resolution.\n+ The amazing quality of the graphics (in full resolution only), everytime I revisit or look again at this game, I am simply amazed by how visually appealing this game is.\n-+ The repetitive format of the missions was for a reason, adding to the realism by needing to scout and survey before actually doing the mission. (This along with a few other small aspects from AC 1 and 2 are echoed but not well enough in AC:Unity). However, I agree that it negatively impacts that section of the game's replayability. +But these are optional and you are not forced to complete them.\n-+ Hand to hand combat isn't that great either, the fact that the option is there is good though (however you are forced to use it in some side missions), but the ability to use it to throw enemies as a finisher is pretty cool. In AC 2 they address this melee problem and make it very desirable to use since you can start using any enemy weapon through this, also fun to watch disarms (I'm not sure about being able to kick your opponents when they're on the ground was added in AC 1 or 2, so I wont place it).\n+-Not being able to swim isn't a negative, considering how much the developers worked on the huge range of things in the game. I think the reason they did this (choosing not to implement swimming) was because of the A.I, which might be why in the following ACs, the AI still cannot swim and die when they touch the water.\n+ Adding to the previous note on Altair, his voice actor here is brilliant, unlike the later AC:Revelations actor who gives the young version of Altair a very American Hollywood accent. Then again, a big part of the original team, including Patrice D√©silets (One of the main creators of the game) was forced to quit around the time of the development of AC:Brotherhood (which I consider the beginning of the winding road which sent the series to its demise, losing most of what it originally had, with whatever remaining as bare bones).\n+ This game replies to real world context of a prejudiced audience and biased media. Which again, links to the first point regarding the historical links, philosophy, movement of people and ideas. I truly felt (and still do) that this game broke through multiple barriers.\n\nTo elaborate on this character's development, and compare him to the similar theme with other AC main characters. We see him in the beginning as brash, arrogant and impetuous. However, when faced with the reality (of whatever, the real world, 'the truth', responsibility, or you could consider all the above), they quickly mature and become the wise and calm sage-like individuals (or at least calmer, they're still human). This again links to the pursuit of knowledge, truth and philosophy, mentioned above. We see this pattern with all the main characters, but most quickly with Altair, which Ezio remarks on in admiration when he was discovering the past of his ancestor. This is why I liked AC:Revelations more in comparison to Brotherhood, since you get to see the older Altair as well as the older Ezio, with the similarities more explicitly shown, and one of the many patterns of humans and individuals is shown, simply put as 'the repetition of history', which is another major theme in the series.\n\nAnd replying to 3 unique criticisms, which I felt rated the game on idealistic, current (2014-2015) expectations:\n-Little Interaction with crowds: What? This game putting in a huge and vibrant crowd, which is pretty amazing considering its pioneering position. In the sequel which is released 2 years later, they make it possible to hide within crowds. In this game however, you see early mechanics of such, ex: sitting on benches between people, using monks to hide between them as your crowd to blend in.\n-Emptiness between cities: this ‚Äúemptiness‚Äù was quite a rich area, which showed small farming towns, with farmers, military outposts, trade checkpoints, patrols, rich and diverse landscape of the Levant, with mountains and open fields. It was actually quite impressive, and a great way to explore the new horse riding system they implemented.\n-The cliff-hanger ending: This game was released as simply ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äù and not ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äôs Creed: Arrival‚Äù. The game needed an ending which showed the continuity of the story and history, that you (as desmond) are nothing special, and that you are simply a piece of a long line of others like you. And at the time of the release, it was not certain that they would or would not make a sequel, which is why they left it with a possibly open ended ending so to be able to carry on from it. I remember it was amazing to see such an ending and I truly hoped to see a continuation, which was very well done with the elaboration regarding the First Civilization and conspiracy theories (I can‚Äôt say the same about the  later conspiracy puzzles and such, which for example: was noted in Brotherhood for its sub-par quality in comparison to 2, which is why they completely removed those conspiracy puzzles).\nThus in context, this game did so much that was right for its time, that it released a very long and drawn out series because of it. A very similar comparison is with CoD 1 and its later successors.\n\nIn summary, this is one of the games that I would consider well made and it doesn't deserve the 7/10s that have been posted by so many others. This game truly deserves a 9.5/10 considering the huge step it to it took in so many aspects.","February 28, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It also has amazing graphics for it's time and age which is a really great thing. In this review I'm going to be letting you know about the good and the bad for this game, (although it's generally good and I would highly reccomend).\n\nSomething that I thought was great about this game is that it wasn't one of them horrible console to PC ports with horrible controls. It worked absolutely fine, and though I haven't, I'm sure it would also work great with a controller. Now, that aside, the general controls for the game were... let's say interesting. This is not because of it being a port, but part of the storyline. Basically you complete the levels in the Anamus and are reliving your ancestors memories. You have to be completely in sync with what they did, therefore as you are playing through their memories, the controls are a bit weird. For instance, you can't simply press the space bar to jump, you need to press 'W', the right mouse button and then the SPACE bar. There are many other examples aside from that too.\n\nThe storyline for this game is absolutely amazing. You start of as a reckless assassin, ignoring the clear rules of the assassin code, therefore having your rank stripped of you. To regain your rank, the assassin leader, Al Mualim, requests for you to kill 9 'corrupt' leaders in different cities. Around the cities you learn more evidence about whatever plot or plan the leader's are planning, eventually you kill the leaders ect. The end of the game has a very dark twist, and I'm not going to tell you, because that would be spoilers but if you play the game with no knowledge of it, such as I did, it will be quite a shock. The game also has quite a good storyline outside of the Anamus, as you have been kidnapped by modern day Templars who are using your ancestors memories to locate the other Apple of Eden's scattered across the world.\n\nThe gameplay for this game was generally good, but it could get quite clonky at times when trying to face more than 10 other enemies at a time especially if they are templars or highly suspicious guards. The game was also pretty repetitive as every time you entered a city you have to complete 3 investigations, such as earsdropping, stealing, interrigation and more. When finally facing the target things become less repetitive as each target has something different up their sleave leaving things to get more and more difficult.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game and would highly reccomend it. I would rate this game an 8/10.","February 28, 2015","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game not only lets you relive history in a slightly alternative way, but it brings it into modern times by tying in ancient secret world orders that have survived for centuries and now run the world behind the scenes. Manipulating history and giving its own explanation of how we came to be. It might offend some of you who are died hard stubborn religious people, but if you can just get past that it is a game, you will definitely enhoy it. (I myself am religious and still hold AC as my favorite game franchise of all time).\n\nAs for the AC fans who haven't played AC 1 yet, all I can say is that, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT, this is where it all began after all. Altair, the Grandmaster of the Assassin Order and most badass of all assassins. (Die hard Altair fanboy.)\n\nApart from the previous, I will admit the game is pretty old and has it's flaws, it is buggy and VERY repetitive, but if you can just push through, you find it is a great introduction ,or re-introduction, into the Assassin world.\n\n11/10 would play and play and play again.","August 26, 2014","true","16.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Im gonna write a short review about this, okey game...\n\nSo, you start off by meeting Desmond, that has been captured by the templars. He goes into a machine called the animus to re-live his ancestors memories. This is when you start the game for real. You directly jump into a very interesting character called Altair. Hes an assassins during the 11th century. Hes in the middle of a war between the templars and the assassins. So, your mission starts directly, and you get it from his master Al Mualim. Your task is to set-off to the biggest cities around Isreal (example of a city is Jerusalem) and murder 9 different templars. This is where the most boring missions you will ever come across. You need to go on to a viewpoint to find investigations (from where you get the info about your target) and then assassinate the target. This is going to be for all the 9 templar "masters". But, the story do get very interesting, and you need to play this game to understand the sequels.

The series may have become bogged down by tired yearly-projects in recent days, but there was a sweet spot for this series in it's early days (namely the first through Brotherhood) that absolutely cannot be denied. There weren't any games like this when it came out, and there still aren't today. The delicate wire of written and unwritten history which it balances is masterful to say the least, and is a game that, since I played it when it was first released, has a certain feeling which permeates it, of which I, to this day, have never been able to shake. Although the ending has been much maligned, I personally loved it, and felt it truly serves as the final brush stroke that brings home the entire game, and imprints it on our memory forever, if you will only invest the time and allow it to.","January 3, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/recommended/15100/","Borba","Borba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/","1717 products in account","TL:DR at the end, scored 6 / 10 as of 23rd May 2016  Full Livestream Playthrough soon!\nBorba Recommends\nBorba likes:Genre - Assassin‚Äôs Creed is an open world action adventure, with elements of stealth and a very powerful storyline that will leave players aching for more.\n\nNarrative - A very deep narrative, with interesting and well thought out characters, dialogues and puzzling secrets to discover. Borba warns that the game ends in one hell of a cliffhanger, so have your credit card ready in order to get the next titles in order to unfold the whole series‚Äô most valuable asset.\n\nInterface - Simple and functional, shows health, wanted status, equipped weapon, a radar and a much needed control helper, since the game has context based controls that might be hard to memorize at first.\n\nGraphics - It can be said that this first game in the series aged pretty well in terms of visuals, despite looking a bit bland sometimes due to some sort of colour filtering.\n\nMusic - An epic music score is present throughout the whole game, improving the overall experience.\n\nSound - Excellent voice work and combat sound effects, with some repetitive generic villager and guard voice lines.\nBorba dislikes:Replayability - The game offers side missions, collectibles and an open world to explore that is based on historical locations, but no achievements. Due to the repetitive nature of the game, only diehard fans will consider repeating it, or doing a full playthrough that may take a few dozen hours. Regular gamers that just want to play through the main quests will take between 10 and 12 hours to finish, and feel glad they finally got through it.\n\nGameplay - The parkour system developed for the game was ingenious, and despite having some flaws and being slower than later iterations, it‚Äôs still pretty good for its time. Combat is original and functional, becoming a bit too easy once players get the hang of it. The repetitive investigation missions and the viewpoint unlocks are Borba‚Äôs biggest beef with the game, quickly becoming a mind numbing chore that ultimately feels necessary to extend the game‚Äôs playtime into an acceptable amount of hours.\n\nDesign - The world design is amazing for its time, however, the repetitive gameplay tarnishes the experience. Also, there are a couple of missable events that allow the character access to a few files that will shed some further details about the narrative. Borba hates missable things in games.\n\nPolish - A few issues still occur, including crashes, lack of subtitles, controller issues and parkour / animation bugs, even though the game is pretty much playable from start to finish it‚Äôs a shame these were never fixed.\nBorba feels like despite the issues with repetitive gameplay, lack of subtitles and some bugs, Assassin‚Äôs Creed I is the stepping stone, a necessary evil, for players to get hooked into a very deep narrative, which on its own turns this mediocre title into a worthwhile experience for most players that endured through its repetitiveness.\n\n6 / 10","May 23","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zharwyn/recommended/15100/","Zharwyn","Zharwyn | tiny sarling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zharwyn/","2531 products in account","Assassin's Creed is a rather enjoyable game. It has a pretty cool concept, the story is quite alright and free-running from rooftop to rooftop is extremely fun. You really feel like a skilled assassin when you are playing the game, at least for the most part. It gets harder and harder towards the end to dodge enemies and to make sure you're not discovered, but that's to be expected. You need to plan accordingly at times. The story takes place in an interesting era and is quite intriguing but sadly a bit forgettable.\n\nThe combat (apart from the assassinations) is somewhat clunky and you can tell that it's a console port. You can play the game with keyboard and mouse but I recommend that you play with a controller if you have one since it's obvious it is meant to be played with one. I had a lot of fun with the game when it wasn't feeling repetitive. Climbing up to the view points was really fun and a few of them was a little bit challenging, too. I found myself enjoying climbing and exploring more than the combat itself.\n\nThe visuals are stunning. The game is rather bright and takes place during daytime which is a bit odd for a "stealth" assassin game. The way Alta√Ør moves is also done extremely well, his movements are very smooth. As a nice treat; Nolan North is the voice of Desmond Miles - and you can't go wrong with that!\n\nA few negative things: Apart from being a console port with somewhat clunky combat, the game can get rather repetitive, especially towards the end. It also lacks subtitles which is crucial for many. Sometimes I had trouble hearing what was said in the game due to the background sounds. This is something to consider if you're like me and prefer to have subtitles. But all in all it's a nice game despite its flaws. It's a good game to start off a franchise with.","April 20, 2013","true","25.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Desmond will seem more relateable, Lucy will be much more human, and Revelations will make a helluva lot more sense if you can just sit down and have some fun with this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Simolius/recommended/15100/","Simolius","Simolius@AgualvaCity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Simolius/","234 products in account","I bought this game because I'm a lore freak and I have already played other AC games. I really wanted to play AC1 just to understand a few bits of the story, but having beaten the game, I can guarantee that unless you're also a massive lore fanatic, you're not missing out on much.\n\nAssassins Creed tells the story of r3tard bartender Desmond and r3tard assassin Altair (because Steam censors the word r3tard). After a long day of work, Desmond is kidnapped by obviously evil Abstergo Industries, imprisoned in their HQ and forced to connect to the Animus machine to relive the memories of r3tard assassin Altair back in 1191, allowing the Abstergo people to locate an ancient world domination artifact. For most of the game, you control Altair jumping around on the rooftops of various middle-eastern cities, sneaking around dark alleys and stabbing templars.\n\nThis is one of the best themes in the whole AC franchise. It's very unique, not many games are set on this locations and time period. The world looks very good, very detailed and realistic. Cities are large and full of cramped streets populated with beggars, scholars, guards and other civilians. One of the most well built middle-eastern settings in gaming. Graphics in general are quite nice and not very punishing on the hardware.\n\nNow, this is going to be a negative review as you probably already noticed, so let's get this out of the way. This game also has on of the best parkour systems in gaming history. Amazing ledge detection and climbing animations. It's very fun to jump around the rooftops and climb towers in this game. Great job there.\n\nNow the crap starts to pour in:\n\nThe story is crap. The future/present storyline with Desmond Miles is 100% pointless. The Altair and the Templars storyline was more than enough for the game. If Ubisoft had stuck to that part of the story alone, the game would have been a bit better. No weird matrix glitches and desynchronization, much more immersive, original and simple. Then, the main characters are SO STUPID. Desmond reacts to his own kidnapping as if it was just a call for help. The scientists are like "GET DA HELL UP ON THAT MACHINE SON OR WE GONNA CAP YOUR ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• AND THROW YOU IN DA RIVER!!!" and Desmond is just like "Yeah, sure. I'll be right there :)". Then there's Altair.\n\n*SPOILERS*\nAltair's master is an evil looking old man that dresses in a creepy black cloak, has a scar on his eye and is the keeper of the ancient world domination artifact. The first guy Altair is sent to kill says something like "Hey, I'm actually not that evil. I was just trying to help the poor people, why did you stab me in the throat?". The second guy says the same thing, and the third, and the fourth...Altair has to kill around 9 more guys to even start thinking that maybe, just maybe his master is the bad guy. It's infuriating.\n*SPOILERS ENDED*\n\nNow, the game consists of the following: Receive assassination order from master, travel to city, complete side activities in the city in order to locate the target, locate target, kill target, return to master, repeat from the beginning. This cycle repeats itself about 10 times and NEVER changes until the very end when stuff just gets worse. Every fight is the same, every boss battle is the same, every investigation is the same. This game is repetitive as hell. It's a 4 hour game stretched to around 13 hours during which you do the same assassination mission over and over and over again, in a different looking city, with different looking enemies and a different looking boss.\n\nCombat is lazy and boring. Enemies surround you, you wait in the middle, when enemies attack you just press the counter button and watch Altair dodge and stab the dude, repeat for every other dude. You can actively strike at the enemies or grab them and throw them around but countering is much easier and faster. As the game goes forward, the combat becomes the most annoying thing in the game. Enemies become more resistant and aren't killed by a single counter, they grab you and throw you around a lot and, the most annoying thing of all, they're attack animations become really random and artificially sped up or slowed, making countering harder in a very bad way. In the final hours of the game, all the game does is throw huge waves of enemies at you for no reason, further padding the game. Then there's the final boss battle. After you sit through more long and boring monologues, you get a boss fight that starts with a stage in which you have to kill the boss like 4 times and you can get killed with a single hit from his also random attack animations. It's infuriating, I almost uninstalled the game.\n\nThe game also features the most lazy upgrade/reward system ever. In the beginning of the game you have a bunch of awesome gear, great weapons and climbing abilities. Then suddenly everything is taken away for story reasons. You get your stuff back as the game progresses. There's no fun in being rewarded with a piece of gear you already had at some point in the game. Imagine if, in Legend of Zelda, you got to play 3 hours of the game with all the gear in the game and then everything got taken away only for you to have to get it back piece by piece. There's no element of surprise to the rewards and most of them are just tiny damage boosts and abilities that you shouldn't have lost in the first place (Altair forgets how to grab ledges and counter attacks in combat...wot?).\n\nI beat the game in 13 hours using fast travel. There's a hub world that separates all the cities but it's the most pointless hub world ever. It's unnecessarily huge, sometimes hard to navigate and completely empty if you don't count the pointless collectible flags. It's sole purpose is to artificially add length to the game. No reason not to use fast travel.\n\nTech demo I say, tech demo. Just like Just Cause to Just Cause 2 or FarCry 2 to FarCry 3, AC1 feels like and idea of a game that later became other better AC games.\n\nThe story sucks, the twist is visible from start, the combat is oversimplified crap and later it becomes an infuriating buggy mess, the game lasts for around 15 hours, most of which consists of massive padding and faffing around. Skip this one, read the story on the wiki and move on, nothing to play here, just sight seeing and parkour.\n\nScore: 2/5\n\nSimolius - April 2015","April 2, 2015","false","13.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZS-KEV/recommended/15100/","ZS-KEV","ZS-KEV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZS-KEV/","118 products in account","Assassin‚Äôs Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise, Assassin‚Äôs Creed. Launched in 2007, the game received enormous commercial success on consoles, but only a year later after its initial release, Assassin‚Äôs Creed was introduced to PC. Assassin‚Äôs Creed is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy lands of; Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus during the Crusades.\n\nAssassin‚Äôs Creed is a beautiful game, every crack and crevasse is filled with amazing detail, from astounding visuals to overheard cries for help. The graphics are absolutely jaw dropping, despite the age of the game. The Vast cities of Jerusalem and Acre extend into the horizon with hundreds of buildings and thousands of people living out their daily lives. All the while the frame-rate remains constant.\n\nThe story, or should I story‚Äôs, brings the game to life. On the one hand, you play an assassin during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD, named Altair. We follow his quests as he assassinates nine public figures at the command of his master. And on the other hand, you are put into the shoes of Desmond Miles, whose ancestor was Altair. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and put into the Animus. The Animus is a device which allows the user to revisit their ancestors‚Äô past memories. Desmond is forced to relive his ancestor‚Äôs life against his will for unknown reasons.\n\nThe voice acting is solid throughout the game. Conversations are completely believable and delivered with the perfect amount of solemn dignity. What you hear in the game is more impressive than what you see. In the cities with populated areas, your ears will fill with the pleas of beggars, the din of street vendors, and the occasional humming. At the top of synchronisation points, you hear the wind blowing past you as you climb for the sky, the barking of a far-off dog, and the twittering of birds.\n\nAssassin‚Äôs Creed is exceptionally entertaining in that it features a mix of fine stealthy exploration and exciting combat. You start the game off fairly weak, but as you progress through missions, Altair gains new abilities and increased health. Before a primary target can be assassinated, you need to gather intelligence. The methods by which you go about doing so present the most irritating aspects of the game. When you get a mission to assassinate a target, you have to do at least 3 side quests first before you can assassinate the main target. There are an array of side quests that you can choose from, like; Pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interrogation, and target elimination. The problem is that after doing one of the side quests, there‚Äôs practically nothing satisfying about it.\n\nAfter completing three side quests of any variety, you head over to an assassin‚Äôs bureau in the city and you get informed that you can now assassinate your main target. The problem is that all the bits of intelligence you pick up while on side quests have little to no impact on how the eventual primary target mission plays out. Beyond that problem, after repeating the process for each target, things got plain, simple and just really boring.\n\nThe controls, for me, could have been better. I often found myself getting stuck on a wall, roof top or the side of a building as you can‚Äôt just jump anywhere; you have to jump from one specific point to another. This really got on my nerves, especially when trying to run away from guards, the last thing you want to happen is to get stuck. Combat in the game is fun and exciting, but it does have its issues. First off, there are a few combinations that you will need time to get used to. Secondly, the character did not always do what I wanted him to. This did get a tad annoying sometimes but it‚Äôs not a major issue.\n\nThe player is given five different weapons; long sword, short sword, throwing knives, and a hidden blade. Each weapon is useful in different situations. The long sword is the main tool of self-defence, and is useful for big battles; the short sword is a light and fast blade which is useful when facing small numbers of enemies; throwing knives can be very useful as they kill the enemy instantly, and you can use them for long distance kills; and the hidden blade which is used for assassinations.\n\nAssassin‚Äôs Creed does come with a few issues that just can‚Äôt be ignored. Firstly, the amount of guards that walk around the roof tops is incredible. It is impossible to go anywhere by running ‚Äòfreely‚Äô on the roof tops without alerting a guard. You can assassinate them, but after a while, that satisfaction of watching Altair use his hidden blade to slam down a guard just becomes boring and you just want to get to where ever you going. So then you decide to take the city streets to your destination, only to find out that it‚Äôs just as annoying as taking the roof tops. The city streets in Assassin‚Äôs Creed are plagued with beggars, drunken people and woman carrying pots on their heads that fall and break if you run into them.\n\nIf you are on a stealth mission where keeping your distance or blending in is needed, just wait until you come across the beggars who run in front of you, and you only, and start asking for money, meanwhile your target is getting away as once the beggar is in front of you it‚Äôs hard to get them out of the way. Same scenario, but you are confronted with drunken people who walk around and look like zombies from 'Land Of The Dead', if you get close to them they will push you which ultimately gives away your position and you have to restart the mission.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nAssassin‚Äôs Creed is definitely not the best game in the series, with its repetitive side quests and annoying NPCs, the game can get a bit frustrating and boring. For somebody totally unfamiliar with the game, it's certainly worth playing. Even though the game does have its faults, it still offers a great mix of exploration and action that is just waiting to be experienced.\n\n+ Good graphics\n+ Lots to explore\n+ Great story\n+ Challenging missions\n- No side Quests\n- Controls could have been better\n- To many guards on the roof tops\n- To many beggars and drunk people in the cities\n\nSCORE: 7.5/10","November 19, 2014","true","20.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Boring,monotonous,ripetitive and incomplete. I would recommend it only to people who want to play the entire AC series since it shows important matters like who's Desmond,how he ends up in Abstergo etc. (matters that Desmond will summarize in the introduction of Assassin's Creed II anyway).\nThe graphics is not bad and so the setting,even if the only places in which you can wander are the cities,some lands (that are all the same),the fortress of Masyaf and the assassins' refuges; I don't like Alta√Ør,this AC doesn't allow us to understand how and who really is this assassin,he doesn't give me any emotions. He's just dull. However,I really like the story and it will be better illustrated in the following AC (they're much better than this!).","August 27, 2015","false","25.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Story will make much more sense if you start out from the beginning.\n\nFirst game of the highly acclaimed and often over hyped Assassins Creed series, I remember playing it a long time ago when it came out. I was not in the loop so I didn't really have any expectations set up. But after completing the game, I must say it was the best game I had played during those times. The story is pretty decent, will keep you hooked up for the most part. Soundtrack is overlooked, but it is pretty amazing. Combat system is pretty responsive. Some side quests get repititive, but otherwise a fantastic game. I was looking forward to AC2 ever since I finished it all those years ago, and yet again I was not disappointed.\n\nIf you are fairly new to this series, it is really worth it ,at least up until AC3, where the story takes a turn (you will get what I mean once you get there). AC4 was reasonably good (which was my most recent AC game). Unity was apparently a disaster, and there are more AC games than I can care to list, and at this point Ubi just seems like milking the franchise.  This is just my opinion on whats out there and not entirely related to this review, feel free to ignore this paragraph if you disagree or don't find it useful.","July 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Voice acting sucks sooo much...I hear wonderful lines and they're ruined by the awful delivery. The story...oh god it's just so amazing and good and creepy and awesome and then it just...ends...no fantastic conclusion, no Desmond escaping from the facility, no we have to wait for the SECOND one to do that >:F. And the allmighty thing that breaks the game is the controls. They're so horribly awful, whoever came up with it needs to be fired. It ruins the parkour because all you're doing is holding down two buttons and watching as Altiar does cool ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•...no skill involved in that part. And then the combat system is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed because it only responds to what you tell it to do half the time and the AI sucks too so they're constantly trying to hit you but then acting like "nah Ima just wait here" so then you try to counterattack and someone else attacks and then you die.\n\nI'm just so horribly frustrated with how good this game could have been. So many things done amazingly well, and so few ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up, but those few things make it a bad expierence. 6/10...and I'm being nice.

While the original AC had was a very fun game, it definitely had some flaws. It was a transitional game, trying to move the parkour of Prince of Persia into a world of stealth like Tenchu or Splinter Cell, and was definitely still growing through its awkward phase. The game feels very slow at times and pickpocketing missions are tedious to say the least. Some missions feel forced or don't make sense, and some of the stealth/alert mechanics really didn't work.  The combat is shockingly easy; counter kills all around!\nIt's definitely worth playing for its gripping story and the combination of stealth and parkour action. It's a masterpiece in spite of its shortcomings. While the sequels have been getting progressively better, this is where it all started and is definitely worth a play through for fans of the series.","May 14, 2014","true","19.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For that reason it's hard to give a bad review because it was so cheap, but I didn't like this game.  Assassins' Creed 2 is a different story, however.\n\nAnyway, the game is very repetitive and quite short.  There is not even much in the way of achievements unless you want to collect flags but the game pretty much implies that this is a worthless endeavor.\n\nThe game had good graphics for its time.  Perhaps that's what made it so popular, and also you can climb on just about everything.  This is the good part.\n\nThe problem is that you are always doing the same thing.  It's always about assassinating certain people and it's almost always done in the same way. Yeah, you have to maybe pickpocket, interrogate or eavesdrop on people before you get to the target but in the end you have to keep repeating these activities over and over again.\n\nThis game could make you hate poor people since the beggars will swarm around you like flies until you want to murder them even though that's evil and the guards will make your life miserable if you keep doing that.  This is one of the funnier aspects of the game but after awhile it gets annoying.\n\nIn the end, I felt that I was just doing the same thing over and over and over again just for slight progression in the main character's (Desmond's) story, and the game doesn't answer all the questions (hence the many, many sequels) so you don't necessarily get a good resolution.\n\nI have played other stealth games.  I enjoyed Tenchu 1 and 2 though they aren't super hardcore about stealth, and I've always thought that the Metal Gear Solid games did stealth well.  I especially loved how difficult Siren was with its stealth gameplay, but this game got too tiresome.  The stealth isn't particulary hard, like some of the games I played above, so I wouldn't even say it's a challenging stealth game.  I do like the parkour elements but I just wish there had been more variety to the missions you have to perform.\n\nI didn't like this game, but then I played Assassin's Creed 2 which is better in every possible way, so unless you want to be a completionist and play all the games I recommend skipping this one.","November 20, 2015","false","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Assassin's Creed (if I say "2", it implies the sequel. Other wise, I'm referring to the first game) initially feels like a breath of fresh air amidst all wildly rampant action games at its time. And it was unique ("was" being the key word). The graphics are stunning and it helped buff the slim pickings of the stealth genre. However, as the game dragged on, you'll come to realize that all your quests are the same and at its core, you're simply repeating what you've been doing since the first hour of the game for about a dozen more hours.

Then it's pretty damn bad.\n\nLook I'm not saying this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because it's not. But I have to stress the fact that it has so many flaws like the other games in the franchise do (especially in the case of unity *cough*), but all it really is, is a repetetive game that makes you run everywhere and doing the same kind of short missions over and over. The small tasks you have to do just to get some information to progress the story (which you have to do over and over 9 times during the game's main storyline mind you), is so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing lame. At least in the other ones there is more flexibility in terms of how you progress, and this adds a lot of variety to the overall gameplay. In this game however, you run around to the exact same places more than once, and the environments are boring and bland because the citizens have little to no emotion whatsoever other than running everywhere and screaming like chimpanzes high on meth with a splash of beer while driving a lambourgini backwards in a forest. When they see you running around they usually give you the same remarks again and again, like "Oh stop your going to hurt someone!", or there might be beggars who like to say "Give me your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing money." which you don't have whatsoever.

I had to start a new game in order to fix this.\n\nNot to mention that it's a 5-step process to exit the game, which is ridiculous. You have to exit out of a mission to the animus in the present day, then exit the animus, then choose to exit to the menu, and then you have to load a profile before you can actually choose to exit.

I have not compared to the console version of the game. In the PC version the graphics are not ground breaking but are functional and polished. Animations are smooth and environments are well realised. The cities are modest in size and look the part for the period the game is set. The streets are littered with things you would expect, haystacks, street murchants etc.\n\nAudio is good. The most noticable thing about the sound is the background music which fits more with the modern part of the modern/historical aspect of the story. Apart from that the audio doesn't really stand out in any particular way, everything sounds like you would expect.\n\nGameplay is heavily story driven. The story and premise is fairly interesting. The historical part of the story (the important part IMO) is about a disgraced assassin trying to redeem himself. The protagonist sees himself as the bringer of justice etc.\nUnfortunately the games is boiled down to but a few core gameplay mechanics such as fighting/evading, eavesdropping and, and the main one, assassinating. This makes the game incredibly tedious. The meat of the story is the assassinations, but to get to that you have to do a set number of the other stuff first. Unfortunately the other side missions become tedious after just a few times because it is ALWAYS the same. After 20 hours of gameplay I completely lost interest and stopped playing. Travelling between locations is also uninteresting, but thankfully there is a quick travel option.\nOne thing that I just can't understand is the requirement to walk when near the authorities, it just doesn't make any sense at all. In Hitman it is somewhat logical, you are in disguise so you must walk to maintain your cover, but in Assassin Creed you wear your assassin's outfit everywhere, so what difference does it make if you walk or run?\nThe sandbox presentation is wasted on this game, I think it would have been more successfull as a linear mission based style like Hitman. The developers limited the core gameplay too much when compared to the likes of GTA.\n\nIf you have plenty of time to waste, this is an above average game but the repetitive gameplay was just a bit much for me, I can't recommend it to people with limited game time. Take a look at Far Cry 3 if you want a really good sandbox, or the new Tomb Raider for a nice linear experience. Both of those games felt shorter than this even though they probably aren't and they both felt much more engaging and interesting.","December 18, 2013","false","23.2"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","28","58","0","0"

Each area is repetitive and essentially boils down to: climb all the towers, save all the civilians, do a few races, beat some people up then assassinate the target. Repeat 9 times. The collection 'side quest' is infuriating, overly long and utterly pointless. How this game spawed such a winning franchise I do not know (but having played II I am glad it did).

The gameplay. In my opinion, this game had one of the worst types of gameplay I've ever come across, so this kind of forced me to try and get through the game as fast as I could. The fighting was very bland, the missions were VERY repetetive, and to be honest, I didn't enjoy any of the fights. There's also the fact that there were no subtitles, which is a must-have for me, very limited soundtrack, Altair spoke in an American accent in a time where America didn't even exist (Yes, I'm aware that they change his voice in Revelations, although I haven't played it yet.) and it was far too easy to escape the guards. One of the things I really did enjoy, though, is the storyline, especially the bits with the one-armed assassin. I'd recommend this to anyone who can stomache bad gameplay for a good story, but otherwise, I don't feel like this game deserves a recommendation.

The controls are horrible (M/KB or controller - I played on a controller and they're equally awful), not precise at all when you try to climb on things, most of the time you don't go in the direction you indend or it fails to function properly. In general, climbing plain sucks and when it's one of the main draws of the game, it hurts immensly. Also the little side quests needed to do assassinations are one of a handful of recycled missions throughout the entire game it get repetative very fast. Plus, field of view for enemies is laughibly bad. Additionally combat is boring as hell, unresponsive, and the again the controls suck for that too. With that said, the combat is actually incredibly easy at the same time - have fun countering the entire game and doing nothing else to kill enemies while in the process never getting hit. This game is so repetative, with poor controls, and an incredibly dull main character (all the characters act like cardboard cutouts with no personalities) - not to mention a pretty lame ending. I don't see how anyone in their right mind could like this game. Oh and did I mention a bug that can currupt your savegame at random at any point in your playthrough - that's been present since it was released in 2007? Yeah - enjoy having to delete your save and start from the begining if that happens to you, even if you're 99% through.\n\n1/10 - simply because the graphics were decent the year this was released, and it spawned better future Assassin Creed games.\n\nI payed $5 for it, it wouldn't even recomoned playing this if it were free for your sanities sake - one of the worst games I have ever played. Luckily, it spawned a good series despite being such a failure. With that said don't let disuade you from the rest of the series. My advice, skip Assassin's Creed 1 read a synopsis on wikipedia and jump striaight in Assassin's Creed 2 - which is actually a good game.","October 10, 2014","false","15.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","8","18","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/15100/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","Short verdict: it's not a stealth game, it's a poorly executed and repetitive horde mode with lousy battle system and mediocre story.\nMy overall rating: 6/10.\n\nStory: it's fine, somewhat dull and lacks detail that later titles have, but in overall it's fine.\nGraphics: surprisingly well for such an old game.\nBattlesystem: attack, strong attack, a block, a counter, evasion, a grab and a grab brake - it all fused into frustrating ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of your patience, because there's no way how to finish battle more quickly (except for knife throw/stealth kill - with very limited opportunities), you are forced to go through the same repetitive choreography all over again. And with hordes of enemies on every corner, it's really a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\nGameplay: basically, it's the same pattern throughout the game: find the assassins' bureau, perform at least minimum number of investigations, kill the primary target, report of success. What changes is the city/city district and number of soldiers in the cities. By the end of the game, the numbers are overwhelming. There's really no way how you stay incognito, unless you are tiptoing through vast quarters full of beggars, thugs and crazy people, that all stand in your way to perform missions. What I hated the most was that there's really no way you could STEALTH kill the targets, because they were surrounded by number of guards. And that number was increasing with each next target. It felt more like hack'n'slash at some points.\nSide missions:\nclimb points of view - reveals the location of assassins' bureaus and other side missions;\nsave citizens - reduces number of soldiers and unlock vigilantes that might help you escape (it's not that much of a help actually);\ninvestigations: eavesdropping, pickpocketing, intimidation missions, escort challenges, killing archers/pursuers for fellow assassins, flag challenges/catching informers on time;\ncollectibles: flags (a set for each city/territory).\nWith every completed set of 15 objectives, you are granted additional health unit, but after you're maxed out, there's no point to bother with side missions, because they're all the same and do not provide any substantial reward.\n\nI have previously played AC3 and I think it's a wonderful game. I've spent 116 hours on it. It gave me a genuine sense of historic atmosphere and it really felt like a stealth game. Intrigued by AC saga and heroes, I looked forward for similar experience with the original title. However, what I found was frustration and disappointment. I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. It's not a pleasant pastime, it's a trial of patience, which, I guess, I have, because I've actually finished the game. But it was not a fun ride, you would expect from such a popular title.\n\nThe only way and reason I find this game worth anyone's time and money is with discount and to find out how the whole AC saga began.\n\np.s. There's is one great thing about it, though. It does not have uPlay overlay.","November 2, 2014","false","17.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","8","18","3","1"

There is nothing like doing the same things over and over again in 3 different cities. The game consists of: Go to Acre/Jerusalem/Damascus, get the scoop on who you are supposed to kill, get all the viewpoints in the district you are exploring, do 3 of the 6 missions associated with gaining info on your target, grab a feather from your feather friend, kill the target, bathe the feather in the blood of your target, give the bloody feather to your feather friend, return to home base and get an earful from your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• boss. You do this over and over and over, until the very end when you actually do something else for once.

It's really disappointing as the first entry for the series.\n\nPositives:\n\n+ Having completed Assassin's Creed II and subsequent games in the series, I can say the whole plot behind the Assassin's Creed franchise is great and well designed.\n+ Various weapons and fighting styles, use hidden blades and swords to strike down foes.\n+ Free climbing and running, you can scale walls and buildings. A lot of the environment can be interacted with.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Constant crashing on the latest GPU's, GTX 970 4 GB (2015), to the point of being unplayable.\n- The game world seemed really dull during my brief playthrough. It's quite bleak and lacks a lot of colour. The controls were also an abomination.\n- Graphically it's nothing fantastic. Even during release it was arguably poor graphics for its time.\n- For a game about assassination it's surprisingly lacklustre when it comes to the act itself. It's not really a stealth game, there aren't many creative ways to carry out assassinations...it's just odd. Assassin's Creed II struggled with this as well, but it was far more fun and interesting, so I can forgive it.\n- Constant repetition with menial tasks, like eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. Boring.\n- Pause interface is obstructive and annoying.\n\nOverall Score 4/10\n\nIn my experience the games in the Assassin's Creed series are decent but have never had that 'wow' factor. Assassin's Creed is probably the worst, and well worth skipping. Starting with Assassin's Creed II is your best bet. You won't miss out on much of the vital story anyway, and you'll save yourself from this painful game.\n\nIt's definitely not good, or anywhere close, but it's not horrific at the same time.

I remember saying to my friend that it would be the most amazing thing after a few more installations of this IP how great it would be to have the games story move into the modern era with Desmond taking town to new templars. While i have not actually played the rest of the overkill that is AC annual releases it does not seem to have done this yet‚Ä¶ This game remains very good.\n\nHOWEVER!\nThis is a Ubisoft Title and with that comes the 90% of the time fact that it will just not run on computers a few years newer than the game very well (ie XIII & Beyond Good & Evil)\n\nA few of things i ran into finally playing this game in the year 2015 and what i had to do to make it work for me.\n-Absolutely no in-game overlays can exist it will just crash. raptr, steam overlay, caused ShadowPlay caused crashes for me. Shadow Play also caused graphical artifacts and sound distortion randomly. (while having all of these turned off or disabled there were still time that game crashed but i was able to get past the title screen)\n\n-The game will crash at random times when you complete certain actions like killing a templar in the game world because the game tries to connect to ubisoft server that does not exist anymore. Its recommended that you turn off the internet to computer you are playing it on but you can also use your firewall setup to block it.\n\n-iirc correctly this game may have come out before the wireless xbox 360 setup was available for pc. I ‚Äúthink‚Äù it was patched in later in the version that you can buy on steam. So the game does see the ‚Äúwireless‚Äù controller but by default it is set-up incorrectly the triggers serve as camera movements left and right but are opposite. the colors of the buttons and on screen prompts are counter clock-wise wrong by one position. this can all be fixed with a little bit of tinkering in the buggy options menu or in the ini files.\n\n-not as important but still relevant. this is an open world game with  many thing to find and collect. two of which i found rather pointless. Flags & Templars. They serve no real purpose in the game. they existed on the console version for achievements and trophies that do not exist on the pc version at all steam or uplay. This is not a uplay game just fyi it was long before it existed and was never incorporated. but anyways while i am usually one to take my time and find all of the things in games this game gave me no motivation to do so, neither achievements or in game unlockables‚Ä¶\n\n-the actual controls and character movements now feel very tank like. a sort of inbetween modern 3rd person games and classic tomb raider for lack of better comparison.\n\nIn conclusion This IS a great game and it is very fun but it was not made to be future proof. It takes a good bit of work to enjoy. I can't recommend it on modern systems but if you are willing to do the work get it running it is a lot of fun perhaps mostly nostalgia.","March 27, 2015","false","28.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","4"

The first 30 minutes were excellent, the visuals were great and story seemed interesting, controls were also fine, but when I actually got in the main part of the game...\n\nIt's repetitive, very repetitive, for every assassination you have to complete few tasks that play exactly same everytime, at worst you just have to go from point A to B and just press a button to gather a piece of information.\nThe notoriety system is weakly put together. You are being a suspicious person at all times except when you're walking, so a game being all about parkour is punishing you from doing any athletics. When you get noticed the only way you can escape enemies is to hide in specific map locations. Escaping isn't that hard though since the enemies can be defeated extremely easily, but it's very, very time consuming and has to be done for being able to advance.\n\nAs said before the story was quite interesting, but I don't think it's worth getting into because of the endles stream of neverending sequels.\n\nAC2 fixes most of the problems of this game, I'd rather go for that or Black Flag.","December 27, 2015","false","9.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Other wise, just skip it.  It is not worth your money and it is a terrible game.  Here are some reasons why.\n\nThe Bad\n\nStory\nThe story is very generic and it's ending is laughable.  The characters are almost none existent and the story seems to have trouble developing itself, most notably towards the end of the game where the story just collapes in on itself and doesn't make sense anymore, leaving on an ending that leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth.  The story does have a few twists and turns you won't you see coming and they can be very suspenseful, but none of them last and are only small moments that shine.  As a whole, the story is unsatisfying and leaves much to be desired.\n\nGameplay\nNow, the gameplay as a whole isn't exactly bad.  In fact, it can be quite good.  For example, combat can be fun and satisfying and the free-run system is equally satifying.  However, the game mechanics work 90% of the time, but the other 10% it doesn't work makes the game infuriating.  The 10% is most notable whenever you are running away from guards, and Altair decides to have a panic attack and jump to whatever platform he feels like, coating himself with gorilla glue in the process, in order to stick to every pixel possible at the worst times.  It can be very difficult to control Altair during this instances and leads to possibly broken monitors.  As a whole, gameplay can be fun, but usually results in frustration due to annoying controls and error in game mechanics.\n\nThe Good\n\nStory\nThe only good that comes from the story is the unexpected twists and turns.  I geniunely didn't see them coming and some of them did suprise me, leaving me somewhat interested in the story.\n\nGameplay\nThe 90% of the time that the game works, its enjoyable and fun.\n\nVerdict\nI only recommend this game to people who just want to beat the game to be able to say that they have played it.  If you are interested in it for other reasons, I say just look up a summary of the story on the internet and go and buy the 2nd game.","November 29, 2014","false","20.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Captured by the multi-million dollar company, Abstergo Industries, Desmond is tasked with using a device called the Animus to relive the life of his ancestor from the 11th century, an Syrian assassin named Alta√Ør. As Alta√Ør, you have compromised the safety of the Brotherhood of the Assassins, and now, you must travel the country to find and eliminate the eight Templars currently in control of the country to help the people all across Syria.\n\nNow I love the lore and story in Assassin's Creed games, I really do. But I don't understand why people think AC is a great game in terms of gameplay, because simply put, it's not. The combat feels slow and clunky compared to that of future AC titles, throwing knives are overpowered, the parkour is buggy as hell, it's hard to control your character and overall, the controls are just a huge mess.\n\nThe missions are repetitive, if nothing else. You go to a city, complete a couple of missions to get information on what your target is going to do, assassinate the target, and you're done. The actual evidence missions themselves are why this are repetitive. At least the Templars themselves have motives and goals as why they're doing what they're doing, but when retrieving information, the individual missions feel shallow, like they're nothing to them at all. Honestly, climbing towers to get information about the surrounding area and jumping into a pile of hay at the bottom is the most satisfying part about this missions.\n\nThe only thing about this game that I can recommend is the story. I will say though, if you're looking for context in AC2 about the characters and such, I'd say buy it, but don't expect anything good to come out of the gameplay.\n","March 21, 2015","false","38.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I desperately wanted to play the first, but the second wouldn't leave me be and ultimately became the experience of this game.\n\nUbisoft's brand of boring and repetitive combat makes its series debut in AC.  Add to that the three virtually identical main set pieces, and you will be left amazed as I was that so bland a game could come from the hundreds of creative people who had a hand in making this title.  Adding more creativity to the production does not necessarily mean more creativity in the final product to be sure.\n\nThe tragedy of AC is that underneath all this blandness lies a pretty interesting story of inter-temporal... well... something or other.  The story was obfuscated by the very presentation that was meant to tell it.  I had to youtube the ending and secret story points after beating the game just to see wtf happened.  This obfuscation could have been by design, which is possible as Ubisoft does tend to put the finer points of the game's story into easter eggs to be found by the player.  And maybe that's my fault for not recognizing and engaging that.  But with such a bland gameplay experience, I was left uninterested in anything other than finding something exciting and pulse-pounding about Assassin's Creed, which is ostensibly an action game.  Reading in-game emails and interpreting glyphs on walls would not have qualified as exciting at that point for me.\n\nThe final and in my opinion unforgivable F-you from Ubisoft is that this game has in effect no ending.  Clearly Ubisoft had intentions to serialize this franchise, which is fine.  But you have to have an ending in the first release of an IP, even if you have a cliffhanger in it as AC did.  The original Halo did it, Star Wars did it.  It's a rule.  Period.\n\nAssassin's Creed works, and somewhere in there is a compelling story, but you're probably better off with either of Ubisoft's other platforming/action titles Splinter Cell or Prince of Persia.","January 6, 2013","true","19.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I desperately wanted to play the first, but the second wouldn't leave me be and ultimately became the experience of this game.\n\nUbisoft's brand of boring and repetitive combat makes its series debut in AC.  Add to that the three virtually identical main set pieces, and you will be left amazed as I was that so bland a game could come from the hundreds of creative people who had a hand in making this title.  Adding more creativity to the production does not necessarily mean more creativity in the final product to be sure.\n\nThe tragedy of AC is that underneath all this blandness lies a pretty interesting story of inter-temporal... well... something or other.  The story was obfuscated by the very presentation that was meant to tell it.  I had to youtube the ending and secret story points after beating the game just to see wtf happened.  This obfuscation could have been by design, which is possible as Ubisoft does tend to put the finer points of the game's story into easter eggs to be found by the player.  And maybe that's my fault for not recognizing and engaging that.  But with such a bland gameplay experience, I was left uninterested in anything other than finding something exciting and pulse-pounding about Assassin's Creed, which is ostensibly an action game.  Reading in-game emails and interpreting glyphs on walls would not have qualified as exciting at that point for me.\n\nThe final and in my opinion unforgivable F-you from Ubisoft is that this game has in effect no ending.  Clearly Ubisoft had intentions to serialize this franchise, which is fine.  But you have to have an ending in the first release of an IP, even if you have a cliffhanger in it as AC did.  The original Halo did it, Star Wars did it.  It's a rule.  Period.\n\nAssassin's Creed works, and somewhere in there is a compelling story, but you're probably better off with either of Ubisoft's other platforming/action titles Splinter Cell or Prince of Persia.","January 6, 2013","true","19.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While that is to be expected in any game series (or at least most game series), I just could not find replay value in this one after I beat it once. But like I stated previously, I cannot deny the fact that without this game its sequels never would have been produced so I cannot help but have total respect for this game. All in all, it has a good story (although static camera angles for long periods of time makes it difficult to commit to it), but unrefined gameplay. If you want to get into Assassin's Creed, definately start with this one because it is a good steppingstone to the future games and also provides a good deal of story that is used throughout the series, but if you are looking back from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and wondering if this one is worth replaying, just be wary and know that (gameplay-wise), this game is far less refined.","July 20, 2014","true","25.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The voice acting is also horrendous, something that doesn't seem to improve for a few Assassins Creed games, and nothing takes you out of a game faster than bad voice actors.\n\nBut being a decently-original game idea when it was released and probably the best of its time, it's hard to argue that playing it isn't worth it especially if you're interested in the series. The graphics also hold up pretty well to today, and in some instances I believe the graphics are better than in Assassins Creed II, but besides that it's a ~18 hour journey (or shorter if it doesn't keep crashing) that's worth it for Assassins Creed fans.","February 6","false","18.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Gameplay becomes repetative after two cities - climb the tower, find the objective, RUN FROM THE GUARDS, kill the target, go to the bureau and move onto the next target. Free-run is pretty cool, climbing animations are smooth. However the climbing process is so simplified that it becomes boring pretty soon. Guards everywhere disrupt the running pretty often and sometimes it is VERY ANNOYING. By some reason regular people (not guards) may throw rocks at you while you are climbing - a person who gave them that ability must be fired. It seems that it was forbidden to drive the horse fast back in these days - the police will chase you if you break the speed limit (stealing horses is still fine). A wast amount of collectibles (420 flags and 60 tampliers) is useless - there is no reward for collecting them.\n\nCombat is horrible - there is no lock-on so you will change your target every time you move the mouse. You can avoid fighting till memory block 6 when you'll be forced to kill a small army (and this is not how the True Assassins‚Ñ¢ do).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/15100/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Assassin‚Äôs Creed is an undeniably ambitious game. Attempting to follow in the storied tradition of greats such as chocolate and peanut butter, it wants to be a bunch of awesome things made even more awesome by way of combination‚Äîspecifically, equal parts tense stealth game, badass fighting game, and open-world sandbox game rolled into one. It even wants to deliver a complicated plot that will keep you guessing to the very end. The result is sort of like dumping your chocolate and peanut butter into a bowl of ice cream along with every other item from the make-your-own-sundae bar. The mixture as a whole is a little odd, but once you learn to identify the things you like and pick around the things you don‚Äôt there are some incredible taste sensations to be had.\n\nDespite taking place during the Third Crusade in the embattled Holy Land surrounding Jerusalem, Assassin‚Äôs Creed barely touches upon religious issues and instead focuses more on general issues of power over society. You play an assassin named Altair (pronounced Al-Taa-Ir) who is tasked with the killing of nine influential men‚Äîincluding both Christians and Muslims‚Äîtowards the greater goal of restoring order to the land and bringing justice to the people. There is also another element to the story, a sci-fi bit that may not be to some people‚Äôs liking. Although it does permeate the HUD and other parts of the graphical interface it only surfaces directly as very brief interludes a few times during the game, and the story as a whole remains interesting enough to drive the action forward.\n\nThat action revolves around the nine assassinations, and each one follows the same basic formula. You go to the city district your current target resides in (three districts in each of three cities), find out where and what your target is up to, and then take him out. There are investigation mini-games‚Äîeavesdropping, pick-pocketing, interrogation, and other forms of information gathering‚Äîwhich you must completed to move on, as well as lookout points to climb and citizens to rescue from the guards, optional tasks encouraged by the increase to your maximum health and additional means of escape from the guards they grant. The assassinations themselves often come down to a scripted sequence followed by a brief stalking or a brawl and a large dose of the plot. Though not entirely unsatisfying, those hoping for more of a Hitman-esque arena to set up your own style of assassination will be disappointed.\n\nTo accomplish all this you‚Äôll rely on Altair‚Äôs three rather impressive skills sets‚Äîfighting, sneaking, and acrobatics. Fighting, while it looks amazing with tons of cinematic flourishes and gruesome finishing moves, basically comes down to a one-button timing game. Repeatedly press the attack button with the right timing and you‚Äôll score a kill. Likewise, the proper timing on that same button while blocking will score you a counter strike, either sending your foe sprawling or killing him outright. Mess it up and you‚Äôre likely to take some damage. There are a few other wrinkles, but that‚Äôs pretty much it. Your enemies always have swords, and come in maybe three or four different difficulties, but once you master the system no number of enemies is ever really hard again.\n\nWhen you don‚Äôt feel like fighting, or in rare instances when it‚Äôs actually required, Altair‚Äôs stealth abilities come in handy. Assassin‚Äôs Creed doesn‚Äôt use typical stealth mechanics though, but rather the concept of hiding as its mainstay. When the guards aren‚Äôt alerted, you can hide in plain sight, by moving slowly and blending into crowds. In this state you can assassinate even the toughest enemies in the game with a strike from your hidden blade. Once the charade is up though, you‚Äôll have to run to one of many pre-set hiding points‚Äîpiles of hay, small cloth-draped gazebos, etc.‚Äîor kill all the guards chasing you before you can go back to being sneaky again. It‚Äôs a little hokey, but it more or less functions as intended, leading to some tense moments and harrowing chases.\n\nOne of the real highlights of Assassin‚Äôs Creed is Altair‚Äôs incredible acrobatic abilities. Taking a page from the Price of Persia‚Äôs playbook, Altair is a master of all things running and jumping. Anything and everything is a potential hand or foot hold, and scaling city structures using the seamless controls is not only a joy but one that nets very tangible strategic rewards. It also gives you an opportunity, particularly when climbing the many lookout points, to gape in awe at exactly how beautiful Assassin‚Äôs Creed is, arguably featuring the best art direction ever in a game. The cities and surrounding landscape are fantastically presented, and the panoramic views from high above are truly breathtaking.\n\nThrough the first third of the game, which amounts to a greatly extended tutorial, you are shown all of these wonderful things you can do. What happens after that is a very subtle escalation of the difficulty that continues through the rest of the game. Hacking through guards too easy? How about larger and larger groups then, with better countering abilities and trickier timings? Sneaking around too easy? Try getting past more guards on higher alert who will spot you if you‚Äôre careless. Likewise, later city districts have trickier buildings to climb, with more archers positioned on the roofs. It‚Äôs a very clever and refined way to make a game, but the subtlety is at times too slight, and there is a great repetition of the same basic elements for most of the game with little in the way of overt addition.\n\nIncredibly stylish and undeniably unique, Assassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äôs particular choices in combining all these gameplay elements will be debated by supporters and critics alike for a long time. If it all sounds like too much to realistically fit into one game, at least in this case it is, but not by as wide a margin as you might imagine. The result, while not quite all it could have been, is definitely more than the sum of its parts. While Assassin‚Äôs Creed doesn‚Äôt manage to deliver a top notch experience in any one of these areas individually, it gets enough things right in all of them and gives you a lot of freedom in how to use them, all while looking pretty damn cool. Though it degenerates into a lot of fighting at the end, and makes a fair number of mistakes in its execution along the way, there‚Äôs something entrancing about this game and each of the amazing things you can do. Your mileage may vary on precisely how quickly the game‚Äôs repetition exceeds its subtle nuance, but it‚Äôs well worth checking out for the first times if not for the seventy thirds.\n\nHighly recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 2, 2014","true","18.8"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","11","25","2","5"

The mission types repeat and repeat and repeat, and one (eavesdropping) doesn't even involve gameplay. Climbing viewpoints gets tedious most quickly, and there are (by my count) 91 of them in the game. Some aren't that high, but some are these ridiculous towers it takes probably well over a minute to climb, sync and dive from.\n\nThe free running feels good, except when you randomly stop climbing or you randomly fail to jump to or grab something or it just doesn't respond properly in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe combat is alright, but it doesn't really make sense that when you're surrounded by enemies, only one attacks you at any given time.\n\nThe graphics are still decent, but even with the highest settings there's heavy LOD-popping going on as you roam around, especially in 'the kingdom', the area in between the key cities. And the shadow resolution drops, jarringly, for anything further than a few metres from you. People even popped into existence before my eyes once or twice. You do get to ride a horse through the kingdom though, which is strangely satisfying.\n\nThe story is alright but the most interesting part is the 'present day' stuff, which really doesn't tell a proper story, more like the first couple of chapters.\n\nOh and you know what's the most annoying? The drunks, beggars and deranged who annoy the absolute shitzu out of you any time you're on street level.\n\nSo... I strongly suggest watching the cutscenes on YouTube and skipping right to the second game, unless you're the neurotic type who feels compelled to play through all of them (like me).

PS3 version ran badly, but didn't have any glitches. 360 version was great and ran smoothly.  This PC port, however, was an insult. I beat the game fully to give this review creditbility.\n\nFirst of all, I can't see any difference in graphics quality in the PC version over the consoles. That's only a minor complaint.\n\nThe major complaints are the absolutely game and immersion-breaking glitches you'll encounter in this game.  Enemy NPC models will twist around the floor like they're break-dancing.  Some will even randomly shoot towards the sky like Superman taking flight in Man of Steel.  Then there is the famed parkour elements that people enjoy this series for... they are an absolute headache in this game.  Altair will randomly slam into surfaces instead of grabbing them, falling off the building and to the ground.  Sometimes when ascending the sides of buildings, he'll stop despite pushing upwards on the analogue, and despite there being plenty to grab to further climb.\n\nOn top of all that, you have to sit with your teeth gritted because at any minute the game could encounter one of the random crashes to desktop.  I think in the 19 hours I have recorded, I encountered 10, which doesn't sound much, but is built up enough over the course of the game, that you're taken out of the experience by expecting one at any time; and they can come at any time; cutscenes, gameplay, and so forth.\n\nThe humble yet fascinating beginning of the lore throughout this franchise, as expected, remains highly enjoyable, especially if you're an alternate history buff.  This is about the only positive thing to be said.\n\nIf you're somebody who's lived under a rock and want to finally get into this huge gaming franchise you can't stop hearing about, I'd say go straight to AC2 (a buttery smooth, utterly flawless port, with superior visuals to the console versions) and read a Wikia article/YouTube vid/etc on the first game.  If you're one of these people who absolutely must experience the story first hand, then wait until this is absolutely pennies in one of Steam's sales.","March 8, 2015","false","19.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","8"

It is, of all the Assassin's Creed games, the most unpolished, glitchy and baldly unplayable. Considering most of the other games are rather mediocre, and that this is the worst of them, this praise, again, astounds me.\n\nI have heard praises heaped upon this game for it's narrative, for it's gameplay mechanics, and for it's primary protagonist. All 3 of these points fall flat when put to scrutiny.\n\nLet us look first at the narrative. I will spoil it, though for such a inane and so ideologically uninteresting of a story, one could hardly spoil it. The structure of the narrative revolves around a process of reclaiming your character's honor and position within the Assassin Order after they disgraced themselves by betraying the creed's 3 tenets.\n\nTo this end, you eliminate 9 targets, learning of a templar conspiracy. As you take them out, the assassin versus templar conflict becomes clear. Both the assassins and templars are secular humanists, so to speak. They both recognize religion, God, spiritual belief, philosophy, morality, and universal truths to be illusions manufactured by man.\n\nTheir difference is in the conclusions they come to from this recognition. The assassins seem to advocate liberty, that they would dispel the illusions, that they trust humanity with this. They think human nature good enough to find it's own truths without the illusions. So, freedom is their ideal.\n\nThe templars would not dispel the illusion, fearing the chaos that would come from it. They would maintain the illusion that they might maintain order. In fact, they would strengthen the existing hierarchies, religions, and authorities so they might further build an order to which all men serve. A new world order.\n\nThere's some sci-fi garbage somewhere in there revolving around a race who came before and how they or their artifacts manufactured all the various miracles and religious events throughout history. Whatever, it's abysmal at best.\n\nIt comes to pass that the templars you are eliminating are part of the same order as the assassin's mentor, Al Mualim, is also a templar, and was using you to kill the other leaders of the order so he would be free of any obligation to share power.\n\nThis is the same narrative twist we see used in a couple other, hugely superior games. In Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic, a long chain of side quests where you work for elite bounty hunters known as the genoharadan -- the same form of twist is used. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the Dark Brotherhood questline concludes with a series of contracts that ends in a similar twist as well.\n\nThe conclusion we should make here is simply that the same sort of narrative has been told before with more interesting characters, conflicts, moral questions, and acceptable gameplay mechanics -- all things Assassin's Creed lacks.\n\nAs for the main protagonist, let us discuss the glorious, nuanced character of Altair that receives so much praise. Great lines of dialogue delivered in a monotone, flat, American accent -- Altair is, one would infer, Middle-Eastern. Seriously just listen to some of the lines he delivers, the voice acting is hilariously terrible. The character in the beginning so obviously set up for an arrogant-character-is-humbled-and-has-to-rediscover-honor-and-self cliche it's unbearable waiting for it to happen.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are the most unnacceptable features of the game. Combat is slow, awkward and frustrating. Climbing and physics are beyond stupid. Gravity in the 1st game works like this: jump off building, fall normally for 10 feet or so, stop completely midair and resume falling but instead straight down, no matter the trajectory you had originally.\n\nMissions structure is the same literally every time. Do around 3 investigations upon entering a city, consisting of folllowing someone and beating them up, eavesdropping, or doing race or assassination minigames. This is supposedly to gather information on your target. In practice it seems useless, as every assassination seems a wholly scripted event, the investigations just repetitive and unneeded hoops/filler the game forces the player through to advance the shoddy story.\n\nGlitches are, of course, prominent and further make the game a frustrating and difficult experience to push through.\n\nPlease don't play this game. While none of the Assassin's Creed games are great, any other game in the series is preferable to this one.","January 23, 2015","false","11.4"," 21 of 46 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","21","46","5","34"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/15100/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","I did play the first AC after I had finished AC3. I do not necessarily recommend it to people who have played the later installments. Anyone who hasn't played any AC game yet will do better with it's sequels because this original AC still lacked much. I did play it because I was curious to see how the series, Alta√Ør's story and the story about "Those Who Came Before" started and was fairly disappointed.\n\nThe cities and rural areas are fairly nice to look at and ride through. However they all look and feel sort of the same, both weather and the daytime are static (the whole game plays at sunny daytime). Perhaps one can see more in it if he knows Damascus, Israel and the other cities you visit in this game, though I assume they have changed a lot over the centuries. Monumental places and buildings are not "commented" by the Animus system whatsoever, which makes it hard for people who don't know these cities to connect to them and to their history. You do not buy places, build your own "home" or interact with the cities in any bigger scale either (there isn't any money or economy to begin with). There is some awe-inspiring feeling to the whole of Maysaf being the center of the Assassin order, and both Alta√Ør and his mentor have a feeling of serious- and meaningfulness you may miss within the later installments. But even then their outlines are fairly weak; after having finished this game I could hardly understand what the fuss about Alta√Ør was about for people to apparently miss him so much when Ezio became the new protagonist in AC2. Alta√Ør didn't feel as special as I had believed he was, hell you will probably dislike him because he is an arrogant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• throughout most parts of the game.\n\nThe true letdown is the gameplay. The combat is underdeveloped compared to the sequels (you cannot strike down enemies  with assassination streaks as they were introduced with Brotherhood, you don't have as many weapons - it didn't feel as enjoyable) and the progression throughout the game is pretty repetitive. This original game is probably most faithful to the idea of being an assassin as you are constantly tasked to kill some templars hiding in the cities, often wealthy or well-protected people you need to "locate" first by doing minor tasks that in the later installments would pass for "side activities" at best: Eavesdrop one some guys, beat up/question another, pickpocket some intel from someone else and the likes. There are about 5 of these tasks to do per kill target, you choose which to do and need to finish about 3 of them to be able to "locate", approach and strike your kill target (which thankfully have some background, and are approached in a bit more interesting way than your previous tasks). After that you go back to Maysaf, speak to your mentor and go for a new target. Rinse and repeat. And that's already about it mostly. There are activities having the nature of "collectibles", like killing templars hiding in specific locations in the cities and rural areas, or saving citiziens from repressive soldiers, but those activites are very repetitive too. They didn't really motivate me much to roam about more than I had to. There are some unique story/plot moments, but they are rare.\n\nAlso, this game had an usability issue: It doesn't have subtitles. It may seem stupid, but apparently it wasn't self-evident back then. For a game trying to take serious steps in storytelling and bringing some past time to life it would help to understand all the people. I think they all speak English in this game (in the later games the citizens partly speak in their native language), but I still can't understand them all because English isn't my main tongue. There are some whisperings of story-relevant characters in parts of the game - don't expect me to get any of their lines too well either.","April 16, 2014","false","31.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The game doesn't have subtitles. An unfortunate design choice for two reasons.\nThe first reason: Many of the actors(?) haven't quite figured out how to open their mouth while talking.\nThe second reason: talking is pretty much everything that happens in this game.\n\nDon't believe the lie about open-world gameplay, parkour moves and total freedom. All I seemed to do in this game was to hold forwards from one dialogue-ridden cutscene to the next. Sure, I had the option of parkouring about the place, but it didn't bring forth feelings of open world movement and pulse-pounding action. Freerunning simply felt like a carrot being dangled over my nose on the other side of a window, designed solely to frustrate me while I wait through another cutscene.\nWait seems to be the keyword in this game. The intro in particular is an irritating wait. Intros are to be skipped. We see them the first time, and then we skip past them because we've already seen them. But no. The developers don't care about me wanting to play a game, they've got religious nutters to placate, leaving me to tap the escape-button with no real hope of being let into the game any time soon.\n\nStill, if you've got good hearing, a high tolerance for tricky control schemes, and a genuine interest in Mumblemurf's backstory, I'm sure the game is good.","February 9, 2014","false","2.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

An unfortunate design choice for two reasons.\nThe first reason: Many of the actors(?) haven't quite figured out how to open their mouth while talking.\nThe second reason: talking is pretty much everything that happens in this game.\n\nDon't believe the lie about open-world gameplay, parkour moves and total freedom. All I seemed to do in this game was to hold forwards from one dialogue-ridden cutscene to the next. Sure, I had the option of parkouring about the place, but it didn't bring forth feelings of open world movement and pulse-pounding action. Freerunning simply felt like a carrot being dangled over my nose on the other side of a window, designed solely to frustrate me while I wait through another cutscene.\nWait seems to be the keyword in this game. The intro in particular is an irritating wait. Intros are to be skipped. We see them the first time, and then we skip past them because we've already seen them. But no. The developers don't care about me wanting to play a game, they've got religious nutters to placate, leaving me to tap the escape-button with no real hope of being let into the game any time soon.\n\nStill, if you've got good hearing, a high tolerance for tricky control schemes, and a genuine interest in Mumblemurf's backstory, I'm sure the game is good.","February 9, 2014","false","2.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

It's pretty much the epitome of terrible console port - starting with the menu and exit game mechanism that makes it literally take several minutes to quit unless you press ALT-F4.  Seriously Ubisoft - 6 menus to quit the game?\n\nBeyond that, as the game is called Assassin's Creed you would be forgiven for thinking it will be about stealth assassination.  Generally, it's not - very few of the true assassinations in the main plot allow different angles of approach or stealth mechanics.  You would assume an assassin would prefer to avoid doing their work in public, or would prefer to use a handy bow from a nearby roof - you would be wrong, though.  Rather, you are expected to get in close, which inevitably means getting into combat.  That's also a strike - the combat is bloody terrible.  Again, the console port-ness appears, as the combat is typical of other console ports (I'm looking at you, Prince of Persia Sands of Time) and is not at all intuitive for PC players.  Much of it relies on timing moves, which don't appear to register well, and are better suited to a controller.  In fact, the majority of the game is best suited for a controller - or to be watched in a LP rather than played.\n\nTL;DR:  For a game that was published well after the Thief series, Deus Ex, and a myriad of others that contain aspects of stealth assassination, they all do it much better than Assassin's Creed.  I bought this for $7 and I drastically overpaid.\n\nNOT recommended.","December 27, 2013","false","10.6"," 19 of 43 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","19","43","0","3"

Also peppered throughout the cities are viewpoints, which are actually pretty fun because you have to find ways to climb tall buildings. Then there are the "rescue citizen" missions which are so completely out of place it's ridiculous.

The fact that it takes 2 buttons and WASD to sprint really proves that. The whole high profile low profile aspect of the controls really make the entire thing feel really clunky. This also leaks over into the combat, which I love in concept, but in execution eventually becomes hold down RMB and then spam LMB after theyre done attacking, at least until you get countering. After that, the combat becomes even more of a joke. Parkour doesn't feel satisfying in the slightest, really all you have to do is press "W" and RMB and press space when you plateau.

The idea behind the gameplay mechanics are great, and the free running features are smooth at times. Yet, there's nothing more to it. It's essentially a tech-demo.\nI'm informed that the other Assassin's Creed games are MUCH better, and have a better storyline, and don't have you repeating the game over at the halfway point ala the first Assassin's Creed. If that's the case I look forward to the other Assassin Creed titles.\n\nI originally played this game on the 360 when it was initially released. My hype was high and expectations were perhaps uncontrolable. I remember getting into an argument with the Ubisoft rep who would come into our store about how crap the game was. He wasn't too happy that I wasn't going to shill it hard to people.\n\nHowever, the first one is stale and undercooked at the same time. The crashes to desktop are beyond frustrating. DX10 version is unstable and unsupported. The DX9 version strangely runs smoother. I get the impression it's the Steam interface which causes the crashes.\n\nOverall, I'd suggest watching the story on youtube and jumping on (hopefully) the much improved Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood.

It becomes a chore--a repetitive experience that makes you want to quit playing the game and never finish it, even though the storyline is decent. That's what I did.\n\nIf you're caught up in the Assassin's Creed hype, do yourself a favor and skip the first one. Start with the later installments.","December 13, 2013","false","8.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Yes it gets very repeatative when you are finding information for each assassination and some of them drove me up the wall but performing that assassination without a problem was just so rewarding. Recomending this game however I just can't do, I love the assassin creed series and I'm always telling people to play them but for PC this was a buggy mess and my DX 10 file would not play so I had to use the DX 9 and that still didnt work perfectly.

I had high expectations due to the popularity of the franchise. At the beginning you get blown away by the detailed graphics and the openness of the world. You started digging into the combat mechanics, enjoy your stealthy kills and exploring every hidden city corner. But after a few missions, the repetitiveness of it all becomes quite apparent: always the same mini missions, always the same chain of events, the open world where you can do... nothing. Yet another few missions later and you are wondering why you are wasting your time on this... Boredom changes into irritation once you find out that you really don't need to be stealthy nor do you need to explore everything or finish every mini mission. And then I didn't even mention the excruciating game menu, the crappy ending, the poorly scripted conversations (no, there is no escape button). Quickly I didn't feel any sympathy for the main character and the unfolding story. What a missed opportunity this game is... Even at sale, I would not recommend this game.\n\nScore: 4/10\n\nPro:\n+ visuals\n+ open world\n+ climbing towers and enjoying great views\n\nContra:\n- empty world\n- repetitive missions\n- clumsy controls on pc\n- painful game menu system\n- irritating camera system","March 17, 2014","false","19.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

However, shortly after, you realize you have to do the same thing again. and again. and again. This game gets boring fast, and while the high-level assassinations can be unique, the long periods in between leavemuch to be desired. Additionally, the lack of steam acheivments renders the collecting of flags and the murder of templars pointless, and doing so unlocks no in-game features.

I had to play it.\n\nIt's a really pretty game, even by current 2014 standards.. but aside from that there's not much else in the way of redeeming features. You'll be doing a couple of things in this game, running around exploring, fighting and doing side quests.\n\nAll the side quests are the same, there's a million 'save a citizen' quests that just involve fighting some guards and then getting one of three canned replies from the person you rescued.. there's no variation in conversation.. by the end of the game you'll have heard a million other people say the same lines whenever you start to climb anything or knock anything over.\n\nClimbing / freerunning is the other big thing, but it feels a bit gimmicky in the game, there's very little reason to use it other than the game forcing you to use it to explore areas by getting to vantage points.By the end of the game I was using it for that purpose and just to get places quite far away quickly, everything else was easier to just stay on the ground in my opinion.\n\nCombat itself isn't fluid and locks away most of your combat moves until you progress the game, which makes combat start out clumsy and boring and ends up the same way as every combat move you get is defensive in nature, the entire combat system boils down to defending and counterattacking.. there's never any storming in and killing everyone like a badass.. there's storming and and defending yourself until everyone dies which just does not have the same feeling at all.\n\nEven the ending just really truly sucks, I don't want to put up any spoilers but it's one of the most dissapointing experiences I've had finishing a game.\n\nThe entire game is repititous and feels extremely grindy, by the end I was putting it on for an hour and then turning it off because it just felt like work.. unless you have the same issue as me and need to see the game yourself for the storyline before moving onto the next, then honestly skip this game.

You have to hold three damn keys just to sprint. Climbing things isn't too fun either, because the guy is really slow doing it and often he can't reach to climb and it takes you a second to realize that, because of his slowness. When you run to an edge of something, you just "stare" down instead of jumping or doing anything sensible. You have to press "other hand" control.\n\nThe reason for the mess with the controls is 'cause you have "low profile" and "high profile" modes. The low-profile mode is annoying as hell, however, because you move around like a snail. Same goes for some places like the Abstergo lab or some buildings: you can't sprint, you can only "walk" which takes forever.\n\nSpeaking of profiles, you have to actually use a horse to move around cities. I searched around whether there's a fast travel mode, and apparently there is, but not in all the places and you have to get to the edge of the map or something. Annoying. This means if you want to move at any appreciable speed, you have to "gallop" in high profile mode which, for some reason, makes every random dude with a sword want to kill you.\n\nNow, you may think me being on a horse and the dudes being on foot... I can just run away! What's the problem then? Well, the problem is one of the more annoying features of the game: the detection meter. Whoever thought it was an awesome idea for it to loudly beep should be fired. So, it beeps if you're in an area where you might get attacked. If you get detected, it starts to beep even louder. And if you run away? Hell, that thing will beep forever! You actually have to find a bush somewhere and jump into the bush and sit there for a minute just to shut that stupid beeper off‚Äîno other reason; there's no one chasing you any more!\n\nSo for the last three hours, I feel like I've done nothing but wrestle with controls and get annoyed with the damned beeper.\n\nAs for the story, well, it may be a good one, but I already dislike the guy I'm playing as. He's a rebel in one sentence and submissive in another. He's all over the place and I don't want to be him.\n\nI don't recommend this outdated game.","June 5","false","4.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

My biggest complaint is that the gameplay is repetitive, predictable, and just generally boring.  Go to area, receive intel by doing generic activities, kill boss.  Lather, rinse, repeat. The controls are fine... sometimes.  Other times, (usually during a chase when it matters the most,) they are frustratingly bad.  And overall, there are a lot of things that just don't make any sense.  For example, every single city guard has no difficulty whatsoever when it comes to climbing walls and jumping from building to building.  They can even keep up with you, the trained assassin.  I understand why it was necessary, (otherwise you would be essentially invincible on rooftops,) but it feels out of place, especially when the rest of the game strives for realism and historical accuracy.\n\nThis isn't to say that the whole franchise is terrible.  I've already started playing the second game, and it is better in basically every single aspect.  I personally would recommend skipping this game and going straight on to Assassin's Creed II if you are interested in playing the series.","January 13, 2014","false","71.3"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"

While other games claim to be next-gen with impressive graphics and physics, Assassin's Creed merges technology, game design, theme and emotions into a world where you instigate chaos and become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change.\n\nThe setting is 1191 AD. The Third Crusade is tearing the Holy Land apart. You, Altair, intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict.\n\nYou are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history.","February 23, 2014","true","418.3"," 17 of 40 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","17","40","0","1"

It's just so boring.  Even simple things like loading up the game are needlessly long and dull.  Start game, pick load save, get sent to some lab in the present day, pick load game, and then you're finally in the portion of the game you want to play.  What the hell.  It's the same process for quitting the game, so you're better just manually shutting it down to save yourself the time.\n\nFrom the 90-120 minutes I played, there was very little action and what there was was poorly executed, and I've read it's just more the same as the game continues.  There was also a lot of boring cut-scenes for the short amount I played the game.  Didn't care for how it handled with either mouse/keyboard or with a controller.  Action events like fighting, sneaking, moving around were blah as well.\n\nI disliked this game so much that it soured me on bothering with the series as a whole despite already having a free copy of Black Flag, which is supposedly a good game.

I've got a folder for multiplayer games; that should be self explanatory. I've got a folder for currently installed games; that also is self explanatory. There's a folder for games I wish to play, a folder for games that I may play at some point, a folder for games I won't ever play that mostly consist of the extra, unwanted humble bundle games, and then there's the last folder. This folder is called "Absolute Garbage Full of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•." There are only two games in this folder, two games that are the worst of humanity and deserve nothing more than to be displayed in Museums where they display rotten games. One game is Deus Ex: Invisible War, the game that marked Ion Storm's downfall as they pandered to consoles, much like Crytek. The other is Assassin's Creed.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the Assassin's Creed series is not a terrible one, or so I've been told. I have only played this one and Assassin's Creed 3. I did not like Assassin's Creed 3, but dear god does it fail in comparison to this piece of flaky bull. You start out with a rather interesting concept of a story; you're in a laboratory undergoing a simulation to relate to your knife-oriented ancestors in some plot involving Templars. You go through an intro with some heavy fighting and you're thinking "Oh, okay, this definitely is not a stealth game. This is a hack n slash." But whatever right? You suppose it can still be fun, right? Wrong, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you. You get these awful controls and repitive combat that make you yearn to go play with a toaster; at the very least the toaster would be responsive to controls. But whatever, again, you think, who cares if the combat is boring? I'm in it for the raw gameplay. Parkour man. Doing side quests. Story!\n\nWell, I'll give you that. Parkour is enjoyable. The wall climbing feels satisfying when you scale insurmountable heights leading up to the conclusion of a bird's nest at the peak of a city. But that's really the only thing it has going for it. When you enter a city, the side quests are by far the most boring, repititve, garbage nonsense that half the time doesn't even make sense. Why am I capturing flags? Why is there a time limit? I'm a trained assassin, not a crazed blue coin collector. There's tons of people being harassed and you can intervene, but why? You're told you're supposed to blend in, not ostracize yourself. Even if they did make sense, they're so senselessly boring the second time around that you do any of them.\n\nBut hey, there's no uPlay.","July 24, 2014","false","0.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","5"

However, once I started to play this game my opinion shifted and I realised why his franchise became huge.\n\nThe graphics were far ahead for its time as it was released in 2007 and even though there are an occaional glitch or two, they aren't majour-they are quite trivial and don't affect the gameplay. The story is a very good one as it focuses on a an assassin regaining his lost honour and title by assinating 9 templars and in doing so reveals much about corruption and deception. The character admitadly we don't see much of a development on as he is quite bland-I prefer Ezio overall as we see his development and maturity more- however, he adds a sense of "coldness" which i believe makes him more of an assassin. Even though I had feared that there would be a lot missing and would make the game simple compared to it's sequels, there were things that did make it much harder such as not being able to have a killstreak, calling other assassins, having air/ledge/hiding spot assination-which I think was the most difficult part or having a double blade which made the game more of achallenge and makes it more fun.\n\nOverall, if you are looking to see what began it all, don't mind how many things are missing from it since AC2 was a huge leap from AC1 and want more of an Assassin game where the objective is to assassinate multiple targts as the main plot then this game then this game is for you and you should get it since it is quite cheap!\n\nI would rate this game 8.5/10 for being a brilliant start to an awesome franchise!\n\n\n","December 21, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play from 2 view points, The modern world where you control Desmond Miles. And in 1191 In the Holy Land where you play as Altair ibn la ahad. The gameplay, and story is very addicting and fun. The fact that you get to murder people where ever you go, and you have side missions, or objectives you get to do throughout the game is awesome. The controls feel very good, and the graphics were good for its time back when it was first released, For any begginers that want to play this game, you may have to sit down for a little and get really comfterable with the controls and becoming aware of your surroundings. Any veterans that have played other Assassin's Creed except this one, you may become frustrated with what they give you in this game, but otherwise you might really enjoy this game. Except for a few thing which is the repetitive gameplay that is in this game. I don't mind it, but after a while you really wished there was more things to do. Oh and the informer challenege can ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• right off. I would recommend this game to begginers wanting to get into the assassin's creed franchise and want to start from the beggining, but for some veteran assassin creed players, it may seem boring because of its repetitive investigation.\n\n8.5/10 - Fun as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but some boring repetitive gameplay","January 16, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is repetitive; the investigations are repetitive; the objectives within the investigations are repetitive, and the combat is extremely repetitive. If you don't like doing the same thing over and over, this game will make you want to shoot yourself. If I were to give it a score on a 10 point scale, I'd give it a 6.5. The visuals were actually pretty good, and its setting was fascinating. I found the backstory (there are two stories - one in which you are in an Animus, reliving your ancestor's assassin memories, and the other where you are a random dude being tested on in this lab by a sketchy scientist) more interesting than the "main" one. Is the game extremely over-hyped? Yes. Was it worth the $5.00 I paid for it? Yeah, I'd say so. Overall, decent game.

You will often find yourself doing many of the same things over and over again, just over different settings.\nThankfully this is all supplemented over the game's freedom of how to approach each assassination, the game's freerunning and it's entertaining (but a tad easy) combat system.\nOne last issue I have with the presentation is that sometimes the voice acting is really off, mostly the main character who seems to talk in an American accent while everyone else talks on a Middle-Eastern accent, plus he also seems to talk really "Narmy" (With excessive melodrama)\nOverall, in my opinion you should only buy this game when it's on sale or if you already got Assassin's Creed II.\nIf you're looking to get into this series I reccomend starting in AC II, because as much as I love what this game did right, I also hate what it did wrong.\n\nPC PORT REPORT: Game is well optimized, but suffers a lot in the control department, so if you don't have a controller but still wish to buy this port, I reccomend getting one. Thankfully the game has fully re-bindable keyboard and mouse controls. This "Director's Cut" version doesn't really add anything worth noting to the game either, in fact I barely even noticed the extra missions. If you have the console version of the game I don't reccomend buying this version too.\nLast but not least, this game DOES NOT requiere Uplay to play, essentially freeing it from Ubisoft's poor PC DRM policies.","January 5, 2015","true","44.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spgcollective/recommended/15100/","spgcollective","Sp√•ra13A","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spgcollective/","119 products in account","BLUF: Interesting story, however characters hold little weight. Relatively repetitive, little replay value. Good starting point into AC Universe, but with no multiplayer or branching story, and little in the way of customization, there is no need to replay the game unless one is looking for deeper meaning in the story. The more recent AC games have also perfected the formula.\n\n8/10\n*********************************************************************************************************************************\n\nAs the introduction to a now well known and defined franchise by Ubisoft {France and other studios}, Assassin's Creed‚Ñ¢ is the cornerstone entry into now what has become Ubisoft's flagship brand.\n\nAssassin's Creed‚Ñ¢: Director's Cut is the quintessential version of that cornerstone. Ultimately, the game is fun to play to an extent. For those lost in the annals of the Assassin's Creed universe, this game is a great stepping stone to move into the now popular "revenge, passion, and growth" storylines that permeate the modern AC entries. For fans of Ubisoft's work, it can serve as an interesting look back at the mechanics and storytelling that launched a new IP.\n\nHowever, I would like to stress that this game is not like its future bretheren. The game has little in the way of customization of either character or playstyle. The unlocks are given at defined intervals and there is significant travel time between mission sets. The gameplay is repetitive, taking place through a variety of event types that ultimately lead you up to an extended mission with a difficult situation to overcome tactically. However there is no replay value, as the missions do not change. The graphics are dated 7 years later, and the Director's Cut content does not add anything that changes the way the mission sets play out.\n\nI do want to note that the game places much of stress onto players to approach situations how they want while being given the tools to do so. Two of the 6-8 side missions are required for the player to approach the set-ending assasination attempt, which leaves it to the player to decide how much preparation they want to place behind their precision. The future entries in the AC Universe certainly distill this methodology of player agency and expand on it, incorporating the side missions into the main story, therefore lengthening the story and making the work up to an assassination attempt significant in a different way.\n\nI would also like to stress that the story is different as well. The story for AC was developed following the loose adaptation of Vladimir Bartol's Alamut. The story is not the typified AC norm (emotionally scarring event that leads the protagonist into a catharsis, forging the character and leading to the emergence of an assassin moving to vanquish those who wronged him/her/the brotherhood) The Assassin v. Templar threat is not well fleshed out here in the meta-story either. However, these are tropes left to the rest of the franchise to carry out.\n\nI argue that this story line is the last one that has significant interpretation that can be administered. Although containing franchise staples such as revenge and freedom, the epiphany here takes the length of the game, and the true value is in the growth of the main character, not in the vanquishing of the main antagonist. The assassination's in the mean time serve as the vehicles that propel the character to the objective, without becoming the objectives themselves. It is here that the story shines, even though it is an adaptation of a story written in 1938.\n\nDespite it's flaws, Assassin's Creed‚Ñ¢ is a title that enthusiasts and beginners can both pick up and enjoy with the only draws being the repetitive nature of the mechanics. I love the game and certainly suggest it to all interested. With it's interesting and well written story, and fun gameplay with appropriate twists, this title earns and keeps it's place as the birthplace of AC and one of Ubisoft's riskier and profitible entries.\n\n8/10\n\n**It should be noted that Ubisoft took a financial hit in developing AC, losing a significant amount to a lack of sales driven by the release of this as a new IP and the lack of heavy marketing that Ubisoft now relies on. Ironically, the game's mechanics and models have been copied into many of Ubisoft's other IPs and has created an extremely successful franchise that is soon seeing it's next installments in AC: Unity and AC: Rogue, bringing the total number of console/PC AC properties to 8. Vladimir Bartol would be proud.**","October 20, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As he continues to kill the men, Alta√Ør finds out why he was sent to kill them and also why Desmond was kidnapped.\n\nIn order to assassinate the leaders, Alta√Ør must gather information by pickpocketing, beating a confession, eavesdropping, or helping a Order informer on the target that is in a sector and then get approval from the Order leader in the city with the information.\nAlso he can do a couple side missions by saving citizens that go can help getting into a place with scholars or having vigilantes that while hold on to guards as Alta√Ør gets away.\nAll of this is the real problem with the game as getting the information is all the same in every level of the game and gets really boring fast.\n\nVisually the game looks great even on a standard def TV and I bet looks better on a HDTV.\nControls are tight most of the time and only feel loose when fighting but not so loose to be killed too many times.\nBut another fault is that story is weak as its pretty confusing and a bit convoluted.\n\nOverall the game is a good game and worth borrowing to play but its seems like the game needed a little more work in some areas that could have make it a great game.\n\n7/10\n\n(This review is based on the PS3 version when is was originally released so does not reflect on the PC port)","November 30, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRedCthulhu/recommended/15100/","TheRedCthulhu","Manfred von Richthofen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRedCthulhu/","33 products in account","The original Assassin's Creed game is what started a franchise that can be recognized almost anywhere. I honsetly believe it was this game that served as the catalyst to boost Ubisoft Montreal into creating the multiple other AC games.\n\nI wanted to include my own story overview, because in my opinion you'll want to play this game because of the gameplay (Parkour, Freerunning, Combat) first and the storyline second. This isn't because I thought the story was bad-- it is just the least interesting in the series. However this story was what started the Assassin's Creed lore and, well, Creed.\nYou start off by waking up inside a machine known as "The Animus", a device developed by a company called "Abstergo". To be more clear 'you' are Desmond Miles, a young man who claims to be a bartender. Abstergo kidnapped Desmond as a means to probe him with the Animus to recover memories of his ancestors, which would lead them to something (something of value) that was lost to time (as Assassin's Creed I is set during the Crusades, in 1191 AD). Once inside the Animus, you play as Altair, a master Assassin who loses everything he built up in the Brotherhood by breaking key Tenents set by the Order's leader, Al Maulim, and Assassins from a previous age. Abstergo follows the memories of Altair, searching for a device created by unknown people (speculated to be supernatural beings) that has the ability to control the minds of others. Towards the middle of the story Desmond realizes what is happening, that the company called Abstergo is actully run by Templar Knights, who are still bent on ending the war waged by Assassins and Templars, even after a thousand years, by using the Apple (as the mind-control device is called).\nSo does Desmond or Altair do something about it? You'll have to buy this game and play it to find out.\nBeyond Story, this game has very nice gameplay and graphics for a game made in 2007-2008. I can still consider it a Next Gen game, as the details and cinematics are very well done. This game isn't seamless, as you have to load every time you change locations-- thats another thing: While this game is tagged as "Open World", the game is devised to give you the first few levels complete control over where you go. After this, you can quickly travel between the main cities in the game; Masyaf, Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus. The area in between these places is called Kingdom on the map. You can always travel through Kingdom, but you always have the option to teleport to the cities' outskirts after you return to Al Maulim at Masyaf. This game, in this case, becomes both Open World, and Linear. But because this is a small detail, it doesn't really add up as a problem in-game.\nParkour is always fun in AC, as you can freerun up any place so long as there are handholds of ledges to hold onto. The game's "Leap of Faith" idea wasn't bad, but it makes the game seem unrealistic in my opinion, not that this game should sound "real" at all. Basically a Leap of Faith is when you climb up onto a veiwpoint, spy your surroundngs, then leap down into a nearby haystack. Its a very fun feature, but looks very impossible. Ignoring the aesthetics of the Leap of Faith, it's a great way to get players to explore without feeling rushed. You don't just walk around and unlock map bits. You have to climb up and look around to know where to go. This is also great because you don't complete missions if you don't explore-- you have to complete three side-quests before the target is avaliable to kill. So viewpoints and Leaps of Faith are very much-- gameplay wise-- critical.\nI've played Assassin's Creed through once now. It can go quick if you want it to, or rush through it to do the most important thing you can possibly do once you complete AC1-- play the next game.\nI give this game a 8/10, because its fun to play, but just ends too quickly!","September 15, 2014","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The background story in the present time with Desmond Miles is a great setup for later games, but unfortunately the story of Altair in the crusades isn't anything special. This is more than made up by the fact that the world is one giant parkour playground and that it actually feels like a real living, breathing world with all the people and their reactions (especially when guards randomly fall from rooftops). Combat needs some work, basically you learn the timing of the counterattack and you can kill anything easily. Altair also failed swimming lessons and dies instantly in the water.\n\nEasily recommended, although with how old this game is I would say to wait until it's on sale to pick it up, and preferably as part of a bundle with other AC games.","September 9, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thats all i can really tell without Major spoilers for things that will affect our experience dfrasticaly and make it much less fun for you the first time. For ¬£10 this game is amazing value and you can spend dozens of hours in the story, exploring the cities, and doing just random stuff. Sadly there is no Multiplayer in this title but there is later in the series. The reason I have 4 hours playtime is because I just brought this on steam but i had it on Playstation 3. So I highly reccomend this game. 9/10","August 1, 2014","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, this game might not seem cool at all if you've played the later Assassin's Creed games such as Black Flag, but if you're just starting, I highly recommend starting here, at ground zero. For me, the combat system was revolutionary, compared to Ubisoft's similar game series "Prince of Persia," it was a major jump. The fact that the city environments in the game are completely open-ended are also an awesome addition. It helps add a realistic element and shows you the effort put into the virtual environment. Now, I personally loved following both story lines, but that may or may not be interesting at all to you. In the event that it isn't, there's plenty of gory combat and backstabbing to cure the itch. So, do I recommend this game, YES. Though it doesn't have a very high replay value, its got great combat and plus, it's the only Assassin's Creed game that saves you having to get Uplay, which can be a little difficult.","December 23, 2014","true","76.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as Desmond, a test subject for a mysterious project which involves the use of a machine called "The Animus". The Animus transports the subject into the body of any ancestor from the subject's bloodline, via genetic memory. Altair is the ancestor of choice in this game. There's so much running and jumping it'll make you want to take up parkour. The animation is beautiful as well as the worlds. The worlds are so impressive, visiting places like Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, each having it's own distinct feel and design. Certainly a work of art.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/15100/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","Third person view assassination parkour simulator.\n\nThe "simulator" is especially befitting as this is in fact a story of one kidnapped Desmond Miles, set in what appears to be a not so distant future. Machine called Animus s(t)imulates genetic memories of our hero to put him in shoes of his ancestor, assassin Alta√Ør ibn-La'Ahad, during times of the Third Crusade.\n\nThis meta story is definitely one of the highlights of this adventure game. The other being the pretty well executed, smooth freerunning exploration aspect. I also love how the whole Animus business explains lots of acceptable breaks from reality present in video games. But then who will explain the stuff that is going on for Desmond? xD\n\nI would hesitate though to call this much of "action" game or especially "stealth" game. It's rather easy, for one, bar maybe the very end and any area that has water as Alta√Ør can survive falls from some rather jarring heights but can't swim even in a puddle of liquid. But okay, let it be an action adventure.\n\nFor two, however, regarding the stealth aspect. You're not that much interesting to the guards to begin with and then you simply have one button to make you even less interesting, kind of hiding in plain sight (blending). Once you do garner unhealthy interest what you do is run away, break line of sight and hide in some hay or something, often jumping there from some ridiculous heights.\n\nExcept you often get this impression it is actually easier and faster to kill dozen of guards rather than to run from them and hide.\n\nIn short, the stealth aspect is actually barely present and not that all rewarding, especially compared to something I would call "proper" stealth like in Dishonored or even Deus Ex: HR or Batman. Not mentioning Thief, of course, that's a given. But I imagine I have to set this expectation for the whole series that this is more about the story, freerunning and mass murder rather than stealth. Not saying it's bad, just bit different from what I originally anticipated.\n\nArguably the most challenging part is gathering literally hundreds of some flags loitered around, yet it gives you pretty much nothing, there aren't even uplay points or steam achievements for that (on consoles you'd get achievos at least). Sufficient to say I gave up on that portion :] Even creator pretty much agreed he was just trolling players with that.\n\nAlthough I did execute all the "side" missions even if you're required to do only a fraction of them to proceed.\n\nAh.. the missions.. That's another stab at gameplay. Despite all the open ended nature, it gets pretty repetetive. Maybe that's why they decided not to force all side missions on you.\n\nOverall I'd still say it is a pretty interesting experience, and even if it didn't exactly meet my expectations it did nicely set off the whole franchise and can't wait to play the next installments.","January 11, 2013","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Relatively repetitive, little replay value. Good starting point into AC Universe, but with no multiplayer or branching story, and little in the way of customization, there is no need to replay the game unless one is looking for deeper meaning in the story. The more recent AC games have also perfected the formula.\n\n8/10\n*********************************************************************************************************************************\n\nAs the introduction to a now well known and defined franchise by Ubisoft {France and other studios}, Assassin's Creed‚Ñ¢ is the cornerstone entry into now what has become Ubisoft's flagship brand.\n\nAssassin's Creed‚Ñ¢: Director's Cut is the quintessential version of that cornerstone. Ultimately, the game is fun to play to an extent. For those lost in the annals of the Assassin's Creed universe, this game is a great stepping stone to move into the now popular "revenge, passion, and growth" storylines that permeate the modern AC entries. For fans of Ubisoft's work, it can serve as an interesting look back at the mechanics and storytelling that launched a new IP.\n\nHowever, I would like to stress that this game is not like its future bretheren. The game has little in the way of customization of either character or playstyle. The unlocks are given at defined intervals and there is significant travel time between mission sets. The gameplay is repetitive, taking place through a variety of event types that ultimately lead you up to an extended mission with a difficult situation to overcome tactically. However there is no replay value, as the missions do not change. The graphics are dated 7 years later, and the Director's Cut content does not add anything that changes the way the mission sets play out.\n\nI do want to note that the game places much of stress onto players to approach situations how they want while being given the tools to do so. Two of the 6-8 side missions are required for the player to approach the set-ending assasination attempt, which leaves it to the player to decide how much preparation they want to place behind their precision. The future entries in the AC Universe certainly distill this methodology of player agency and expand on it, incorporating the side missions into the main story, therefore lengthening the story and making the work up to an assassination attempt significant in a different way.\n\nI would also like to stress that the story is different as well. The story for AC was developed following the loose adaptation of Vladimir Bartol's Alamut. The story is not the typified AC norm (emotionally scarring event that leads the protagonist into a catharsis, forging the character and leading to the emergence of an assassin moving to vanquish those who wronged him/her/the brotherhood) The Assassin v. Templar threat is not well fleshed out here in the meta-story either. However, these are tropes left to the rest of the franchise to carry out.\n\nI argue that this story line is the last one that has significant interpretation that can be administered. Although containing franchise staples such as revenge and freedom, the epiphany here takes the length of the game, and the true value is in the growth of the main character, not in the vanquishing of the main antagonist. The assassination's in the mean time serve as the vehicles that propel the character to the objective, without becoming the objectives themselves. It is here that the story shines, even though it is an adaptation of a story written in 1938.\n\nDespite it's flaws, Assassin's Creed‚Ñ¢ is a title that enthusiasts and beginners can both pick up and enjoy with the only draws being the repetitive nature of the mechanics. I love the game and certainly suggest it to all interested. With it's interesting and well written story, and fun gameplay with appropriate twists, this title earns and keeps it's place as the birthplace of AC and one of Ubisoft's riskier and profitible entries.\n\n8/10\n\n**It should be noted that Ubisoft took a financial hit in developing AC, losing a significant amount to a lack of sales driven by the release of this as a new IP and the lack of heavy marketing that Ubisoft now relies on. Ironically, the game's mechanics and models have been copied into many of Ubisoft's other IPs and has created an extremely successful franchise that is soon seeing it's next installments in AC: Unity and AC: Rogue, bringing the total number of console/PC AC properties to 8. Vladimir Bartol would be proud.**","October 20, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your Player character themselves, exceeds in being able to sleep knowing they will soon be killed (A difficult skill) and they have a vision mode like the light csi use.\n\nYou mainly play the player characters, player character which is an Assassin. The first 6 hours of the game repeats itself two more times. Sadly about halfway through you stop getting cool stuff to make this grind feel less like a grind. Would it have been too much to ask for a sword that was strong enough to occassionally snap enemies swords in half...\n\nThe promise of being an assassin is not delivered as it is in games such as Hitman. If you instead think of yourself as a "Knight"/"Ranger" or at best "Rogue" things make a little more sense. Don't expect to be doing any of the following assassin tricks.\n\n* Dripping poison into the mouth a deep sleeping target\n* Poison capsules in the wine. (Someone does poison wine, but it is not you)\n* Accidental or false flag death situations\n* Wearing a disguise\n* Hiding bodies\n* Being able to sneak passed the guards of those you are seeking to assassinate without having to take them all head on..

The game itself is still decent despite some design issues, such as doing the same repetitive side quests in order to progress the convoluted main story, or being able to beat the game by using a single combat move ad nauseam. Still, Assassin's Creed (both the first game and the series) does a great job of taking you through various historic locations and keeping you engaged as it does. It's a definite recommendation from me.","March 15, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I judged it too quickly , I had it for a while, and decided after watching a playthrough of a few levels on youtube I decided maybe I was too hasty. I redownloaded the game and really had a great time. The game can be used with a keyboard... but you will either A. Kill your keyboard or B. Kill your hand. Whichever comes first.\n\nI was never good with gamepads but after my hand began to hurt with frustation, I pulled out my pad and really REALLY benefited from it. The Game makes it easy too, since the circles in the upper right mirror the layout of your controller, and change accordingly it allowed me to easily adapt and in doing so become a much better assassin haha.

A definite favourite of mine at any rate.\n\nThis game got me into the Assassin's creed franchise. The gameplay may not be the very best there is, but it's good. The "side missions" are the same in every city and every district, which is at times boring. However, the whole story and the actual main missions are all worth this.\n\nThe free-running aspect of the gameplay is of course the main pull. Even at this stage it's already great fun to run along the rooftops, though it gets considerably better in the later games.\n\nThe weapons are few, but it's enough for this game. The hidden blade and the sword are all you need most of the time, anyway.\n\nMy favourite part are the little "stories" told during the death scenes. The dialogue is well written and it makes you think and question and doutb much like it does the main character. The plot is the driving force of this games at any rate, because the mystery and the power are something to be revealed, something to be discovered.\n\nThe combat is fairly easy, once you get the hang of it. As you acquire new skills and techniques, you grow bolder in combat, no longer waiting for the opportunity to counter, but to attack as well. The aspect of growth is important as the game progresses and as the character changes. First, you get to try out all the things you have, all that you can do, but you do not know how to do or use most of those things. Then, they are ripped away from you and you're left with only the bare necessities. You learn as the characters does, to use the little you have and to deserve more.\n\nThe cities are different in architecture, all magnificent, although the details are not all that sharp. However, this is the first game and if played first, it will pull you in. It's set where most other games never set foot, therefore compelling.\n\nThe educational side is great. The characters presented in the games, mostly "villains", are based, in many cases, on real history-related people. There's so much to learn and so much passion to ignite while having fun at the same time.\n\nOne major downside is the lack of subtitles. For someone such as myself, who is not a native speaker, it is hard to understand the dialogue at times, which is a pity since it's so well written. Also, the hearing impaired gamers are sure to feel left out, because they cannot enjoy this piece as well as they could were the subtitles there.\n\nDespite the fact that the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, apart from the main missions, it is still revolutionary. You're allowed to run and be free for as long as you wish. The combat is fun, because winning usually is - saving poor people is a bonus and you feel like a hero for a while, though the story and the other characters don't see you as such. But as the story grows, so does the character and this is one of the few games where the main character learns, grows and changes. The Altair you start out with and the one you are at the end are not the same and the difference is palpable. The game holds a potential for greatness only developed and fully discovered in the later games. It makes for an enjoyable 20-hour ride nonetheless.\n\n7/10","November 2, 2014","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
