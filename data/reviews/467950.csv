"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/recommended/467950/","dragoonsz","± Roger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/","4396 products in account","Product received for free\n\nSurvive in Space\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing.\n\nThe team at Just1337 must really love space and space themed games, as this is there 4th space game on Steam. Survive in Space is a 2D Space Shooter. The story is kind of interesting so I won't spoil it, but throughout the stages of of this game, you pilot a space fighter. You can choose between 5 initially, though I'm not sure if more unlock as you continue to play. Each ship has a set passive abilities that are different from the other ships, and you can choose a ship to cater to your playing style. You can also switch what ship you want to use before each stage. You have a basic attack and 2 other skills you can use in combat, and after each stage your character receives experience as well the ship that you are using. When your ship levels up you can assign more passive abilities to it, and the same applies to your character.\n\nThe combat itself puts you in a space battlefield for each stage. You are tasked with taking down all enemy ships as they appear on your screen with your various abilities to complete the stage. You can manage the difficulty of each battle from the classic presets of "Easy, Medium & Hard" as well as choose to add more asteroids (which pose as flying obstacles) as well increasing the amount of enemies you have to defeat. Of course the more difficult you make it for yourself, the more experience your will accumulate. The game can be a bit bullet hell-y at times, and there are boss battles at certain stages.\n\n--------\n\nGraphics: 7 / 10\n\nThe art style might be subjective. It's a 2D western animeish design for the characters, which isn't something I tend to enjoy but I could see how a lot of people would appreciate it. The back drop for the battles is decent, though I feel it does get a bit repetitive after awhile, although I haven't played all the stages to know if it's different later on. The animations are also decent, and the combat effects as well as the menus are designed pretty nicely. There shouldn't be any problems running the title on any graphics card or CPU as it is not a demanding title.\n\n--------\n\nSound: 8 / 10\n\nEveryone has different tastes in music, but I feel like anyone who can enjoy EDM music; this title has a nice soundtrack for you. I personally enjoy the music in this game, it reminds me a lot of their other title Neon Space, which I believe some of the music is also from. I noticed in the music interface that they have various types of EDM styles like: Drumbass, Dubstep, Electronic and House music, and as someone who enjoys this type of music, I would rate it pretty highly. There is also options to skip to the next track as well as shuffle and repeat features. The in-game and combat sound effects are also decent and surprisingly didn't feel repetitive. There is also some voice acting within the game which is also very subjective.\n\n--------\n\nMechanics: 7 / 10\n\nFor a title like this, the mechanics are pretty solid. You have your basic attack, and your 2 other skills. You more around with either a controller, your arrow keys, or your mouse, and shoot down enemies on your screen while avoiding their fire. Unlike some shooters, you also have the option of flipping your ship and shooting in the opposite direction. I do find it a tad frustrating not being able to shoot up and down at times, though I feel the controls might be too messy if something like that was implemented. You can switch between two different modes while playing, attack mode and defense mode, which both offer benefits and disadvantages. The enemy variety is pretty good, there's quite a few different looking enemy ships with different abilities. You can upgrade your ship as well as your character with experience at the end of each battle as well as toggle the difficulty level.\n\n--------\n\nFinal Personal Remarks\n\nI think Survive in Space is a good title for beginners who want to get into 2D shooters. It's not as intense as some bullet hells but it can give you some rush and satisfaction when you're able to take down all the enemies. The art style isn't  something I personally enjoy but I do like the soundtrack and how you can upgrade your ships as well as your character. The story seems interesting but also kind of cliché, but I see it hooking a lot of people. In my experience with playing the game, I preferred to stay in attack mode rather than defense mode. It's a bit riskier when you take a hit because you take more damage in addition to having your health points already lowered, but you deal a lot more damage, and it's easier to take out enemies.\n\nThanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.","May 26","true","3.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robotater/recommended/467950/","robotater","[воом] come have a gander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robotater/","283 products in account","Product received for free\n\nProvided by Giveaways Reborn\nSurvive in Space is a 2D space shooter, based around Sasaki, who lives in a galaxy that has been taken over by an evil people known as "The Chronicles." Sasaki discovers the truth about The Chronicles and the history of his people, and must fight to earn redemption.\n\nPresentationIn game, the graphics are great, and all the art compliments each other perfectly, making this game a feast for the eyes. Outside of the gameplay, however, the graphics seem to be lacking.\n\nThe main menu's art is quite nice, with an animated picture of Sasaki on a seemingly deserted planet. The graphical design of the actual menu part, however, leaves much to be desired. While when the player hovers over an option, the menu fits with the aesthetic of the game, when the player is not hovering over the menu options, they are just gray boxes with a font closely akin to Arial. This font is used throughout the game, and it really draws away from the rest of the game's aesthetic.\n\nThe art style in the cutscenes is extremely unpolished compared with the rest of the game, even to the point of looking unfinished at times. The voice acting in these cutscenes is very much a mixed bag. The narrator and the "servant of darkness" are both voiced extremely well, but the main character, Sasaki, is not. The voice actor sounds like he is reading a story to a kindergarten class, and manages to do it with no emotion. Any emotion given to Sasaki's character through the voice acting seems very forced.\n\nThe music, while it sounds great, does not really fit in with the atmosphere of the game at points. The player can also add their own music, as long as it is in .wav or .ogg format.\n\nInterface/ControlsThe user interface is generally very easy to use. The only major problem with it is that to access the upgrade and ship select screen, the player has to leave the level select screen to go to the main menu, where they must select the "Upgrades" option. A casual player who has never played this game before might totally miss it, as it is not mentioned in any tutorial, and try and get through some of the harder levels without any upgrades, or without realizing there were other ships in the game.\n\nThe controls are quite comfortable and make sense. On a keyboard, the game uses the MOBA system for attacks, using Q, W, E, and R for attacks, while on a controller it uses the regular buttons.\n\nPlotThe game follows Sasaki as he fights The Chronicles. He has the truth about The Chronicles revealed to him by an ancient writing of some sort, and is then seduced by a "servant of darkness," who is also seeking vengeance against The Chronicles.\n\nThe script is poorly written, with Sasaki's emotions or thoughts only ever being revealed through him saying directly what they are. It does not flow well, with the characters often speaking in short or fragmented sentences, and going out of the way to make sure that the audience does not have to infer anything.\n\nGameplayThe game tries to be a sort of bullet hell space shooter, but fails in that it is too slow paced. This becomes apparent at the very beginning, when the first enemy to spawn takes eight hits with the base weapon to kill. This does not change as the player levels up - at level one, that enemy takes eight hits, at level five it takes the same.\n\nTher is a large variety of ships for the player to chose from, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. The only problem with this is that there is no indication of this capability from the level select screen or the main menu. To change ships, the player has to go to the main menu and select "Upgrades," then go to the "Shipyard" tab.\n\nThe player is given three weapons - the basic weapon, a laser, and homing missiles. The basic weapon is able to be fired every tenth of a second or so, and the other weapons take a few seconds to recharge, which can be upgraded to be less. The basic weapon is a machine gun which does about two damage to an enemy. The laser is a solid laser beam which does more, and the homing missiles are, well, homing missiles. They do a ridiculous amount of damage, but take a while to recharge.\n\nThe player is also given a "super mode" upon pressing R, that makes the players attacks more powerful, but moves the ship's shields farther away, rendering it more vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe player's ship can only shoot in two directions: left and right. This, coupled with the fact that the ship moves quite slowly, makes defeating enemies a chore sometimes. The player's ship also cant move to the very top or very bottom of the screen, rendering enemies in certain positions unreachable.\n\nReplayabilityAfter completing the 50 levels with the game, the player can continue leveling up indefinitely, playing through those 50 levels again and again, eventually becoming ridiculously overpowered.\n\nConclusionSurvive in Space, while promising, is plagued with a myriad of problems, chief among those being the slow pace and a lack of general polish.\n\n\nFollow Giveaways Reborn ! curator for more reviews\nThis game has been given away in Giveaways Reborn !","May 28","false","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

You also have full control to switch the songs at any time during the game.\n+ Visually the game looks great with very bright colorful neon ships, bullets, and explosions along with some great looking outerspace backgrounds.\n+ A unique mechanic where you can turn your ship left or right, so basically you are fighting waves of enemies that appear on both sides of the screen and generally stay in the center.\n+ Upgrade / experience system, you can upgrade each of your weapons along a separate skill tree. You have player upgrades to increase your damage, shields, evasion, etc. And finally there are 5 ships to choose from that you can essentially level as you play to gain additional perks .\n+ Great difficulty settings  / modifiers, to gain additional experience you can turn up the difficulty OR you can set modifiers to make the game more challenging such as more enemies, asteroids, and "planetary fortresses" which will send a few planets at you during the mission which have rocket launching turrets on them.\n+ Challenging bosses which have a variety of unique abilities and movements to really keep things entertaining every 10 levels.\n+ A surprising amount of voice acted cutscenes which you don't normally see in games of this genre.\n\n- The story is a bit confusing to fully understand\n- The voice acting / dialogue felt a bit forced at times, but as an indie project it's pretty easy to look past that\n- Even though there's 5 ships, you only have 4 abilities that you will be using repetitively throughout the 50 missions. It would have been nice if each ship had unique abilities to mix things up a bit.","May 21","true","8.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

They are a set of waves and enemies. You have to complete every wave and kill every enemy in order to complete a level. You are able to turn on extra modifiers to make your game harder but they grant you more experience. Experiences are needed to level up and upgrading ur ship and ability power. Playing on higher difficulty will only give you more experience. IT will not change the ammount of ships and waves. They remain the same. However they do more damage and will get more HP. You are able to switch between Stances. Offensive Stance is good for attacking, giving you more power and speed. But defensive stance is good if you need to regain health. They both have their upside and downside.\n\nDifferent difficulties.\nDifferent ship with different ship bonus effects.\nGreat artwork.\nGraphics are alright.\nMusic is alright? You can add your own music.\nNO OPTIONS DURING A LEVEL.\nMany levels. including bosses and other things.\nFonts are a bit too small to see your HP and experience.
