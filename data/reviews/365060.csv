"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/365060/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Titanis is the kind of game you play during a rainy afternoon, when you want to kill a couple of hours and you don't feel like doing something meaningful with your life. It doesn't excel in anything but it's not a bad game either; it's relaxing and casual but at the same time I didn't find it boring at all; truth is I was planning to give it a try for 15-30 minutes but I ended up playing 4-5 hours until I managed to unlock the whole content.\n\nTitanis is a side scrolling action game with some platforming bits and a few RPG elements. There's not much story attached to it though - the protagonist Bash takes up a mission to fight the strange creatures attacking a settlement in the middle of the desert.\n\nThe levels consist mainly of killing the enemies and completing some objectives. Those  award money and skill points that you can further use to upgrade your armor or unlock new skills. With a total of 16 skills of which you can equip 4 at the same time, there's not much variety of spells, but on the other hand, the enemies are so easy to kill that you don't really need to use more than a basic damage attack 2 or 3 times for a given mob to be dead. The only moments in which you need to use more than 1 skill are the two boss fights you encounter. While the game seemed to me like a walk in the park, the last boss proved to be rather difficult compared to everything else before, even with all the upgrades and skills unlocked, and I had to retry the level quite a few times before I  managed to beat it.\n\nAchievement-wise, this is not an easy 100% despite the fact that it seems to be so, judging by the difficulty of the levels. Don't be fooled by the "Beat the boss without taking damage." achievements - while one of those 2 is doable after a little practice and by spamming shields non stop and dodging everything, the other one is much much harder.\n\nThis is a short game that you can play in one setting, but the replayability is enhanced by the inclusion of the level editor.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","July 18, 2015","true","13.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","4"

This game is well worth $4.99. The game mechanics were simple but fun. The weopon/armor upgrades were pretty decent.  The game seems fairly easy till you get to the boss. I beat the boss on my 6th try, very fun boss fight.  The skills you could choose from are fun and diverse. This is a short game but, I feel would make a great game to do speed runs on. I look forward to more games from the developers.","June 9, 2015","true","7.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Nothing deep but decent mechanics and a couple hours of fun.  Seems a little flat in the sound department, but I wasn't expecting much for 5$.  You'll most likely beat it in an afternoon, but it' ll be worth it.  Probably.","June 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Each mission has a side objective (find an item, kill an enemy) and a main objective, which usually entails getting to the end of the stage and fighting a gauntlet of enemies, or clearing out a series of large enemies through the level.\n\nThe art style is nice, and colorful; very easy on the eyes. The music is fine, and suits the game.\n\nThe meat of the game comes from the customization. You can acquire 16 diffferent skills but can only have a loadout of four at one time. Each one is unique, whether it offers damage, protection, or causes  status effects on enemies. As you collect gold, you can buy upgrades to your health, damage, and more.\n\nEven spending a little less then an hour farming gold to finish all the upgrades it didn't take me too long to get through this. All the achievements are easy, save the two for defeating bosses with no damage. There is also a hidden achievement, but I'm not sure what it entails.\n\nThis game is recommended. There are worse things to spend your money on.","October 23, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Casual platforming shooter with upgrades.\n\nWish it was a bit faster paced (faster player movement and projectile movement, and faster weapon cooldown!), and I wish you could crouch to dodge projectile attacks.\n\n+rebindable controls\n+level editor\n+upgradable weapons\n+unlock new weapons/"skills" (example: boomerang, rocket, laser, grenades)","August 26, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played some of it and my son played some of it. Fun for all ages.  Dialogue was a little slow, but game ran smoothly and progressively got harder which was good. Skills and upgrades were cool to play around with, just wish it had difficulty settings since it was kinda on the easy side.If you have $5 and a few hours to kill, definitely worth it.","June 9, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

But being honest here, there are much better games available than yours for free. The whole time I was playing your game I was thinking to myself, "I could be playing Plazma Burst 2 and it would be more fun than this.  So many elements felt like they were thrown in to hit the checkboxes of being a platformer rather than to make the game more fun.\nPros- It references the best Star Wars movies lightly with the acheivements\n\nNeutral- The graphics are a bit dated but I see them fitting with this as a Flash game.\n\nCons- Story is awful, the intown NPCs dialogue never changes, and there is no feeling that I am making things better for these people. A few little things thrown into the background of the town after completing a mission would have helped here.\nThe enemy AI is weak and the enemies more annoying than fun to take out. Either go for adding a bunch and let me try to curbstomp them, or make them more powerful and give me cover and much better movement and better weapons. Please.\nThe movement needs to be more polished, it is annoying the number of times that I got stuck on the edge of a ledge and was unable to jump up. Also double jump is too weak to largely help in combat and felt like it was added to hit a checkbox.\nFirerate is too slow, weapons largely aren't upgradeable, and it makes about as much sense for me to be unable to launch a drone or fire a laser when my primary weapon is in cooldown as it does to say that I can't scratch my butt while brushing my teeth.\n\nIn all I would say that this game in the state it is currently in should be something that is released for free in order to receive feedback.\nTo the dev I will list some of the free games I have played that this game made me think of in terms of platforming run-and-gun elements as to how it could have been better.\nDiamond Hollow 2\nPlazma Burst 2\n","August 27, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
