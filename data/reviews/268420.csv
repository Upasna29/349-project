No real reason. It was aesthetically cute, and the cash shop was mostly there for little "pretties".\n\nUnfortunately, I am writing this review as a negative, as I cannot suggest this game to anyone due to the practices of the company. In short, once you start buying points with real cash, if you choose to stop buying, they will ban your account.\n\nI had been playing this game for a little while, and purchased quite a bit of points, but when my points started piling up and I just felt i had nothing to truly spend them on, I ceased buying, only to be greeted with an email a few months later stating that "for my protection" a ban has been placed on my account due to billing inactivity. They inform you to contact support on their website, and provide transaction histories that you cannot access, due to not even being able to log into your account. If you attempt to, you are greeted with a messege saying your account is frozen for "violation of terms of services".\n\nDon't believe me? Run a google search. The issue speaks for itself. It is not that I did anything illigal. I did not violate terms of service. The company banned me for choosing not to buy "optional" points via real cash, on their "free to play" game.","October 10, 2015","false","15.1"," 724 of 786 people (92%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","92","724","786","55","33"

I will give you my pros and cons and keep in mind that this is an ANIME mmorpg , i know that not every1 likes animes but i love them and based on my experience i ll assume that to be in the pros category ! :)\n\nPROS :\n\n- It is FREE , you can become great without even spending a single euro/dollar !\n- Anime graphics , well designed world and characters !\n- New player friendly , anyone can learn all he needs to know from the in-game tutorials which are all implemented in the story-line and are presented at the proper time.\n- Nice storyline that will keep you interested (if you are ever read missions and not skip them)\n- Clever way to involve pets (named eidolons in the game) in the storyline and awesome system to get them gathering key fragments. (pets and mounts are different)\n- A big variety of classes and the abillity to choose a subclass at later levels allows for many different playstyles and combinations !\n- Fishing , digging and other extra stuff to keep you busy even when you think you are done leveling up (you ll never actually be :P ).\n- Nice and friendly community, you can surely make a lot of in-game friends and have fun in the game !\n- Quests offer an autopath for the monsters you have to slain or the things you have to find so you wont need to blindly search for them.\n\n\nCONS :\n\n- For those who skip missions it will be boring as it doesnt offer anything more in leveling up other than grind and more grind.\n- There are not TOO many dungeons , you will have to repeat some of them at certain points which you may find tiring.\n- Lags and glitches do exist but they are not unbearable , considering that the game is still young they shouldnt be a problem that will last for long.\n- IF you decide to buy something with real money you need to know that things in the store are TOO expensive.\n- Still in progress so the game still doesn't offer an ending at it's story line , it will be released at a later date.\n\nRESULT :\n\nAs you can see : PROS >> CONS and overall this is a GREAT mmorpg that i strongly recommend to every single gamer out there , either you are a fan of mmorpgs or not ! It will keep you playing for hours and you will have a great time ! Awesome game , awesome kingdom ! :)","October 15, 2014","true","522.9"," 417 of 438 people (95%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","95","417","438","17","23"

Of course, that thread has been deleted since so it's up to you whether you believe it or not.\nThe conclusion of my review is that you should be very careful if you are a free player, because the game rules apply to you differently.

(gPotato was even worst)\n\n\nIf for some reason you still want to play this game, Here is some steps to NOT get perma banned from AeriaGames & Aura Kingdom for no reason:\n\nDo NOT spend any money on the game at all! not a single penny.. nor have any payment information on your account profile\n\nDo NOT merchant ingame.. the art of buying low and selling high to make ingame profit would get you perma banned for trading with gold farmers\n\nDo NOT farm dungeons & bosses! you WILL get banned for botting believe me\n\nDo NOT participate in any AeriaGames Forums discussions at all.. they will ban you from the forums as well as in game for just stating a simple opinion or rant\n---\n\nI can give you a scenario of how two of my AeriaGames accounts were permanent banned for no reason:\n\nFirst account I created back around 2006 and played Grand Fantasia\n\nCreated a Wizard Character\n\nMade a two or three microtransations and bought stuff from the item mall\n\nLeveled up to 40 doing quests\n\nUpgraded all equips using alot of enhancing items from the Item Mall\n\nStayed level 40 to be within that PVP level bracket (was the best on the server at that time)\n\nBeing proooooo (no actually i was more like a P2W noob but i was good at PVP anyway) I had alot of PVP honor points saved up so i bought the level 50 PVP set\n\nBought even more enhancing stuff from the Item Mall and upgraded all of those equips, sold whatever i had left in game on the marketplace.. (I remember the Gaia Blessing or whatever its called was worth like 10k gold each at the time)\n\nLeveled to 50 to be within that PVP level bracket\n\nGot bored and quit the game for awhile\n\nFew days later I get Permanent banned for buying gold from a gold farmer?\n\nMade another account Last year to play Aura Kingdom with a friend\n\n\nWith what previously happened to my other account i decided not to spend a single penny on the game\n\nLeveled to about level 55 solo & doing quests\n\nSeen a special bonus package deal for new accounts that makes a 1st AP purchase. decided hell i'll just buy that since its less than $5\n\nLeveled up to 66 and crafted my own armor and weapon set using the materials i gained farming solo & party dungeons myself\n\nGrind was becoming hella boring, and i had no idea what the heck Sky Tower was.. so I quit the game\n\nA few months later I get suspended from the game (can not login to the game at all) due to Inactivity of Billing (note I have not made a single purchase in a couple of months, and the purchase I made in the past was NOT recurring.. Ban email message below)\n\nAlso to reply to many of the previous comments stating that the suspension is "temporary", that is not always the case, many people dont even remember their full account credentials and/or cannot recover their accounts at all.. and like i've mentioned earlier this is my SECOND account that I no longer have access to.\n\nOthers had the same problem on various occasions, and while customer support "sometimes" does help them with their problem, they end up getting banned (or suspended) AGAIN\n\nLINK: Similar problems other people had[aeriagamestruth.blogspot.ca]\n\nLINK: More Similar problems other people had[aeriagamestruth.blogspot.ca]\n\nLINK: Even More Similar problems other people had[www.centralslayers.net]\n\n\n\nAeria Games: Your account has been suspended\n\nservice@aeriagames.com - 25/03/2015\n\nTo: <my email address right here>\n\n\n\n\nDear <my account name right here>,\n\nThis is a notice of a suspension of service to this account due to billing inactivity.\n\nTo ensure the safety of your account a ban has been put in place to prevent any misuse.\n\nIf you would like to reclaim your account please send a ticket to our customer service representatives.\n\nHere is a link: https://www.aeriagames.com/contact\n\nIn order to expedite your claim we ask for you to provide the following information in your ticket.\n\nThe name of the account you are trying to reclaim\nThe email address for the account\nMost recent AP transaction history\n\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused and we look forward to assisting you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAeria Games Admin Team","May 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 901 of 1,082 people (83%) found this review helpful 100 people found this review funny","83","901","1","100","88"

It's not the perfect MMO and it caters to a specific demo, I would recommend it based on the fact that is is free to try and worth a look.\n\nPros\n- Beautiful world. The enviroments and the animals look like hand drawn anime.. the good kind. Not the cheesy cliche kind\n- Very populated with a (usually) friendly player base.\n- I thought I had to pay for the scarf around level 20 to continue the main quest line but apparently I did not need to. I think they make that a bit confusing on purpose. Other than that the F2P model is pretty good.\n- Very easy to understand and pick up and play. Nothing is overly complex and the UI and all other things surrounding gameplay make sense.\n\nCons\n- The million dollar MMORPG word.. grindy. The game is VERY kill 10 of these and collect 8 of these. They throw some curveballs in there occasionally but this is what ultimately had me stop playing in the 40s. It just stopped being fun.\n- Dungeons are repetitive cut and paste. Nothing special there for sure.\n- Didn't care for the music so I put my own ambient soundtrack to it.\n- Easy. This could go under pro or con. I didn't mind it but some will.\n\nAside from dueling I never got too much into PvP in this game so I can't really speak on that. Each class seems pretty cool and you get to pick a secondary skill along the way which helps keep combat fresh. The battle companions are cool but can get annoying with the constant dialogue thing.\n\nOverall I'm happy with the time I put into it. I'm sure it gets more fun when you are at or close to cap but I could not continue any longer. You can check out my video review in my First Impression/Final Impression videos below.

( not perfect movement but good for what it is)\n\n5. very large areas and a arrray of monsters to fight and quests to complete\n\n6. ALSO COULD BE CON! simple 1 click quest navigation allowing you to quickly get to a quest location without having to hunt for its location\n\n7.  has a great starting area and not as dull and lengthy as other starter areas.\n\nCON'S\n1.  ALSO COULD BE PRO! simple 1 click quest navigation. for those who like to explore and find what you need with a group this could ruin the experience\n\n2. very specific audience if you dont like the asthetic of anime or cartoon look then this wont be for you\n\n3. camera can be a hassle when playing for the first time and no real lock on system. would help those who cant multitask as well as others with controls\n\n4. after a while it can be a grind to complete certian quests if they are repeated quests.\n\n5. can be quite easy and no really challenge if your fighting at low levels. even at higher levels you can do most of the questing alone without a group.\n\n6.PRO/CON: certian dungeons require a group to complete allowing more co-op opportunites or a hassle if you wish to play alone\n7. in certian areas and certian times. it can strain your system and according to other users. runs porrly on certian compontents ( be sure what your pc parts are and any issues with them and the game before playing if you wish to avoid problems out the game)\n\nfor me i really enjoyed this game. alone and in the company of random people in those specific dungeons. there is no hostility and is just a blast to play for a few minutes to a few hours. i also really like this games art design and the character design ( even though there is clearly fan service) overall i would recommend you give this game a solid try and see if you enjoy it. if you like numbers on a scale i give it a 8/10  not perfect but worth a try if this game has your interest","July 4, 2014","true","8.2"," 252 of 288 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","252","288","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zweihandra/recommended/268420/","Zweihandra","[BM] Sky-Scythe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zweihandra/","16 products in account","Aura Kingdom is a fantasy anime-style MMORPG that has the player take on the role of an 'Envoy of Gaia' - a human with abilities far exceeding those of all but other Envoys. Every player is given three Eidolons throughout the story, NPC companions each with their own unique set of abilities, stats, and even personality.\n\nThe gameplay of Aura Kingdom is fairly repetitive, with hundreds of kill __ of __ and gather __ of __ quests. There is also very little 'multiplayer' as far as MMOs go. One could potentially complete every quest alongside friends rather easily, but there is little merit to doing so other than the obvious social benefits. Armour grants you stats and costumes grant minor benefits and the visual appeal. While this somewhat stifles players' creativity in creating costumes from inexpensive armours, you will also never have to walk around in a barrel. Everything is stylish and fits someone's tastes.\n\nThe level cap set at 65 (correct me if I'm wrong) the grind to 40 goes smoothly enough, with quests being the best source of EXP around. Monsters grant players VERY little EXP, usually below .15% per.\n\nNow here's the catch; this game can be quite addicting when played with friends, and there is always a fresh, shiny new set of armours and weapons waiting for you at every level milestone. Despite being an MMO, this game holds plenty of replayability to try out each class, skillsets, and offensive/defensive point spreads.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone looking for a casual game to goof around in with friends.\n\nDisclaimer This game may contain panty shots.

There's an alternative to real money stuff, the "loyalty points" are currency in-game that you can earn doing daily quest and completing achievements.\n- Eidolon system, which in my opinion adds that special thing to the game, there's a long list of 'em, some are easy to get and some take time.\n- Weekly maintenance and more content to be added in the future.\n- As every other MMORPG, events.\n\n\nCons:\n- Grindy, once you finish the main quest, you will probably get stuck in the 57-60 level area, where the only thing that you can do it's: well, dungeons, dungeons, daily quests, dungeons, and desperate a bit for that level 60.\n- Bots, yes, each of the three servers have a load of bots, also known as "the redhead army". They're just gold farming bots, who usually send you trash mail telling you to buy gold for 4 bucks.\n- Can turn boring time to time, and probably in the "57-60 area" previously descrived.\n- Lag/delay in some dungeons\n- The devs are hmmm how to descrive it, hmmm they're not bad, but they're kinda lazy, and when a problem arise most of the time they will opt for an easy solution. Note* this doesnt happen most of the time.\n- Huge risk of a rollback when an imminent issue shows. Ex. a few months ago the item mall started to work wrong, the prices were wrong, and of course people took that chance to get cheap stuff, with that done the devs just did a rollback (if you're not used to that word, a rollback it's just what it sounds) they returned the status of the server to the day before that issue happen, with that done every single player lost the items/gold/exp/levels/progress achieved that day, after that they apologized with the community and gave to every player affected by the rollback a special package and a week of 50% more drop and exp.\n","November 4, 2014","true","305.1"," 140 of 150 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","140","150","6","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaehyungKai/recommended/268420/","TaehyungKai","Taehyung","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaehyungKai/","71 products in account","REVIEW BREAKDOWN\nIn this review, I will be breaking it down to four different categories:\n-Community / Playerbase\n-Gameplay\n-Money System\n-Overall thoughts/experience\nOh, and there will be a TL;DR at the bottom as well.\n\n\nCommunity\nAura Kingdom's community throughout my experience was not exceptionally bad, although it isn't what I would consider good either. In AK, the majority of players are quiet, there are very few conversations going on in even the main cities/zones in the game unless it is due to a quest and/or event where partying is required. This issue may be due to the fact that Aeria Games, or rather, Aura Kingdom specifically is having a 'bot' problem making players (including me) feel less engaged into the world.\n\nGameplay\nEven though Aura Kingdom uses the standard MMORPG controls (who some may not prefer), the game itself was very enjoyable, the animation in each classes abilities were stunning and beautiful. Mobs and monsters in this game were each unique but some displayed the same attack patterns making it feel slightly repetititve. Also take note that AK is a extremely easy game until near endgame (lvl 60+) as well as the fact that once you DO reach endgame it is extremely slow to level which may make it feel boring due to lack of effort needed or fatigue. Overall, it uses a nicely executed combat system but Aeria Games may want to take a step up on the early difficulty.\n\nMoney System\nSo, is Aura Kingdom Pay to win or not? The answer is no, heres why;\nAlthough Aeria Games advertise themselves quite heavily as you play through, all you can really buy with the real money content are rare items or ruby coins which can be used to sell for in-game currency, gold. The rare items (such as costumes) changes your stats very insignificantly and is not different to those stats of a free costume that is earned through questing. Sure, you can buy gear with that gold you earned from spending your real money but in the end, most gear in Aura Kingdom isn't very expensive and can be earned fairly fast without even having to spend a penny on the game. I have experience on both my characters, one which I spent money on and the other I didn't, although they are different classes there aren't much difference in strength, at least not enough for me to consider Aura Kingdom pay to win.\n\nOverall\nAura Kingdom is a fun and entertaining game, it may not suit everyone but it definitely kept me satisfied with everything it is and will continue to for a long while, I have shared a lot of fun memories with my friends and people I have met on this game and although the community is fairly quiet once you find the right people, it will make the game feel so much more engaging and lively. If I were to give Aura Kingdom a rating, it would be a 8/10.\n\nTL;DR: Aura Kingdom is a fun and entertaining game to play but has its own fair share of problems such as bots and being too easy. It is not pay to win.\n\n*BRIEF EDIT (2/4/2015)*\nThis may hinder the gameplay for some and was worth mentioning, Aeria Games does a fairly poor job in terms of management when it comes to Aura Kingdom, lack of updates, unorganized events, etc.","December 27, 2014","true","150.4"," 134 of 143 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","134","143","6","4"

I read that this game is full of friendly, helpful people, so I decided to give it a try. I ended up liking the game a lot, however the opinion regarding players couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing anime style graphics\n-Skill customization - change the behavior of skills you already have\n-Gliding - fast transport around the map\n-Autopath to quest objective - regular quests have this, "hidden" quests do not. You will find both on all the maps.\n-Creative missions - take control of npc during a main quest\n-Achievements system - you get them for just about every quest you do. The names are creative and it makes the game more fun\n-Sub class system - lets you mix 2 classes together for greater variety\n-Pets - called Eidelons, they contribute to your damage significantly and you can swap them around based on the situation to take advantage of their special abilities.\n\nCons:\n-Bot heaven - the review I read stated 99/100 players are friendly and helpful. The truth is, 99/100 players are bots. They are complete clones of each other with the same naming convention, yet nobody seems to care about it. You find them everywhere, not difficult to get 5-10 on your screen at a time.\n-Players - virtually everoyone ignores you completely. Those that do not only see you as a resource, not a person. There is a system of "loyalty" points and guild points so people only friend you so they can click a greeting button on you once a day for loyalty or that you farm guild points for their benefit. Beyond that, you mean nothing\n-Lag - you feel it in every slightly crowded area or town. This is especially noticable with delay on jumping/gliding\n-Character appearance - some could say there is a lack of options for character customization. I haven't really run into lookalike characters yet except for bots that all look the same.\n-Class balance - some classes are seriously overpowered, just about all players agree on who those are (Ravagers, even after a nerf they are still the most dominant by far)\n\nConclusion: If you have friends to play with, this game is pretty fun and enjoyable. If you do not and are not a solo player, don't bother, you won't get any help around here.","February 20, 2015","true","54.1"," 149 of 167 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","149","167","11","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lainverse/recommended/268420/","lainverse","[x] lainverse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lainverse/","4329 products in account","In general I have two things to say about this game:\n\n* it's nice looking anime-styled and not oversexualized game;\n\n* it turns incredibly boring when you get to level 55.\n\nI managed to crawl to level 66 btw and raised a few alts to 50-55… just for more grind.\n\n~~~\nTL;DR: If you like anime and repetitive grind - this game is for you. If you only like anime then try to enjoy the story during your quest to The Level 55 great barrier. Don't forget to make a few screenshots of rich players at Navea when you get there. Then kill it with fire before it became too boring to play.\n~~~\n\nUnfortunately, this game has almost no quests which you may want to bother to read and the vast majority of them are mundane kill and fedex. There are a couple of oddballs, but they are rare and clunky. They don't feel like they belong here. After level 55 it's non-stop grindfest and repeating of the same dungeons over and over again. Every single day. Especially if you want to get some rare Eidolons. Every 5-10 levels a few "new" areas will open for you. Did I say "new"? I meant you will be revisiting the same areas with different enemies on your way. Due to that game looks cheap. All locations in the game are small, low detailed, and reused on every possible occasion. It's especially easy to see in the daily fame quests. The game pulls 5 random quests out of 40 every day for you, but there are only 5 or 6 different maps! You just start from a different point and different enemies may crawl around (fixed for each quest). Even "urgent" event quests reuse the same maps! Near the end of 2014 they added guild dungeon system and you think what? They've reused existing maps again! They just placed invisible walls around some spots on the low-level maps and called them dungeons. You can even get out of these areas by jumping and walk through empty from players and NPCs versions of low-level villages.\n\nYet another massive fun-stopper in this game is exploration part. Collision boxes for many world objects are just wrong. They stop you from flying over the small bumps, streams and all kinds of chasms. Have fun getting out of the city in Demarech Mines or Ventos Praire or just try to walk under the bridge in the Vulture's Vale. They don't exist where you expect them to be or just much less detailed and stands far from the visible object boundaries. See that chimney? Jump on top of... 1 meter above the chimney invisible floor. See that roof? Oh wait we are in the house now. In an odd way. You can glide to traverse locations faster, but you will hit invisible walls just everywhere. That's another reason why this game looks cheap.\n\nNow add to that autopilot for almost all quests in the game and absurd storyline. Soon you will notice that you don't really play the game. You just click on the quest objectives to get to the location and repeating the same attack pattern like a bot. Why? Just to get through the next area and reach a higher level.\n\nAh, right, bots. You will see A LOT of them running around and 1 or 2 in-game spam emails with proposition to buy some gold for money will greet you every single day. Well, at least it tells that the game isn't dead yet. Someone still bothers to buy it after all, even though it's bannable.\n\nDid we finally reach the PvP section of this review? Well, PVP is not even broken. It has to be implemented in the first place to be broken. It's slapped on top of PvE and completely imbalanced and having so many classes does not help to balance it at all. It's hard to balance even 3-5 classes and we have more than a dozen here! Also, it's limited only to PVP arena and occasional duels if someone will accept them. Do you think you can go to the arena at any moment? You can't be more wrong. Well, it won't be that bad if PvE and exploration parts would be fun.\n\nAh, btw, everything in this game is bound to timers. Eidolons spawns at the guild hall at specific hours every day. PvP arenas (there are a few different types) open and close by the timer. All dungeons resets by timer and you have only 1 entry at the top difficulties before the next reset which will happen in around 6 hours. Have fun getting rare Eidolons and items. Fish kings spawn only at specific hours and world bosses too. And on the top of that standing Sky Tower which is open only 6 times during the weekend. And you can enter it only once per day with the same character. So, you need to have at least 3 high-level characters with a good gear if you wish to run it 6 times. And it doesn't really worth to do so due to incredibly bad drop rates. It's 1.5-2 hours run for 40 people and it's likely that not even one will get anything from it. And all these timers are intersecting. So, you always will have to miss one event to go to another.\n\nI had a little fun in the beginning, but then I realized that the game turned into a work. Dull and boring work which only eats my time and doesn't make me happy (or make me feel any other emotion besides frustration). At some point, I started to think that the whole point of this game is to get Kotonoha and make her wear less modest dress through thousands of hours of grindfest. Well, you can speed up this process with money a bit (or just waste them for nothing depending on your luck).\n\nAnother problem is The Word Filter. It seems broken or just way too simple since it detects "a s s" in the "glasses" and "class". And many other "rude" words in the middle of completely normal. Try to write "Titanus" in the chat (dungeon boss name). It will be completely blocked since it consists of "t i t" and "a n u s"! It even breaks item names and links to items in the chat making it impossible to show some of them there.\n\nGood sides of this game:\n\n* It isn't straight pay to win.\n\nThat doesn't mean you won't need a lot of gold to get your gear and get it to its full potential, but you can get this money in the game. In a few months or rather... Years. -_-\n\n* It's nice and cute looking. Especially some of the Eidolons.\n\nYet most of the best Eidolons are either incredibly rarely or available only in the store for real money. I got 1 fragment out of 10 for Endora and 1 for some other rare during my gameplay and I did a lot of runs through high-level dungeons for that.\n\n* Community is rather nice and friendly.\n\nBTW, it actually amuses me to look at all the people coming here in the comments section enraged by the fact that I downvoted the game which I played for so long. I'm almost sure it's better than endgame in the actual game.","January 5, 2015","false","794.1"," 242 of 338 people (72%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","72","242","338","57","43"

CLASS IS IN SESSION (lol puns am I right)!\n\nYou got your Guardians, your Magicians, your Bards, your Ravagers... OH IT'S SIMPLY SPLENDID! Each class chooses a subclass at level 40! I always thought that your 40s were a time of crisis but not in this reality! Party up with a group of friends and you'll have a blast!\n\nQuesting is super duper party snooper until you reach 50s which are still okay but then there's level 60 and KABLAMO! You're stuck at 60 years young for quite some time unless you got the skills and the will to survive...\n\nSOCIAL LINKS SOCIAL LINKS SOCIAL LINKS SOCIAL LINKS\n\n"How do I make friends?"\nThanks for asking Jenny, before you get down to business to defeat the Huns you'll want a neato pateeto party of cutie patootie warriors! However many people give you the cold shoulder in this world. All three servers will have their share of antisocials, regulars and over the top bards with strange tendencies to touch your thighs and such. Chimera is the big boy, filled to the brim with peeps, but not a peep can be heard from many of them! Siren is my homeland, a middle ground where less people live but still a large enough amount, and then Hydra is a server full of jolly alts and such, a level 1 on Hydra could have 600 lvl 80 characters hidden away. Spooky? Loominarty confirmed lel jk don't get spooked now!\n\nA good way to really make chums is by joining a guild. Guilds grant a lovely exp bonus and plenty of fun events to bring your show and tell objects to. e.g. Guardian Angels (Shameless plug) or jimmies Wonderboys (might not be real). Guild members can form parties with ease, teach eachother techniques and all that bizzle AND THE BEST THING IS THAT IF YOU SPAM GUILD CHAT THEY'LL HAVE TO TALK TO YOU! HOORAY!\n\nGRAPHICS\neyy der gud, if ya like animoo. Actually you don't need to like anime at all I suppose, the style is PRETTY FLY without straining a low end computer with the terrain deets. The monsters are pretty goofy sometimes but hey, what ya gonnas do about it tough guy? That's what I thought. If you like TF2 or Sanctum it's sort of along those lines! UNDERSTAND!? OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!\n\nTHE WARNING\nListen here chap or chappete, don't touch the store, especially the paragon table if you value your life. The lucky packs, roulettes and all that goobertron can  get you addicted hardcore! Vegeta what does the scouter say about my spending spree? YOU SPENT OVER 9000 pounds on a hat! WHAT 9000? DARN YOU LUCKY PACKS!\n\nOverall I r8 8/8 k no memes involved I love this game despite the lack of middle ground between easy levelling and impossible levelling ya dig? Also yes I like cosmetics and such because I'm such a nerd when it comes to armour GEEZ get off my back, you're not my mamma!

Single click auto-pathing for quests, lots of unique little things to participate in, ability to skip quest dialog, full featured minimap will click to move, no need to loot after monster kills, etc. The user interface is refined and has a lot of nice little features not seen in the larger MMOs. The improvements make the game easy to understand and play.\n\nThe game is definately targeted for the casual player. It has nice graphics and sound, but a lot of the improvements are focused around making the game fast and easy to play. Unlike so many other MMOs, you get a mount very early on. You should be level 10 and have one toolbar of skills, a mount, and your companion, within an hour or two of starting the game.\n\nYou get to choose your companion when you create your character, and there are seven different choices. Each one has different skills and focuses - one may be a healer and another a warrior type. The companion is similar in functionality to SWTOR companions, but you can even have little conversations with them.\n\nYou gain new skills (based on the class you choose) as you level automatically, and you have character improvement tileset. You gain one improvement point every three levels. I call it a tileset because its not a tree, your starting point is in the middle of all of the tiles and you can pick improvement tiles moving outward in any direction.\n\nThe in game store items seem a little expensive compared to other games. They have plenty of various cheap or expensive items, but just for comparison: 75 cents for a 20% xp boost for 60 minutes, $5 for a 20% xp boost for 24 hours play time (24 hours of played time, not calendar time so it will last multiple days), $50 for a unique mount that is 60% movement speed, if you buy 4 of them you can combine them into a 90% mount. For $15 you can get an item that gives you a 24 hours of 50%/25% monster/quest xp boost. I like the play time versus day time system, because it discourages afks and it is aimed at the casual player who might play one or two days a week. So if you play around 5 or 6 hours a week, the $15 boost will last you about a month.\n\nYou can purchase XP books from the store that instantly give amounts of XP, 29 cents for a book that gives the equivalent of 20 monster kills of your level. You can buy the in-game cash shop currency in $5, $10, $25 etc increments. They also have spending "tier" rewards per month, as you reach higher tiers you get greater free rewards. The first two spending tiers are at $5 and $15. Purchases go through the Steam Store so you don't have to visit another website.\n\nOverall it is a very refined game with a lot of features and a better UI that is not found in today's larger MMOs. The cash shop is optional but the enticement to buy XP outright, or buy timed XP boosts will always be tempting - but "free" games are not free to build and run by the companies that make them and they need to make a profit.","November 2, 2014","true","10.4"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","40","47","3","0"

You can join a raidcall and within a minutes make friends. In the actual game you do busy work until level 60 where you can finally start to do something entertaining. However, after 65, the leveling gap really becomes apparent. at level 70, an entire run of dungeons gets you roughly 1 percent of your current level and less so the higher the level. Also with the rarity of the drops. You either have luck, or stop playing you are waisting time. This game is based on luck on time. If you don't have both of those, don't play. 124.3 hours in game in the past two weeks got me nothing of use from dungeons, high level monsters, high level anything.\n\nNow that my rant is over, in all seriousness:\nPros:\nVery friendly community\nWeekly updates\nTeamwork oriented\n\nCons:\nVery time consuming\nVery luck based (you need to be very lucky)\nProgessively large xp and level gaps (One size fits all)\nFoot in the door type currency systems (difficult to make money, items are usually very expensive, unless you have a sugar momma/daddy, refer to Cons 1 & 2)\nVery difficult to get level up armour and weapons (Cons 1, 2 & 3)\n"OP" Idolizing (You are either over powered, or weak and if so, be useless, refer to cons 1, 2, 3 &4)\nNot much "OOMPH" to be felt from this game, not a lot of energy to take away with.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxtribe/recommended/268420/","foxtribe","foxtribe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxtribe/","37 products in account","Graphics: 10/10\nThe graphics are by far the best part of the game in my opinion. The game looks lush and explorable. At times more explorable than it actually is. It looks like you really CAN go more than two minutes into the ocean without bumping into an invisible wall! (of course you can't though, the invisible wall is very much there. ;D) Each place looks unique and beautiful.\nI'm in love with the style as well. Anime styles can often go wrong, especially in games, but this one is the good kind of anime, not the cheesy kind. The characters are cute and vibrant, and just look plain good.\nThere is a lot of eye candy here!\n\nCustomization: 8/10\nThe customization at the beginning of the game is average. 10 or so hair choices and eye choices with colors to go along with them. You can choose your class (all of them play very similarly by the way) and skin color. The classes aren't gender locked which I liked very much.\nI would have liked to have sliders for things such as height, weight, and length of hair. If you'd like a shorter or chubbier character you're out of luck. I also would have liked to be able to choose the bangs and back of hair seperate. There are many hair styles that I only liked the front or back of.\nYou are going to look cute no matter what you choose but it could use some more options. You will find characters that look just like you.\n\nGameplay: 5/10\nThis is where the game goes wrong. I've heard it was too easy, but I didn't think I would mind. I've enjoyed plenty of easy games, such as Kirby and Pokemon but this isn't just the 'leveling up too fast' easy. This is the 'holding your hand throughout the entire game' easy. You can literally press a button for any quest and be guided to wherever you need to go without moving your character at all. The character is drawn by a shining path and you can just sit back, relax, have a soda, and watch your character move for you. Kind of ruins the point of a "game", eh?\n\nQuests: 3/10\nI'm not very far in the game yet, but the quests are already pushing me away. They are painfully generic. A couple of "Kill these bad guys for a reward" quests are fine in an MMO, but those kinds of quests are ALL this game has. Every single quest is nearly exactly the same. Expect a whole lot of "Sure...I can help you...but first you need to kill 10 sheep for me." And when you finish the quest they will tell you that another person could help you and they will ask you to do something very similar. The loop goes on.\nOne thing that annoyed me is that the things they ask you to kill aren't even bad. Most of them are animals that seem docile and don't harm you unless you harm them. Seems a bit unfair...\n\nStory: 4/10\nAverage MMO story. You most likely won't get attached to any of the characters and won't care about the story much. Overall pretty boring.\n\nSound: 4/10\nRepetitive, and unmemorable.\n\nRecommendation:\nMy opinion may change, but so far I can't really recommend this game. The graphics are gorgeous, but the gameplay is awfully generic and boring. If you are in love with the graphics however, and want to become the amazing OP anime character you dream of, you should give this game a try! I'd say just download the game, play it for a couple of hours, and toss it if you aren't interested. After all, it is free right?","July 10, 2014","false","7.9"," 80 of 120 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","80","120","0","6"

The reason they put 'billing inactivity' is because they don't have updated just yet their reasons to be more clear towards us and it needs time to get updated :P\n\nDev Message:Then i gone to ask about those negative reviews about the billing inactivity reasons and thats what they told me:\nAbout the numerous negative Steam reviews. You may or may not be aware that we ban accounts for inactivity in order to protect them from unauthorized access. However, many of our ex-players don't know that and they think that they're getting banned because they're not purchasing AP (the ban message says the reason is "billing inactivity"). Instead of contacting us, so we can remove their bans they choose to badmouth us wherever they can. I don't think that our ban policy will change soon, but we will look for ways to inform them better about their ban situation.\nEnd of Line / Last Thoughts:\nThe game might get boring for some and repetitive, but i don't count on it so much. It could get some more love towards some mechanics and on its graphics if it can be done.\n\nOverall the game seems really nice, has potential and would recommend it to give it a try and see if you like it.\n\nAlthough this review is all my opinion, others may vary with different point of view.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=689908759","May 22","true","52.4"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

I'm enjoying this game, nice and addictive MMO, but feels boring sometimes. Here's the point.\n\nPros :\n- Nice anime style. It's cute btw.\n- There's a loli waiting for you.\n- Not-so-really Pay to Win, IMO.\n- Loyalty Point, which let you buy items from the item mall.\n\nCons :\n- Bot, bot, bot, bot, bot, bot, and bot.\n- Repetitive quest. (Well, it's a MMO, so don't expect too much about it.)\n- Too grindy.\n- Monsters, some dungeons and some weapons were copy-paste and the only difference is their colors.\n- And more bots for you.\n\nNeutral :\n- The soundtrack is good, but a bit repetitive.\n- Community is so.. err.. quiet? Though I don't really care because there's no spamming chat, this is may be a problem for new players to ask something about the game. But don't worry, just ask in the trade channel, they will answer you. Or find and join an active + friendly guild.\n\nMy personal rating? 8.5/10. Do I recommend this to you? Yes, give it a shot, at least.","September 30, 2014","true","036.5"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","24","28","4","0"

(i tested all the first 30-40 levels)\n-after level 40 (i think it was 40 but it can be a little bit more or less) you can choice a second class for combine it to create your playstyle\n-2-3 classes from this are better for each first class because you become 3 extra skills from the combination but you can play every class with every class you want (not the second class as first class... i mean you can´t play with bow and bow or something)\n-good balanced skill-cooldowns\n-you can dodge heavy attacks with movement! (it´s not to hard)\n-the community is good (i didn´t read a lot of flame or other bad stuff in chat like in other MMORPGs)... i don´t speak from the steamcommunity because i only have the experience from before this game was on steam\n-I like the petsystem (pets are called eidolons) because they are very usefull for fighting/buffs/healing and you can upgrade they\n-You can play the game and watch Videos in high quality or other things at the same time because the game don´t need a lot of ressources from hardware (at maximum settings) and you don´t need a good internet to play it without laggs\n-You can become with quests/loot/buy in shops a lot of dekoration items for your character (on the left side at the top from the minimap you can find a boosymbol, click on that and you can search all dekorationitems, eidolons[pets] or other items and you can see how they look)\n-groupfinder for dungeons (this made it easy to find a group for a dungeon)\n-you can find a list of events at a symbol near the minimap and with that you can see at wich time you can join a event\n\n\nNeutral: -the questingsystem is standart like in the most other MMORPGs (only a very few of all have a diffrent questingsystem)\n-no mana... i´m not 100% sure this is good or not because this made it easy... but maybe to easy?!?\n-the game is buggy because it´s a open beta but it´s very able to play and so much better as other open betas from MMORPGs in the last time (the most of them was terrible and realy not worth to play a long time)\n-the tutorial that you must play with every char is very short and that´s good\n-the cashshop is it not realy worth to buy things from it because you can become all things from loyalty points or trading with other players and that´s why i think the game is able2play and not pay2play\n\n\nNegativ: -you can´t play together with guys they are don´t play with steam because the servers are diffrent\n-the graphic looks not up2date on highest settings(i´m not very intressted in high quality grafics but for other guys this is maybe negativ thing)\n-the choice in charactercreation is very small because you have only 1 race (human), the choice between male/female, few complete faces/haircuts/eyecolors/haircolors and the charname. That´s all.\n-you must play the tutorial with every new char\n-tradechat=allchat... it exist a item to write in allchat but this consumable and so write all player in tradechat\n-it exist few spammbots but they exist\n-future forecast: the game is from aeria games and it´s free2play -> the support from all this games is bad and slow -> that´s good for hacker and bad for all other player -> updates will be small and they will don´t fix bugs fast -> that´s very good for hacker and bugabuser -> negative reputation and leaving players (the future looks dark and i think it´s not a game that you can play for ever if you want a real good and fair game... but i think you can have fun with it for months)\n\n\nI think i forget a lot of things but i will complete my review later and i hope it was helpful for you.\nAnd things they i don´t tested in my playtime are: guildsystem, PvPsystem and a lot of events.\n\n-Edits-\nPro: -look at the eventtimer and you will see when you can join a event like quiz or something.\n-you can change your second class now with a item from the shop or buy it from other players. it´s not to expensive.\n\nNeutral: -the lategame is grinding dungeons and daily quests for leveling. it need more time to creat new quests for lategame\n-they bring a new class into the game that´s called samurai. it´s a very strange class that mixed meele and range. it is the only class that i never want to play again because the swordstance don´t looks like the real swordstance from a samurai and the playstyle is bad. a lot of other guys write the same ingame and only few like this class. the class is very defective at the moment and the skills need bugfixes because you can interrupt your own skills or the skilldamage and other things they are negativ for you if you play this class. (this is neutral because you don´t need to play it and this class isn´t overpowered)\n\nNegativ: -the gameforum is very confused because the mods are don´t put the right threads into the right forum sections\n-the pvp feels strange because it has fixed times for joining. so you can´t play pvp if you want and that means you must want pvp if it´s possible or you can´t play it(that means not the duell function).\n-the pvp is unbalanced and need much more patches for being fair and the matchmaking looks very random. in other MMORPGs it´s much better but i know that it´s only in a very few good.\n-if you change the map it clears the chat. so you must be sure every time you want to change the map that other don´t write to you in loading screen (because you will never be able to see it) or short time before and you must be sure that you don´t want to read the chat from this map. (groupchat and other chats are cleared too)\n-if the server crash you will don´t be able to play the game for longer time... the last time as the server crashed we must wait 2 days to play the game.","July 4, 2014","true","0.4"," 84 of 133 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","84","133","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subxerozia/recommended/268420/","subxerozia","Xerozia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subxerozia/","437 products in account","I've played dozens of Anime stlye MMO's over the years, and some are similar, some are different. What usually defines how that game is not like all the others tends to usually fall into one major gimmick per game.\n\nIn Aura Kingdom that would be known as the 'Eidolon' system.\n\nBasically it's your own pet that fights with you. They're core in the game and are not too hard to obtain.\n\n(This review is based on a few things. I have two characters. One lvl 50 and one level 30. I have yet to do the more 'lategame' stuff like high level dungeons. As of this review I've clocked around 40 hours.)\n\nThe main points of the game, you decide if it's good or bad.\n\n- Quests are heavy and pretty much constant till you hit lvl 48. There is no monster grinding whatsoever and leveling is fast.\n- Even though there are parties, questing is pretty much a solo thing and instances need to be done solo.\n- The classes and skills are quite different and unique.\n- Appearance is based on global costumes rather than class related armor.\n- There seems to be class imbalances at the current time of the game. So far my Ravager (which is considered more AoE) has bested duelists of my level.\n- There is no MP (as far as I can tell) in the game, letting mages spam.\n- There is a need to kite enemy spells as they can be dodged by movement and skills, meaning there is a bit more skill in some mob fighting.\n- All classes, even the support types like Bard are capable of solo questing and don't need to depend on parties.\n- Gaining decent items at earlier levels is not too hard provided you know your way around the market and auction area.\n- Mobs spawn back really fast so dont worry about AoE mob stealers or KSers.\n- Gaining 'Bonus EXP' is fairly simple with parties. EXP is not split between members however - making Power Leveling unapparent.\n- There is quite a number of bots who auto follow quests since going from place to place is REALLY easy.\n- High number of 'grindy' collection quests which require this or that killed/collected. This is countered by the decent drop rate. Seems to be around 60%.To collect 5 eggs from birds you usually have to kill around 10 or less.\n- Eidolons are quite handy in a solo game like this. They're easy to level up.\n- You can glide.\n- Characters have very little stats to customise due to lack of MP related stats.\n- Subclasses can be obtained to make your character even more unique.\n- There are tons of daily and hidden quests for you to find if you really want to.\n- There is an achievement system for those who like to collect.\n\nA review of the basics:\n-Very story driven.\n-Leveling is easy.\n-Classes are unique.\n-Easy to understand GUI.\n-Easy quest system.\n-More of a solo-ish game.\n\nMy personal experience:\nGot to level 40 on my first day because I have no life. Made a guild with my real life friends. There wasn't much interaction till 1 daily quest and there still isnt. It's been 5 days and I only just got to level 50. Im slowly starting to get bored of the monotony now, at this level there are around 10 quests of collection and killing ♥♥♥♥ and you don't even ge to the next level. I'm gerenally a fickle person with my MMOs, I play things until there's too much repetition because I don't have the patience for that and the novelty of the game wears off when that happens.\n\nMy Ravager makes quick work of nearly all mobs and I dont require the use of a potion due to my innate tankiness and the fact I have a DMG/CRIT type. The only problem I face is soloing boss monsters which tend to mow me down quite fast and actual skill is required to kill them though kiting (which is a good thing). My sorcerer pretty much is a spam machine that doesn't even compare to my Ravager.\n\n\nBased on:\n40 hours, 2 characters (50, 30), Ronin patch.\n\nVerdict:\nWorth a shot for anyone into MMORPGs, especially for those trying to learn it. the quest tracker makes lives simple for those learning about these type of games and all NPC chat doesn't need to be read to know what's going on.\n\nFor more reviews check out my website:\nExplicitly Honest.[www.explicitlyhonest.com]\n","July 11, 2014","true","37.7"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","3"

More things unlock at 66, 70, 75, 76, and so forth in this pattern.\n\nThe Eidolons are cool looking but are weak unless you can manage to get literally every form of buff for them; 3 star evolution, 3 star their wish requirements, strong accessories. The best eidolons are often requiring real money to get, or a lot of work in game to even attempt towards getting before that eidolong related item becomes unavailable again.\n\nSky Tower is basically only way to get certain items and those require a good raiding team. Join a popular guild, and that's basically your only hope of getting said items.\n\nThe community is on all ends of the spectrum, but the worst are the loli lovers or open pedo's. Have meet a few normal people from the game but it's like needle in a haystack of finding them.\n\nOverall: 7/10\nThey could do better and it's more clear of that the longer that you play. Mainly community management needs improving, the market needs leveled out from pay to win, and could fix the leveling system for higher levels past 65.

( Quit the match they will eat you alive )\n\nWell, If you do however manage to find a nice welcoming guild with senpai's who are willing to help you out, you will find that this game is really wonderful to play, the anime style graphics that allows you to peek at your own toons pantsu...  oops i mean the fast pace style of the game will surely keep you coming back for more, despite that some people had stated that the repetitive grinding is one of the biggest turn down, i would like to differ by saying as a warbow i loved the way on how i was able to kite so many mobs, running while shooting them with movement speed of 200 same could be said in playing wizards and gunslingers. i love kiting.\n\nOverall despite a bot army and terrible human community plus insane server lag, i would still recommend Aura Kingdom\n( purely because of the loli's and waifu's ) for it has a fun and fulfilling style of gameplay.\nHey, it's free so why not try it out.\nI'd still give it a 6 out of 10 score.   6 / 10\n\nP.S i hate fishing , digging , cooking","August 20, 2015","true","195.4"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","67","41","61","17","3"

You can go solo in this game no problem, the difficult in this game seem fake.\n2: Like number 1, the parting in this game seem a little pointless, just only a little XP boost and only for small potion of duns but the rest its pretty much pointless.\n3:This game is grindy, very grindy but not a grind-fest. All mission is just kill these and gather that over and over but you progess very easy in this game and don't really need to do subs or anything to level up really, just doing your main you progress just fine so results of it gets pretty boring quickly.\n\n\nDo I reccomand this game? I say just give it a try, I don't play it much but I like it, I'm trying to slow down in this game cause I tend to get pretty bore of it fast.

If you can read Trad chinese go play on the Taiwan servers, US servers are unbearable to say the least.\n\nThe review will be for the US servers.\n\nServers are very laggy if your not near or in the US. 1 ~ 10 minute delays if you dont disconnect. as of 12/12/15. Peak hours (for bots) you can't interact with npcs tp gates etc for about 10 ~ 30mins. Server merges only worsened the problem, this only further caused the low player base to decay.\n\nI play this from the launcher rather than from steam, I can say i have at least 2k hours on the game.\n\nAeria games is just a failure in game management, it has come to the point that people that love the game (for its art style) looks for bugs in the game. Meanwhile Aeria is just sitting there waiting for XLegends to do everything for them. If only this game came out under another company, it would have had a bright future ahead of it.\n\n1 Prime example is failure to uphold its founder pack promises, they were not cheap. The handful of founders left still playing are also leaving due to this. As a company they will try to squeeze every penny they can from you, once they do they just toss you aside, in this case it was the founders. After they paid $550, with the uncertainty the game will even make it through to release, their exclusive content is now being released to non-founders for free. Other physical contents were unable to be given to the players, AG then tried to sweep it under the rug by giving players conpensation ingame.\n\nRNG in game is like entering a lottery for a trillion dollars. They try to use that as a way of enticing players to spend real money(for boosters that do jack all), meanwhile this pertpetuates the botting problem as buying gold from bots are WAAAYYYY~ cheaper and you 100% get the item. Thus the cycle continues with rarer and rarer drops while bots get more and more revenue to continue botting.\n\nPlayer to bots ratio? About 1 : 3. If you take the fact that most players have 5+ characters you can basically take the ratio down to a 1 : 10.\n\nContent between lvl 1 ~ 50 is basically a SP game with 1 daily multi-player dungeon worth doing, takes 2 mins. Gear doesn't  matter.\nContent between lvl 50 ~ 66 is paced nicely with reasonable grinding times to lvl and gain items. Gears start to matter.\nContent between lvl 66 ~ 70, phew, grindy to say the least. Gears is the key to be able to do party dungeons.\nContent from lvl 70 onwards, its world record grind fest with RNG that is basically non-existent. Don't expect to make it into a party for dungeons in this lvl range unless you have end game gears. Back to being an SP game except now theres not even a story, as the gap between quests get bigger there is less to nothing that keeps the player going, other than the thread of hope that they might win the lottery.\n\nYou basically cannot reach the end game stage without spending most of your time on the game (6 characters doing all the dungeons every 3 hrs impossible to do all the ones that reset, across the span of a half a year to say the least), playing merchant for about half a year if your lucky, buying gold from bots, or buying AP (Aeria Points) with real money. Paragon table a lottery table where you roll items, is nicknamed the scam table. People have spent 500k RC (each roll is 200RC) on it and failed to obtain anything aside from junk and emeralds. Emeralds let you roll at the table some more, the results are similar to the ones using RC.\n\nIf your new to the MMORPG style, try TERA the RNG is acutally reasonable and it has an awesome auto match making function for dungeons that balances your team.\n\nMain reason people play this is for the anime like art style, Eidolons (grindfest v 1.1) unique art style, nothing noteable other than that. Sad to see a game with such a unique art style die because it landed in the hands of a worthless company.","September 7, 2015","false","255.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

First, you start out with a class (really just a weapon, but y'know), and a follower called an Eidolon. As you progress through the game, you can improve your starting Eidolon, or get ones that are way better. Each one has different skills and interacts with your character in various ways. At lvl 50, you can choose a second weapon, either one that makes your character way better at the niche that it has, or one that rounds it out better.\n\nCONS:\nStaffing - Pretty nil. Oftentimes, the serious reports aren't handled for a long time, while most things minor that happen when a staff is on will get handled right away, resulting in a ban. However, unlike most of the top reviews say, you won't likely get banned for the stupid stuff they say you are unless you are just doing it right in front of a mod, which is overall stupid.\nPvP - The game is advertised as PvE, and it really lives up to that. But if you like PvP, then you might be dissapointed by this game.\n\nTL;DR Good game, has good graphics and a decent story, but some of the people aspects could use some work.","April 14","true","6.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The character designs immediately call to mind Magic Knight Rayearth; fashion is pretty and elaborate with lots of frills on display, hair is long and available in a variety of fanciful colors, and all swords are huge. Combat is pretty easy to learn, each weapon type has some kind of small gimmick that helps to keep squashing the various adorable monsters roaming the world from becoming stale quickly. A similarly easy to learn fishing mini-game is also worked in, with its own equipment and interface. Cosmetic gear is entirely seperated from statistic-granting combat gear, leading to the situation whereby your character can look like pretty much whatever you want without impacting the ability to fight effectively.\nThis is the kind of game where there's no dungeon finder, but 14 seperate dance emotes. Where new abilities are learned automatically on level up or are chosen for free, straight from the character info window, and are re-chosen with fairly minimal penalty the same way. It's a very soothing kind of game, great for mellow, casual players or people just getting acquainted with online games.\n...In summary, if you spend most of your time foaming at the mouth and screaming into a headset mic about why your last raid wipe or lost ranked match was everyone else's fault, give this one a pass.

You will not enjoy this at all if you dislike any of the aforementioned.\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with this game. I have been playing since Chimera server release, and at first loved it dearly, as it was one of my first actual MMOs. Also, it was after watching Sword Art Online, which got me into this "binge" feeling for MMORPGs. Any new player to the MMORPG scene would probably enjoy this game a lot, as it provides a general experience of an MMORPG.\n\n\nPros:Very friendly to newcomers. There are tutorials for just about everything - but oh sweet jeebuz, the voices.\nGraphics are beautiful; if you're into anime-styled characters with big boobs and badass swords - you'll probably enjoy this game.\nMany classes to choose from - you'll never get bored from the multitude of choices. I have levelled many characters to a certain point (50-60) and have enjoyed all but one.\nSub-classes: Some MMORPGs do not provide this experience. You will use two classes as your setup, but can be hard deciding if you have never played the other classes, as there is such a wide variety.\nThe first time through the game is crazy - it can be hard keeping up with all the skills you're offered, and all the different potential combat variation. Of course, you can set a 1-2-3 routine if that's how you like it - but I personally enjoy mixing it up a bit.\nQuesting with friends can be fun as the points for killing X mob counts for the both of you. This can lead to faster questing, if you are both killing different mobs at a time.\nGliding and mounts. Gliding is normalized unless you get enchantment cards of some sorts that provide faster gliding speed; however, the MOUNTS are the real pro here. Mounts are organized by 30%, 60%, and 90% speeds. There are no flying mounts, and they cannot be used in combat.\nCosmetics! Probably my favorite part about this game is the variation in cosmetics. Most of it is only available through the cash shop or AP tiered spenders - however, you can easily obtain these costumes through gold usage on the Auction House. Do note that brand new costumes are extremely expensive and will not be available to a player making minimal amounts of money.\nMore on the cosmetics - most of the "orange" items can be dyed different colors. This leads to lots of variation in one costume, having a multitude of colors to choose from on multiple locations of the costume.\nThe community. For the most part, the community is actually pretty good in this game. There are a ton of guilds for players of all levels, and most veterans welcome newcomers with open arms. Possibly one of the better communities out of most MMOs I've played.\nEidolons - I love how many there are, and that you can "evolve" them like Pokémon, so-to-speak. Collecting them is hard, and some are unobtainable (look at "cons" section).\n\n\n\nCons:The cash shop. Do not let anyone fool you by saying this game is NOT pay-to-win. There ARE fortifications on the cash shop. There are many items on there that will make AP (their money/site currency) users much stronger than you.\nX-Legend is not known for their PvP in games. The PvP is very, very unbalanced - some classes are ridiculously overpowered and very little is changed (such as sleep timers - Sorcerer) to reduce some classes from being extremely overpowered.\nBots are running about all over. It feels like they are slowly diminishing, but that could just be the fact I am used to seeing them everywhere. Then again, most MMOs in general have a lot of bots farming for in-game currencies to sell online.\nVery grindy. Themepark. If you dislike grinding the same dozen or so dungeons; I HIGHLY recommend you stay away. You will not like this game after levelling.\nAhh; levelling. The quests are merely kill ___ mob ___ times; collect ___ from ___ mob; collect ___ plant ___ times. Very repetitive and tedious quests with the rare occurance of an actual plot.\nThe story is... meh. This is not a game for people who want to be immersed whatsoever. The "role-playing" feel you got from Vanilla WoW - yea, that's not here.\nPatches are very slow. We get classes that the Taiwan version gets around 6-8 months later, and actual content comes in around the same pace.\nThe translations aren't perfect, but if you aren't reading the story this is not a very big deal to you. Although, some of the skills have awkward wordings and can be rather confusing.\nEidolons -  Many of them are unobtainable without the cash shop "RNG" boxes, or getting the key fragments from the AP tiered spenders. The drop rates on some of the eidolons are so ridiculously low that getting one without the cash shop/tiered spender is extremely rare (I'm looking at you, Tsubaki).\n\nOVERALL, I do recommend this MMORPG. I had a blast, and still come back to it every few months and go at it again. The instances are always fun to run through again and remembering old times. Just note that the game is a themepark and generally does not offer much else to do other than instances.\n\nI hope my review helped you as an individual decide on whether or not you are going to play this game or not Feel free to add me on Steam and message me any questions you may have about the game. I will give you the honest truth; not a biased opinion like some of the other reviews I have read on here.","April 13, 2015","true","603.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The combat's servicable enough except there's no strategy in regards positioning in any class not focused with ranged attacks. When executing an ability it locks you in place (or into the animation) until it's finished, with only being able to auto-attack while moving.  Many of the quests you'll be doing consist of clicking on the objective to set a path you can auto-follow to just talk to NPCs, which is where more than half of your experience comes from, instead of quests oriented with combat. In a bizzare mechanic about the game I noted, gliding to objectives was actually faster than using mounts, even though it's not automatic. When you hit Level 35, which will take roughly 15 hours, and have access to trading there's no real incentive to truding to higher levels aside from the class progression.\n\nThe soundtrack has one or two songs that stand out whilst the other's fufill their purpose, and the game fairs well enough graphically. The community's rather friendly and the customer support was relatively quickly when I needed my pass code to be reset, but I've had no experience with the paid aspect of the game. I suggest a title like Dragon's Nest instead.\n\nEDIT: Mentioned more and added clarity to some sloppy sentences.","February 22","false","19.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

This game is a good for casual gamers because the game is relatively easy and has great design. The gameplay is point and click based with some use of the usual wasd and 1-9 skills.\nBelow is my opinion on what are the pros and cons of the game.\nPros:\n-The game is free to play. (Seriously) \(>o<)/\n-Eidolons, they're like summons that help you kill monsters and gives buffs or heal you.\n-The game is easy, this could go in either in pros or cons depending on the player.\n-The game mechanics are ( are or is? Dunno dunt care. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) easy to understand.\n-Friendly community and player base. ( except for the trolls （￣へ￣）)\n-Gears and Costumes concept. ( Your char's image are based on the costumes, and your char's stats are based on the gears)\n-The new loot system makes high level gear farming relatively easy.\n-Tiered spender. ( Free items which you can get if you spend cash on the game.)\nhttp://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com/itemmall/tiered-spender\n-Loyalty system. ( Loyalties are free which can be farmed and is used to buy items on the cash Item mall.)\n\nCons:\n-Game is easy.\n-Highly pay to win, Ofc most game which are free are pay to win. But this game requires ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s amount of money to get annoyingly overpowered. Example of this is the forti scrolls in this game. +1-9 forti scroll is free. +10-20 <-- sh*tload $$\n-They often change the pricing of loyalty in the item mall. You know, for you to use $$. ノ( º _ ºノ)\n-No pvp gear bracket, Players with +9 gears dont have a match with players +20 gears. (THEY'LL 1 HIT YOU!!!1 HIT!!)\n-PVP which got  rankings time brackets. Practically annoying if its Working hours and Eerie hours.\n-World bosses are practically paper thin and weak as hell.

Leveling to 60 wasn't too bad, but as I saw in my original review below, nothing special.  The problem is at level 60 quests that were giving you 10-15% of a level each now give about 0.1%.  The solo dungeons available give less than 1% to run the entire thing.  Doing dailies with level 65 mobs that are quite painful to push through give about 3% for 30-60 minutes of work.  But unfun work.  I literally beat on the same enemy for 10 minutes straight to take him down and he was only PART of that quest requirement.  The only way to level is to run party dungeons, but parties don't take people below level 65.  The game does not get better.  All reports indicate level 70+ is even worse.  If it's just grind grind grind and solo grind at that until 65... forget it.  Not the point of an MMO.\n\nIt's a free to play MMO with decent graphics that doesn't seem to (I'm only mid 30s in level so far) nickle and dime you for every little think like so many other Asian free to play MMOs do.  There's nothing I've found exceedingly unique or special with this game than so many others.  It has nice convenience features like clicking a quest objective to take you there, easy party finding in most (low level at least) cases, and an active user base.  Again, shocked it doesn't nickle and dime.  There were a number of times I ran into in game things that were free I just KNEW would cost money, like item upgrading and inserting/removing stones that provide bonuses to items.  It's a good diversion for the price.  Nothing spectacular.","March 4, 2015","false","38.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The party system in this game isn't even that as I've read on the Aeria forums from another player that states that it's just there as an item distribution system.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are extremely simple but there is plenty of potential as it even allows you to hybridize the class system when you get to level 40. In fact it was that very idea that caught my attention (apart from the aesthetic appeal).\n\nHowever, my grief with this game starts when in a party. You don't share EXP for each kill you get with the rest of your party and when doing quests side by side, a party member's achievements, like killing a monster, doesn't count to the rest of the party's quest count.\n\nSomeone please explain to me how games like this is still considered multiplayer? I look at this game and all I see is an online single player social game.\n\nIf you like the anime style gameplay and playing solo online then for sure go check this game out as it's visually appealing and again, the game system itself isn't that bad.\n\nIf you're looking for a massively multiplayer online role playing game?

The graphics are pretty and it satisfies my costume addiction! I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a casual game to play/wanting a temporary game while awaiting AAA titles.\n\nPros:\n- Anime graphics: Weaboos' dream come true. They really are nice.\n- Casual gameplay: There is a nice community in Crescent Hill ch1, who are really laid back and fun to be with. If you don't want to level up its so easy to make friends and laze about.\n- Wide variety of costumes: If you're like me, this game will be perfect as you have lots of costumes to choose from and they can be dyed too.\n- Easy to understand: The game's simplicity is another pro, it isn't like Perfect World International where you have to know the names of a tonne of things.\n\nCons:\n- Publisher: Aeriagames is known for its not-so-good customer service so be warned, don't expect much and you probably will still be disappointed.\n- Developer: X-Legend are the McDonalds' of MMORPGs so quality isn't really the thing going for it. If you've played Grand Fantasia or Eden Eternal, Aura Kingdom is really just a simpler and more visually appealing version of it.\n- Patch times: They're not quick. Every few months we get a new large patch, IM promotions are much more frequent. Our next patch is scheduled for late February/early March so there is a long wait.\n- Repetitiveness: You have solo challenge, solo, party and hell modes of all dungeons except the 3 dragons. It's really just reskinned versions of things (smartly named 'Otherworld' dungeons aka harder versions of lowbie dungeons) and gets old real fast.\n- PvP: Don't even bother with it. Cash loads or fail.\n\nOverall if you're looking for a bit of fun AKs the game for you. Hardcore players should avoid this game as the dungeon limits and stuff will inevitably get to them.","January 17","true","827.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","9"

No I will not put a TL;DR thing.\n\nI was looking for a free mmorpg to play on Steam...you know something different, and this game exceeded my expectations.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are downright gorgeous. They put care into the designing of costumes and the characters expressing emotions. Now I know graphics can't only make the game, but I have to applaud them for the details they put into characters and the buildings. They really captured the anime feel of this game.\n\nCustomization of Character:\nThere are many customization options to choose from: Gender, Hairstyle, Hair Color, Eye Color, Face Style, and Skin Color. Regret your decision in the future? No problem. They sell a kit to help you change that. There are various costumes out there that you can use to customize what your character wears. You get free ones by completing the main story quest, but the rest you will have to buy with real money or loyalty points(points you earn while playing the game). Basically, your armor does not change the appearance of your character. There are costume slots such as headgear, body, and back.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is more action style and not slow turned based. The stats are allocated differently. There are three attack stats and three defense stats. The three attack stats are DMG,Crit,and SPD. The three defense ones are HP,DEF,and EVA. Each level later on, you gain one attack and one defense stat. Depending on your class and weapon, you can attack while you're turned around and while running. Did I mention you can glide in the air? Well you can! Did I mention they give you a starting mount? Well you get one! Did I mention EIGHT different classes? I know...*faint*\n\nOne key feature of the game is the game gives you a companion to use alongside your journey, more like a permanent two-person party. You have the option to summon or dismiss it whenever you like. At least you're not playing alone!\n\nStory:\nFantasy and anime. The story is awesome so far for fantasy lovers. I could go on, but I think it's for the best to see it yourself.\n\nList of things to do:\nThere are a ton of things. Hidden quests, achievements, and more where you can get different titles to boost your stats, or add some character to your character.\n\nEconomy:\nSurprisingly with bots out there, the economy maintains its composure to be fair.\n\nCustomer Service:\nThey may ask you repetitive questions, but overall their service is kind and quick.\n\nOverall, this game is the next big thing. This can beat all the free-to-play mmorpgs out there.","August 5, 2014","true","451.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/witchrift/recommended/268420/","witchrift","lion sugar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/witchrift/","62 products in account","I've only been playing this game for a small time now, but from the moment I actually got into the game I noticed a few things that I want to note about this game. Of course this is a limited view as of right now, and I'll probably right more on this game in the future, but there are just things from a new player that I'd like to discuss that are appealing and absolutely not.\n\n1. CAMERA DIRECTION. The camera is fixed, and not on the direction that your character is running, which is common in practically 99% of RPG games you and I could probably think of off the top of our heads. You have to hold down the right mouse button and manually steer around where your view is. This can be considered an infuriating experience at first. It also completely ruins the flow of the game, adventure, and just kinda sticks it more into your head that this is a program instead of your own cool anime adventure.\n\nEven when it feels like I've gotten used to it, I end up in situations where this absolute design flaw sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\n2. QUESTS OBJECTIVE TRACKING. While we're on the topic of that feeling of adventure that a lot of people would consider crucial for an RPG, myself included, the game has a function that can completely destroy the sense of adventure and exploration in quests. How? Well I'll start off by saying that any good RPG has a way to track the general destination or area that you have to go to for your quest, through just a little symbol that appears on the map or a symbol that appears generally on the top of the screen that points you where to go (note: in some games this can be executed poorly, however there are also games that can do this while still giving a lot of sense of adventure, Skyrim is a good example).\n\nThis game, however, has a pop-up screen that displays the goals of the quest, and if you click on the sentences of these obective (e.g you have to kill 5 of a certain enemy), the game will not only lay out a sparkly trail on the ground that not only leads to your goal, but also automatically starts taking you there. If you needed to find people that you can tell are supposed to be hard to find, you can just click this and you'll just be taken to them. More hidden resources that needed to be found? No worry, you'll be taken to it instantly.\n\nFor some, this is quite the positive, since a lot of people would find having to always look for the quest's objectives manually each time tedious and tiring; and it's a completely optional too. Honestly it's a pretty convenient function for people that just wanna blast through to get to the higher levels.\n\nAlthough the bad thing I'll have to say about it is that the icon on the mini-map in the top right-hand of the screen the icons were absolutely confusing. There is a lot going on, and the icon that displays the direction of the quest does not stand out as much as the other symbols. The good thing is, however, that if you go into the regional map there is a list of icons on the side that not only tell you what each is for, but also has an option to not display them! Very handy.\n\nI'd say these functions are honestly up to interpretation for whether they're good or bad. Personally, I find that it's very hard and not as clear as other RPG games in the showing of a more general direction and in frustration, can push you more to the option of just letting the game take you everywhere. I'm all about immersion and for me, even having that option takes away from the potential of the experience of adventure.\n\n3. THE DESIGNS AND ITEMS. My god, everything is cool in this game. As an artist, aesthetics and the way colours and design catch the eye are very important to me for just about everything; especially in anything that's definitely more visual-based like games. But I've caught myself thinking quite a few times that it's overwhelming in this game, and even a bit 'too cool'.\n\nGenerally when we start to play a new fantasy MMORPG we start off with these kinda mediocre and mundane gear. In some you can see how it's kinda cool, but it's definitely not awe-inspiring. Especially compared to high-level players that you see running around mounted on something crazy like a lion with a fire mane, and gear on them that is radiating with some awesome aura, with wings coming out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ back. We look to these players and start to idolize them in a sense for looking so rad. And when you start to reach up closer to the top, and start to collect your own cooler items, you definitely start to get a sense of pride and accomplishment in the hard work you've put into developing your character so much, especially if you paid money for it.\n\nThis game off the bat gives you awesome items. For exmaple I choose the Scythe class for my first character, at a very early level I can summon not one, but THREE beautifully designed demons to accompany me; and the choice is out of six demons in total. Even if you didn't choose the Scythe class, under level 10 you are given a mount, which personally I've never witnessed in a fantasy MMORPG before.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the game itself is actually based around the lore of it's world that there are these people chosen by destiny, that are given little creature companions (which is a very stereotypical thing to see in anime) that help you fight with their special abilities. While in character creation you get to choose out of four which one you want.\n\nThis trait in the game is also really up to interpretation just like the last one, too. On one hand, it's very rad that we all can have so many magnificent items, and can just look so fine. But on the other hand, it personally gives me less of an urgent want to progress fastly to be able to look good since I already am satisfied with my gear. Also on the more negative side, town centers were lots of players congregate can look completely ridiculous; like a hub for really over the top, overpowered original characters from deviantArt. And despite actually loving all the designs in this game, I still feel more neutral about it all.\n\n4. LAG. The bane of all gamers out there, the insufferable force which destroys the natural flow and order in your gaming session - yes, ladies, gentlemen, and honoured guests - this game has so, so much lag. I don't believe I have to go into such extensive detail for this section, but it's so much that it DOES need to be noted. It's not so bad that it crashes my game or makes me lag for more then 10 seconds, but I do have a good laptop and internet.\n\nWhy so much lag though? Honestly, blame the dirty weabs. All there for the designs, I swear.\n\n5. POP-UP CONVERSATION SCENES. In this game when you talk to anyone that isn't a background character a pop-up screen with your character's and the npc's top half of the body show up. Dialogue, actions each character makes shown in text, intervention from not only your first mount, but also your little companion that's always given to you... it's all just like a visual novel. And it's very appealing, and even refreshing and unique to see in a fantasy MMORGP.\n\nIt wouldn't be too much of a stretch that they put this in to appeal to those that are loyal anime fans, seeing as a lot of very popular games in Japan have these kinds of cut scenes that are very iconic in visual novels. They even give your character very over-exaggerated reactions that intergrate into the 'weaboo sub-popculture'.\n\nI can imagine some people would find this cringe-worthy, but I doubt anyone that would see it like that would be interested in a blantantly obvious anime-inspired game in the first place.\n\n6. CLASSES. I was going to write about this extensively, but I ran out of space, so here's the basics. There are a wide range of classes, up to 13 classes in total.\n\nI'd recommend this game since most features that I see as note-worthy are more postive or up to interpretation, and therefore, worth giving a go and seeing if it's for yourself!","April 25","true","111.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Leveling is fast, skills are flashy, players are many, IT'S NOT P2W but you'll probably spend cash anyways since the costumes and mounts are awesome and yeah, read below if you want to find out more.\n\nI was a bit skeptical about this game at first since I read some stuff on the forums about it not receiving updates that often, devs being lazy and so on but I gave it a try nevertheless.\nSo far I'm loving it. Even if it's like your usual get that / do that type of MMORPG the art-style, graphics and gameplay are what keep me going with it. At the moment, I'm Lv16 and from what I see there are lots of features unlocking at Lv20 and Lv25.\nLeveling is fairly easy, as of now I am leveling from like 3 quests which are easy to do, just go collect some things or kill some monsters.\nThe story is somewhat interesting, I don't usually read quest logs and stuff like that but this game made me read them. There are some cliche things here but still, compared to how other MMOs cough up story it's awesome.\nThis game has an interesting guild system as well. After you reach Lv10 you can join guilds by simply pressing G and searching for a guild that fits your liking. You instantly join them, no acceptance required. Now I'm not sure if this applies to every guild but still.\nAnother cool feature that I noticed is the friends system. It has this Intimacy thing which categorizes how close you are to your in-game friends. If you spend a lot of time with them in parties and stuff the Intimacy level goes up.\nSkills are fancy, classes are awesome, mounts and the most important thing which I should have mentioned in the beginning, this game is not Pay-2-Win at all. At least from what info I managed to scrape so far.\nAs of now that's all I can say about this game, I highly recommend it to anyone that loves MMORPGs and doesn't mind anime-like graphics.\nI'll update this once I get on a higher level and explore more of the content ! :)\n\nEDIT : I am now Lv42 and I just chose my second class since you can get another class at Lv40 and pretty much combine skills and stuff. So far I'm still loving this game, even more than before and I also found myself a nice guild.\nThe dungeons are somewhat fun as well although I was used to dungeons like they were in WoW or CABAL Online but still, fun nevertheless. I also spent some cash on this after I learned about the Paragon Table thing (sort of like a gamble system where you can win costumes and stuff) so yeah.\nI'll make another edit on this review once I progress even further in the content.","January 21, 2015","true","36.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

Aura Kingdom is my all time favourite game and is the most played game in my library, you take on the role as a envoy of gaia –  a human with abilities far exceeding other humans. The envoy starts out as a regular human, working for a living, until a blue mysterious orb suddenly appears and follows the envoy around until transforming into its true form, an eidolon. After the public saw this they were reminded of a envoy like him who had supposedly gone crazy and hid in a cave this was because he had a desire for power and because of this his eidolon transformed into something sinister that caused the envoy to lose control and lash out at civilians. Because of this the envoy is scared that his destiny would end up like the other envoys destiny and would eventually go crazy, his solution, to use a ancient device to remove the eidolon before he loses control. There is more to the story but some prefer to find out for themselves.\n\n\nPros\n-Beautiful world full of unique animals and creatures with an anime like visual style to it\n-Populated servers with friendly people\n-Free to play\n-Easy to understand\n-Dungeons are interesting to complete by yourself or in a party and will keep you interested\n-Attention to detail is superb such as weapons, costumes, eidolons and mounts\n-A amazing combat system with smooth transitions between moves\n-Large areas full of quests and monsters to fight\n-Gliding through the air is awesome\n-Can run on crappy computers and crappy internet\n-Good storyline if you don't continuously press the skip button\n-Clever ways to involve companions (eidolon) which each have unique abilities, movesets, stats and even personalities (and there are many to choose from)\n-Remains fun even if you have finished the main quest\n-Pay to win doesn't really apply as long as you have perseverance\n-Game has plenty of replayability like fishing, digging, creating new characters to use new classes and movesets, participating in the sky tower and events, duelling or trading with strangers, joining or creating dungeon raiding parties, side quests, hidden quests, achievements and more\n-Game still receives updates so the game still has more to offer\n-Many classes to choose from and you gain a secondary class at level 40 creating interesting combinations of movesets and combos\n-Companions named eidolons are useful for fighting/buffs/healing and can be levelled up\n-Has events which happen every 3 to 4 hours\n-You can create your own guilds that can be levelled up with daily quests and achievements and will gain you additional perks\n\n\nCons\n-The game tends to use quests like pick up _ of this and kill _ of a little to often that but aside from that quests are amazing\n-Music is not exactly memorable but that doesn't really matter\n-You can't change your race\n\n\nThis game is definitely worth picking up and playing and the best part is it's free I definitely recommend it to all who enjoy MMORPG","December 24, 2014","true","303.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The initial leveling experience is fairly swift, comparable to the current starter zones in games such as Lord of the Rings Online or World of Warcraft.As for the gameplay - it's a game that's easy to get into but also easy to set down and forget in favor of more engrossing games.Like in all other MMORPGs, grinding is the theme of Aura Kingdom and the storyline can, at most of the times, be neglected.Overall, Aura Kingdom represents a welcome turn from Aeria Games to making a decent and family friendly MMORPG which manages to be a fun, polished, and addictive experience.","July 9, 2014","true","13.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Before starting why i should say i've played till level 26\n\nAt first i saw the anime style and many classes. I liked the look of it. That really is the only reason I can think of to like this game.\n\nWhat can I say? It just feels like its designed for someone who doesn't really want to play. qeusting is pretty much one click to the objective, doing/killing one thing, and delivering it. Because of the auto-travel the world is not interesting and bland. To elaborate, this small area has creature type one, and this type 2. you don't even need to look at your surounding.\n\nWhen I went into the first real dungeon that required a team, it was only one room and had 3 enemies. They weren't that hard to beat. Compare it to other MMO's and it just feels really boring and uninspired. Outside of the dungeons there isn't any room for teamwork either.\n\nYou level very fast, which just add to the idea that the game is for the lazy. Not even something like a mount is worth anything. You get handed your first mount during the first 10 levels of play, this game does not feel like making the player do something, You just go through the motions.\n\nI geuss you get what you pay for, which is in this case: Nothing!","July 17, 2014","false","6.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

What caught my eye for this game was the art style. Its probly one of the most anime looking artsyle for any mmorpg I have played and that was a huge motivation for me to start playing. That was a huge pro for me that made this game win me over. I will now talk about other pros which is the gameplay itself and some cons.\n\nPros:\n-Great storyline\n-Fast pace combat system\n-Interesting pet system.\n-Quests are unique and fun. Especially daily quests you do.\n-Boss fights are highly addictive and does not make you stand in one place. Theres red paths that indicate when a monster is about to use a skill and you'd have to dodge it. Bosses in higher level will make it harder to actually dodge and make it a challenging experience.\n-Not a P2W game at all. Most things you can get from the ap store are things you can get in-game for gold.\n-Dual class feature\n-Great anime art style\n-Large class variety\n\nCons:\n-The only appearance you can have in the game are costumes. Equipments does not show up at all. Its only costumes.\n-Limited Character Customization\n-Not many areas to explore when compared to other mmorpgs.\n\nOverall a very highly addictive game with an amazing anime art style.

By that time I alredy had problems few times with bosses being able to hit you for like 50% of you HP but those rabbit just stamped big red cross on FUN. Why? Simple. They hitted to hard they swarmed you and healing sucks in this game, I cursed and sweared at them loudly, but while they are were managable event their bigger miniboss version. Long story short I barely managed to fight my way to the boss, threw everything I had at him and didn't even scratch him for 10% Also if monster losses aggro at you he recovers HP instantly, at least monster didn't respawn but that was last nail in the coffin for this game.\n\nEnd of the review I can reccomend this game for 10 to 20 hours.","May 31","true","38.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/268420/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","OVERVIEW\n\nAura Kingdom is an anime MMORPG adventure published by Aeria Games. They were known for publishing a lot of popular online games such as Grand Fantasia,Eden Eternal,Alliance Of Valliant Arms,Soldier Front 2 and etc. The question is...like all other point & click MMORPG,does this deliver anybody high expectation or it just another dissapointing mess ? In my opinion i always preferred fast paced action MMORPG such as Vindictus,C9 & TERA,mainly because they are much more fun to play than watching a bunch of animation play out. Let find out if this game is any good.\n\nGAMEPLAY : 7/10\n\nAs you start off,you are given ten classess to choose from. Ranging from Guardian,Ravager,Duelist,Grenadier,Gunslinger,Wizard,Sorcerer,Bard,Brawler & Ranger. I personally find Bard to be my type of class mainly due to the massive amount of support skills. Once you choose your class,you are given to create your own character. Dissapointingly,all you do is just choose a bunch of presets and limited colour to pick from. Which mean you gonna see a lot of clone character just with different outfit. After you create your character,you are given to choose 1 out of 4 different eidolons.They are basically your guardian which aid you in the battle. You also can do like a tag team combo with your eidolons.\n\nSome problem i had with this game is the tutorial. It is like is half-done. In the beginning it doesn't guide you so you have to figured out a lot of things on your own. In some certain situation when you enable a quest,then they started introduce you the tutorial. Why not teach all the basic things in the beginning of the game ???\n\nI have to give them a credit though for putting a auto quest tracker. Basically it make your character to automatically move to the destination quest. However it is poorly done since you would stuck in certain terrain or just stop half way.\n\nAnother problem i don't like is why they locked out some features unless you reach the specific level it required. It like you need achieve to level 10 in order to join guild and unlock the mail system.\n\nWhile you don't get your mounts & your eidolons in the beginning of the game,you get them quite early once you completed few quest.\n\nAs for skills progression,you unlock a specific skills once you reach that specific levels. Example would be you reach level 4 to unlock Ambient Drone skill. You obtain a skill points every 2 or 3 level if i am not mistaken. From there you can upgrade your skills. It not that complicated as well as it not linear.\n\nDuring combat,you can move around while your character performing auto-attack. You can avoid danger easily since there is a danger sign telling you where the spell are gonna land. This game doesn't have any MP bar system so basically you can just spam any skills you want. Your health will regenerate too no matter what class you choose. Mainly this type of decision they make is to target player who are new to MMORPG or to provide a less frustration experience.\n\nGRAPHICS : 7/10\n\nThis game has an interesting artstyle and design choice. While the character models seems a bit off and doesn't blend well with the background,the monster models is impressive.\n\nAnimations is well done for the most part and it doesn't felt stiff except when you jump.\n\nThe texture details and environment look great especially in MAX settings.\n\nThere are certain NPC that walk in town to make the world feel a bit lively though they don't interact much.\n\nThe interface in my opinion is a clutter mess. Good things you can edit and adjust some of the UI.\n\nAUDIO : 5/10\n\nWhile i think the soundtrack in this game is marvelous. Most of the sound assets is quite poor. There is barely any voice acting when you have conversation with a NPC and your character doesn't yell,scream or grunt when performing certain actions. It feel like the character is lifeless and it just a walking robot. There is not much ambience to be heard either.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 7.5/10\n\nSince the world is massive,there is much to explore especially if you playing with a friends. There is titles & achievements you can unlock,hidden & sub quest you can do,PvP,able to glide if you sick of walking on the ground & massive amounts of events. If you able to join a guild it would add more enjoyment to it as you can fight difficult bosses that you can't handle alone. Not to mentioned you can go fishing and swimming too. There are daily login rewards to encourage players to keep playing this game.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 6.6/10\n\nDespite it flaws,i had some fun with this game especially the inclusion of eidolons. I recommend to people to those who want a light hearted and an enjoyable MMORPG.\n\nI still got some de ja vu though since this game is like an upgraded version of Fiesta Online. It like both of these games have some resemblence to it.\n\nGRADE : D ( Not Bad )","July 4, 2014","true","1.7"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","9"

Aura Kingdom is a game that's simple to learn and grasp, I was able to get into it and learn a lot of things in a manner of minutes! The variety of classes allows a unique gameplay style for everyone, and the secondary weapon you can get later on just makes things even more challenging and fun.\nThe biggest pros in my opinion are:\n-Variety of classes (more to come!)\n-Eidolon systems, you don't need to be a summoner class to get an epic companion to fight with you!\n-Awesome flashy skills\n-Epic dungeons to explore with friends and intense, challenging fights\n-Unique story and background, everything has a story\n-How well the game pulls you in, once you start, you really can't stop playing\n\nIn contrast however, the cons in my choice are:\n-You'll find yourself repeating fetch and kill quests, the occasional special quest with something else to it\n-Unable to skip boring cutscenes that last awhile\n-How unfair dueling systems can get, a level 70 can challenge a level 30 to a fight, seriously?\n-Servers can be unstable time to time\n-Leveling, becomes ridiculous in higher levels, quests only bump you up like 2%\n\nThe thing fantastic about Aura, there's always something to do, regardless if gameplay becomes reptative. How you play Aura is up to you, but the biggest things you need to remember:\n-This is an MMO, if you understand the basics, you'll know long hours and patience go a long way and are needed to enjoy this game\n-People have the grinding style of leveling, but in Aura that method won't really work, espicially later on, just do your quests, it wont kill you\n\nI personally enjoy Aura, if you love MMORPG's and want to find one to kill time, have an awesome adventure with friends, or just flat out looking for something new, this is the game for you. I promise its worth every minute of gameplay.","July 29, 2014","true","863.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In the game players are going to be accompanied by faithful interactive companions able to evolve and give support in battle.\n\nIn Aura Kingdom players can choose between eight classes, fight with a dynamic action combat system, and customize their their haracters with elaborate skill trees.\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n\nDetailed and Rich fantasy world\n\nStunning anime styled graphics\n\nHuge selection of interactive companions\n\nUnprecedented mobility\n\nDynamic and fast-paced action combat\n\nLots of customisation options regarding abilities and weapons\n\nCompletely free-to-play\n\n\nA VIBRANT WORLD\n\nAura Kingdom features a vast and vibrant fantasy world illustrated in highly detailed anime styled graphics. Players will trek across beautiful landscapes and charming towns, meeting its inhabitants while exploring mysterious dungeons and climbing massive towers.\n\nCLASSES & WEAPONS\n\nThe game presents rather than a usual class system, a system based on the weapon players may use, resulting in eight classes to choose from, but along the way they are able to select a secondary weapon normally wielded by one of the remaining classes. Each weapon provides unique skills that are unlocked automatically step by step upon reaching higher levels. With every new level, players are also able to put points into a passive skill tree that differs between classes.\n\nCurrently available are the following weapons: axe, dual daggers, sword & shield, staff, harp, grimoire, dual pistols and cannon.\n\nCOMPANIONS\n\nIn Aura Kingdom players are accompanied by companions which are far more than simple pets and an integral part of the game experience. These companions grow more formidable over the course of the game and gain powerful combat abilities-including joining with the player to initiate spectacular combo attacks.In addition these companions will remember your actions ingame, frequently conversing with the player about their past exploits and battles.\n\nCOMBAT & MOBILITY\n\nIn the game players are going to have unprecedented mobility both in combat and out, offering unique movement techniques to traverse the terrain. Players may utilise double-jumps to scale heights and glide forward through the air at high speed to cover ground faster than they ever thought possible. Even for low level players, it’s already possible to climb on the back of an extensive array of mounts.\n\nThis mobility allows for fast-paced and fluid battles. Position and quick thinking will enable them to dodge enemy attacks and stay on their feet. They can call in their companion to join them, granting access to powerful new abilities and spectacular combo attacks.\n\nCUSTOMISATION\n\nIn Aura Kingdom the customisation is not limited to hair styles, costumes and accessories, but also allows adapting characters regarding their abilities and weapons. Players can choose which of their many abilities to power up to suit their play style, and change them around quickly and freely. They are encouraged to experiment with different setups often, as the right approach can mean the difference between victory and defeat.\n\nAura Kingdom does not present the common stats, but attack and defence points instead. Attacks points can be used to improve the character’s attack to inflict a larger amount of damage, the chance to land a critical hit, and the attack speed. Defence points can be employed to increase health, health regeneration and the chance to avoid an attack, as well as to reduce the amount of damage received.\n","May 14","true","14.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

If you are an Anime Freak like me, this game is absolutely for you! I just downloaded it and played 9 straight hours ! that's how addicting the game is! I got my character up 37 in one day so the leveling is really fast (of course if you keep doing the main quests). Aura Kingdom gives the atmosphere that you are inside the world. So first up you have the basic class choosing, customization, and tutorial. I am here to convince few people by telling my pros and cons i had so far from the game! HERE IT GOES!\nPros:\nrun smoothly even if you have a low graphics card (depends on your internet connection)\nlowest setting still looks great\nmany classes to choose from and later in the game you can choose another class (lvl 40)\nit's not really p2w or pvp MMO\nThe Music is soothing\nAll classes are balanced\nYou get your own partner that will help you throughout the game that you can talk to! ( Like Digimon some sort of)\nCrowded Servers\nVery exciting Dungeons\nNot really a toxic player game\nStory is pretty good for a MMO\nCostumes are free by doing the main quests ( You get many costumes)\nSharing monster kills for quests ( normally you have to kill your own target but not in this MMO)\nAutomatic Healing potions usage at % health (you can turn it on or off and set it up at what % health you want to use it, IT'S VERY UNIQUE imo)\nIT'S TOTALLY F2P !!!! Unless you like to support the developers by buying at their Shop Mall\n\nNeg:\nThe same quests as go talk to him than him or kill this, pick up this etc ...\nPvp is restricted until later the game ( I Think)\nCrowded server might crash your game ( Not for mine)\nlow internet connection is not recommended ( 25 mbps is recommended by me)\nSocial or chat is mehh, couldn't figure out how to make a new tab to make like a guild chat only, party chat only etc ... ( I couldn't find how)\nFemales are mostly males ( i have nothing wrong with it, but in an Anime MMORPG is creepy)\neveryone can have the same helpers (it bothers me, they at least could put some customization to our helper)\nLimited Bag Space that becomes annoying to clean up\n\n\nOverall i would give it 8/10! Since the neg are mostly on the small issues than the gameplay. THIS IS MY ANALYSIS! I play Age of Wushu(Only PVP)  therefore it makes Aura KIngdom so unique for me. Play with your friends or cooperate with a stranger rather killing him in public. It's more of the Piece full games!\nSorry for the grammar but i wanted to help people by deciding to start or not! And give them general idea of the game!\nWell i hope my review helped some of you out there!\n","July 5, 2014","true","419.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

Even the good old bugs are there.\nHooo... good times.\n\n>>> Now lets talk for real.\n\nThis game is not for the hardcore players like i used to be in WoW times.\nThis is a very easy and very casual game.

This game has a lot more interesting things. I didn't tell that it has more events to do or any features but it kind of addictive, IDK why?. It's like the graphics is fantastic in its kind (Fantasy, Anime). Nice interface. Never getting bored when levelling up your character. It's UNIQUE. In my opinion, it could almost reach the equal level to FFXIV or Guild Wars 2  in my FunMeter. SO FREAKING COOL. I'm addicted to it now.

When the graphics are turned all the way up it has quite the detailed environment, even tho it has a kind of animated feel which is just the style of game. all and all whether your an anime fan or just a fan or rpg's id highly suggest trying out aura kingdom, its definitely worth a few dozen hours of gameplay and even if your pc is crappy like mine lol, im sure you could figure a way to get it running, atleast i did. of coarse theres the little things that are always wrong with free to play rpg's, like they use the same monsters in different levels by just rendering them different colors and sometimes the graphic glitchs when jumping and casting skills but other than the usual little stuff but its definitely no pay 2 win, most of the item mall stuff is cosmetic and it can still be obtained by playing to complete quests and getting loyalty points which works like the AP which is aura point you pay for.","July 24, 2014","true","278.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But still there are plenty worthy adventure quests to do that\n▲Takes SO MUCH TIME on FIRST LOAD, other than that it's fine.\n▲Never press the full scan button.\n▲Going on a different server can cause your character to not be on that server. Play on the server that you created your character on (if you made it on hydra, play on hydra)\n▲Alot of trade spammers. I would recommend turning trade off in general. Keep trade channel for trade only.\n\nI guess that's my review of this great game. If the developers read this, good job guys!

This game is trully an Anime like game. This is the biggest plus in this game so far. NPCs are quite unique, though i sometimes feel a repetitive scene when fighting some mobs (especially humans, like pirates), but still creature mobs are so unique and interesting that i feel a pleasure just roaming and watching them pass me by.\n\nBad thing is that quests are dull. Like, take that, bring that, kill that, collect that. It's pretty much repetitive. But its not a problem for a free game (most of the rpgs have same kind of quests anyway). There are many hidden quests, that start with the player checking some container or an item. And there are alot of bounties, side quests and stuff like that. It's all about numbers, not quality.\n\nThere are 9 classes to choose from. The character creation is so loyal to anime/manga fans that most probably most of you will enjoy. There are some elements that are quite new to me (becouse i dont play MMO often). Like, none of the skills have mana requirements, only cooldowns. And there is no typical Strenght, Endurance, Energy leveling. You get ATK Points and DEF points. In ATK section you level damage, critical hit chance or attack speed, and in DEF section you level armor rating or evasion.\n\nYou can have a pet here. Ranging from faries to ponies (Yes, MLP fans, this game is for you too!) That pet levels with you and it can get you presents every 10 minutes for some kind of energy points. To restore points, you need to talk with your pet. The dialogue is pretty solid, sometimes fun. So you need to take care not only about your character, but about your pet as well.\n\nOverall, this game is still in open beta stage. There are some bugs, sometimes server lags and that kind of stuff. This game isn't the perfect game ever, some things really bug me (like, why doesnt character look depend on a costume but not the armor?). But still, i had a pleasure playing it. So check that out, for a free game and for a beta stage, it's awesome.\n\nPros:\n+ Loyal to anime fans (even MLP?)\n+ Beautiful world\n+ Pretty much original\n+ Nice soundtrack\n+ Awesome Eidolon (Pet) system.\n\nCons:\n- Bugs and freezes\n- Missing sounds for enemy mobs or ambience.\n- Only 10 hairstyles :(\n- This game begs you to find friends, becouse some quests can't be passed without a party.\n- Mini-games with you controling other NPCs feel unfinished and lousy.\n- Disguises just give you a model to wear, not a costume itself.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n7 hairstyles out of 10","August 3, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is horrid, though I did play this after TERA, so my opinion of this game is bound to be critical. Point and click to fight, camera that doesn't automatically follow you,  movements don't look smooth at all, and the UI is disgusting to look at. It looks like it came out in 2004 honestly. This is simply unplayable, so I had to stop before actually getting far into the game. This is technicially a review for the game I downloaded and installed from the main website, but since the game never worked correctly for me on Steam I would still not recommend it.","July 2, 2015","false","2.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sosseres/recommended/268420/","sosseres","Sosseres","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sosseres/","358 products in account","The game is very simple. Even the hidden quests have markers on the minimap with clues on the items you recieve. The only hidden thing is the conversations you can overhear, getting all of them in an area grants a bonus.\n\nI played 10 hours before I got stuck on a bug. I assume a relog would fix it but I quit the game instead at level 28. The game is simply too easy. I once dropped below 30 % in 10 hours. I used a total of 2 health potions.\n\nThere was one forced group battle at level 20, nobody in our group dropped below 70% hp.\n\nBesides that it is a fun game with gliding fast over the terrain between quest and monster. Often able to glide up a cliff to report a quest within 20 s of it being done. It progresses fast and teaches you mechanics and systems as you go along if you do all the quests in the area. The equipment gets upgraded as well, with some sets needing to defeat instances multiple times for drops (longest time to complete one was 2 min for me).\n\nThe biggest upside in the controls for this game is that you can click on the minimap and the character will go there. You can even click on characters to go up to them or enemies. Playing SW mmo you realise quickly how big this improvement is.","May 7","true","10.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

You can make friends, parties, or guilds freely. Furthermore, you can fight against enemies with your pets. Classes are various, you can choose one of these classes freely. you can select a second class when your level is at least 40. Also, you can fish and make a couple with a friend. It's possible to do many kinds of things. These things make your game style various. these are good points about 'Aura Kingdom'.\n\nBut there are some bad points in 'Aura Kingdom'.\n\nFirst, Pay-to-win. Of course, 'Aura Kingdom' is a Free-to-play game, and other online and free-to-play rpg games have this pay-to-win system. But when your level is at least 55-60, The difference between 'paying' and 'not paying' may be bigger than you expect.\n\nSecond, You'll download the client which size is 4.3GB through Steam. However, After you finish to install that, and when you start this client at the first time, You'll download additional files, The size of these files is about 1.5GB. I have no idea why they didn't update game files in Steam. I think Downloading through Steam is faster than downloading through their servers, in some countries. Also this can lessen their servers burdens.\n\nFinally, About servers. Sometimes, their servers are insecure. For example, One day, Users couldn't login to this game for few hours because Aeria servers were down. I know they do the maintenance work in servers, but they are still insecure.\n\nIn short, 'Aura Kingdom' is a well-made and good game even though there are some bad points.\nIf you have enough time to play this and want to try this game, try this, It may not be bad, because this game is a free-to-play game.","August 3, 2015","true","59.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

I don't even need to spend real money to play, because the gameplay wasn't really all stats and expensive items. You need the skill and speed for executing the moves to win a PVP duel.

I fell in love all over again when I first started to play. 2-3 months later I have a in-game tech issue and the GM only told me to redo the steps I've already taken prior to contacting them. All I got in reaspons from all the GMs online was "You should stop playing the game..." Really. Since all these high level players are so greedy and the GMs are of barely no help... this game is not worth it but it is. Even though I think about quitting. I can't bring myself to do so. This game is one of a kind heart stealer. I can't give it up now. At least not until Private server files are released. The let those greedy high level players have their stupid original server. Look into the aurakingdom.to private server. I bet it's much better then the mains. I've only been to their page a few times but since I don't want to ditch my characters I've worked so hard to build I havn't looked into it futhur. If you do check the AK.to p-server then come back an tell people what you experienced compared to the mains. I'd like to see what other think.","August 13, 2014","true","329.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a /Extremely/ easy game for all to play. I played it for 11 hours and got from level 1 - level 42, I had a create time conversing with the commuinity of the game and fighting my way through the typical sort of mmo questing sysetem. The dungeons are probably the best bit of this game, especially the bits of seen for hell-mode. The dungeons are insane, so much colours and things going on at once you really feel like you're controlling some sort of really OP anime character.\n\nPro's-\n\n-F2P and a very good F2P model at that.\n-Beautiful world to explore.\n-A great anime style; probably the best yet.\n-Fun gameplay.\n-A lot of the quests are completely opptional it won't /make/ you pay for anything to get along in the game.\n-Easy, this could be good or bad depending on your opinion.\n\nCon's-\n\nThis is going to be the biggest thing I'm going to raise, because it's what made me stop playing.\n-The AP store, the place where you use real money to buy in game things, not important things that give you an advantage over anyone else, just mounts, costumes, random things...AND THE F**KING SUBCLASS CHANGE. That's right, being a "Noob" to this game I had know idea that you're supposed to take a certain subclass taht went well with the first class you had, it would be fine if this change costed in game currency or a small amount of loyalty points. BUT NO. it costs\n!!!£20!!!\nFor something that small but still something so drastic and needed for the gameplay, for this single thing the developers get!\n\n0/10! EA STATUS.\n\n-The game is your typical mmo. Kill 9 of these, then hand in the quest. It's normally okay though since it's masked by the beautiful gameplay.\n-The music was ♥♥♥♥, sorry people but yes. The same soundtrack...Over  & over...Just...ugh.\n-PvP is completely one sided, it's no wonder barley anyone does it, Gunslingers rule the battlefield.\n-Not much end game content. The extent of what you do is farm to get the best mounts and costumes.\n\nIn short, this game is great. Just be careful of the choices you make sometimes...Because the developers are gonna make you pay big.\n\nThis game get's 7/10","September 21, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has absolutely no need to spend real money in, leveling is fairly well paced throughout the game (I've only had to grind for a level twice) and all items you can spend money on are either customisation, mounts (you get one for free before you even reach level 10), or items you can get by playing the game. The game also has a great guild system, which encourages members to aid their guild so it can level up to provide bonuses to all members of the guild. Graphically the game actually looks pretty good, with an anime inspired art design and some decently creative orginal monster designs. Gameplay is your standard hotkey system mmorpg style, while I have railed on this system multiple times in the past, this game did it well in my opinion. Unlike other games using the hotkey system, Aura Kingdom made it enjoyable by 1. Not requiring me to mash a button for my standard attack (I'm looking at you Star Wars the Old Republic) 2. Having enjoyably flashy ability animations and 3. providing a cool combo system with the second class (which with the correct combinations of weapons can lead to powerful special abilities). The only complaint I have with this game is the story, it's not bad and it's not the game's fault that I don't enjoy it. Due to the previously mentioned Star Wars the Old Republic I have a hard time enjoying mmorpg's that don't at least have voice acting, though as said it's my fault. If you enjoy games with an anime art style, mmorpg's, or mmo's in general, you will love this game and I can't recommend it enough. Other wise definitely give it a shot. Finally though, if you aren't a fan of any of the previously mentioned then admittedly this game won't change your mind on the genre.","October 29, 2014","true","56.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robinmallow/recommended/268420/","robinmallow","Marshmallow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robinmallow/","39 products in account","As an avid player of MMORPGs, this caught my eye immediately (especially when it came to Steam and I didn't have to use the Aeria Games launcher, kekeke) when I saw it.\n\nYou play as an Envoy of Gaia, and because of this you can summon creatures known as Eidolons to fight alongside you. Dragons, maidens, fairies, unicorns, golems, all sorts. To start with, I picked Grimm, and have recently unlocked Sigrun and Gigas. You can name these anything you want, so the names don't particularly matter. There are plenty of different classes to fit your playing style. I, personally, have used a Bard - a healing class - all the way to level 43 as of writing this. I chose Sorcerer as my secondary class at level 40. The stats system is a little unbalanced and there are glitches here and there, but the game as a whole completely overpowers these with its good graphics and intuitive game mechanics\n\nThe game itself is gripping and the mechanics are amazing. It's clean, tells you everything you need to know and has a deep, fleshed out story and world. The art style is also adorable, so if anime-style games are your thing, AK is for you. What I love most is the questing mechanics. Any item you need to use or make is shown in the quest tracker, and all you have to do is double click the objective and you automatically travel there on an adorable ostrich by the name of Beebis. What I love is that killstealing does not exist. So long as you contribute to the killing of an enemy, everyone gets the same amount of XP, the kill registers and everyone gets their own drops, so no need to worry about someone else stealing your kill for a quest.\n\nIt looks a little inaccessible once you see all of the different things you can do, such as fortification, equipment salvaging and feeding your Eidolons with experience crystals. However these are introduced in interactive quests, and are presented very well.\n\nMy one complaint is the abundance of jiggle physics in the female characters... but hey, it's an anime game, and it's rather unnoticeable except for the female Eidolons. If anything, it's hilarious to watch!\n\nI would highly recommend to any fantasy RPG lover.","August 16, 2014","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When the game finally launched I've been playing this for a few months. Now I'm back I don't really see significant changes, but when I played the game I did really enjoy it. Before this game was even launched I was really attracted to the way Aura Kingdom looked. The looks of it were quite promising. Always when I play a MMO I would play it for a few months but then I would take a break. After stopped playing this I haven't found any good MMO's.\n\nThis game is quite easy in the beginning. You're able to grind really easy but near level 40 it gets a lot harder and it takes mor time to level up. It's fantastic that you're able to use 2 classes on one character. When you've come that far you can use the skills of your second class together with the primary class that you have. Furtherhand I would like to say that this game is a really good starter for people who haven't been playing MMO's. Since the tutorial is very clear it's easy to understand how everything works.","July 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay and combat is good and the game is well polished although there are a few major problems. The game auto sets resolution on first open to 800x600, there is too much hud and makes the game a little harder to concentrate and play on with hud crowding every edge of your screen completely, this hud needs to be simplified. Lastly the combat although good and interesting, it needs a tweak so you can lock onto targets if you wish and some other fixes.

Each class is different, giving varities of characters to play as. The quest system in this game is farily easy since it has a tracking system as well whether you need trouble or just lazy to go to the area. You get a Eidolon which acts as your partner to help kill enemies as well as unlocking a special finisher, fancy animation for every class.\nAll in all it's worthy game to try out.

It is very casual, just press a button and you can auto run to most quest objectives. The game is pretty much all PVE, I have not played very long so I may be wrong but if there is PVP in game, the community seems small for it. It is also pretty buggy so far, I have had trouble running the game and doing things in game because of these bugs.\n\nOver all though if you are looking for a really casual PVE oriented, anime style mmo, and dont want to worry about cash shop pay to win, this game might be of interest to you if you're not worried about putting up with some bugs along the way.

Set in the semi-linear world of Azuria, you are an Envoy of Gaia, a human with special abilities and the power to summon powerful & mysterious partners called Eidolons to your aid, as you travel the world, defeating monsters, helping the towns, and defending against the ShadowKnights, a strange and powerful foe!\n\nDiscover your Eidolons true potential by fighting alongside with them and leveling them up, into more powerful forms (somewhat like Pokemon :P ) and use their skills to aid you in battle with the upper-hand!\n\n12 awesome classes to choose from, including Ravager (High DMG), Scythe (Necromancer) & Grenadier (2-Handed Cannon Wielder), and blast, slice & shoot through the games many challenging dungeons and Main Quest line. Become a dual-class at Lvl40 with the ability to adopt a 2nd classes skills (for example a Tachi + Katar), and gain many more kickass skills and abilities!\n\nPro's\n- Very balanced classes (PvP can be won by any mix-up of classes)\n- Amazing soundtrack (very fitting for areas, a little repetitive, but fitting)\n- Great Group Events (including Battlefields, enhanced Dungeons, and special Party Quests)\n- Smooth Graphics (easy on the eyes, simple, but aestheticly pleasing)\n- Lots of backstory / lore (Simply read what people have to say, it will make sense)\n- Not Pay2Win (Can easily get to Max Lvl with High Quality gear, without spending a cent! (although you can get some cool looking apparel and mounts, etc for some cash if you wanna spend)\n\nCon's\n- Main Quests can be pretty repetitive (lots of Fetch Quests, Kill X Amount of Monsters, etc)\n- Hit Boxes is slightly Buggy (sometimes cannot target opponent until they hurt you first)\n- Sudden jump in EXP needed to Lvl after 45 (1-45 quick leveling, 45+ is grindy)\n\nOVERALL\nOverall, I love Aura Kingdom, its an amazing MMO that I would highly recommend trying, especially with friends (plus Bonus EXP in parties so Win-Win! XD)\n\nGive it a go, and if you don't enjoy it, no money was lost since F2P! :D\n\nOverall Score - 8.5/10","May 13, 2015","true","215.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

First off, when looking for an MMO with Anime Graphics and free-roam style... this is so far the only game that has hit the spot. I fell in love and I now have been playing it non-stop for three days, just short of 40 hours now.\n\nTRUE - Players are not overly friendly and do not go out of their way to say Hello or RolePlay (I come from World of Warcraft) so players NOT roleplaying was a little different.\nFALSE - Players only seek to use you. I've met some very nice people and have joined a guild that is actually reasonably social. Good players are out there, they are just hidden. Hah.\nTRUE - The Quests are mostly gathering and killing - basic MMO stuff. Still, I love them because if you listen to the story behind them, they actually make sense. In WoW - they say go get some candles. No explanation for why... just go get me some freaking candles. So you do. In this game, your goal is clear and everyone's quests are to help them help you. It makes sense why you go gather mushrooms or kill beetles.\nTRUE - The AI and BOT models are VERRRRRY overused, but I don't mind it much. As for player models, I haven't seen any close look-alikes and the character creation gives just enough imput.\n\nOther Things I Love?\nI love classifying in two specializations. So i can use guns and swords, etc. It's very cool and something I was sad they started taking away from World of Warcraft (its basically nonexistant).\nI love the dungeon system. Dungeons are completely solo-able or you can join up and do a party-version. This makes it easy for SOLO players (like myself) to get everything in the game accomplished without searching for people I don't even want to talk too.\nThe game is easy. Not in the sense that it offers no thrill or excitement, but its not overly complicated. Everything is explained in words first and then (for visual people like myself), most everything has a little video to also explain how each element works. Using Gems is explained, creating armor and gear, and even fishing.\nFishing is FUN. Its also one of the easiest places to get Gold (WInk WINk).\nI Love the Companions - they are fun and sooo helpful. I especially Love Merilee!!\nCostumes are great - no mismatched ugly gear while you're leveling. The best ones must be bought however (SIGH)\n\nWhat I Don't Like?\nNo open world RolePlay - but thats ok. Hey, if you want to Look Me Up. I love Roleplay\nNot a whole lot of servers.\nCan only create 9 characters, but there are 12 classes [This isn't overly important since they have duel-classification at level 40, so you can make up for lost classes then.]\nGold Farming is Slow. And I do mean SLOOOW. I've farmed gold for weeks in several games but I've never had so much difficulty as in this one.\nIn-Game Real Money:: I've always had a problem with this in games. It bothers me that I can't buy nice things with Gold. They have implemented another Currency to get most of these Real Money items, but its a lot of work (almost too much). Still - despite adding this it is in no way PAY to WIN. You don't have to spend any money to be freaking amazing in this game.\n\nI don't if my review helped. But these are some things that I looked at, disliked, loved, and enjoyed.\n\nOverall. Get this Game. If you like RPGs with a GOOD Storyline (who doesnt?), Anime Graphics, and MMO, get this game. People say a lot of crap. But this game has been completely worth it for me. :)\n","June 3, 2015","true","59.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've been playing it for almost a year now and I honestly cannot think of a single bad thing to say about it.\n\nThe game itself is generally very easy. I love everything from the look of it, to the fighting, and the story line. Even after making multiple characters and doing the same quests over and over again I just can't seem to get bored of it. It does start to get a little slow around level 50-60 but that's basically every mmorpg game at a certain point. I also think it has the best community for a game that I've seen in my opinion. People are just extremely friendly and generous.\n\nThe only thing that frustrates me about it is trying to get enough gold to buy stuff at the auction house. The prices for some of the costumes and mounts tend to be a little ridiculous (if you want something that the game doesn't already give you or just isn't basic) and as someone who doesn't want to spend actual money on the game, it gets annoying having to wait so long to save up enough for something that probably won't be there in 24 hours or less when you finally have enough. Also the spam from bots trying to sell you gold is utterly annoying, I can't even tell you how many I've had to block.\n\nOverall though I would 10/10 suggest this game if you're looking for something fun to play with fun people to play with.","April 30, 2015","true","316.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love anime and I've been searching for a really well graphical anime mmo and thankfully I came across Aura Kingdom. I know some people who just find this game down right boring but if you grab even one person to join you in your adventure you will definitely have fun. My friend and I made new characters and everytime we learned a new skill we dueled one another, although I got obliterated by him it was still fun to get far into the game together. A lot of yelling and a lot of skipping quests that we regret skipping lol. If you wanna play a well designed anime mmo then Aura Kingdom is the one for you. I hope this helps and possibly convinces some of you.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Dual class system at level 40.\n2. Eidolon/Pet creativity\n3. Amazing cutscenes that you wouldn't want to miss\n\nCons:\n\n1. Although this may seem like a stupid con for some of you, leveling is to fast for my liking. In about one day my friend and I got to level 30 (no we didn't stay up the whole night). I like to take it decently slow and sometimes stop for amazing sights.\n\nOverall: I think this game is great besides the leveling system and don't worry it's not really pay to play unless you just want a cool mount, I think the free mount that you recieve is cool enough. I mean come on, who doesn't wanna run around exploring on a FREAKING OSTRICH?!\n\nEdit: I know I don't have many hours on this game but that is because I used to play it outside of steam and quit it since I got a bit seperated from the game and then when I saw it on steam it brought back good memories.","February 9, 2015","true","9.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Perfect World for its Quest Based Leveling (yes dungeon & quest are your primary source for level, farming & killing mobs are not necessary).\n\nBut to top of it, Aura Kingdom compile the best part of MMORPG to date, not too keen for Pay To Win because most dependable item are available through ingame, and you may get items from item mall with Token (available to get) instead of Aeria Points.\n\n\n\nBut every review must have its con, so in my opinion, this game is lack of support from developer and game provider Aeria itself, lack of update, bug fixing, and so on.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you're just a casual player that want some fun without any progressive playing and money-spending, this one suits you best. not necessary to P2W, decent gameplay with friends, and since it's PVE centered, no need of ++++weapon & armor that you should buy with money from other people or grinding too much.","July 29, 2014","true","706.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I got potions to drink and livers to destroy!"\n\n+ I must say I do like the art style of the game is quite lovely though.\n+ This does have a large variety of classes to choose from including a scythe class, I love scythes, I even get a companion around level 10.\n+ I enjoy the companion idea that you get to choose at the beginning of the game and her/his interface, she/he always greets you and says that she got lonely when you were offline, that kind of stuff does make me feel kinda warm inside and I do love the idea of putting a more indepth characteristic into your partner.\n\n= The storyline seems like it could be kind of good but it's hard to pay attention to it over the simple text dialogue, voice acting and such is always a good idea if you want to draw in a more indepth atmosphere. It could also do without it choosing what emotion your hero is going under, like crying at times and such, it's best to leave that kind of stuff out because it should be up to the players imagination to know what emotion your character should be going through.\n\n- Interface covering 70% of the screen annoys me but oh well.\n- This game includes the overly used quests in every other mmo, quite off putting, I need to see something new, spice it up a little.\n- I hate the fact that it has auto pathing for the quests, oh how original and unefforting, just click the text and the game plays itself, screw effort.\n- I also dislike that the gear you put on doesn't show up on you character it's all costume based.\n\noverall is this game good?\nthere are both likes and dislikes about this game and some of the good points really do stand out... I just like having a companion XD, but the unoriginality and costume base weighs the game down alot and really prevents me from playing knowing the progress I make won't make me all the unique from any other player.

During my first week into the game, I was greeted with the traditional anime esc story about how you are the main character and the world revolves around you. Now this being an MMO I grew tired of reading through everyones dialouge and skipped most of the story until I found myself in Navea. Navea is the main hub for players to sell their items, fight players, window shop, etc. Having made my way to lvl 20 and viewing everyone elses cool costumes and items, I found myself looking through the Auction House. I will say this right now... DO NOT spend any money on this game. Every item can be obtained by completing quests or dungeon running, although it will take far longer your wallet will be thanking you in the end.\n\nNow that the fancy costumes are out of the way, we can begin talking about the combat system. Combat in Aura Kingdom is very... spammy? Without knowing any better, you will soon be allocating all your combat points into speed which will reduce the cooldown on all of your abilities. Now with infinite ability spamming, the bosses in this game are a lot easier and reduce the amount of time you spend in dungeons. All in all, the combat system is nice but very broken with the cooldown on all of your abilities... especially the bard class.\n\nWould I recommend the game? Yes. Aura Kingdom is a free to play game with a lot potential but is wasted on broken builds and abilities. However, the world is very fruity and with new patches being released every month or so it makes up for the mistakes that it clearly made.","September 9, 2015","true","935.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Sadly though, the story quests are fixed NPCs and you can walk there with auto-path (I even tried the game while knowing the feature is there).\n\nI'd say NO because the animations are very clunky and the game lags like hell. Though lag might also be caused for the servers to be located on the US West-coast while I play from Europe, I would certainly play more if it wasn't such an issue.\n\nLast but not least, the cash shop. I'm too low in the game to be able to judge Pay2Win or not, but it does look like it's Pay2Win. This while there's a lot of fluff cosmetic, mounts and eidalons (not sure how severe P2W those are) in it as well.\n\nIn general said YES because I think the game is fun to play...","December 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","1"

I find it difficult to stop playing and want to keep playing to "just finish one more quest!" The only issue i have is that it was not 100% clear how to fight. I found out through trial and error that it was the right-click on the mouse to attack as well as do other things. Despite that it is a very addicting game and i'm having so much fun playing it!\n\nEdit 30/12/2015: Since writing this review i have now gotten to level 58 and i'm currently working toward unlocking the sky tower at level 60. I stand by my comment that it's a game that you want to just keep playing to just "finish one more quest". As for the issue i mentioned about the controls i have since realised that all controls can be found here: http://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com/game/controls along with tips and all sorts of other bits of help for the game which makes it easier to both complete quests and to know what you are doing. The graphics are really good, the costumes are cute, the game is comples with several different main locations (almost like floors in a dungeon really) as well as several dungeons to play in as well. There are quests you can do on your own and quests you can do with others. I quite like the sound of the guardian knight feature as well - though i have yet to actually try it.

In addition to numerous unaddressed launcher and login issues, you will be lucky to even make it to the login screen in this nightmare. The forums are filled with other users pleading for help that never comes. As a fairly popular MMO that has recently been added to steam, it makes you wonder what the team behind Aura Kingdom is doing with their time and money. That being said, the game itself is nothing special. The tacky writing in the tuturial is enough to make any self respecting gamer cringe. Combat is mind numbingly easy and thoughtless, offering little in terms of interesting gameplay. Movement is awkward unless you enjoy point and click styles you would find in any RTS.

The Graphic is Good, better than many game out there. Design in Anime style is so advantage to attract many players. Music is Nice. Storyline is pretty interesting and Finally, Battle is Outstanding. From skill to skill, you can serve your enemy with the Cool-Connecting Combo up on your style. Stack up DPS or Screw the enemy with 1st and 2nd Combination Ultimate Skill.\n\nClass Balance is Great. No MP or SP to worry because the cool down time is the only thing you must consider, to manage your fighting rhythm....The Best Combo System I ever play.\n\nChoose the Player Class and build up your own character, gender and face and Side Kick Eidolon. and Play out the DEJAVU opening style mission, Pretty interesting opening intro stage. So you can try out many class in the very first stage and change it if you want to try other play style.\nBut if you climb up to Over 50Lv, things will go more harder in many way. That's mean if you put your effort fight all the way til Lv50, the real battle just begin from this place. (Some player quit, Some player continue)\n\nOne of The Best F2P. You can use (Real) money to buy stuff if you want but basically, you can get almost of them by your effort....kinda hard but still has a chance.\nThe Only annoying thing is BOT.....Just leave them alone or turn off the [other player invisible] button. (Or steal their kill count is the fast way to end the quest too)\n\nOne Best thing and the last is [PANTIEs] ! Many type of girl and many kind of Pantie they put on (YES, SO ANIME).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beefster/recommended/268420/","beefster","beefster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beefster/","33 products in account","I played this game a lot, for 3 days. i'm not sure if i'm going to keep playing.\n\nIf you've played WoW, you can tell this game took a lot of cues from there. In a few ways this game is actually better than WoW, however, the only reason you should play this over WoW is if you want to save money or just really want something Anime themed.\n\nLeveling up starts out extremely fast and i like that. i wanted to get to the end game content fast. I wanted to reach level cap asap and start PvPing. As you quest, you learn new abilities at a good pace, you can easily auto-path from one place to another so it flows really well. quest path is linear so it's pretty much going along for a ride, slaying mobs and gathering items like nobody's business. there is a ton of dialog, i skipped as much as i could, seeing as it's not exactly a riveting story in my opinion.\n\nThe UI could stand a lot of improvement. it's somewhat customizable but not nearly as much as i'd like. The graphics are ok, the anti aliasing sucks and i can't configure it with the Nvidia control panel but i used sweetFX and it looks better. you can tell the game is optimized for japaneze localization as a lot of the english text is awkward, not fitting into its box, missing spaces, etc. it was translated pretty well but the ui is just not quite optimal for english it seems.\n\nThe class system is neat, you pick a main class and then when you hit level 40 you pick a secondary class and start learning those abilities. those abilities have longer cooldowns, however, and don't benefit from your masteries or talent specs.\n\nAnyway, the reason i am losing interest is because as i hit level 60, the game became extremely grind-y. the pace of leveling drastically slows down, and until level 62 you're basically just doing dailies. your Eidolon, basically a combat pet that everyone has, doesn't level with you, you ahve to feed it XP crystals, and having fed one that was almost my same level since around 30, with every xp crystal i had got my hands on until then, it still fell behind. There are a lot of things you have to grind items for in this game, that's one of them. you can buy or farm for these XP crystals, "secret stones," scrolls and shards, crafting ingredients, etc... a lot like WoW, but it's just not clear at all on the best way to farm or grind for this stuff, and when you do figure it out it's disappointing how long it will take.\n\nthe game makes money with an in-game shop where you can pay real money to get stuff, not that it's p2w but you can save a lot of farming and grinding from there.\n\nSo at level 60 i decided to see if i could stop leveling and just start PvPing. then i discovered that pvp is split into only two tiers: 60 and below and above 60. and battlegrounds are scheduled, with 3-4 occurring per day. so to farm honor points for pvp gear you can't just queue into BGs over and over, you have to log in at the right time. and before you get this gear, you're going to get eaten alive in the arena events and such.\n\nas PvP is my favorite thing to do in these games, i was really hoping to be able to jump in and get decent pvp gear before too long, but there's just not a good way to farm "war coins" and "valor coins" at all, to get the gear. Not to mention the game's content is pretty much capped out at 60 even though the level cap is 80, so i have no clue how people get to level 80 seeing as it's taking forever to get just 10% of the way to level 61.\n\nthe game went from super fast-paced and easy to ridiculously slow and confusing. and the pvp system sucks. so i think i'll just hop in once in a while to do daily quests and large battlegrounds when i can until i finally have decent pvp gear and can actually have some fun.\n\n","March 18, 2015","false","41.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyneFan/recommended/268420/","UndyneFan","☾Zombie † Queen☽","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyneFan/","107 products in account","I've been playing a lot more than it says I have on Steam, but I recently downloaded it again from Steam because I'm weird like that and I like all my games to be in Steam if possible.\nAnyways, this is a real gem in an ocean of crap F2P games.\n\nGood:\n--------------------------\nAwesome story that makes sense and is easy to follow\n\nBeautiful world, amazing attention to detail and a real joy to just look around\n\nThe things you can buy from the store can also be earned (usually in several different ways) from in-game things as well or you can easily and *safely* earn free Aeria Points by installing and playing apps on your phone or watching a minute long video.\n\nTranslation is spot on.  I haven't seen any issues and usually with games like this half the quest text makes 0 sense.\n\nAs you progress you have several ways of changing and making yourself better.  From talent trees to mastering skills to adding gems, enchants and fortifying armor and weapons.\n\nGreat sense of humor.\n\nA lot of classes to choose from which are not sex locked.\n\nLots of different looks without even mentioning costumes and dyes and all of that, I'm just talking about character creation.\n\nEvery day you log back in you are greeted with a free present and your Eidolon as well.\n\nEidolons.  These are exceptionally well done "battle pets" (bascially) with stories and personalities all of their own.  They don't just level, you help them to level and to better themselves as you progress as well.  Not only are there several to choose from or earn but they all have their own way of speaking, seeing the world and battling.  Some are healers, others plain warriors and so on.  They can be evolved at certain levels with the right items, given items to up their stats permanently, you have conversations with them on a regular basis and they give you great gifts which can help both of you a lot in the long run.  This is by far, one of the most impressive battle pets systems I have ever seen in any game, and it's free to play!\n\nAuto-route.  I have no idea why, some people see this as a bad thing but I don't understand that at all.  You can open the map up, find a specific NPC and just run to them without having to worry.  I don't see a problem with this and with all of the other types of games I have played, I just see it as it's own game mechanic.  You don't have an "auto kill everything" feature so it isn't game breaking in the least.  If you don't like it, just don't use it.  I see this as only a plus and will not name this as a con for any reason.\n\nThe way they did quests is not only pretty clever, it's also very fun.  When you approach an NPC and click on them to start a quest a small box will take over your screen.  You can then watch the interaction between your character and the NPC as they engage in quest conversation.  It's really cute, allows you to cut off the rest of the MMO world for a moment to get into what you are doing and also lets you see the amount of emotions displayed in a really fun way.  I really like it.\n\nI've played four different classes, all of which had spells and attacks that were very different from one another.  Battle Bow looks nothing like another class, which some of these F2P MMOs do and it is very boring.  The attacks and spells in this game are vibrant, fun, fast-paced and well thought out.  You cannot just mash buttons either, which I really appreciate.  You have a global cooldown on all abilities.  Speaking of abilities, you can do a combo with your Eidolon.  It is unique to each one and does a ton of damage.  Even the healer types have one they can do with you.  Very fun, awesome to watch.\n\nAuto-potions.  I love this feature as well and will not say this is a con either, for any reason.  You don't like it don't use it.  I don't care, I think this is awesome.  What this does is allow you to place whatever type of potions you have in your bags in the Auto-potion slot.  You can then click it "On" and choose a percentage of health in which to have it switch to.  I have mine at 30% and it has seriously helped.  This allows you to focus on the action (you'd just be clicking it anyways, don't waste the global cooldown) while staying somewhat safe.  This does not gaurantee that you will stay alive.  This is not a 100% proof plan against death.  You can still die.  Don't kid yourself.  Some of the daily instances are just mean.  But this feature is just really awesome and I've never seen it before in any MMO.  That I remember.\n\nLots and lots to do.  You have cooking done in a unique fashion, bring items you find randomly around the world to special cooks in the towns and they can help you fuse up something amazing.  Sometimes it's green, sometimes it's orange and you will get an achievement and exp for doing so.  Sometimes it's purple and helps specifically with PvP!  There are thousands of hidden quests and achievements in every area of the game.  From finding green question marked items and finishing the tasks lined up with them, to gathering loyalty points that you can also use in the item mall for lots of really cool items without spending a single penny.  Or chase down the 4-6 unique monsters in each area and turn in their pots to the city/village jailer for extra goodies and more achievements/titles.\n\nEverything on the UI can be moved anywhere you want it.\n\nThe UI itself is great looking and you can even shrink or enlarge all of the elements.\n\nLots of different ways of doing quests.  I have noticed some people saying it's the same as many other MMOs and there is a lot of grinding.  I don't think this is true at all.  Yes, you kill enemies and you collect items but there is a LOT more than just that going on.  Sometimes you are dodging the eyes of the bad guys trying to get through a dungeon or winning over the baddy in order to help you later on.  Planting bombs, fishing, sneaking through very dangerous areas.  There's more than just the normal amount of "kill this" and "collect that".  Plus, it actually makes 100% sense as to WHY you are doing it.  it isn't just "my farm is in danger kill 5000 beetles".  You are killing those things and collecting those items in order to help finish a much bigger picture which I think is really cool.  The kill quests and collection items aren't over done either.  At most I have been asked to kill 10 things at one time.  Not a big deal to me at all.\n\nAuto join a guild, get benefits and never be bothered.  Or bother them and start a conversation.  It's literally up to you.  I love this feature, I wish every game had something like this.\n\n----------------------\nBad:\n\nNot a lot of character slots available, only three without paying.\n\nBots.  They aren't a huge deal and literally only sit in one place of each zone that I have noticed, but it's really annoying.  They are always the guys with the big cannon looking things, I can't remember the name of the class.  They all look the exactg same and have ridiculous names.  Just annoying.\n\nSometimes it is a little too easy.  You feel like you are just sweeping through everything.  This could be a good thing to some, I don't see it that way though so am only naming it as a con.  I would like there to be much more challenge.  The daily instances offer something more, but only rarely and for the most part they aren't too hard either.\n\nBag space.  They will give you bags and stuff from time to time and all but really there isn't much at all.  Especially your bank.  It is TINY and I really hate that.  You have a shared bank which is awesome but it is just too small.\n\nCooking things requires far too much money.  I don't spend my money on much else really.  I get items from dungeons and such and don't want to spend it on AH crap or personal sellers.  But fusing together some cooked chicken costs much too much.\n\nYou share Eidolons with your account.  This can be good and bad.","October 16, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/megasourusrex/recommended/268420/","megasourusrex","Megasourusrex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/megasourusrex/","13 products in account","A beautiful game!\nInstead of putting a whole paragraph on how I love it, I'll just put some points down on what I really liked about it. I will also put some kind of not-so-great things here as well, so you can see if this is the game for you!\n\nPros:\n\n1. The scenery itself is very beautiful! Each town and area has their own little thing and you can explore all of the beautiful sights!\n\n2. The enemies are very adorable! Now this isn't much of a pro to the game since enemy style doesn't really tell how good a game is, but I thought to put it out there. I feel bad killing a lot of the enemies because of how cute they are.\n\n3. There are 3 servers in a game. Each server is seperate so you can make 3 characters per server. In total, you can have 9 characters. I am a person that likes to try a lot of different classes, so this is great for me! If you're like that too, you'll love this! I know from my experience of different MMORPGs that a lot of games don't really allow this kind of thing. The only one I can remember was Fiesta online did this. I know there are a couple more out there that I don't remember. But this one does that kind of thing, so I think it's great!\n\n4.  The character design for your character and the NPCs are so adorable! I really like the character customization on this game. While there isn't too much to the customization, it's enough to make nice characters, in my opionion! I wasn't expecting something like this to have PS2 Online super ultra customization, but I was surprised to how much there was in it. So overall, its a great player maker!\n\n5. There are so many quests! Many of them are not fighting-based either, so you won't always be running around doing the same thing over and over again. You set up traps, deliver things, make things, etc. Of course, though, there will always be more fighting than, lets say, delivery quests. But, the small difference in routine gives it a little more fun! It even has a stroy questline to it as well!\n\n6. You get an ostrich. That's right. You get to ride an ostrich. This also doesn't make a game 100% better, but I think it's pretty cool that your free mount is an ostrich.\n\n7. Another thing I like about this game is it has such a friendly environment! Many times have I made a character and at a low-level, higher ups have me join their guild or party to help me out thinking I'm extremely new. I have not once gotten into an argument with anyone. The community is great in my opinion. I'm not sure if others would agree with me because everyone has their own experiences with other people in MMORPGs, but my experience has been good so far. I'm hoping it is like this for everyone!\n\n8. You can get something called "loyalty points" through out the game that you can use to "buy" costumes! Loyalty points are free, but a little difficult to get a lot. But if you're determined and do a lot of easedropping on NPCs, you'll rack up those loyalty points and get that cool costume you wanted! They also have another point system that you actually have to pay money to get, but I think that it's great that the game developers let the people who don't pay money on games have a chance to get something cool!\n\n---\n\nCons:\n\n1. This game does get kind of repetitive. Even though they have different quests thats not all fighting, they are usually "get __ amount of __" kind of quests. My higher up is aroung level 36 if I remember, and it's getting a little boring aroung there. However I do sometimes continue to log on and play. They do have "fame quests" and "daily quests" that they put up if you don't feel like doing the same old quests. (<---maybe should have put that in pros?)\n\n2. It is a point-and-click stlyled fighting game. You do have hot keys for your abilities, but for the most part, it's a point-and-click. If you're not a fan of that style of fighting in an MMORPG, then you'll probably get bored very fast.\n\n3. Laggy a bit. This might just be for me and my dumb computer. But if you have just a general computer or laptop, you may experience some lag (not too much of it unless you're in a crowded area, but thats normal for every crowded MMORPG). The cutscenes don't work for me because of it. It may be different for you though! So don't stress over this point too much.\n\n4. Some quests require you have a party of 3. If you are a solo player like me, that may serve a problem in trying to find and work the courage to work with people. There is a party finder so you can form parties for just the dungeon. However, for me, I like doing things alone and forming parties is awkward because then I have to figure out if I should leave the party or if they still want to work together, etc. So if you're a solo player, some of these moments might not be for you.\n\n5. Very easy. This could be a pro as well if you like things easy. Bosses are not that hard, enemies are farley easy. (I've killed an enemy about 3 or 4 levels above me with not a problem). So if you like easy MMORPGs, this is for you. But if you like a challange, this may not be it.\n\n---\n\nOverall, in my opinion, I really like this game and I think, despite the cons, I will continue to play this game. It's very beautiful and the scenery and characters are very well made. Even though quests become a routine, they have daily quests and fame quests that break the routine a little bit. If there was a 10 rating, i think it would go about 8.5/10. I would reccomend people to give this a try and see if it is their cup of tea.","October 17, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This ques gives you enough XP to almost hit lvl 41. The main attraction of the end game is the Sky Tower, where on the weekend you can form parties and take the tower floor by floor as the bosses get harder and harder. Never before have i had to grind so hard on an mmo, the content cap is around lvl 62 and the max level is 75 currently. Quests around this lvl tend to give you around %1 of the xp towards the next level. Dungeons are the way forward from this point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EntroSRL/recommended/268420/","EntroSRL","Entro (Purple Heart)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EntroSRL/","175 products in account","An Anime style MMO that I really wish I knew about sooner.\n\nI was surprised that when I gave this game a try (made a Scythe,) that it managed to pull me in very fast, with nothing but enjoyment. I haven't had an Anime style MMO do this to me in so long since Phantasy Star Online 2 when it was in Open Beta. I played Mabinogi for a solid two years, but I just lost any enjoyment I had with that game, because of how Pay to Win it was, along with how ignorant and elitist the Community is for all of Nexon's published Games.\n\nHowever, even though this game did pull me in, and I have enjoyed the almost 80 hours I have put into it, it definitely does have some flaws (All MMOs have flaws.)\n\nPros:\n\n-Classes: I took a look at what each of the classes do before I decided to start my journey, and while they all performed pretty well in what I have seen from Youtube, I decided to go with the Scythe, because I love Ranged DPS (This will also be a Con,) and I love that the Pets you summon give you benefits depending on which 3 of the 6 demons are summoned.  It's definitely crazy how high your Crit and Speed gets along the way, especially around level 55.\n-Outfits: A lot of the outfits in this game are definitely what you would expect from an Anime-style MMO (Especially for Female characters, which I chose for my Scythe). I listed this as a Pro, because while you only get a certain amount of Costumes from doing the Main Storyline in each are, there are actually a lot of Outfits in this game that you can also get from other sources. There aren't that many Costumes on the Shop either, which is also a plus, because it isn't Pay to Dress up.\n-Fishing: Yes, Fishing. The bane of every one's existence in pretty much every MMO. The one skill that will leave you bored for hours. Believe it or not, but in Aura Kingdom, Fishing is actually VERY useful, and profitable. As you fish, you can come across Fish in your inventory that when opened, can give EXP, Items for your Eidilons to feed them, Fusion materials for Orange quality Fishing Gear, Weapon Chests, and for some very odd reason, Costumes. Yes. You can get Costumes from Fishing. Most of them are not worth selling, but if you get the Custom variants (Orange,) you're going to easily pocket 50+ Gold just by selling it on the Auction House. Fishing is very profitable because you can sell the Costumes you get (low chance to get them though,) and you can open the Weapon Chests to get Weapons that you can sell to Vendors for about 100 - 200 silver (especially when you get the Level 60 Weapon Chests in the 60 areas. It's actually one of your two main sources for making income at Level 60+, unless you run the end game dungeons and get lucky on drops.\n-Community: You don't know how incredibly hard it is for some one of my status to list the Community as a Pro for an MMO. I have been a part of the MMO Community since Everquest, and while every single one of them suffer from the typical cesspool players and elitists, Aura Kingdom so far has been very tame, and friendly. Other than the Dimensional Halls, I have not done any Party Dungeons at all while I was leveling, but every Dimensional Hall party I was in was just friendly in general.\n-Soundtrack: While the Soundtrack itself does get repetitive quick in-game, and some times reused in different areas (especially for the Daily Fame / Emergency Quests,) it definitely has some that you will probably like. Candeo Core's Soundtrack is so far my favorite.\n-Cash Shop: Other than Runescape's Cash Shop, and Phantasy Star Online 2's, this is one of the Cash Shops that contain VERY LITTLE Pay-to-win aspects to it. You can get Weapon / Armor Fortifications and Eidolons from the Cash Shop, but you will easily get Fortifications while questing, doing dungeons, or from doing the Dailies each and every day. The Eidolons on the other hand, is pretty much like Mabinogi's Gachapons. You have a chance to receive a certain Eidolon's Key in order to obtain them, or Fragments to combine a bunch later on into a Key. This isn't really Pay-to-Win because you can obtain Eidolons from doing the Eidolon Temple, Guild Hall, or Abyss / Otherworld dungeons when they reset.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Story: MMOs usually fall into one of two categories when it comes to Story. It either succeeds very well with it, and engages you, or you just want to hate it. Unfortunately, the Story in Aura Kingdom falls under this category. Other than the Tutorial area and Port Skandia, every Main Storyline in the rest of the areas is literally the same thing. This Town needs you to retrieve what was stolen. This town has a competition and needs you to help to get what you need. Alliances need to be formed. Yada yada. Pretty much when you are doing the quests in Aura Kingdom, you're better off just speeding through the Dialogue so you can get from one area to the next.\n-Generic Quests: You know those Kill / Collect quests you LOVE so much from other MMOs, especially World of Warcraft? That's literally around 95% of the questing you will do. If the Anime Style of this Game, the Soundtrack, or the classes don't keep you in the game, this most certainly won't.\n-Classes: "But wait, Entro. You already put Classes in the Pros. Why is it in the Cons?" The main reason why is it also listed as a Con, is because of the Dungeon aspect. I will be blunt when I say this: At level 60+, if you are ANY Melee Class that is not a Guardian, don't expect to find any Parties, unless you're running with a Guild. Bosses in the end-game dungeons are VERY unforgiving to those in Melee Range, and you will die incredibly fast unless you are a Guardian, which is the Tank Class of Aura Kingdom.\n-Telegraphed Attacks: Pretty much all you will notice from Dungeon Elites / Bosses in this game is that they have Telegraphed Attacks, and a lot of them at that. I like being able to go into a dungeon blind and expecting some thing difficult, and figuring out how to dodge after I learn a bosses' given moveset. What I don't like is when it colors the Ground to basically show you "Don't stand here or you will get hit." This kind of feature is what pushes me away from MMOs with it included, because it takes out most of the fun and learning of dungeons right out of the game. Granted, enemies and bosses can still melee, cast spells or ranged at you normally, along with debuffing, but for the most part, you'll mostly see Telegraphed Attacks.\n-Eidolons: While leveling, you will get a total of three Eidolons that will accompany you. You can have only one out at a time, which is fair considering how strong they are (mainly their Special which is on a 1 minute cooldown.) The problem though, is that unless you are extremely lucky and RNG plays in your favor, you won't get more than the three default Eidolons for a long time. When you do every thing I listed in the Pros, either killing the boss or fighting the Eidolon and succeeding gives you a chance (very low) that the Eidolon will acknowledge your skills and join your party. While that is a nice feature, your only focus is pretty much just to level up the stats and levels of one of your Eidolons, specifically Sigrun (the second Eidolon,) since she is tanky, and can keep most of the aggro on her, until you start hitting and critting like crazy.\n-Leveling and difficulty: If you tough out the quests and the dungeons, Leveling actually goes by very fast. It begins to slow down at 45, again at 55, and then 60 - 70 turns into every Korean MMOs' long grind. For me personally, it took me 40 hours of on and off play to level up to 60, which when you look at it, isn't actually a bad grind, but if you don't like how the quests are, it will draw you away quickly. I never died once while leveling either, which is a bummer because I was hoping for more difficulty.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10. For me, I would still recommend it to my friends that like these kind of Anime-style MMOs.","January 22, 2015","true","99.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The characters are cute, the combat system is straight forward, and the quests and auto-routing makes this game, basically play itself.\n\nNow I'm not new to mmos, and I have played countless types of various styles and this one really caught my attention. What I like the most is that it's super easy to level up on your own, and you don't really have to rely on others. I've played other MMOs, where I simply couldn't progress on my own cause well, the character I made just wasn't fast/strong enough to gain the exp. Clerics suck, just saying but, I also can't play non-clerics/squishy characters.\n\nI also like how, you don't have to work as hard to level up to get those cooler looking skills, or in other words, you get to get those cool skills at the get go. Cause that's a major selling point for me, I'm all about the graphics and how flashy and cool you get to make your character.\n\nThe edioleons are super cool, wish there was more of a way to pick which ones you get, or at least raise the chances of getting the one you want. If there is, well... I guess I haven't looked into it enough. But I'm also not the type to like grind for hours in the same dungeon to get something super rare however what I noticed from dungeoning it probably won't take too much time to get that shiny armour you want. Anyone willing to do that, super props to you. I never know how you do it.\n\nOther cool features are the gliding, the duel class option at level 40, dungeons and auto-loot pick up are super useful and that there is a pretty extensive fishing option. Armour and Weapon fortification is pretty simple too, making anyone able to upgrade their stuff; takes a lot of resources, but it's still fun and you're not likely going to loose your stuff if it fails. All of these I find super awesome cause these are stuff I wish was found in other games.\n\nTL;DR for pros:\nsuper easy to play on your own, has everything you can want in a game that you probably wouldn't have thought of. I barely scratched the surface of this game, and I bet it's even better when you dig deeper.\n\nNow what I don't like, and I don't know if this is just me, but I have played this game with a friend, and even though we were both playing the game, it didn't really feel like we played together. We were both just running about on our own, and talking in between when we were stuck. I'm super social when it comes to ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes, but the fact that there isn't the shared loot pickup for quests, or that exp isn't shared between us, it really feels like a solo game. The best you can do is just stand around and kill stuff while waiting for your friend. And a lot of the quests are specifically solo anyways.\n\nWhat also bothered me is the mouse controls. You get used to them as you play (not really) but the two camera functions can really hinder you in a bind. Like one camera simply rotates around your character, and the other one actually makes your character turn with it. So like I know during boss fights, I turn my camera a lot to look at different angles, but I don't nessecarily need my character to be turnt around too cause some skills require them to be facing a monster. So with that, sometimes I would need to run away to get out of a red zone, and I find myself using the wrong camera move, and I just have my character running backwards super slowly, and usually on the verge of death now. (I'm not the type to click-to-move) And some mobs jump around a lot so you need that camera moving.\n\nAnd another is the skill keys hot-bar. There are waaaay too many skills to fit on one hot bar and it's inconvient how they only go up to 8. I used to it going up to the "=" key. Plus with the eidoleon skills, mounts, glide features and other stuff I can't remember, you are't left with a lot of space, especially when the second class comes into play. So you're left with like maybe 4 of your favourite skills from each class.\n\nTL;DR for the cons:\nIt doesn't feel as social of a game going by my standards. There isn't that sense of playing with friends, but just having them on the side (but thats not too bad). The mouse controls are super annoying and the hot-bars don't have enough space and can get pretty cluttered.\n\nOverall:\nI would totally recommend. There's a lot I complained about, but really they don't affect gameplay that much. If you know what you're doing it's pretty meaningless.\n\n10/10","January 6, 2015","true","35.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EntroSRL/recommended/268420/","EntroSRL","Entro (Purple Heart)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EntroSRL/","175 products in account","An Anime style MMO that I really wish I knew about sooner.\n\nI was surprised that when I gave this game a try (made a Scythe,) that it managed to pull me in very fast, with nothing but enjoyment. I haven't had an Anime style MMO do this to me in so long since Phantasy Star Online 2 when it was in Open Beta. I played Mabinogi for a solid two years, but I just lost any enjoyment I had with that game, because of how Pay to Win it was, along with how ignorant and elitist the Community is for all of Nexon's published Games.\n\nHowever, even though this game did pull me in, and I have enjoyed the almost 80 hours I have put into it, it definitely does have some flaws (All MMOs have flaws.)\n\nPros:\n\n-Classes: I took a look at what each of the classes do before I decided to start my journey, and while they all performed pretty well in what I have seen from Youtube, I decided to go with the Scythe, because I love Ranged DPS (This will also be a Con,) and I love that the Pets you summon give you benefits depending on which 3 of the 6 demons are summoned.  It's definitely crazy how high your Crit and Speed gets along the way, especially around level 55.\n-Outfits: A lot of the outfits in this game are definitely what you would expect from an Anime-style MMO (Especially for Female characters, which I chose for my Scythe). I listed this as a Pro, because while you only get a certain amount of Costumes from doing the Main Storyline in each are, there are actually a lot of Outfits in this game that you can also get from other sources. There aren't that many Costumes on the Shop either, which is also a plus, because it isn't Pay to Dress up.\n-Fishing: Yes, Fishing. The bane of every one's existence in pretty much every MMO. The one skill that will leave you bored for hours. Believe it or not, but in Aura Kingdom, Fishing is actually VERY useful, and profitable. As you fish, you can come across Fish in your inventory that when opened, can give EXP, Items for your Eidilons to feed them, Fusion materials for Orange quality Fishing Gear, Weapon Chests, and for some very odd reason, Costumes. Yes. You can get Costumes from Fishing. Most of them are not worth selling, but if you get the Custom variants (Orange,) you're going to easily pocket 50+ Gold just by selling it on the Auction House. Fishing is very profitable because you can sell the Costumes you get (low chance to get them though,) and you can open the Weapon Chests to get Weapons that you can sell to Vendors for about 100 - 200 silver (especially when you get the Level 60 Weapon Chests in the 60 areas. It's actually one of your two main sources for making income at Level 60+, unless you run the end game dungeons and get lucky on drops.\n-Community: You don't know how incredibly hard it is for some one of my status to list the Community as a Pro for an MMO. I have been a part of the MMO Community since Everquest, and while every single one of them suffer from the typical cesspool players and elitists, Aura Kingdom so far has been very tame, and friendly. Other than the Dimensional Halls, I have not done any Party Dungeons at all while I was leveling, but every Dimensional Hall party I was in was just friendly in general.\n-Soundtrack: While the Soundtrack itself does get repetitive quick in-game, and some times reused in different areas (especially for the Daily Fame / Emergency Quests,) it definitely has some that you will probably like. Candeo Core's Soundtrack is so far my favorite.\n-Cash Shop: Other than Runescape's Cash Shop, and Phantasy Star Online 2's, this is one of the Cash Shops that contain VERY LITTLE Pay-to-win aspects to it. You can get Weapon / Armor Fortifications and Eidolons from the Cash Shop, but you will easily get Fortifications while questing, doing dungeons, or from doing the Dailies each and every day. The Eidolons on the other hand, is pretty much like Mabinogi's Gachapons. You have a chance to receive a certain Eidolon's Key in order to obtain them, or Fragments to combine a bunch later on into a Key. This isn't really Pay-to-Win because you can obtain Eidolons from doing the Eidolon Temple, Guild Hall, or Abyss / Otherworld dungeons when they reset.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Story: MMOs usually fall into one of two categories when it comes to Story. It either succeeds very well with it, and engages you, or you just want to hate it. Unfortunately, the Story in Aura Kingdom falls under this category. Other than the Tutorial area and Port Skandia, every Main Storyline in the rest of the areas is literally the same thing. This Town needs you to retrieve what was stolen. This town has a competition and needs you to help to get what you need. Alliances need to be formed. Yada yada. Pretty much when you are doing the quests in Aura Kingdom, you're better off just speeding through the Dialogue so you can get from one area to the next.\n-Generic Quests: You know those Kill / Collect quests you LOVE so much from other MMOs, especially World of Warcraft? That's literally around 95% of the questing you will do. If the Anime Style of this Game, the Soundtrack, or the classes don't keep you in the game, this most certainly won't.\n-Classes: "But wait, Entro. You already put Classes in the Pros. Why is it in the Cons?" The main reason why is it also listed as a Con, is because of the Dungeon aspect. I will be blunt when I say this: At level 60+, if you are ANY Melee Class that is not a Guardian, don't expect to find any Parties, unless you're running with a Guild. Bosses in the end-game dungeons are VERY unforgiving to those in Melee Range, and you will die incredibly fast unless you are a Guardian, which is the Tank Class of Aura Kingdom.\n-Telegraphed Attacks: Pretty much all you will notice from Dungeon Elites / Bosses in this game is that they have Telegraphed Attacks, and a lot of them at that. I like being able to go into a dungeon blind and expecting some thing difficult, and figuring out how to dodge after I learn a bosses' given moveset. What I don't like is when it colors the Ground to basically show you "Don't stand here or you will get hit." This kind of feature is what pushes me away from MMOs with it included, because it takes out most of the fun and learning of dungeons right out of the game. Granted, enemies and bosses can still melee, cast spells or ranged at you normally, along with debuffing, but for the most part, you'll mostly see Telegraphed Attacks.\n-Eidolons: While leveling, you will get a total of three Eidolons that will accompany you. You can have only one out at a time, which is fair considering how strong they are (mainly their Special which is on a 1 minute cooldown.) The problem though, is that unless you are extremely lucky and RNG plays in your favor, you won't get more than the three default Eidolons for a long time. When you do every thing I listed in the Pros, either killing the boss or fighting the Eidolon and succeeding gives you a chance (very low) that the Eidolon will acknowledge your skills and join your party. While that is a nice feature, your only focus is pretty much just to level up the stats and levels of one of your Eidolons, specifically Sigrun (the second Eidolon,) since she is tanky, and can keep most of the aggro on her, until you start hitting and critting like crazy.\n-Leveling and difficulty: If you tough out the quests and the dungeons, Leveling actually goes by very fast. It begins to slow down at 45, again at 55, and then 60 - 70 turns into every Korean MMOs' long grind. For me personally, it took me 40 hours of on and off play to level up to 60, which when you look at it, isn't actually a bad grind, but if you don't like how the quests are, it will draw you away quickly. I never died once while leveling either, which is a bummer because I was hoping for more difficulty.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10. For me, I would still recommend it to my friends that like these kind of Anime-style MMOs.","January 22, 2015","true","99.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/endlesspersonalandbruh/recommended/268420/","endlesspersonalandbruh","MelodicChirps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/endlesspersonalandbruh/","48 products in account","At first, I really liked Aura Kingdom. It's bright, colorful, has very engaging combat, and is, just in general, fun.... but only for the first two levels (Or 'locations.') Later in the game, you start to wonder "What the hell am I doing and what does any of this have to do with the story?" This will happen A LOT.\n\nHere's an example from one of the earlier quests where such an instance first appears. You need to make medicen for your character because he/she passed out. Well, you need antilope blood. Okay, fine. But you need to kill six of the giant creatures for their blood. WHAT THE HELL? HOW MUCH BLOOD DOES THIS DOCTOR NEED FOR LITTLE OL' ME?!\n\nThis is fine in those quests where the particular creature you're killing needs to be driven out of the area, but when you need to collect items from them? It's VERY monotonous. Another reason this sucks is that, when you're collecting items from creatures, there is a 20% chance that you will actually get the item you need. As a rough estimate, if you have to kill 4 fish to get scales, you'll probably have to kill 8 fish to get the four sets of scales. This becomes even worse when, in higher level areas, you have to kill 7 and 14 creatures to gather the specified number of itmes you need to complete a "Main Quest" that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the story. This makes playing the game the way your suppose to a chore.\n\nAnother problem this game has is its dungeons. These are usually big cave-like areas where you fight large waves of monsters. Most Dungeons require the player to be in a party of three to actually activate it. This would be fine if players in this game were actually considerate. No one wants anything to do with you unless you wear expensive costumes and hats, or have the best mounts and weapons. It's like, if Team Fortress 2 met World of Warcraft in a very ill-considerate and rude way. This is most evident, unfortunatly, for players who speak english. My first language is english and my spanish is a little rusty (But little to no spanish speaking players play this game anyway) meaning I am stuck dealing with the ruder end of the player pool, which is the dominant end. The worst part is these dungeons are REQUIRED to finish the story. Which means you could be stuck for a LONG time on the same main quest, not because you cannot defeat the enemies because they, themselves, are quite easy, but because no one wants to join you. Making friends in this game is hard for the same reason, even if the player is a noob at the same time you are and has the first constume as well.\n\nIn all, Aura Kingdom is a game with lovely visuals, fun combat, a promising story, rude and selfish majority players, monotonus quests and pointless quests.

I love the customization, and I think the anime style is very cute. I personally prefer PvE, so I don't know much about PvP in this game. But, I can tell you the PvE is very fun and will have you hooked.\n\nThe quest line is good. There's always something for you to do, from any level. I have kept mostly to the main quest line, but I've done a side quest here and there (though personally I have found that you dont really need to do them, as your level should stay consistent with the difficulty).\n\nOverall I really like this game, and would give it a 9/10 (minus one star because of the repetition).","December 11, 2015","true","50.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The grafix and clothing design are sick, but you have to spend money to get it like all the great mounts and extra clothing (so that sucks).  The battlegrounds are a waste to even try, you will just get ♥♥♥♥♥ even with full pvp gear. If you are lvl 50 they will still put you up with lvl 70 players they all one hit you, so its a shamefull 15min, its die spawn repeat or you just wait out the time and cant do anything.  This game you have to have lots of friends or you wont be able to do any party runs at your level, very hard getting people randomly to join you. For a anima fan the clothing you get visually makes this great eye candy and the spells and attacks animation are very well done. Overal not bad game but you will have to spend to look great and you need friends who can play with you at the same time lines.

Quite literally.\n\nEveryone's' username relates to Sword Art Online, also known as ♥♥♥♥ Autism Online. That and all the users name their character 'Something_Waifu_Something'. What's worse is the fact that the game features 12 year old girls that are barely clothed and apparently adult 'men'predominantly play this sorry excuse of a video game? The characters are thus catered to pedophiles, maybe the game developer's fathers should've sprayed on a tissue... At any rate, all story missions are repetitive as can be and offer no variety of any kind. 'Go speak to X to report on your mission progress, then proceed to kill 5 of X and make 5 of X and speak to X again to claim your reward.'  Yeah, very engaging story missions. In addition to that the music is also repetitive and the graphic is a massive let-down. But whatever, if weebs are too pre-occupied playing this pedo-bait then I am happy, it keeps them off games that require more than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a mommy to spoonfeed them.\n\nGod bless the United States of America.","August 19, 2015","false","54.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","6"

I personally love leveling up, but i wish i can make some friends :(\n\nOkay, so what you need to know :\n\n\nThis game is, of course, an MMORPG. You create your player with a selection of 12 classes. After you selected your character features, you have to choose your eidolon. Eidolons are basically partners that stay with you on your journey ( Pokemon-ish lol ). You begin the game in a dimensional belt or something. You fight your way to the boss. Somehow you end up in a small town next to the ocean. You have to complete some tasks for the people. After this, you move on to the next area, then the next and so on. The max level is 80 I believe, and once you reach over 70, your level turns into ??. I've been playing for a long time, and honestly, I love this game so much. If you would like to meet me in-game go ahead, but ofc you would have to be my friend, or if you already are, well you get the point.\n\nOkay well I hope this helped. And yes, I recommend this game DONT ASK ME QUESTIONS STEAM MY GOSH.......\n\nSorry steam was asking me if i recommend this game. Well bye bye!\n\nIt's kind of hard to list pros and cons since this game never ends. But everything for this game on a scale from 1-10, I say this game rates a 7. I'm very addicted to it..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsWhatYouChoose/recommended/268420/","ItsWhatYouChoose","Wateeeeeer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsWhatYouChoose/","11 products in account","BEFORE I START OFF WITH MY REVIEW I WANNA SAY THAT THOSE POSITIVE REMARKS YOU SEE ARE ALL BASED OFF PLAYERS WHO PLAY FOR ONLY VERY FEW HOURS WHICH IS THE JOY AURA KINGDOM WOULD BRING TO YOU BUT ONLY FOR THE VERY FIRST WEEK THAT YOU START. AFTER THAT, YOU GET BORED EASILY OR FEEL DEMOTIVATED TO EVEN PLAY ANYMORE.\n\nIf any of you are planning to start this game. Please read my review first before doing so.  I STRONGLY recommend this game only for the amazing graphics and cartoon-like wonders the game has to offer. You first start off with a basic character and clothes. Everything goes smoothly and you get to earn more costumes/Equipments as you progress. However these costumes and equipments that are given to you from quest drops are REALLY GARBAGE. If you wanna get an awesome item for yourself, be prepared to grind you entire life into it or simply pay to get it quick since the company host is "aeria games", known for extorting money out of people :). Also i have to mention that GRINDING is near impossible now adays due to the fact that you can only get better items out of more difficult dungeons and the rate of getting these impossible items are near 0%. The dungeons require you to ask players to help you out if not, with weak equipments, you get KOed in 1 second by just a normal monster of your level(NOW, IMAGINE WHAT A BOSS WOULD DO). This game also has very severe lag issues with tons of bots constantly flooding you mails. Now, let's go back to the costume segment, you can earn better costumes via loyalty points where you can get it from the paragon table which requires you to trade your loyalty points for the paragon coins. The % of getting a good costume is also very low, thus players will most likely spend money to get more paragon coins. Lastly there is also the sky towers which is like a special dungeon for players that wanna acquire legendary materials and weapons/costumes, which comes with problems like better players only teaming up with themselves and putting passwords. This causes players who just hit the required level to enter these special dungeons not being able to even clear the first level of it since the boss is really very difficult and you need to wear really strong gears to even stand a chance on a frontal assault.\n\n\nCOMBAT SYSTEM:  Combat system is horrible as you watch your character just standing there and spamming their spells and stuffs like that, totally not like dragonest combat system or more advanced ones. It does not require skills to beat boss/mobs/players since you just need better eqs and you can just spam your spells and eat your noodles or snacks meanwhile :)\n\nOverall i do not recommend this game. If you really wanna play this game and not pay to win/get better gears. I recommend you going to the private server of this game which you can find on google. Everything is free there just like extalia. Have fun!","February 2","false","308.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game has a good fantasy feeling to it, unlike other MMORPGs that just make you bored in 5 minutes of gameplay. The game classes contain some awesome gear and interesting spells, especially when you're the new class.\n\nHere are my GOOD sides and my BAD sides:\n\nGOOD:\n1. Class selection is wide ranged, unlike other MMORPGs.\n2. Recieving free gifts each day and a free eidelon (an in-game pet for starters).\n3. Friendly players who communicate kindly (most other MMORPGs aren't like this due to ragers and racism).\n4. The new class is awesomely epic (sorry if awesomely isn't an existing word)\n5. Good gameplay to make a good hour of footage/streaming on.\n6. I've always wanted to see a good fantasy RPG that is like Perfect Worlds but got a better aspect to the gameplay.\n7. The review rating is very positive which means new players every minute.\n8. Noobies get a good teaching tutorial unlike others where they babble on forever.\n9. Last but not least, fantastic graphics and music.\n\nBAD:\n1. Unable to switch what gender the class is (most RPGs allow you to do this, make this an update please).\n2. Some people tend to break all the dungeons which usually crash the game servers. This means that people can't join       fast enough and sometimes can't join at all if they have a bad computer.\n3. Some advanced players will try to 'help' you in to levelling, instead, all they do is leave you in a high level place and you die. This can be annoying because these players are able to persuade with such good passion that loads of players usually get tricked into it and this CAAAN be pretty rageful towards those type of players...\n4. You know what I'm going to say, don't you? The graphics. Sometimes the graphics ARE a bit too powerful for some computers. I usually get gigantic lag spikes but at least I don't freeze like I've been saying with some players.\n5. Some attacking animations are broken. Bad computers usually make the game crash. I've only had one crash for when I was in a guild dungeon raid and I was attempting to use my sorcerer skill which kind of crashed out my game because the attacking animation was broken. This is usually caused when the creator hasn't been bothered or forget to add an actual animation to that specific skill.\n6. Finally, FIX THE SERVERS!!! I'm sick of people messaging my on Steam about how the Aura Kingdom servers are not working and it's all cause of me just because I used this special software to boost up my Aura Kingdom. I message them back saying "It's not my fault the servers ain't working. The software doesn't even affect the servers on Aura Kingdom so stop blaming it on me because it will most likely be a person scamming or exploiting the servers out".\n\nLike, I know Aura Kingdom can't help all these problems due to the game is gettin really popular and sooo many people are trying to join at once-especially at night. Now, I'm never going to stop playing Aura Kingdom due to these problems (I'm going to have to write this quickly because I have a guild dungeon in like 7 minutes and I don't want to miss it because if I do, I'll be kicked out the guild).\n\n-\nRKIDNB (YouTuber)","October 20, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you wish to get all the "cool looking" mounts, clothing, weapons, summons. Don't even waste your time spending money on this game, First of all the instant you buy their points they lock you out of even being able to purchase items. You have to go through a long painful proccess of sending them information through a ticket, which in set they take forever to reply to. Only for them to finally unlock that ascpect of your game so you can purchase things. Now, moving onto the problem. I was in the mindset of wasting my money getting the cool things I wanted in the game to make my character more personally appealing. I found that to be a utter joke with this company, not only did I waste money, but I found out they are scumbags. You go to buy the item, thinking you are going to get what you purchased and no wrong. Instead you click on the icon you obtained for the item and it becomes a treasure luck box pretty much in a sense. In this case you MAY obtain the item you were hoping for, instead I constantly got health pots. I think this is a utter joke, a rip off and a scam. Do NOT label your items as if you were to directly obtain said item, instead make it labeled a luck box and CLEARLY show that you can not be able to obtain the item. Instead of doing it after you buy the item and waste money.","October 8, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

I usually get gigantic lag spikes but at least I don't freeze like I've been saying with some players.\n5. Some attacking animations are broken. Bad computers usually make the game crash. I've only had one crash for when I was in a guild dungeon raid and I was attempting to use my sorcerer skill which kind of crashed out my game because the attacking animation was broken. This is usually caused when the creator hasn't been bothered or forget to add an actual animation to that specific skill.\n6. Finally, FIX THE SERVERS!!! I'm sick of people messaging my on Steam about how the Aura Kingdom servers are not working and it's all cause of me just because I used this special software to boost up my Aura Kingdom. I message them back saying "It's not my fault the servers ain't working. The software doesn't even affect the servers on Aura Kingdom so stop blaming it on me because it will most likely be a person scamming or exploiting the servers out".\n\nLike, I know Aura Kingdom can't help all these problems due to the game is gettin really popular and sooo many people are trying to join at once-especially at night. Now, I'm never going to stop playing Aura Kingdom due to these problems (I'm going to have to write this quickly because I have a guild dungeon in like 7 minutes and I don't want to miss it because if I do, I'll be kicked out the guild).\n\n-\nRKIDNB (YouTuber)","October 20, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you wish to get all the "cool looking" mounts, clothing, weapons, summons. Don't even waste your time spending money on this game, First of all the instant you buy their points they lock you out of even being able to purchase items. You have to go through a long painful proccess of sending them information through a ticket, which in set they take forever to reply to. Only for them to finally unlock that ascpect of your game so you can purchase things. Now, moving onto the problem. I was in the mindset of wasting my money getting the cool things I wanted in the game to make my character more personally appealing. I found that to be a utter joke with this company, not only did I waste money, but I found out they are scumbags. You go to buy the item, thinking you are going to get what you purchased and no wrong. Instead you click on the icon you obtained for the item and it becomes a treasure luck box pretty much in a sense. In this case you MAY obtain the item you were hoping for, instead I constantly got health pots. I think this is a utter joke, a rip off and a scam. Do NOT label your items as if you were to directly obtain said item, instead make it labeled a luck box and CLEARLY show that you can not be able to obtain the item. Instead of doing it after you buy the item and waste money.","October 8, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

Interestingly enough the daily quests, side quests and hidden quests tend to be where something other than kill 14 x happens. You have your standard activities, like collecting flowers, fishing, smithing and mining, however you can only get better at fishing and smithing.\nThe combat is the usual click on an enemy and let there be skills. You are much more mobile while doing so than in most MMORPGs however, only stopping for a second and not loading up the skill while standing frozen in place.\nThe class system is one of the unique parts of this game.\nNot only is there a lot of different classes but you can actually have 2 classes from lvl 40 on. The second class will be heavyly nerfed compared to it being your first class but you can still use all the skills. Some class combinations grant bonus skills. Now this doesnt seem like much, but there is also the character custumization, masterys, the envo path and all together you can get rather creative. THe best part is that you can reset anything at any time for a small amount of ingame money. So you were a guy that runs around with 2 pistols and occasionaly gets out a sword, that skilled on critical damage and defense and preferred stun abilities etc.? Forget all that you are now a mage that wips out a scythe when he fgeels like it and commands a little demon army. If you get the hangt of it class switching can be a matter of minutes, so basically you are any class at any time throughout the entire game.\n\nThe second unique part is the Eidolon system. Eidolons are basically a constant follower and can be upgraded almost as much as yourself. Each comes with its own set of skills, and one liners. You get a small amount from the story of the game, however getting the others involves a LOT of work.\n\nAnother interesting thing is how casual the experience is. There is ALWAYS at least one main quest, so you always know where to go and what to do next. And the main quest will also be fitting for your level. Particularly in the early levels the speed at which you level up through main quests is insane. However, as said before it is usually kill 14 x.\n\nThe story itself is nothing worth mentioning, sure they wrote a lot and created so many characters and quests and whatever, but they mostly lack uniqueness and feel bland, basically you will find yourself skipping through all the dialogue at some point most likely, because it is so damn boring.\n\nThere is no faction system, which can be a good thing, as it doesnt split the playerbase.\n\nThe music is just as average as the story.\n\nThe graphics are nothing special either. Certain skills can look pretty but thats about it. The anime style of your character and most of the screenshots isnt really all that noticable.\n\nThe camera can be a gigantic issue at times when you go full in zoom and cant see anything because the game decided so.\n\nNoticable is also  the small size of each map as well the speed at which you travel between maps. You will NEVER need more than 5 minutes to get anywhere. Quests will never take all that long and neither will dugeons. Alltogether this means that this is the one MMORPG where you can actually just fire it up for 20 mins and leave again and achieve something in the time.\n\nWhat about p2w? Well obviously I dont know about endgame content but so far there was never even a slight need for money, nor people dominating me because of money, so yeah I'd dare to say no p2w.\n\nSummed up: why did I give a positive rating? Because while it is so god damn average, it uses mechanics that have worked for decades now and is by no means a bad game. Also it is free, and for that price you dont get robbed of your money.","February 6","true","27.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Lots of players (Especially on channel 1 of your chosen server) and a very active community. Weapons are very stylish, but the costume is hard to come by without advancing to get at least a decent Forest Ambassador outfit. There is a currency called Loyalty Points (Accumulated by doing certain daily quests, returning monster bounties, or in valuable chests) and if you continuously do these quests, getting a costume without abiding to microtransaction's tempting offers for the best looking costumes, can be pretty satisfying, include the mounts too which are kinda affordable. Eidolons, the pets which is already registered in your account and can be used by multiple characters depending if they are active on the other character, is very convenient as you won't be grinding hard again if you decide to create a 2nd character, but instead the keys 9which are used to summon them) can be saved to do an evolution for your eidolon. And lastly, I would like to commend the very interesting and versatile sub skill system. In lvl 40, you will be given a quest where you can pick your sub, but worry not, as your sub can be replaced for free!\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes MMORPGs with anime theme and an active community and fun to play dungeons.","May 23","true","168.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/animerainbowz/recommended/268420/","animerainbowz","Ello","http://steamcommunity.com/id/animerainbowz/","4 products in account","Great graphics, cute characters, stupid ♥♥♥ Npcs, what more could a gamer ask for?\n\nCute game. Fighting was pretty easy for me, and the fighting animations are badass. Not to mention that it isn't so heavily a pay to play game, so that's nice.\n\nPros:\n-Good graphics\n-Fun fighting\n-Nice fellow players\n-easy quests\n-small amount of lag\n-Cool weapons\n\n\nCons:\n-The spammy chat\n-How the quests may as well be pressing the button to bring you to the area where everything is\n-This ostrich thing which you can't disable and randomly appears (Yes, out of anything, an ostrich)\n-Characters never speak other than trying to trade in the chat, I mean by "nice" by they don't attack you or anything\n-I'm not sure if there is a feature to friend other people\n-Buttons, buttons everywhere.\n\nI know, this is going to be a long review for a person with 2 hours online gameplay.\n\nLets start with the pros. The graphics aren't as great as Gmod or Tf2 obviously, but they're mediocre, and deserve some appreciation. The fighting was easy and fun for me. I found moves easy to use and techniques. The quests are easy, which is both good and bad (You'll see what I mean in the paragraph overviewing the cons). The lag was very minimum for me. I occasionally got lag, but like any game, it was to be expected. The weapons have nice design as well.\n\n+Now for the cons. There's this chat. It's dreadful. Remember the Windows 8 tab which always comes up when you move your cursor to the right side of the screen? The chat is like that. Whenever you move your mouse over it, it suddenly boldens. Now, there may be a way to X the chat out, but thanks to players only spamming the chat with things about trading, I never could reach anyone who legitely knew a lot about the game.\n\n+The quests, as I said above, are easy. In a bad, and good way. They're easy so you can obtain rewards quickly and easily. I personally liked this, because the area to obtain something was usually a lengthy walk away. Sadly, this also makes the game have not much of a point. When you're given a quest, you can press the text of a certain task , and that'll make your character walk in the direction, and end up stopping in the area which you could collect that item, or whatever. This also can be misleading, because the quest I'm stuck on only brings me too a VERY general area.\n\n+The ostrich. God, it's a little sad I have to talk about the ostrich. I don't know if others were given this item, but I got it. It randomly appears, and it's a nuisance when you want to walk around as a much smaller, more compatable human. This ostrich thing would randomly appear, and It was absolute hell. It was huge, so say goodbye to parcouring and all the other fun glitches. Worst of all, I CAN'T DISPOSE THIS OSTRICH -rage quits-.\n\n+Characters are nice, in a way... You know those games where on servers people would constantly kill you, or pick on you because you were a noob? You won't experience that in this game! Well, you won't experience praises either. Now, I don't know if there was seperate chats. In real life I'm shy, but online I want to at least have some stranger to talk to. The chat is spammed by trade. Finding people who were willing to help me was rare. I really love the game, but I'm really confused, and the other players are only focused on selling stuff it seems.\n\n+Not to mention that no one talks to you, if someone did, you might never see that person again (Unless you find their Skype or something, but is there a PM for that???). A friend system. Sounds cheesy to some, but imagine being able to know when that person was online. And a Private Message (PM) system, so you'd be able to talk to each other. BUT NO ONE EVER TALKED TO ME!\n\n+Buttons. Knwoing were to find information was so hard. I would end up clicking on everything to try finding one feature. Yes, it's probably just a noob thing which I'm experiencing, but whole screen in the game has these pointless buttons.\n\nI don't know whether to recommend this game. Why? Because everyone that recommends it seems to be someone who grinded forever, and I don't think it deserves to be not reccomended. The game needs more user interaction. Now, if something other than a robotic NPC or manual would help me, I think all the other cons would have been resolved a long long time ago. Heck, I don't even know if there is a legit chat, other than people spamming for trade.\n\nI rate this game 7/10. It had nice features, but just playing it seemed frusturating. I'm probably just a noob who hasn't learnt about how to change things, but oh well, none of the experienced players ever try helping. 7 rounds to 10, so I guess I reccomend this game.","April 11, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've also learned to fly through the air, beaten two world bosses, and gotten a variety of Unique equipment for when I'm a higher level.\n\nAura Kingdoms has a cute, and surprisingly deep, story. You're an 'Envoy of Gaia', blessed with a mysterious power to summon and harness pokemon- sorry, Eidolons. The host of characters all have thriving, quirky personalities. It's cliche (exactly what you would expect from an anime-themed game), but it works.\n\nControls are finicky, and no where near as fluid as they could be: these sort of refinements however take time.\n\nThere is no pay-to-win aspect that usually comes from F2P MMOs - cash-shop items all have an equivalent which can be purchased with 'loyalty' points - points you get from earning achievements, grouping with friends or greeting players. The cash shop exclusive items are cosmetic only (for example, a unicorn versus its loyalty-point equivalent: a horse-drawn carriage).\n\nIt's a game I'd recommend to any guy wanting to get his girlfriend into games, or the otakus among you. Give it fifteen minutes. You'll be pleasantly surprised. It's casual. It's cute. It has dragons.","April 10, 2015","true","32.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Same point-and-click battles, and all you could find in WoW). The bad thing - Copy. A thing like this already exists. Good thing - it's FREE. You CAN donate into the game, but remember the difference between the words CAN and MUST. In WoW, you MUST pay EVERY MONTH! to play. Otherwise, you'll only have the starter pack (that's why I never played WoW over level 20).\n3)Speaking of graphics, minding the fact that I love the oldstyle drawn anime and FREAKING HATE 3D ANIME, this is actually pretty wonderfull! And sill better then WoW. Can't compare with ESO (that even has a diferent gameplay), though.\n4)Gameplay. If you've ever played World of Warcraft, you won't have to read the tutorials, as the mechanics are pretty much all the same. Use WASD, or point on the ground to move, click someone to interact, click on your weapon icon to attack. Basic (and sometimes boring). Oh, why did I say that, now level [insert 99-digit number here] kids from WoW will hate me xD.\n5)My personal feelings about the game - WHAT THE HELL ARE CUSTUMES FOR AND HOW THE HELL DO THEY WORK??!?!! Sorry, had to burst out at some point... So, costumes. By default, you should have an adventurer's costume and some armour. Now look at this nonsence - I have armor on (yeah, found it out when got new armr, and wanted to see how it looks), so, I have armour on, I take off the costume and *pam the character is naked. W.T.F.? Maybe I don't understand how to take off the costume and leave the armour, and hope someone will help me out.\n\nAt this point, I guess it's all I have to say.","October 2, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now, with it's server instability, and it's awkward crafting/upgrading, it suits being a free-to-play game, as paying for the game would denote much better server maintenance.\n\nQuick Edit:  To discuss the crafting system a bit more, it seems a lot of the F2P Asian-based MMO's nowadays seem to not want to tread on eachother's crafting systems, each new MMO coming up with a more awkward and less sensical way to craft and upgrade gear than the last.  Not a terribly bad thing, but worthy of note.","April 1, 2015","true","210.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't like most of the 'big' MMOs, however Aura Kingdom has that anime charm, and presents itself as an great anime MMO.\n\nThis game is what I have been looking to play whilst watching 'Sword Art Online' (a must watch anime). If you are an anime lover, then I believe you will love this game as much as I do :D","July 5, 2014","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
