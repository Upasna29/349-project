When I first wrote this review the price was a whopping $5, but it's now been lowered to $2 to match the mobile version, so kudos to the devs for that.\n\nThe gameplay is a take on the "breakout" arcade game.  You must bounce balls to destroy the viruses (blocks), but the ball must be the same color as the virus it hits in order to clear it, and the ball changes color each time it bounces off your paddle.  The paddle is actually carried by the pixelated little person you control, and instead of freely moving and stopping as in most games of this genre, you move between 5 levels.  By default the paddle is not large enough to cover an entire level, so often you must time your move between the levels to be able to keep the ball in play.\n\nThere are the usual assortment of power-ups, and hitting some viruses with a wrong colored ball can have mildly unpleasant side effects.  Some userfriendly touches involve a helpful display letting you know the color the ball will become after the next bounce so that you can plan ahead, the ball only cycling through colors of viruses which are still present in the level (bust-a-move style), and the rapid delivery of "split ball" power-ups once there are only 1 or 2 viruses left.\n\nAnnoyingly, one "power-up" actually makes it easier to miss the ball, by obscuring the area immediately around the paddle with thick colored arrows dynamically moving to point to any balls in play.  I can see those balls just fine, thank-you-very-much, but not when they're being covered by the arrows!\n\nThe story campaign consists of multiple zones of 3 levels each.  You have 3 balls to complete each level, after which you must start the level over.  There are unlimited such retries, but the game only saves progress after you've completed a zone, so if you are on the third level of a zone when you decide to quit, you'll have to repeat the first two levels again next time.  As you proceed through the campaign, additional virus colors are added to raise the difficulty.\n\nThe graphics are pretty decent "8-bit retro" style, as can be seen in the screenshots.  What's not apparent from the screenshots is that the game launches in a tiny 640x480 window, and the only other option is to stretch it all the way to Full Screen with ALT+ENTER (something the game assumes you already know to do, as it's not mentioned anywhere.)   You'll have to do it again every time you start the game.  The framerate is locked to 30fps, but that's not a problem in a game like this with no scrolling, and I didn't notice any input lag.\n\nThere are multiple difficulty settings, as well as an endless mode, but I couldn't figure out how to actually activate them.  The spacebar is used to switch the other settings in the menu, but did nothing here - are these locked out until you beat the campaign on the default difficulty?  Who knows - the game certainly doesn't tell you.\n\nThe short cutscenes are amusing, but I found the text, being both highly pixelated and italicized, annoyingly hard to read.\n\nThe music is very good chiptune, but doesn't have much variety.\n\nAnd then we come to the interface.  The only consideration made for PC users in this port is the ability to use the keyboard, and enable an xinput controller (such as my 360 pad), neither remappable.  You can also awkwardly control movement with the mouse, but cannot launch the ball by clicking, so that's pretty much  useless.  There is an option to overlay the screen with control prompts, but it is absolutely hideous, and covers too much of the screen.   Without such prompts, you don't even know how to exit to the menu from inside the level.  Escape (keyboard)/ Start (360 controller) bring up the Pause screen, and pressing them again resumes the gameplay - you somehow have to figure out to hit Backspace / B from the Pause menu in order to actually quit the level.\n\nAnd of course there are no Steamworks features, not even achievements which are usually expected in arcade games.\n\nSo in the end, I can't recommend a game that's optimized for touch controls and offers no PC specific changes beyond the base ability to use a keyboard or a controller.","May 6, 2015","false","2.1"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","3"

Upon booting it up, you are struck with a charming little cutscene and are kicked into a horizontal Breakout/Doctor Mario combination. The first couple rounds are fun, and the mechanics are introduced organically. The story is placeholder, although a fun one, but not the real draw.\n\nFor the record, Virus Jigglin' Fever is a mobile game, and not the worst one at that. It was designed by only a few people, but even with the fact that this is probably their first game, there is an impressive effort here to make this game more than just a Breakout clone. The animations in particular on the sprites are eye catching, and every new enemy introduced can spice up the tedium just enough to make the tedium potentially more interesting. However, this does not take away from the poor design decisions that can ultimately bore the player to death, which if done slightly differently or a bit more polished, they could've made a solid little game.\n\nSadly this is not the case. One of the most infuriating aspects of design comes from the base game itself; every enemy is a specific color, and the only way to remove them from the board is to hit them with the same color ball. In the early stages this is not an issue, but when I was deep into the 8th stage, the randomized monster placement and ball color (which changes every time it makes contact with your paddle) meant there were multiple bounces where I hit a number of hard to reach monsters without effect, and the colors I would be given in succession always seemed to match the viruses surrounded by the colors I never got.\n\nThis doesn't help the fact that you can't even change your ball color, or manipulate the ball in any way. Even though there is a colored button saying "next" to indicate what is coming next, clicking on it does nothing. This doesn't help the fact that even when you do get the color you want, getting it to where the virus you want to hit is another matter entirely. While this would'nt really be a problem in regular breakout, the fact that you have line up so many variables just to get the viruses in your way removed isn't a good time. There are power-ups, most of which if landed correctly can make a masochist round a breeze, but like the rest of the game it is purely determined by luck, and the ones that you'll see the most are worthless. Also, there isn't an actual end to the game, it just keeps going. I got to the 8th level and decided to stop and com back later. You can't go to any level past 6. That is not okay. More proof this is simply unfinished.\n\nAll of this is further damaged by the fact that some of the colors, (specifically orange, red, pink, and purple) are almost virtually indistinguishable on the ball. The viruses are fine and the art design is varied, but there were plenty of times where I genuinely thought one color was the other. Only when the ball is blown up massively by a power up I never fully understood could I make out the color, but the sprite is generally so small that I often found the ball hitting something just a shade darker and not doing a hint of damage. This combined with all lack of control makes it a truly depressing, demoralizing experience.\n\nWhat could've saved this from being so frustrating would've been an implementation of a basic health system, in which certain colors cause higher or lower damage. Match the same color; instant death. Similar or almost identical? Massive damager. Opposite? Almost negligable. It would at the very least save the player from feeling like every match is futile.\n\nThis isn't helped by the fact that there is no score system. As a breakout clone, how this wasn't implemented is beyond me. It has all the components, all the power-ups, and all the clear indicators that it should have one, and yet there is not a single one to be seen. This is a breakout game without a score system. I don't even know how that was over looked. Oh, and there is a decent tune in this game, but it's the only tune. Another thing that just peeved me. No steam achievements, no trading cards, no leaderboards; nothing to motivate anyone to pick this up, even on an impulse buy for 10 cents or something.\n\nFor all its cute skipping hazmat wearing scientists and charming sprite work, is ultimately an unfinished product. It has the ground work for something fun, even the more important components to keep someone hooked, (I played this way longer than I should've) but ultimately still feels like a work in development.  I really did want to give this a positive review, but all I can do is be remorsefully negative. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game.","July 27, 2015","false","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

There's something satisfying about firing off multiple spiked balls at once and watching them tear through the waves of viruses. The NES-style music and deliberately silly story are a nice touch as well. It's a little on the simplistic side, but if you're in the mood for a puzzle game I'd say it's well worth its price.","May 6, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"
