"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/201790/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Orcs Must Die! 2 is the follow up to Orcs Must Die 1, and is a third person tower defence game, developed by Robot Entertainment.  The game was released on PC July 2012.\n\nThe main difference with Orcs Must Die 2 is the addition of co-op gameplay. Everything else is virtually the same. You play either as a War Mage or sorceress in the story mode. You have to defend at one or more rifts which open at the start of the level. Each level has a varying amount of waves of enemies continuously spawning in order to reach said rift. Your aim is to stop them by building traps whilst also using your own character to kill them as well. Before each level you choose your load out of traps that you want to use. You start out by only being able to take 4 or 5, but work your way up to being able to take 10 traps on a stage with you.  Before jumping into each level too, you can upgrade your traps to do more damage, have a lower cool down time, or some other ability such as slowing the enemy if they are hit by it for example.  You'll notice from the very beginning that there are a few traps that you'll always want to take with you, such as the slowing trap - but included in your loadout, is your characters weapon, so you have to choose carefully.\n\nYou are given an infinite amount of time to build your traps at the start of each level, and you are also given a healthy amount of time between waves to allow you to build more. You are granted extra coins after each wave, and for killing enemies, and you use these coins to purchase more traps. Whilst you can also place traps when enemies are spawning, this isn't always a good idea as your main focus should be on killing enemies then.  A large portion of this game is actually you spamming your left mouse button using your main weapon, whilst you aren't able to destroy everything with this weapon; it is more used as filler for your time as most of the damage will come from the traps.  There is a huge variety of traps as well, and you probably won't even use them all even by the end of the game, leaving you plenty of chances to experiment.\n\nThe graphics in Orcs Must Die 2 are really nice. They are in the cartoon style that many of us really enjoy, but they aren't so childish that they can't portray the maturity of the title. There are some really nice special effects, such as the lava and ice traps, they all look marvellous. Everything is perfectly animated too, whilst a lot of the enemies are copy/pasted, that is to be expected from a game of this type.\n\nOrcs Must Die 2 has a very catchy sound track too; the song is played constantly and it will be driven into your head and you'll be whistling it without realising it. Other than the soundtrack, the rest of the game's audio is brilliant too. The game is narrated in the cut scenes by the male character; it would have been nice to get voice acting on the female though.\n\nThis game has varying levels of difficulty, the regular easy, medium and hard mode. You only unlock hard mode after you have beaten the game. There is one other form of difficulty, and that is endless mode. This will pit you against an endless stream of enemies, meaning you have to constantly upgrade your traps and the enemies will not stop until they either kill you or destroy your rift. This mode will really test your metal but is extremely fun to play in. Most players should really be playing this game on the Medium skill level, the easy mode is too easy and will not really offer any challenge to any tower defence veteran.\n\nAll of the levels in Orcs Must Die 2 are so well designed; I cannot find any faults with them at all. The early stages of the game are a tutorial stage really, allowing you to test out your traps to work out how they are best used, so the levels are pretty simple, but once you reach the end levels, you'll really be putting your trap building skills to the test, as you have to defend multiple rifts from multiple entry points of enemies. Some of the bigger levels offer a bit of support in getting around quickly in the form of teleporters, these will teleport you to the other side of the map once stepping in them.\n\nI have been playing Orcs Must Die 2 for almost thirty hours, this is because there is absolutely tons of content in this game, not only is the single player story mode eight hours of gameplay, you also have the added replay ability of playing the story again as the other hero (with different skills and abilities), and then you also can replay the whole game again on co-op which adds a whole another level of content as the enemies are all scaled up to match you and your friend - and finally, we have the endless mode, this is the part of the game that I have spent the majority of my time and I am absolutely hooked on it. As you play the story mode, once you reach the final waves of a level, you'll often feel like you wish you could carry on and see how far you get, you can do that in endless mode; you just keep building traps, and facing more and more enemies as they just keep coming. This mode alone has given me about fifteen hours of gameplay.\n\nOrcs Must Die 2 can be played on all resolutions. I played on 4k with everything on max settings and was able to get 60 FPS constantly. I did however have a few crashes, this mainly happened when you minimize the game too many times, and it gives you a message something regarding DirectX. Although this was annoying, I only had it when minimizing and not whilst in the midst of gameplay. The game can be played with a controller, but as it has elements of aiming with a crosshairs, the game is highly recommended to be played with a keyboard/mouse - it just works so much better on them.\n\nThis game is an absolute must play for any tower defence fan, if you had any sort of enjoyment out of the first, you'll get more of the same out of this, and the added edition of co-op makes it even more appealing to a wider audience. Not to mention the hours and hours of content on offer in this game. The regular price tag of Â£10, 99 is fairly marked and should be considered a must play for me.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

However, OMD2 is shorter than OMD in terms of the campaign and only seems to expand on the original rather than offer a new innovative experience for tower defense fans.There's nothing wrong with the design of the levels or the gameplay in and of themselves. It's just that OMD!2 feels more like a sizeable update complete with co-op integration. It is a good game, though, which manages to live up to its predecessor. Soloing veterans of that game should think very hard if the amendments are enough to buy this sequel at launch.The absence of new levels, no in-game editor, and too close a resemblance with the original title make Orcs Must Die! 2 look more like an expansion pack than a fulfilling sequel.However it's still a thoroughly enjoyable experience that will charm newcomers as well as veterans of the first game.","May 13, 2014","true","29.5"," 102 of 117 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","102","117","0","0"

The levels are clearly designed for two players so (for me at least) they are not fun in single-player. The problem is not necessarily that they are difficult, but it is simply tedious to constantly run around the map trying to cover all directions. This is further aggravated by the lack of local co-op and any public matchmaking. I heartily recommend getting the first one if you have not played it. Get this one only if you have a friend that owns it and is willing to play.","January 18, 2014","false","7.7"," 140 of 217 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","140","217","3","2"

Orcs Must Die! was a great game and could be played alone. When you play Orcs Must Die! 2 alone, you notice something almost immediately; the design of the new levels is clearly built for Co-Op action with a friend. The early levels are easy regardless, and there are some fun new mechanics that you can play with (funneling the orcs along minecart paths) which is a nice change from the first game, where you just look for the best place to place your Swinging Maces. Sadly, once you get about midway through the game some of the interesting levels seem to have already passed. Most of the time through barricades or planning you could get 3 or 4 doors worth of orcs to run through one setup of traps, which is about what was needed to clear the levels on War Mage difficulty. Sadly, about midway through OMD!2, it seems someone decided to make a whole pile of symmetrical levels in which there is no common area to filter all of the orcs through. Fair enough, it must still be possible to do it alone right?\n\nIf you've played the first game, you can picture what I am going to describe now: Imagine a 6 square wide path. There is only a buildable wall on one side. The other side of the path has a few blocks of lava, which cannot be used because if you try to throw them into it they just fly clear of the lava river onto the symmetrical path on the other side (past the point where your traps would be). There is a small section with a ceiling on which to build ceiling traps but Swinging Mace now basically does no damage and just throws the orcs away from your other traps. If you spend all of your money on one side of the level, you might get lucky with a setup that can stop the first 2 waves using all of the right traps in the limited possible building areas, but what do you do on the other side? Fight the whole waves yourself with no trap assistance? Goodluck, it works for a few levels and then you just get completely overwhelmed, You never end up with enough money to defend both sides, and you need to spend what you get to build up your untrapped side, and the original side that you built to start is leaking orcs (a lot of them) every level.\n\nThere are a few levels like this in a row probably about 75% of the way through the game. You clearly need 2 players, so each can play their own separate game on their own side of the level. How is that fun?\n\nThe first game was great. This one, not so much. I've had enough.","June 28, 2014","false","17.8"," 124 of 198 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","124","198","0","6"

Loadouts also differs slightly between the two with the Warmage having access to melee weapons along with shotgun while the Sorceress is more spell based with more staff and so on but the towers are mostly shared.\n\nOnce thats over you can then proceed to choose your map, difficulty and play either solo or coop. Maps for the main campaign are unlocked by clearing the ones before it and clearing it also unlock more tower type and more loadout slots.\n\nOnce in game you can then choose between a lot of weapons and towers provided you have unlocked them already. Initially you only have 3 slots but more are given as you clear map and the slots are shared between accesories. weapons, guardians, and traps so its prudent to choose wisely for the enemy type you will be facing which is indicated on the loadout screen.\n\nYou have a limited funds at start to build your first few traps with more funds gained from killing Orcs, collecting coins, and achieving combos by killing several orcs at once or quickly. Traps ranges from the typical spike and arrow trap to the much cooler acid and ice traps but there are lot more kind with some serving a more utilitarian functions.\n\nOrcs spawn from predefine points on the map and they will charge straight at the limited life teleporter that you must defend. The path they take can be influence by putting traps that block their path although if the map have several brancing paths or there are two teleporter at once they will split up. Initially only 1 spawn point will be active but by the 4th wave usually all are actively pouring in. There are a lot of types of orcs from the typical grunt all the way to elemental monster that can split up to 3 times. Also flying enemies are also present with some weapons and traps can not be use against them and they will ignore all blockade that you made.\n\nOnce you placed the traps and start the round it will continue until all orcs are dead which will give you a  10 second breather to sell/build more towers but while you can build during an attack you can only sell during these grace period in between rounds. At the middle point and right before the final round the game will give you an indefinite break until you trigger the wave yourself but the timer that affects your ranking still runs so its imperative to build/sell/break quickly and resume.\n\nAlright provided you won all the round you will then win the game and be presented with  a stat screen showing how well you did then everything is tally up and Skulls which are currencies are then dole out to you to spend. The main factor I see that affects is how fast you finish a map, letting no orc get to the teleporter, and not dying.\n\nSkulls can be use at the shops to unlock more weapons or upgrade an existing ones to be better. Same goes for traps and guardians and the good thing is that you can reset your build at any time you want at no cost whatsoever and its actually quite common to jump into a new map only to restart it because the build you have are not up to the task.\n\nThen rinse and repeat until you beat every single one of your friend's score.\n\nGraphicsOrc Must Die 2 uses a cartoony style approach to represent their game and it works well with the goofyness that the orc has [along with the idiocy of the Warmage]. Funnily enough if you turn on gib mode to high they will literally explode into chunks of meat when they die.\n\nSoundI suppose the sound are acceptable for all the weapon/spells and trap effect although the voice acting is pretty stellar for the orcs, guardians, and player character. A shame for hard hearing people though as explain below.\n\nOption Menu and ControlRebindable keys check, resolution anti-alias vsync windowed mode check although graphics setting are limited to high and low with no advance option. All the usual audio stuff check along with some gameplay options. No disability options though.\n\nRuns smoothly and if you ever need this for some reason it runs at  60 fps.\n\nSo what is the issue? The dialogue options is only for the cutscene not for when the character talks in-game or quip something when they perform an action and such. That means you can barely hear it if you have hearing isssue.\n\nAs for controls I used the keyboard and it is solid, no issues there.\n\nConclusionOrc Must Die! 2 is a solid action tower defense game that does a humorous spin on the classic formula, abundant of maps, nice enemy selection, and a great amount of traps and weapons are sure to entertain you. It gets even better when you play coop. Overall an excellent game in its category. A F***KING SHAME THE SEQUEL IS A MOBA.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: S-Rank - Awarded for giving out many fun time in its category.\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/201790/","October 15, 2015","true","19.8"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","33","46","2","2"

The 2 characters have very little but noticable difference in starting setup.\n\nAll the traps and weapons have different effect and usage, and there are many ways of completing each stages using different approach. You can invest heavily on weapons and trinkets so you can kill the orcs yourself, or you can spend your upgrades on traps and let them do the job for you.\n\nCoop WILL make a lot of stages so much easier because you will have 2 more extra total slots to start with (6 slots each instead of 10 slots solo), double the attention from players, and double the amount of upgrades you can use! Even the hardest game mode is a piece of cake if both players have enough skulls to upgrade their traps.\n\nYou can refund your upgrades infinitely, so you can plan your upgrades every wave. I only wish that the upgrades can be done BEFORE the stage start instead of after the stage end.\n\nThe story/plot is unimportant nor adds any value to the gameplay, but it has some funny conversation on the beginning of every stages. This makes me look forward to starting the next stage on my first playthrough.\n\nTo complete 100% achievement, you will need 2 things: the first game Orcs Must Die (for the Classic mode DLC), and a coop buddy. If you meet the requirement, all the achievements are quite doable.\n\nOne thing I'd like this game to have is a way to save progress on co-op game. My personal experience, the game crashed on me on wave 39 of the endless mode coop, wasted almost 90 minutes of our time. Another time, my friend got disconnected from the internet for about 30 seconds and we lost 42 waves of endless mode time. Because of this, we don't really play endless mode online anymore because of the fear for the risk.\n\nMy score: 9/10","October 1, 2014","true","36.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

The game can be played in single player or two person co-op. For those familiar with the formula, the game follows the standard idea of building defenses, weaving the path that the enemy must follow and defeat them before they reach the exit. The game itself is set in a 3rd person view, allowing the player to control one of two characters that you may use to fight along-side your traps. During setup, the player may choose from a variety of traps: spike traps, arrow traps, teleporters, acid traps, barricades, guardians (AI), character weapons and trinkets for passive and active buffs. There is a healthy amount of customization what you can bring, making level design easily tailored to your play style and choice.\n\nDuring the matches, the goal is simple: Do not let the orcs, or their minions, past the rift (exit). Each level has a set amount of waves, enemy types and number of rift points (essentially lives) that can be expended before you lose the round. Depending on your success, the player(s) can earn bonus points in the form of skulls. These skulls can be used to upgrade your weapons, trinkets and most importantly, your traps, adding active and passive abilities and increased damage.\n\nThe game has several different game modes, including story mode, several smaller DLC levels, a weekly custom mode and an Endless Mode, which, as you'd have guessed, goes until you lose or quit the level. Aside from different game modes, Orcs Must Die! 2 has three difficulties: Apprentice (Easy), War Mage (Normal) and Nightmare (Hard). As someone who has played very few tower defense games, War Mage is a nice middle ground for those just learning the game or the genre.\n\nThe game will probably provide anywhere from 20-30 hours of continuous gameplay, more so if you explore the different modes and difficulties that it has to offer. Orcs Must Die! 2 is enjoyable, yet challenging. It blends old features with new content very well. if you're a fan of tower defense games, then I think you'll enjoy Orcs Must Die! 2.\n\nPros\nInteresting enemy types and level design.\nCharacter artwork and overall visual effects are very well done.\nThe customization of your arsenal is fleshed out and provides a lot of variety in your build.\nVoice acting - While there is minimal, what is there is cute. I enjoyed the back and forth between the characters.\nReplayability - With the weekly challenge and the Endless Mode, the game offers a nice bit of replayability for fun, or to challenge yourself after you've finished the story.\nNo broken achievements - They are all obtainable.\nCo-Op - the game shines if you have a partner to play with.\nCons\nStory - It's there, sort of, but it isn't really fleshed out aside from a bit of dialogue and a cutscene here and there.\nOrc Mages - Their ranged attack can, at times, feel a little cheap (they home in on your character...a lot...)\n\nOverall, Orcs Must Die! 2 is downright fun. It's a challenge without being irritating and a ton of fun if you're able to play co-op. It's a great installment to the series and feels improved in every fashion. Check it out. I completely recommend it!","March 16","true","25.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","5"

To assist you there are numerous upgrades for your character, minions, and traps that are unlocked as you progress.  You get an action bar where you can put a set number of these things and then start the level.  Using some of these things (like minions and traps) costs coins.  Coins are independent of each level (they don't carry over so don't be shy about spending them.)  You get more as the level progresses and there are other items you can unlock that increase coin drops.\n\nFor me, survival mode was the most fun.  Still haven't made it to wave 30 of any level yet though (it's hard!)  Essentially it's progressively harder and harder waves until you're finally overwhelmed (or make it to that legendary 30th level.)\n\nThe fun factor is through the roof on this one and I highly recommend picking it up!","June 7, 2015","true","12.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The much-awaited multiplayer experience is here, but this review will be from a single-player standpoint.\n\nTo start with, you get to pick between the Warmage and the Sorceress. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but the Warmage simply feels easier to play with due to his superior health, superior tar trap, and arguably superior weapon. The Sorceress is better for charming single, large targets though, and her acid trap does more damage than the Warmage's Arrow Trap.\n\nGameplay is more or less the same. If you played OMD1, this will all be familiar. The Elementalist girls are gone, which is a shame. This change means that you have less options to adjust to your enemies in the middle of a level. Fortunately any upgrades you purchased prior to battle can be reset at no cost. Autoballistae are now considered guardians, which means you can no longer spam them. I was sad about that as well.\n\nAmazingly they made the Gnolls more irritating. They seem to have more HP, run faster (both probably untrue, but it feels like it), and can now slow you upon hitting you, making escape impossible. A whole pack of them, especially in Endless mode (see below), will ruin your day.\n\nI'm rather disappointed that the campaign is so short. The first game took maybe 15-20 hours to complete, and had a good progression. OMD2 instead took me a mere 10 hours on normal difficulty. Granted, I already knew the basics of the game, but this was far shorter than I expected. DLC's extend the game's length a bit, but they contain no story segments, and thus you are basically playing for skulls (the game's peristent currency) and variety. Note that you'll have to play through Campaign again with another character if you want stuff unlocked on both characters.\n\nEndless mode is interesting. Waves come indefinitely and keep getting tougher until you can no longer handle it, much like Survival mode in other types of games. This mode by far is the biggest time-sink, though you are rewarded with plenty of skulls to compensate.\n\nIf you like the first game and want a way to play it with friends, then OMD2 is the way to go. Overall it's an acceptable game. I still recommend the first game though.","February 26, 2015","true","163.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","9","12","4","1"

Complete Pack is very worth it.\n\nAbout Orcs Must Die! 2:It is a fast paced, tower defense game which requires you to be crafty and resourceful from the beginning until the end. But unlike most common defense tower games you actively participate in the battle, you are main defense, your towers, or rather traps, will hinder, soften or thin out the horde, but you'll still have a lot of heavy lifting to do by yourself.\n\nAbout the gameplayOrcs Must Die! 2 is more refined than its predecessor, it fixes little tweaks that were very annoying in the first game and balances weapons that back then felt a little too powerful and buffs weapons that were otherwise almost useless or felt too weak to be of proper use.\n\nThere's a lot of variation in your towers, or rather, traps. You can out them on the ground, walls and ceiling and some traps requires certain strategies to work well. Obviously there are traps that works better with others, but nothing is truly impossible to combine, you create your own set of traps to watch enemies get brutally pierced/crushed/burnt/frozen/stripped to the bones.\n\nThe game makes sure to bring new foes and tricks to ensure that you will always try something new, something you hadn't thought before or to show that your old tactics will eventually stop working.\n\nImprovements over the first gameOrcs Must Die! 2 fixes a lot of little things that were annoying in the first game some are noticeable such as clunky physics with Wind Belt, other are more subtle like not being able to place Boom Barrels too close to enemies and removing fall damage which was completely needless.\n\nAnother big change was the improvements over control customization and options overall which was seriously lacking in the first Orcs Must Die!\n\nAll in all once you play the first game you'll realize how the differences can affect in your game style.\n\nHow difficulty is it?Orcs Must Die! 2 can be difficult, a bit overwhelming at first, but you will rarely feel that the game was unfair, that it did something ridiculous that you couldn't counter before it happened. It is a rewarding experience and you will feel great whenever you pull a maximum rank victory, especially on Nightmare (I'll talk about it in a moment).\n\nThe game was tailored for co-op action and after the first stage you'll be facing two enemy spawn points to defend and it can feel unfair, especially in the beginning when you barely have anything to deal with them, it can be difficult but it's still manageable.\n\nWhile not something I truly appreciate, you'll have to go back to certain levels when you have better equipment to ace it (5 skull). Sure, you can start playing from the get go with a friend, but damn if it doesn't make you feel like a complete pro player when you get that maximum rank victory in a difficult map all by yourself.\n\nNightmare?The Nightmare difficulty, unlocked by finishing the game once, is far from being a numerical difficulty where the game merely ups enemies health or their numbers (something that plagues the games ever since they were made), it ramps up the difficulty to above the roof showing even tougher enemies and giving you puny three seconds to sell traps/units. You'll be forced to rethink your strategies and sometimes change to things you never ever thought before.\n\nBring friend to kill orcs. Have twice as fun.The co-op is just plain fun. Even more enemies to kill with a friend is never enough and being able to share strategies and putting up your traps into synergy is pure glee. If you don't have friends to play with you can always ask for others in the multiplayer groups.\n\nOrcs Must Die, sure, but there are few problems...There are two complaints about this great game I have: grinding and character selection.\nGrinding is bad enough (maximizing traps, accessories and weapons is expensive), but having to do twice because you have to create two separate game files for each character is just increasing the longevity of the game in a bad way, especially since it can take a while to notice the differences between both characters aside from the obvious.\n\nChanging characters requires you to return to the main menu screen, which wouldn't be such a hassle if you didn't have to leave the Party you made for multiplayer which can be very annoying.\n\nThere's also the fact Orcs Must Die! 2 is MUCH shorter than it's predecessor. While the first game has whooping 24 maps in the main campaign, the second game has only 15. Of course with the Classic levels DLC (earned by having the first game) the second game is longer, but I'm was never a big fan of having to rely on DLC to have a game with good length.\n\nFinal commentariesOrcs Must Die! 2 is an excellent game. It has tons of replay value and is balanced decently for both co-op and solo play. It does feel like it's an "Orcs Must Die! 1 v2.0" but with so many new traps, a new character and a good amount of changes, fixes here and there, it's worth every penny.\n\nLet us only hope Robot Entertainment will some day make the Orcs Must Die! 3 after they finish up Unchained and let more characters, more traps and, of course, more orcs appear to amp the fun. Maybe even boss battles?","August 19, 2013","true","516.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Of the many castle defense-type games I have played throughout the years, however, OMD!2 has to be my absolute favorite. It is extremely difficult for me to choose the components of this game I believe to be the most outstanding because it is just so enjoyable and well produced. With varying modes of play, said orcs must be deterred from reaching a Rift in either a solo trial or in two-player multiplayer mayhem; combined with a heart-pounding soundtrack of heavy metal Rifts (pun intended) mixed with more traditional themes, blasting away orcs has never been more entertaining! (This previous statement derives from an upcoming Ork player in the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game.)\nHere are just a few reasons I still enjoy every second of Orcs Must Die! 2:\n\nMain Protagonists - When beginning OMD!2, the player has the option of selecting between two characters: an imbecile unnamed War Mage turned Miner who fans of the first game hail as the gameâs protagonist and a seductress Sorceress who acted as the prior titleâs antagonist. Obviously, these two characters-one being new to the âgood guy clique-differ in both stature and basic weaponry, but playing as each of these individuals reveals another mark of comparison: their unlockable traps, weapons, minions, and skills are unique. For instance, the War Mage begins the game with a scattershot blunderbuss, tar traps that slow enemy minions, and a device to be placed on the wall that fires multiple arrows at crossing enemies; later in the game he can place panels that fling enemies ("These orcs must fly!" -Neosho and myself), and other damaging traps. On the other hand, the Sorceress starts with a projectile launching staff that has the ability to convert orc forces into allies for a limited time, ice vents which freeze hostiles, and acid-spraying wall machines.\n\nHumor - Though mostly from the War Mage than the Sorceress, the dialogue is very enjoyable. Whether a quip from the former villain to the witless hero or a pun directed after a combination kill by the player, each line may at least provoke a snicker from the player. There are also a few cinematic victory dances that may occur after a stage is completed, which is silly enough to be one of my favorite end-of-level treats out of any game.\n\nGameplay - As described previously, the player deters waves of antagonistic orc brutes using a variety of set traps, weapons, trinkets, and-if available-a partner. There is a loadout system implemented to where the player can only select a given number of traps at a specific point in the story; however, this âtrapacityâ (do you see now why I am not permitted to make jokes? It should be court-ordered!) increases as the player progresses through the main campaign, and causes the player to select carefully before engaging the enemy. Each item retains its own unique upgrades, which allows players to partially dictate how they want to play. The usual shooter control layout is utilized (e.g. W, A, S, and D to maneuver, Space Bar to jump, LMB to use the equipped toolâs primary action) but there is no weapon zoom unless you are using the Steam Workshop modification for it; instead, the RMB functions your equipmentâs secondary fire button, which-as an example when using the blunderbuss-fires a ball of energy that explodes on impact to damage and scatter hostiles.\n\nSkull Currency System - As explained prior, the player has the option of purchasing upgrades to their existing items; additional equipment that can be purchased include character skins and new weapons and trinkets. Though the described system of âplay your wayâ intrigues me, how you obtain the in-game currency is even more interesting. OMD!2 utilizes Skulls as a spendable asset, and are either dropped as a mark of achievement for scoring a high combination kill or for mastering a certain campaign levelâs par, such as completing it within a given amount of time or not allowing any orcs into the Rift. This system is based more on performance than anything, which drives the player to achieve more advanced level scores and objectives for a more desirable Skull payout. It also entices players to attempt new trap and weapon combinations to try and best their previous scores.\n\nOverall Feel - Whether orcs are flying due to a well-placed spring trap or are blown meters back by an enhanced blunderbuss blast, OMD!2 melds the player together with an overwhelming sensation of hectic bliss. It is a purely indescribable impression that can be felt while playing either with a friend of solo. I honestly cannot exactly pinpoint single thing that makes this game as good as it is a cohesive punctuation of elements involving the thrill of every lightning bolt strike, every orc cartoonishly erupting in flames, every upgrade purchased; the game just feels right.\n\nTL:DR - There is not much I can truly say against this game. I have an immense amount of fun whenever I play Orcs Must Die! 2, as it a truly unique gaming experience. From my perspective, players take the role of a comedic, naive sorcerer or sensible sorceress while attempting to prevent many orcs from reaching a rift using their upgradable weapons, equipment, and traps. I must admit that this game would be better to play with friends, but is just fine as a single-player experience. Have fun with this awesome game.

But considering refunds are now an option I thought heck this game is ranked as 'Overwhelmingly Positive' I may aswell trying it.  And what a great decision that was.\n\nThe game is still a tower defense game but with all the fast pasced third person shooting, and mindless comedic slaughter of orcs you could ever want. It breaks away from the bog standard tower defense where you feel you are controlling the outcome of the wave rather than the AI controlled defences. One minute you are blastiing down an ogre with your blunderbuss and the next you are trying to quickly decide within the time limit what traps to put down to get the best possible rating. This game is lovingly crafted with a quirky art style incredibly optimized gameplay creating a nicely packed game that suits even the the biggest haters of tpwer defense.\n\nOh and not only this it comes with an astounding co-op that allows you and a friend to take on the entire campaign together with th difficulty cleverly scailed to the amount of players in a mission.

It keeps all of the fun aspects of the previous game while adding plenty of new things as well as addressing the criticisms of the original, the largest of which was lack of multiplayer. The game now has full Co-Op, as well as a new character in the form of the Sorceress. The game adds new levels new enemies, and an arsenal of new weapons and traps to massacre the hordes of orcs with, all while keeping the theme of the original, including the FANTASTIC soundtrack. I would say this feels more like an expansion pack than a sequel, but then you also have to take into account that both this game and the original were very cheap in price on release, and both have been on sale countless times since then.

Okay why not - she got me the game may as well try it. I am extremely glad I did because this simple tower defense idea became Orcs Must Die.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, a tower defense sort of idea. Instead of bland towers and a bird's eye view of watching the action, the game puts you as a player in 3rd person view capable of unleashing an array of weapons such as a bazooka or a spear (all of which have secondary attacks such as turning orcs into stone) as well as deploying defense mechanisms such as arrow walls, tar pits, blocks, giant swinging gates with sharp cone pointing things, floor spikes etc... Basically there isn't a shortage of what to choose from when it comes to beating up the orcs. Defenses and even weapons can be upgraded with the amount of skulls you collect per level. The amount of skulls is dependent on how well you do throughout the level.\n\nVisually this game is fine. It doesn't need over the top graphics but provides enough graphic for the atmosphere that is created.\n\nRunning is also possible in this game (shift) which makes life and the game all that much more beautiful. You'll realize how much you use it when you play.\n\nOverall I'd have to give this game an average\n\nRATING : 7.5/10 ...\n\nalthough be it so, if this game does appeal to you - you will like it guaranteed and you will have fun playing it like I do. If you have a buddy to play with online as well, it will be even better.

Attributes of both genres are blended together perfectly to form an addictive and entertaining little game. This is a game that is very easy to enjoy.\n\nOrcs Must Die! 2 does a great job taking 3rd-person action elements and blending them with some tower defense to establish a good basis. Then they sprinkle in the lighthearted atmosphere and charming characters with the simplistic-yet-captivating mechanics of the gameâ¦ and it shapes up to be a really fun, delightful experience. Itâs definitely the kind of game you can dive right into and get hooked for hours.\n\nThere is a relatively large amount of different towers and abilities in the game when compared to many other games in the tower defense genre. You have plenty of options and can have fun experimenting with different strategies. The level designs also vary enough that they call for different approaches to beat them, so you will have to try out different tactics in order to succeed. And there is a fair amount of different enemies which keeps things fresh as you progress through the game.\n\nThere is also a scoring system and leaderboards to add replay value.\n\nOrcs Must Die! 2 is a step forward from the already amazing first game.  All the good aspects return, with some new ideas sprinkled in. There are many more traps and abilities, and a more extensive upgrade system.  There are many new enemies.  Thereâs a new extensive campaign, new game modes (like endless mode), and with the Steam Workshop there are now limitless possibilities for maps.\n\nAlso the addition of cooperative mode makes the experience exponentially more fun if you have a friend to play with.\n\nI would say practically everyone should enjoy the Orcs Must Die! games.  Many hours of fun to be had with the games in this series, I recommend playing both.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","32.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/201790/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend Orcs Must Die! 2 then skip to Results and read from there.\n\nRobot Entertainment makes a fantastic addition to their brilliant tower defense game. Orcs Must Die! 2 adds new elements of gameplay to the tower defense genre by mixing FPS, TD, and RPG games.\n\nStory:\nThe War Mage has seals the final rift taking magic away from the world, but forever protecting it from the orcs continually onslaught. The world begins to crumble as magic no longer influences the weather i, sickness, and food. People are realizing the harsh world that they inhabit as magic is taken away. The Sorceress no longer has the ability to control the hordes of orcs, as her magic is gone and she has not long to live before they finally dispose of her. But The Master with his last fleeting breath hopes to give the kingdom one last chance opens a rift bringing back The Sorceress. The Master hopes The Sorceress will learn from her mistake and join The War Mage to restore the Order and bring back magic to the world again.\n\nCampaign:\nOrc Must Die! 2 offers two acts, the first consist of seven levels and the second of eight. They start out with each level only being a few waves, and then gradually increasing till you get to the last level which is about twelve waves. Similar to the original you cannot save half way into a level, meaning you need to make sure you have the time available to beat a level before you start it. The game also offers Endless Mode, which includes a variety of levels, some seen in the campaign and others that are unique. Endless mode allows you to obtain skulls (the currency used to buy upgrades) while at the same time getting to practice strategies. The campaign is played similar to the first one where you must place towers to defend rifts from being attacked, but incorporates more RPG elements. If you own Orcs Must Die! the original, you will also be given ten special levels in classic mode. Classic mode essentially is the best parts of the original campaign that can be played co-op and with the new features. This also allows you to earn more skulls and develop your character.\n\nGameplay:\nOrcs Must Die! 2 allows you to play as one of two characters: The Sorceress and The War Mage. The War Mage has higher health while The Sorceress offers more mana. As such one is focused more around using melee and non-magic weapons and the other is based more on magic and spell-casting. This allows you to change how you will play right from the start of the campaign. Unlike Orcs Must Die! you can no longer upgrade your character with coins through the weavers. Instead you buy trinkets using skulls that offer your character passive abilities, upgrade your towers with skulls and unlock unique abilities for the towers, and upgrade weapons with skulls. Each level allows you to get five skulls, plus any additional bonus skulls you pick up as result of enemy drops. This gameplay is focused much more on RPG style gameplay and beating the campaign on War Mage with 5 skulls for every level is near impossible if you donât grind yourself up in Endless Mode.\n\nMultiplayer:\nOrcs Must Die! 2 offers multiplayer, finally you can play co-op as one player is The Sorceress and the other is The War Mage. I personally never played multiplayer, but its nearly self-explanatory that this adds all new elements to the game. A lot of the levels seem as though they are designed for two players, requiring you to essentially run from one side of the map to the other during waves. Adding multiplayer takes Orcs Must Die! and combines it with Sanctum taking the best from both worlds.\n\nFire and Water:\nThe first DLC pack for Orcs Must Die! 2. The levels include new levels (Traffic Jammed, Double Decker, and The West Wing), new enemies (Fire and Water Lords), and new traps (Web Spinner, Dart Spitters, and Floor Portal). Double Decker is one of my favorite levels; it is a two pathed level where you get to use minecarts to stop your foes. The new enemies Fire and Water Lords offer all new challenges, if you donât kill them quick enough they evolve. They can evolve two times starting at Firelings and becoming Fire Lords. The Fire Lords are similar to Ogres and have a lot of health while the Firelings are like Orcs. I personally liked the Dart Spitters came in handy on levels where I wanted to concentrate traps, but ran out of space.\n\nFamily Ties:\nThis DLC further expands Orc Must Die! 2 offering loads of new content: three new levels, two new weapons, a new trinket, and even some new enemies. The levels include: Rush Hour, Breakneck Triad, and Triple Threat. The new levels are really well designed and can be played easily solo or with a group. One of the new weapons, Stone Staff, was actually my favorite weapon as it allows you to essentially freeze enemies then do increased damage to them. The Hobgoblin Healer is a very good addition and requires you to focus your strategy differently as they can cause a simple attach to be very difficult. The Ball and Chain is essentially just a stronger Ogre. Overall this is a great addition to the game, and the new weapon in my opinion is the best in the game.\n\nAre We There Yeti?:\nThis is another exciting DLC pack offered with Orcs Must Die! 2. The pack includes three levels: Yeti Den, The Hive, and Chilled Cavern. These levels introduce new characters (Yeti and Goblin Sapper) and offer a new weapon/trap/trinket. In my opinion these new levels are the hardest ones Iâve played in the Orcs Must Dies series, specifically âYeti Denâ. I played the levels on War Mage and beat them solo, but definitely could not do that on Nightmare. The levels are set up to be played with multiple people and this pack would probably be a lot more entertaining on multiplayer.\n\nResults:\nOrcs Must Die! 2 is a fantastic game that combines RPG, FPS, and TD into one single game. With co-op play you can mess around with your friends and play the maps to a whole new level. Orcs Must Die! 2 also integrate Orcs Must Die! campaign into the game (if you own the latter) allowing you to play the original levels with the new elements of the Orcs Must Die! 2. There are way more weapons to mess around with, loads more spells, trinkets, and special tower upgrades making Orcs Must Die! 2 a great addition to the first game. With loads of DLC to add to it this game is a must buy. If you are unsure or maybe just frugal, such as myself, then wait till the complete pack is on sale and grab that. As you will want to buy the DLC once you really get into the game.\n\nPros:\n+A campaign consisting of 15 new levels\n+Addition of endless mode that lets you go nuts.\n+Loads of new baddies (including the Orc Mages and Shaman from Orcs Must Die! DLC)\n+Co-Op play so you can mess around with a friend and have a great new experience\n+Incorporating RPG elements to the game\n+Three DLC packs\n+If you own the original you get Classic mode which includes ten levels from Orcs Must Die!\n+Loads of new spells (including spells from Orcs Must Die! DLC)\n+Loads of new towers (offering different play strategies)\n+Trinkets (which give you passive and active abilities)\n+Character customization with new costumes.\n+The story picks up right where it left off.\n+Two heroes which allow you to choose your play-style.\n+They added weekly challenges, which get you to play maps in order to earn extra skulls.\n+You can refund your skulls without any penalties as many times as you want.\n\nCons:\n-Orcs Must Die! 2 seems to focus too much on grinding. (in order to beat the Campaign on War Mage you essentially need to play Endless mode to get skulls)\n-The guardian limit is still incredibly low.\n-There are no levels that corridor enemies so you can just build one long defensive run and have fun with the game.","July 4, 2014","true","22.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

From the time I saw the trailer for Orcs Must Die! I knew I wanted to play. So, when I saw a humble bundle that included both Orcs Must Die! and Orcs Must Die! 2 I jumped all over that â¥â¥â¥â¥. I really enjoyed the slight twist of the traditional concept of a tower defense game by throwing you in the middle of all the action, it made even that much more visceral, tense and fun.\n\nI think the only flaw in this game is that fact there is not match making system in the game despite the fact the game pushes you in some aspects to play with another person. Luckily I have a few friends that have the game so I didn't need to deal with that issue at all, but I do see how it could be annoying for someone looking for someone to play the game since you will have to do it the hard way by checking the forums for people to play with. That in no way makes this game not fun, this is totally worth buying if you love have a fun time.\n\nWant to read me saying more positive things about the game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazeeColin/recommended/201790/","CrazeeColin","C.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazeeColin/","2292 products in account","I'll start off with saying this is a very hard review for me to write. I'm still not entirely sure whether I like OMD!2 or not.\n\nI played through the base OMD!2 campaign with Kataztrophik. Playing games with others always makes for a better experience for me.\n\nUnfortunately I found myself getting bored on more than one occasion. The maps all looked pretty much the same, the variance in enemies is limited, and I found the traps to be uninspired and mostly useless.\n\nI'm a huge fun of TD games. They can be repetitive. The strategy in a TD game comes from playing towers/traps/units in best places, and finding a balance between upgrading and placing new units. Then there's the diversity. Do I need to deal with fast enemies? Maybe they're cloaked? Those ones are flying. Wait! There's a group that are resistant to a certain damage type! Oh no here comes the boss!!!\n\nOMD!2 has none of this. You place a trap and that's it. You can sell it in build phases, but there's no upgrading as the level goes on. Therefore the only option is to spam defences everywhere with your spare cash.\n\nThe enemies in OMD!2 are very limited. It has some flyers, some high health hard hitting Ogres, some exploding Kobolds, some fast little buggers, Trolls that regenerate health and then the general mob. Even so they all seem pretty much the same.\n\nThe game just spams you with more and more mobs as the level progresses. You counter it by spamming more and more traps. There's no real strategy. Sure the traps filter out some of the bad guys, but you'll be doing most of the killing with your weapons.\n\nThis is where the game shines. The action gameplay in combat is pretty good. It's fluid and the weapons are fun to use. However, whilst this is certainly fun it offers nothing ground-breaking or unique. With the lack of variance of the enemy one faces it can also get pretty boring fast.\n\nThe biggest thing the game seems to lack for me, is bosses. There should be an epic fight against a might orc, the likes of which has never been seen before! There should be a dragon! A dragon would fit into the games style nicely, and there's no reason why there isn't one.\n\nOverall OMD!2 is a mildly fun action game, with underwhelming TD elements. It's worth playing through the game with a friend, but there are better options available.\n\nBottom line: Good in short stints with a buddy.","January 2, 2014","true","7.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, co-op aside, the other improvements are all solid as well. The main difference (aside from the addition of the Sorceress as a playable character) is a new upgrade/unlock system based on skulls earned by completing levels. It works pretty well and allows you to customize your characters with the traps and weapons you like the best. Other than that, this is pretty much the same game as OMD1, only with new campaign levels and a series of "endless mode" challenges... so, essentially this is more like OMD1.5 than a full on sequel. That said, I am fine with that at the low asking price. I guess the only negative thing I found was that it seemed like levels were designed for co-op. I was able to complete the game solo, so it's not impossibly difficult, but it definitely would have been easier and more fun with a partner. OMD2 provides a solid few hours of fun, plus lots more for high-score hounds.","August 26, 2012","true","19.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's probably more fun than Another Shooter/Tower defense hybrid game, Sanctum. Why? It has more personal involvement, meaning instead of leaving your traps to do most of the dirty work You're gonna have to start taking down orcs with Two playable characters: The Warmage from the first game, and a New character, the Sorceress.\nBoth of them are different in reguards of their playstyles, The Warmage was made to be the Guy usually being in the heart of the Orc swarm, and the Sorceress relying on spells and staying further away but still helping out the Duo ALOT.\nI honestly reccomend getting this instead of the first, only because It's better, and it has some levels from the FIRST Game as an added BONUS.\nSeriously, I can't reccomend this game enough if you and a pal are looking for something to play together.","August 29, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

If you've enjoyed Orcs Must Die, you should definitely pick this one up too.\n\nMost of the gameplay is very much similar. You still have a plethora of traps to use, and lots of orcs in each stage. There are fewer overall stages in the main campaign than there were in the first game, but the game offers some new stuff to make up for it. It now has 2 playable characters. Their starting weapons and starting traps are different. Like for example the Apprentice uses a blunderbuss as the main weapon, whereas the sorceress uses a sceptre to shoot small projectiles from. The presence of two playable characters also means the game can be played in co-op.\n\nIn addition to this, some stages also have an endless mode, where you can keep fighting hordes of orcs till you lose all the rift points, and the game also lets you play some of the classic stages from the first game.\n\nThe upgrade mechanic has been improved from the first game. Though the simplicity of it in the first game was nice, it's also great to have a bigger variety of upgrades that this game offers. Now each trap has more than 1 upgrade, and in addition to upgrading your existing traps, you can also buy new traps, weapons, and trinkets for all sorts of benefits, depending on how you prefer to play. Now this also means that it's easier to earn skulls, which are used as upgrade points. You can now gain them in more ways. In the first game you could only get them as a rating for each mission, but now you can also get them as bonuses and random drops, and as rewards for surviving a certain amount of waves in the endless stages.\n\nJust as with new traps, you also meet some new enemies. We now have some earth elementals which split into two smaller units upon death, some tall, lanky trolls which can take a lot of punishment, and even the regular grunts now have light, medium, and heavy armour varieties.\n\nThere are only a couple of minor things I didn't like. The first one is that I was unable to find an easy way to switch between characters when in the campaign menu. I first played through the whole campaign as the Apprentice, and when I wanted to try out the Sorceress, I couldn't simply pick a stage I've beaten already and to do it with her. Instead I had to create a new character profile with no upgrades or unlocks and to start the campaign all over from the start, which isn't all that great.\n\nAnother thing I didn't like was how the barricades have become virtually useless now. It's possible that maybe I was just unlucky, but on many occasions I noticed that the orcs now seem to prefer to rather smash their way through the barricades rather take an alternate path, even if the alternate path is within their vision. The only time this didn't happen was when I played the classic levels from the first game.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great 3rd person tower defence game and lives up to the quality of the first one. If you've enjoyed the first one, get this one too. If you've enjoyed this one, get the first one too.","November 27, 2015","true","13.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

OMD!2 will honestly be considered one of my favourite games of all time despite only having it for 1 month... it's incredibly fun, addictive and rewarding all at the same time.\n\nThe story mode was entertaining due to the variety of strategies you could employ to complete them and the fact that each level can be completed at a different success rate. Beyond this there is an unlockable 'nightmare' mode which adds another layer of strategy to the game as well as making the game more addictive. However the story mode lacked any real in-depth storyline, there were only 2 cut-scenes that I can remember and each were short.\n\nBeyond story mode you could play endless which was interesting due to the more advanced enemies, it could however be deemed a touch repetitive or tedious. I didn't see it this way as it was always rewarded. There are many acheivements to obtain and none of them felt grindy, completing the story mode got you most of them and the others introduced you to other dimensions of the game such as combo'ing (however you will have to pay for DLC to get 100% completion).\n\nOverall I would say the game is definitely worth a purchase at it's cheap price due to it including Steam trading cards / achievements and being thoroughly enjoyable.","August 26, 2014","true","68.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall , Orc Must Die 2 is a rather Balanced game with some bad tower and you will require tower and you attacking them to win the game.

Not sure why either. It just didn't feel like a successful sequel to Orcs Must Die. I left the game untouched for a few months and returned to it, and boy am I glad I did. Not only was I able to rekindle my love with the series, but also couldn't stop playing. The story follows the main protagonist from the first game, and the old nemesis turned good, Sorcerer. Without ruining the story too much, the orcs discover a new way of entering the magical world and destroying civilization. The war mage and sorcerer soon discover pockets of energy emerging at various spots with hundreds of orcs flooding in, and so begins the journey of orc killing.\n\nThe campaign is broken down into two chapters and can be approached on apprentice (easy) and war mage (medium) in solo or cooperative play. Players can unlock harder difficulty by completing war mage difficulty. The goal of each stage is to stop orcs from entering the rift's' using a large assortment of weapons, traps, guardians, spells and trinkets. No complaints in terms of gameplay and AI. Had no problems or hiccups with running the game. Soundtrack just as outstanding as the first. One of the major improvement or sequel demands on the RE forums from the previous title was the inclusion of multiplayer and I'm glad they've taken that into account and applied it to the game as it adds a whole new layer of strategical approach. The war mage possess weapons, traps and trinkets not accessible by the sorcerer - vice versa. Allowing for a greater diversity of strategies to be implemented. The only key downfall of the multiplayer is that you need a Steam buddy with a copy of the game. Alternatively you're stuck with just the single player offering's, although it does not differ from the multiplayer portion. Robot Entertainment has done an excellent job in identifying and amending the shortcomings of the first title. Although the multiplayer aspect leaves little to desire, the current offerings are more than satisfying and the overall package is much bigger than its predecessor.","September 24, 2013","true","118.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The new enemies are great, all the more to keep away from the endless supplys of rifts.\n\nI never got into the new character, the sorceress. It is good that they put her there, but i stuck with the guy from the last game. it's a shame that you can't change the character freely without having to replay all the levels you worked so hard with on your last guy.\n\nCartoony graphics really suit the slaughter well, and the music is not too hard on the ears, but they are not any really memorable ones either. there is only one i can think of and thats when you beat the level, and it's quite catchy, but other than that they kind of sound the same to me.\n\nOverall a really good game to have fun with your friend.","May 31, 2014","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This new feature is great and now that I've tried it, I have to say the game is very well done.  It stands equal to the first game, in some ways better.\n\nThat's if you play with two players.\n\nIf you play this game solo, you may find it ridiculously difficult.  A punishing level of challenge which sometimes found me having to retry maps 15 or 20 times.  All the new maps are laid out in such a way that you need to go back and forth constantly if you play alone.\n\nI wish they'd made separate co-op maps as well as some new solo maps in order to make the difficulty more consistent.  As with the first game, it's extremely entertaining and well-done and would be perfect except for the difficulty issues.","November 28, 2013","true","49.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deralleintiger/recommended/201790/","deralleintiger","DerAlleinTiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deralleintiger/","121 products in account","Orcs Must Die! 2 (or "Orcs 2"/"OMD2") is an odd amalgamation of third-person action and tower defense.  This creates a very fun and interesting mixture of gameplay that can be balanced at the player's discretion.  The basic format of the game is this:\n\nYou have a portal or sometimes multiple portals which must be protected from waves of enemies of increasing difficulty.  The portal has a set number assigned to it that goes down if you die or enemies enter it.  If and when that number reaches zero, it's GAME OVER!\n\nAt the very start, you choose between two characters, who each have access to certain weapons and traps and shout of their own cheeky one-liners:\n\nWarmage - A very balanced character with about the same amount of health and mana.  Definitely made for those who prefer to get up close and personal with their enemies.\n\nSorceress - A character designed for those who'd rather set up traps and guardians and snipe at enemies with ranged attacks.  The Sorceress has almost double the mana as the warmage, but at the cost of having almost half the health.\n\nOnce you pick a character, it's time to choose your loadout of items and tools to protect your portal:\n\n- Traps - Good old-fashioned traps act like towers in any other tower defense game.  Most activate by themselves and have a recharge.  Some are a little different, but most fit this description.  There is a wide variety of traps to choose from with countless different effects.\n\n- Guardians - Guardians are living beings which you summon to help protect the portal.  They are very much like traps in that they automatically attack enemies, but they are different in that they can move around, do not have a recharge timer, and can die.  They can, however, be revived.\n\n- Weapons - These are what throw the third-person action elements into the mix.  Weapons, while not quite as plentiful as traps, do have a wide variety.  Each weapon has a primary attack which costs nothing and can be used over and over, as well as a secondary attack which uses up mana.  Those who have played the Elder Scrolls should be familiar with how mana (magicka or stamina) works.\n\n- Trinkets - These are similar to weapons in that you carry them on your person, but they are different in that they play a more supportive role than an offensive one.\n\nYou must use a balance of these four tools to defend your portal against seemingly-endless hordes of trolls, gnolls, ogres, and - of course - orcs!  The variety of enemies is just as vast as the variety of counters you have waiting for them.\n\nInside of each level you collect gold to buy traps and guardians.  You gain the gold by killing enemies and collecting coins that are dropped by certain enemies for bonus gold.  At the end of each level, you are awarded with orc skulls depending on how well you did.  You use these skulls to unlock and upgrade new weapons, traps, guardians, and trinkets.  You can also buy a few (and I mean only a FEW) outfits for your character to wear as well.\n\nThe game modes themselves are not all that diverse, but they get the job done.  You have your basic campaign made up of about 30 levels (give or take) with a pretty mediocre storyline.  Then there's the "Endless" mode which is not really endless as it has only 50 waves, but it sure seems endless as you find yourself constantly in a race to keep up with the increasingly difficult enemies.  You can also try out several DLC maps as well as the weekly challenge map, which has you play as a specific character with a pre-defined loadout on a certain map to see how long you can last.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great game for the price and can be very addicting.  The challenge is through the roof at times and you must be prepared to lose, if only to learn your mistakes and try again.  This game is fantastic in singleplayer, but it's an absolute blast in co-op.  What's better than singlehandedly taking on the beastly orc hordes?  Why, taking on the beastly orc hordes with a buddy, of course!  If you're a fan of mixing tower defense and third-person action, then get this game!","October 11, 2013","true","68.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

You have to defend your base(s), called rifts in this game, against a horde of Orcs. To do that you build traps and shoot at your enemies with weapons.\n\nThe game feels very polished, the graphics have a nice cartoon look, the ragdolls and animations are nice. There is a large variety of traps, weapons and trinkets (artifacts that give special abilities) and all of them can be upgraded. You can build traps wherever you want, which allows for an endless amount of different tactics. The action part isn't about quick reflexes and aiming skills either, it's more part of the tactic you use. Will you defend only a part of the level with traps and try to hold back the hordes in the other part yourself? Or will you put less traps throughout the whole level and kill any enemies that may come through, wherever that may be? What weapon will you use? Use traps to kill the larger enemies and have a weapon that is good for crowd control? Or the other way around? Not kill enemies at all and slow them down instead so your traps can do their dirty work? Lots of possibilities there.\n\nBut not everything about the game is great unfortunately. The multiplayer can only be played with (Steam) friends, so no playing with random people like in other games.\n\nThe biggest flaw in my opinion are the difficulty levels though. There are three difficulty levels, easy (called Apprentice), normal (called War Mage) and hard (called Nightmare). Easy is not worth playing for anyone who played tower defense games before. Normal can be challenging at times (especially if you want to get the highest rating), but once you've upgraded a good amount of your equipment it's not that hard anymore. After you have completed the game in normal mode you unlock hard mode.\n\nAnd that's where the problem is. Hard mode could be a real challenge and a lot of fun. More enemies, harder enemies, more madness. But unfortunately they decided to remove the planning phase between waves on that difficulty level. Sure, the game becomes even harder that way. But is that what tower defense games should be about? I want to plan where I put my traps, I want to use a nice tactic. This is not possible in hard mode. After the initial planning phase (where you naturally can only spend the money you start with, which isn't much) you run around like a mad man trying to kill enemies while placing traps and trying to stay alive. No time for thinking, no time to analyze where your defenses aren't strong enough or what you could improve. It's also (more or less, you actually have 3 seconds between waves for it) impossible to sell/replace traps. The game turns from a game that is about tactics and careful planning with a bit of action thrown into the mix into a mad hack and slash action game with a tiny amount of tactics only on that difficulty level. That's a shame and makes the hard difficulty not worth playing in my opinion.\n\nBut overall I can still recommend the game, especially since it's cheap and the Complete Edition offers a lot of content that is fun to play at least on normal difficulty.\n","December 13, 2013","true","37.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The rift is shown up as a door with a dim yellow light coming from it, like something god-like. It's a defense game with waves; you can upgrade traps, outfits, gear, trinkets, and many more. Depending on what level you're on, the amount of waves and the enemy types may vary alot, and you'll have to figure out which is the best way to keep them from going through your 'fortress' in time.\n\nThe game revolves around the basic and generic-kill everything theme, warriors and orcs. I don't have many hours in it, but even if you're a fan of extremely realistic, indie, or 2d games, no matter what, this game is pretty decent. At first you'll think it's plain simple and boring, but after you played it for a bit you'll get used to it, and the fun will start showing up. Play it with a friend, make up a plan, tactics, strategy, and then prove who's the king, the orcs, or your "devilishly handsome" protagonist, ha-ha.\n\nGood luck!","September 4, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This creates a very fun and interesting mixture of gameplay that can be balanced at the player's discretion.  The basic format of the game is this:\n\nYou have a portal or sometimes multiple portals which must be protected from waves of enemies of increasing difficulty.  The portal has a set number assigned to it that goes down if you die or enemies enter it.  If and when that number reaches zero, it's GAME OVER!\n\nAt the very start, you choose between two characters, who each have access to certain weapons and traps and shout of their own cheeky one-liners:\n\nWarmage - A very balanced character with about the same amount of health and mana.  Definitely made for those who prefer to get up close and personal with their enemies.\n\nSorceress - A character designed for those who'd rather set up traps and guardians and snipe at enemies with ranged attacks.  The Sorceress has almost double the mana as the warmage, but at the cost of having almost half the health.\n\nOnce you pick a character, it's time to choose your loadout of items and tools to protect your portal:\n\n- Traps - Good old-fashioned traps act like towers in any other tower defense game.  Most activate by themselves and have a recharge.  Some are a little different, but most fit this description.  There is a wide variety of traps to choose from with countless different effects.\n\n- Guardians - Guardians are living beings which you summon to help protect the portal.  They are very much like traps in that they automatically attack enemies, but they are different in that they can move around, do not have a recharge timer, and can die.  They can, however, be revived.\n\n- Weapons - These are what throw the third-person action elements into the mix.  Weapons, while not quite as plentiful as traps, do have a wide variety.  Each weapon has a primary attack which costs nothing and can be used over and over, as well as a secondary attack which uses up mana.  Those who have played the Elder Scrolls should be familiar with how mana (magicka or stamina) works.\n\n- Trinkets - These are similar to weapons in that you carry them on your person, but they are different in that they play a more supportive role than an offensive one.\n\nYou must use a balance of these four tools to defend your portal against seemingly-endless hordes of trolls, gnolls, ogres, and - of course - orcs!  The variety of enemies is just as vast as the variety of counters you have waiting for them.\n\nInside of each level you collect gold to buy traps and guardians.  You gain the gold by killing enemies and collecting coins that are dropped by certain enemies for bonus gold.  At the end of each level, you are awarded with orc skulls depending on how well you did.  You use these skulls to unlock and upgrade new weapons, traps, guardians, and trinkets.  You can also buy a few (and I mean only a FEW) outfits for your character to wear as well.\n\nThe game modes themselves are not all that diverse, but they get the job done.  You have your basic campaign made up of about 30 levels (give or take) with a pretty mediocre storyline.  Then there's the "Endless" mode which is not really endless as it has only 50 waves, but it sure seems endless as you find yourself constantly in a race to keep up with the increasingly difficult enemies.  You can also try out several DLC maps as well as the weekly challenge map, which has you play as a specific character with a pre-defined loadout on a certain map to see how long you can last.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great game for the price and can be very addicting.  The challenge is through the roof at times and you must be prepared to lose, if only to learn your mistakes and try again.  This game is fantastic in singleplayer, but it's an absolute blast in co-op.  What's better than singlehandedly taking on the beastly orc hordes?  Why, taking on the beastly orc hordes with a buddy, of course!  If you're a fan of mixing tower defense and third-person action, then get this game!","October 11, 2013","true","68.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Act 3 is completely missing, and most of the new monsters only appear in the skimpy DLC with 3 levels each, no voice acting and no story included.\n\nBut instead of an Act 3, we got a new playable character with a different tech tree, ONLINE CO-OP, a staggeringly large armory of weapons, an endless mode with over a dozen maps, a new dwarven mines setting with awesome environmental hazards which half the game takes place in, a unique challenge level that cycles every week, about a dozen maps from the first game (if you own it on Steam), 3 DLC packs with freaky new monsters and good weapons, and Steam Workshop integration so you can play with mods you like. Also included are many very welcome interface changes, such as not having to pick your weapons again every time you restart a level, and a set-up break before Nightmare levels.\n\nA very fun, very worthy sequel that expands and improves upon the original. Have fun earning thousands of skulls to purchase all the upgradesâ¦ and then do it all over again with the other character! Itâll keep you busy for a long time. But enjoy it while it lasts, because OMD3 is a free-to-play League of Legends clone. (Ughâ¦ why??!!)","August 17, 2014","true","55.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is good that they put her there, but i stuck with the guy from the last game. it's a shame that you can't change the character freely without having to replay all the levels you worked so hard with on your last guy.\n\nCartoony graphics really suit the slaughter well, and the music is not too hard on the ears, but they are not any really memorable ones either. there is only one i can think of and thats when you beat the level, and it's quite catchy, but other than that they kind of sound the same to me.\n\nOverall a really good game to have fun with your friend.","May 31, 2014","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to defend your base(s), called rifts in this game, against a horde of Orcs. To do that you build traps and shoot at your enemies with weapons.\n\nThe game feels very polished, the graphics have a nice cartoon look, the ragdolls and animations are nice. There is a large variety of traps, weapons and trinkets (artifacts that give special abilities) and all of them can be upgraded. You can build traps wherever you want, which allows for an endless amount of different tactics. The action part isn't about quick reflexes and aiming skills either, it's more part of the tactic you use. Will you defend only a part of the level with traps and try to hold back the hordes in the other part yourself? Or will you put less traps throughout the whole level and kill any enemies that may come through, wherever that may be? What weapon will you use? Use traps to kill the larger enemies and have a weapon that is good for crowd control? Or the other way around? Not kill enemies at all and slow them down instead so your traps can do their dirty work? Lots of possibilities there.\n\nBut not everything about the game is great unfortunately. The multiplayer can only be played with (Steam) friends, so no playing with random people like in other games.\n\nThe biggest flaw in my opinion are the difficulty levels though. There are three difficulty levels, easy (called Apprentice), normal (called War Mage) and hard (called Nightmare). Easy is not worth playing for anyone who played tower defense games before. Normal can be challenging at times (especially if you want to get the highest rating), but once you've upgraded a good amount of your equipment it's not that hard anymore. After you have completed the game in normal mode you unlock hard mode.\n\nAnd that's where the problem is. Hard mode could be a real challenge and a lot of fun. More enemies, harder enemies, more madness. But unfortunately they decided to remove the planning phase between waves on that difficulty level. Sure, the game becomes even harder that way. But is that what tower defense games should be about? I want to plan where I put my traps, I want to use a nice tactic. This is not possible in hard mode. After the initial planning phase (where you naturally can only spend the money you start with, which isn't much) you run around like a mad man trying to kill enemies while placing traps and trying to stay alive. No time for thinking, no time to analyze where your defenses aren't strong enough or what you could improve. It's also (more or less, you actually have 3 seconds between waves for it) impossible to sell/replace traps. The game turns from a game that is about tactics and careful planning with a bit of action thrown into the mix into a mad hack and slash action game with a tiny amount of tactics only on that difficulty level. That's a shame and makes the hard difficulty not worth playing in my opinion.\n\nBut overall I can still recommend the game, especially since it's cheap and the Complete Edition offers a lot of content that is fun to play at least on normal difficulty.\n","December 13, 2013","true","37.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/201790/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1182 products in account","I suppose how much someone might enjoy OMD2 really depends on if they have a co-op partner.  This game was designed with the idea that you'd be playing co-op.  That doesn't mean you can't play it single player (and the game gives you more inventory slots for traps, weapons and trinkets if you do), but it's a lonely experience.  Even the campaign assumes you'll play co-op, as both characters -- the War Mage and the Sorceress -- converse during the game.\n\nThat said, if you do have a co-op partner (my wife is mine), then this game is an absolutel blast!  OMD2 successfully mixes strategy (tower defense), action and some wacky humor, so the game never gets dull or takes itself too seriously.\n\nHow you play depends on you.  You could rely more on traps or weapons or even trinkets, although the latter do more to augment gameplay than anything else.  Some weapons and traps are better than others on some maps, so you have to be able to adapt to your surroundings.\n\nIf you own the original OMD you get ten maps from the original game to play in OMD2.  Although this is a cool idea, thanking those who've supported the developer, some of the levels aren't new to OMD2 and others don't work extremely well with some of the newer traps.\n\nThe newest addition to OMD2 is the toolkit, which lets you create or edit weapons, traps and trinkets.  You can also download items other people have made from the Steam Workshop.\n\nBottom line:  If you see OMD2 on sale, grab it!  Even at it's normal price, it's still a good deal.  I'd also recommend checking out the developer's website (Robot Entertainment) as they sometimes have deals themselves, which is where my wife and I got our discounted copies.  Don't worry, you get a Steam key.","July 15, 2013","true","75.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The new enemies are great, all the more to keep away from the endless supplys of rifts.\n\nI never got into the new character, the sorceress. It is good that they put her there, but i stuck with the guy from the last game. it's a shame that you can't change the character freely without having to replay all the levels you worked so hard with on your last guy.\n\nCartoony graphics really suit the slaughter well, and the music is not too hard on the ears, but they are not any really memorable ones either. there is only one i can think of and thats when you beat the level, and it's quite catchy, but other than that they kind of sound the same to me.\n\nOverall a really good game to have fun with your friend.","May 31, 2014","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Orcs Must Die! 2 did not have a "wow-factor" for me in terms of the gameplay. I have played too much Dungeon Defenders to be new to third-person tower defense. What this game does shine in is the variety of traps, I enjoy having different load outs depending on the map and my play style. The pathing of waves are designed to be optimized for certain traps (ceiling, floor or walls). The game also supplies players with a good collection of weapons used on Orcs to company the automatic traps. In the game, there are only two classes to choose from; War Mage and Sorceress. The War Mage is a male character whose quotes are quite lighthearted but unintelligent. He has two "uniques" a trusty Blunderbuss, a shot-gun that also doubles as a grenade launcher, and Tar Trap that slows down enemies. The Sorceress, on the other hand, has a very different style. She is more of a passive character than the War Mage. Her unique trap, Acid Sprayer is able to apply short-term effects on enemies and her Sceptre of Domination can temporarily mind control. Even with the lack of characters, Orcs Must Die! 2 is still very enjoyable to play and, if single player is getting repetitive, online co-op is always available.","March 10, 2013","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The hero from the first adventure has to team up with an old enemy for an uneasy truce to fight back the endless horde of enemies.\n\nThe game now has co-op mode where the original lacked multiplayer of any kind. This yields some new pros & new cons. The plus side is that the game is much more fun being able to play with a friend, but that's about where the multiplayer perks end. OMD2 is designed mainly for two people to play at once & with the lack of a server browser, game lobby or matchmaking system of any kind, the only way to get people to join you is through friend invites. For somebody who has very few friends that actually plays the game, it's unlikely that they'll be able to get somebody to game with & therefore be able to progress through the game.\n\nThe traps & weapons have been hugely overhauled with a good number of additional traps & weapons being added. Trinkets have also been added in the sequel making things more interesting. Equipment can still be gained by playing through the storyline, but a large number of your equipment must be purchased using skulls gained through the game. OMD2 also allows for a wider range of upgrades to your equipment, so you get a choice what bonuses you would like your traps, weapons & trinkets to have & how powerful they are.","January 25, 2014","true","45.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It is a tower defence meets fps, at its core you are always trying to make brillent setups of many diffrent traps, some of them ar locked till you reach a certain ponit in the main story and allow you to buy them later on.\n\nWait did I hear buy? Yep, as you play the game and unlock the right to buy certain traps. You earn skulls, these can be used to buy new traps, weapons and upgrade ones you already have. You can also buy some awesome skins.\n\nThat is pretty much most of the game howeever, the game dose a great job by chllangeing you. The story steadly introduces new mobs and levels in a proper diffculty climb. You should never feel like a map is hopeless if you know what you are doing.\n\nNow another game mode is the games endless misssion.\n\nWait wut endless missions so they go on forever? Yup, like the name entails I have been to some pretty high waves. and its really very fun.\n\nStill not convinced, well this game also suports mods adding great reply ablitty. However it is already very high due to its awesome endless mission, story and the veries diffcultiys it can be beat on and even offers to diffrent characters to play as.\n\nAll in all this game has lots of content, always manages to pull me back in for a few waves amd still play it to this day with my friend after owning it for almost a year. You can not go wroung with this game. 8/10 would play again.\n\nIn the words of Doge very fun, much hours.","March 19, 2014","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You lay traps and have to survive waves of monsters in increasing strength and size. So what makes this game better than other tower defense you may ask.\nFirstly, the seamless graphics along with the interesting ability of playing an active and very important role in the defense is major to its sucess. You play as your character and you have to personally mow down the monsters where your traps fail.\nSecondly, the monsters require different ways to kill them, a koboldd sprinter is a small and fast unit with not a lot of hitpoints that can bypass most basic traps quite quickly and so need to be coupled either with some well placed shots to the head or another trap to slow the kobold to stop it from passing, whereas a heavy orc warrior would simply require a lot of traps or armor-piercing traps or shots to kill it. This necessity to vary trap combinations and styles plays a major role to the enjoyability of the game.\nThirdly, there are a plethora of traps and weapons to choose from, each providing a unique play style and experience. Thus you can customise your character either too a mean, lean killing machine or you can upgrade your traps say and lay down so nasty little traps in choke points that obliterate the enemy.\nFourthly, the game is not easy. For people who are not very good at tower defense games playing on anything but apprentice level can be a challenge, this skill level requirement or at least a certain level of understanding of the game is necessary as the game is challenging and keeps you on your toes, especially at later stages in the story or in nightmare or endless mode.\nLastly, the aspect of the game that makes it stand out so much from other games is the great co-op aspect. Can you name another tower defense that looks good, plays great, constantly challenges you to play at your best and allows for so many customizations? I think not. So, unless you have found a better tower defense game I highly recommend this game to whoever is looking for a challenging fun and funny game.","December 4, 2013","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/201790/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1182 products in account","I suppose how much someone might enjoy OMD2 really depends on if they have a co-op partner.  This game was designed with the idea that you'd be playing co-op.  That doesn't mean you can't play it single player (and the game gives you more inventory slots for traps, weapons and trinkets if you do), but it's a lonely experience.  Even the campaign assumes you'll play co-op, as both characters -- the War Mage and the Sorceress -- converse during the game.\n\nThat said, if you do have a co-op partner (my wife is mine), then this game is an absolutel blast!  OMD2 successfully mixes strategy (tower defense), action and some wacky humor, so the game never gets dull or takes itself too seriously.\n\nHow you play depends on you.  You could rely more on traps or weapons or even trinkets, although the latter do more to augment gameplay than anything else.  Some weapons and traps are better than others on some maps, so you have to be able to adapt to your surroundings.\n\nIf you own the original OMD you get ten maps from the original game to play in OMD2.  Although this is a cool idea, thanking those who've supported the developer, some of the levels aren't new to OMD2 and others don't work extremely well with some of the newer traps.\n\nThe newest addition to OMD2 is the toolkit, which lets you create or edit weapons, traps and trinkets.  You can also download items other people have made from the Steam Workshop.\n\nBottom line:  If you see OMD2 on sale, grab it!  Even at it's normal price, it's still a good deal.  I'd also recommend checking out the developer's website (Robot Entertainment) as they sometimes have deals themselves, which is where my wife and I got our discounted copies.  Don't worry, you get a Steam key.","July 15, 2013","true","75.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The much-awaited multiplayer experience is here, but this review will be from a single-player standpoint.\n\nTo start with, you get to pick between the Warmage and the Sorceress. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but the Warmage simply feels easier to play with due to his superior health, superior tar trap, and arguably superior weapon. The Sorceress is better for charming single, large targets though, and her acid trap does more damage than the Warmage's Arrow Trap.\n\nGameplay is more or less the same. If you played OMD1, this will all be familiar. The Elementalist girls are gone, which is a shame. This change means that you have less options to adjust to your enemies in the middle of a level. Fortunately any upgrades you purchased prior to battle can be reset at no cost. Autoballistae are now considered guardians, which means you can no longer spam them. I was sad about that as well.\n\nAmazingly they made the Gnolls more irritating. They seem to have more HP, run faster (both probably untrue, but it feels like it), and can now slow you upon hitting you, making escape impossible. A whole pack of them, especially in Endless mode (see below), will ruin your day.\n\nI'm rather disappointed that the campaign is so short. The first game took maybe 15-20 hours to complete, and had a good progression. OMD2 instead took me a mere 10 hours on normal difficulty. Granted, I already knew the basics of the game, but this was far shorter than I expected. DLC's extend the game's length a bit, but they contain no story segments, and thus you are basically playing for skulls (the game's peristent currency) and variety. Note that you'll have to play through Campaign again with another character if you want stuff unlocked on both characters.\n\nEndless mode is interesting. Waves come indefinitely and keep getting tougher until you can no longer handle it, much like Survival mode in other types of games. This mode by far is the biggest time-sink, though you are rewarded with plenty of skulls to compensate.\n\nIf you like the first game and want a way to play it with friends, then OMD2 is the way to go. Overall it's an acceptable game. I still recommend the first game though.","April 4, 2013","true","287.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You lay traps and have to survive waves of monsters in increasing strength and size. So what makes this game better than other tower defense you may ask.\nFirstly, the seamless graphics along with the interesting ability of playing an active and very important role in the defense is major to its sucess. You play as your character and you have to personally mow down the monsters where your traps fail.\nSecondly, the monsters require different ways to kill them, a koboldd sprinter is a small and fast unit with not a lot of hitpoints that can bypass most basic traps quite quickly and so need to be coupled either with some well placed shots to the head or another trap to slow the kobold to stop it from passing, whereas a heavy orc warrior would simply require a lot of traps or armor-piercing traps or shots to kill it. This necessity to vary trap combinations and styles plays a major role to the enjoyability of the game.\nThirdly, there are a plethora of traps and weapons to choose from, each providing a unique play style and experience. Thus you can customise your character either too a mean, lean killing machine or you can upgrade your traps say and lay down so nasty little traps in choke points that obliterate the enemy.\nFourthly, the game is not easy. For people who are not very good at tower defense games playing on anything but apprentice level can be a challenge, this skill level requirement or at least a certain level of understanding of the game is necessary as the game is challenging and keeps you on your toes, especially at later stages in the story or in nightmare or endless mode.\nLastly, the aspect of the game that makes it stand out so much from other games is the great co-op aspect. Can you name another tower defense that looks good, plays great, constantly challenges you to play at your best and allows for so many customizations? I think not. So, unless you have found a better tower defense game I highly recommend this game to whoever is looking for a challenging fun and funny game.","December 4, 2013","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Orcs Must Die! 2 is everything you could want out of an Orcs Must Die game and more, the co op, new towers and weapons, new maps, and really just alot of fun stuff to play around with. The only negative I have with the game, is that there are no server browsers or anything, you have to have a friend join you if you want to play co op.\n\nIf you did not already know, the goal of the gameplay is to fight off orcs and other magical beasts (trolls, kobolds, ogres, ect.) that are emerging from magical rifts. There is a story and most plot elements are at least touched upon over the three Orcs Must Die games. Orcs Must Die! 2 is worth yout time if you are looking for a good tower defense / action series, take a look, I am sure there is at least something you may like about the OMD series.","July 14, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here comes more orc-slaughtering mayhem at its absolute finest! This iteration has better graphics, more refined & compelling strategy, genuinely creative & exciting maps, and waaaay more delicious, delicious unlockables than the original (the hunger for skulls will be extreme - you've been warned!). There are several DLC packs now available which do an admirable job of forcing you to develop new killing techniques and motivating you to persist in slicing & dicing orcs (along with the newly added enemies) in order to earn yet more skulls which (as in the first game) are the currency with which you purchase new items and upgrades.\n\nThe crown jewel of this genocidal romp... The area where it *really* shines is, without a doubt, the co-op multi-player. This game has provided me with the most fun I've ever had with other players here on Steam. Grab this game (and all the DLC!) for yourself and a good friend, hop onto a Ventrilo or Teamspeak server and you absolutely won't regret the gore-soaked results. Best played with a 360 controller (in my opinion anyway; though a certain Aussie friend of mine insists that mouse/keyboard control is the way to go) and an unquenchable thirst for chaos on an orc-pocalyptic scale.

This means you have to shot the ones, that makes it through your baricats and taps. This makes the gameplay very fun, since the game has this changes of gameplay from time to time.\n\nYou can chosse between to charecters, the warmage and the sorccere. The warmage is based on attacking with a gun, that will do a lot of damage to the orponent. The sorccere can mindcontrole enemys, and therefore win time, or do big damage, by mindcontroling big enemyes.\n\nThe game`s story is not really important, and you don`t really pay attetnion to it. Normally I would say this is a bad thing. But for a game like this, story is not really anthing you want. You want to progress fast, and the game is very good at doing this.\n\nWhen the orcs come out, the waves becomes bigger, and the enemyes more tough. This accualy makes the game very hard at times. I higly recormend to play this with a friend. The game is fun when you play alone, but still, the game has more potentiol as a co-up game.

Being able to communicate is rather important as well. With 2 people you get a little more freedom in what 'towers' you can place. Plus two people beating the Orcs back with clubs is better than one! Grab your best bud and go to town smashing Orcs' faces in!\n\nOrcs Must Die! 2 is a Tower Defense with 3rd person combat and equipment. The Orcs come in waves and there are different types just like any TD. The towers are the more innovative part of this game. Some can be placed on the walls, such as arrow shooters. Others go on the ceiling like a big mace that swings back and forth, pushing Orcs down and off edges. Useful ground spikes and slowing tar will keep the Orcs' movement a few steps behind. Hire bomb wielding Dwarfs & Elven archers and place them wherever you see fit.\n\nYou can make pretty wacky scenes by using logic with knowledge of the physics and death triggers such as endless pits, lava or void portals. Maybe toss them in the Orc grinder! You manually control your chosen character (one of two - male or female, who have many different tower and weapon choices) while the wave is in progress and can use melee or ranged combat, along with magic to help stave off their advance. Trinket choice and passive effects are a big game changer as well, once you unlock them.\n\nThey have different challenges, time trials and survival tests as well to keep occupied with. All you really need to know is there are Orcs... and Orcs Must Die! (2!!!)","September 25, 2014","true","70.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You lay traps and have to survive waves of monsters in increasing strength and size. So what makes this game better than other tower defense you may ask.\nFirstly, the seamless graphics along with the interesting ability of playing an active and very important role in the defense is major to its sucess. You play as your character and you have to personally mow down the monsters where your traps fail.\nSecondly, the monsters require different ways to kill them, a koboldd sprinter is a small and fast unit with not a lot of hitpoints that can bypass most basic traps quite quickly and so need to be coupled either with some well placed shots to the head or another trap to slow the kobold to stop it from passing, whereas a heavy orc warrior would simply require a lot of traps or armor-piercing traps or shots to kill it. This necessity to vary trap combinations and styles plays a major role to the enjoyability of the game.\nThirdly, there are a plethora of traps and weapons to choose from, each providing a unique play style and experience. Thus you can customise your character either too a mean, lean killing machine or you can upgrade your traps say and lay down so nasty little traps in choke points that obliterate the enemy.\nFourthly, the game is not easy. For people who are not very good at tower defense games playing on anything but apprentice level can be a challenge, this skill level requirement or at least a certain level of understanding of the game is necessary as the game is challenging and keeps you on your toes, especially at later stages in the story or in nightmare or endless mode.\nLastly, the aspect of the game that makes it stand out so much from other games is the great co-op aspect. Can you name another tower defense that looks good, plays great, constantly challenges you to play at your best and allows for so many customizations? I think not. So, unless you have found a better tower defense game I highly recommend this game to whoever is looking for a challenging fun and funny game.","December 4, 2013","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

There are so many new levels, traps, trinkets, and a new character in addition to the levels from the first game added on. All of that plus the DLC for an extremely low cost makes this game worth the $10 you will spend on a Steam sale. Infact, I bought this game full price and I have no regret.\n\nThe newly added cooperative play makes the playability of this game extremely high. There is always something to achieve whether that be the actual achievements or simply personal targets in-game. The time it takes to 5-skull every level on story mode and endless mode is long so there is no shortage of game content.\n\nMany reviews I see on here under the "only negative" category are complaints about issues I have not seen. Once you get a friend to play with, this game is endlessly fun.\n\nThe only issue I have ever had with this game is a single broken achievement.\n\n10/10.

Being able to communicate is rather important as well. With 2 people you get a little more freedom in what 'towers' you can place. Plus two people beating the Orcs back with clubs is better than one! Grab your best bud and go to town smashing Orcs' faces in!\n\nOrcs Must Die! 2 is a Tower Defense with 3rd person combat and equipment. The Orcs come in waves and there are different types just like any TD. The towers are the more innovative part of this game. Some can be placed on the walls, such as arrow shooters. Others go on the ceiling like a big mace that swings back and forth, pushing Orcs down and off edges. Useful ground spikes and slowing tar will keep the Orcs' movement a few steps behind. Hire bomb wielding Dwarfs & Elven archers and place them wherever you see fit.\n\nYou can make pretty wacky scenes by using logic with knowledge of the physics and death triggers such as endless pits, lava or void portals. Maybe toss them in the Orc grinder! You manually control your chosen character (one of two - male or female, who have many different tower and weapon choices) while the wave is in progress and can use melee or ranged combat, along with magic to help stave off their advance. Trinket choice and passive effects are a big game changer as well, once you unlock them.\n\nThey have different challenges, time trials and survival tests as well to keep occupied with. All you really need to know is there are Orcs... and Orcs Must Die! (2!!!)","September 25, 2014","true","70.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only problem is that theres is a lot of orcs - orcs that MUST die! 10/10\n\n8/8/15 UpdateHere's a more descriptive view on the game, but a short one. Orcs Must Die! 2 is a sequel to the original, bringing us more gorey ways in destroying the one-sided army of the bloodthirsted Orcs. In protecting each given stronghold, given many traps and trinkets to fend them off in any given way possible to your imagination. All the while, progressing through the story of fending off the last strongholds against the growing threat.\n\nAnyways, I loved the game from the start, being able to choose different routes and ways to take each level, all the while, being competitive to take the first place within your Friend Leaderboard to show you were the best one to make a route crazy enough to be that well, in the first place. While with DLC to offer you more ways to slay them all down, there isn't a way to truly put a stop the Orc's, as they just keep coming, until their prepared army is scaled down to nothing but dust.

Not that that's a bad thing! The formula works, hell in this one they even improved a few things.\nThis time you can choose between 2 characters to play as, the apprentice or the antagonist from the previous game. Each of the characters has their strengths and weaknesses, the apprentice carries on as he did before but now gives you the choice of crossbow, blunderbuss. The crossbow being the same as the last game and the blunderbuss causing far more damage but having a much longer reload time. The sorceress has less health than the apprentice but more mana and she can control a Orc and make him fight the others for a short period. As well as that some of the starting traps are different depending on which you choose as well as a few unlockables later.\nSpeaking of traps there are some new ones, all of which are entertaining to see unfold, the levels also sometimes have environmental traps built in which you can take advantage of.\nThis time there are far more unlockables to collect, costumes that change your abilities, rings and trinkets to enhance the way you play and of course the upgrades.\n\nLike the first game it's repetitive as hell, but what do you expect? And also like the first it's difficulty seems to ramp up out of nowhere.\n\nI recommend this game to those who have either played the first and want more of the same. If your new to the series... Well start here. It's a better game really, since it's the first one plus extras.\nI'd say Â£11.99 is a little steep though considering the first is essentially the same minus a few parts. See if you can find it a bit cheaper or on a sale. Anything below Â£10 is a bargain really.","April 18, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the first game you can work strategically and get a solid defense with work.  In this game everything is balanced down to a mediocre state, so no matter what you do your player has to do a lot of the killing.  This is probably intended but it's less fun than the first game.  The game is still great though.  I still recommend playing it after the original.","November 15, 2015","true","80.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Place traps, fight hordes, and different maps come with all kinds of different challenges.\n\nMy personal favorite part is the variety in options you have to choose from when you create your build. There are probably around one hundred choices to equip, and you can only use 6 at a time, allowing for great differentiation and a unique build that fits your playstyle.

However, I probably would have not bought this at full price (25% reason being that I'm poor).\n\nThe game itself is great. A tower defense+FPS with funny dialouge and great graphics. Very fun game. My only complaint about this is the mouse. The mouse sensitivity is quite high which can be annoying. It gets annoying trying to turn the other way and somehow the the screen makes a 360. With that being said, the aiming can get tough too, especially trying to shoot the fast runners. Swing your cursor to fast, you're gonna miss the target. Swing it slow, you're gonna miss the target.

You can choose the 4-8 traps, weapons, and utilities you use at the beginning of each round, and upgrade them too. The upgrade system allows you to choose one of two unique stat buffs / extra abilities, and gives an additional aspect to modify your items each round. There is a lot of clicking involved for some personal items (especially the sorceress's Staff of Domination). Co-op is also an aspect which, in my opinion, enhances the experience to a degree; However, the game can be completed entirely alone.\n\nThe OST is most noticable during the beginning of the waves, and the last wave, where it conveys the chaos taking place when the late-game waves start throwing hundreds of orcs, imps, golems and trolls at you. Orcs Must Die 2 definately has some charm to it's presentation.\n\nOverall, I think it's a no brainer to pick it up on sale, as it provided me with a good 20 or so hours of fun (though I did not complete all DLC maps)","February 23","true","20.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game it's a solid "Tower" Defense game (with a nice twist), a third person action game and also has nice rpg elements in it (like unlocking new traps, weapons, upgrades and so on). Also the sense of humour it's a nice touch and well done overall, I just wish there were more lines or voice acting between the 2 main characters.\nYeah I know, you are here for the killing but the interaction and presentation of the game really got me hooked and wanted to know even more about the story and characters.\n\nThe game has coop, and some modes to keep things fresh but I'm having a blast with endless mode for the moment. Oh, and the game has steamworkshop built in so that's a nice plus too. I only wish there were more sorceress skins over there.. yeah..\n\nVery good game and addictive too.

Also, the voice acting, although not extensive, makes for some funny moments.\n\nTry it, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're looking for a game that you can pick up, play for an hour or so and then do something else and not regret wasting your time, then I would wager that this is the game for you.","January 15, 2014","true","70.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I probably would have not bought this at full price (25% reason being that I'm poor).\n\nThe game itself is great. A tower defense+FPS with funny dialouge and great graphics. Very fun game. My only complaint about this is the mouse. The mouse sensitivity is quite high which can be annoying. It gets annoying trying to turn the other way and somehow the the screen makes a 360. With that being said, the aiming can get tough too, especially trying to shoot the fast runners. Swing your cursor to fast, you're gonna miss the target. Swing it slow, you're gonna miss the target. Other than that, great game, and very well worth the price on sale.","February 23","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/201790/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick Summary: Orcs Must Die 2 is the co-op follow-up to the original game and while there are changes in maps and some of the traps, the core gameplay is the same. This is a good thing because the first Orcs Must Die is awesome, and only lacked the ability to play with your friends.\n\nSpoilers Ahead\nIf youâve played the first Orcs Must Die recently you will remember that at the end, the war mage (you) closed the rifts into the orc world and trapped the evil sorceress on the other side with her minions. Closing the rifts had the side effect of making magic unusable, so the power she had over the orcs is gone, and now they want her dead. In this sequel, one last rift is opened by an old wise wizard (presumed dead in the first game) and the sorceress has escaped being chased by her former orcs. Itâs team up time, and the war mage must work with the sorceress to stop the hordes of orcs from breaking through the rift into the human world.\n\nThis time around you can choose which character to play the game as: war mage or sorceress. Mostly theyâre the same but each has a couple of traps unique to them.  For example the war mage has the tar trap (one of the best floor traps) and the sorceress has the acid spray wall trap (decent against heavy enemies). Consensus seems to be that war mage is better overall. I played the sorceress and had fun with the polymorph ring against the super heavy enemies.\n\nJust like the first Orcs Must Die, the game is broken up into a series of independent map levels, and every level you start from scratch setting up traps and barricades to kill all the orcs before they reach the rift (or rifts). Itâs a hybrid tower defense/third person shooter, so youâre in the thick of the action, blasting enemies along with your traps, or mopping up the ones who manage to break past. Every level you beat gives you âskullsâ which are currency to buy upgrades for traps or unlock new spells/traps. Unlike the first game, you can replay levels over and over to farm skulls and eventually buy every upgrade.\n\nPros:\n+Co-op campaign! You can play every level with a friend. This along with the skull farming adds a lot of replayability to the campaign.\n+Pretty much everything good in the first game is still there, including maps for the first game. You can play the âclassic levelsâ with the new traps and sorceress character.\n\n\nCons:\n-The âendless modeâ gets buggy as you get to higher levels. Maybe itâs my computer but it really started to lag around wave 35. It actually crashed for me a couple times.\n\nOverall, if you liked Orcs Must Die 1, you should like part 2. Theyâre basically the same game with added improvements, options, and levels for the sequel.\n","March 17","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wrong =p plenty of enemy types, and lot and lots of them.  And how you go about attacking them is totally up to you and the tools you choose to get the job done.\n\nThere are various different traps, helpers (guardians), trinkets (like armor pieces), and weapons you can equip and upgrade via skulls you earn from how you do on each lvl you play through, fun process and makes it have something to work towards ;) ; rewarding to say the least.\n\nEven at full price I'd can whole heartedly recommend this game, the dlc on other hand I'm not totally sure of yet, b/c most of the dlc was included in the pack I bought, so hard for me to judge the bang for buck on the dlc.\n\nFun game though.","March 14","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brings a lot of fun to a concept I havent seen done this well in a long time. The game pits you against angry mobs of orcs and other mythical creatures and does it with simplicity and fun!\n\nThe game starts with a short story about why the orcs are attacking and so on and so forth. However from there you start. Orcs spawn from a single (or up to 4 locations later on) location and have one goal. Reach a predetermined  "door" if you will on the map, and beat the heck out of anything that stands between them and the objective. If too many enemies pass through the door you must retry the level.\n\nYou can choose between two characters. A male character or a female character. The male character comes equipped with a shot gun and his own set of default traps to throw off enemies with. The female caracter comes with a wand that you can shoot either lower power bolts from faster or shoot charged up high damage bolts that also have a short ranged knockdown effect on enemies around the enemy hit with it.\n\nThe game offers new traps,trinkets, and weapons avalible to your character iin the spellbook. The in game store that uses skulls as currency that you obtain through beating levels. Everything is upgradable and it's always fun to see what kind of damage you can do with an uprgraded trap or weapon.\n\nCo-op is the name of the game for the best fun in this game. Grab a buddy and you two can stop the orcs together! It's the same concept as playing alone except for that you get to do it with a friend. For me it return my mind to a simpler time sitting in my parents living room ripping through a game with a freind. It's great fun!\n\nThe game also comes with an endless mode in which enemies spawn in an infinite number of waves. It adds a lot of replay value after a somewhat short campaign. (maybe 5 to 6 hours).\n\nPut aside anydoubt and pick up this game if you think it looks good. It's a great buy and will give you lots of entertainment especially with the three DLC pack bringing new levels and weapons. An easy 9/10 for me!","January 5, 2014","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is in fact my first one.\n\nTo get right to the point of it...I loved the game.  If the name wasn't a dead giveaway, the game has a silly, lighthearted tone to most of it that, when combined with the creative ways you can inflict mass orc genocide (some favorites being hurling them by the packs into bottomless chasms with a well timed gust of wind and launching them ragdoll-style for their afternoon lava bath), leads to plenty of destructive catharsis.\n\nWhile you can play all the missions single player...the game is at its best (IMO) when played with a friend.  Many a map benefits heavily from having a second mind on hand to help combat the games challenges, and with co-op your individual action bar is halved so it emphasizes working and planning together.\n\nThe missions also reward player skill with the main currency of the game, skulls.  Doing things like beating a mission within a certain time limit...not letting anyone through your defenses...and even "hidden" bonuses like not using mana or not taking damage all reward you with additional skulls after the level.  If however you're not that great at pulling things off that way, levels can be farmed repeatedly for unlimited skulls so you aren't punished harshly.\n\nIn conclusion...recommended.  Get a friend...get some chips...and get killing.","December 28, 2014","true","18.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Youâll be allowed to pre-pick what traps and weapons youâd like to use before the waves of enemies start coming, place said traps, and then take an active role in stopping them yourself.\n\nOrcs Must Die! 2 keeps with the general theme.  The player will be allowed to pick between two characters (a male war mage or a female sorceress) and will immediately begin their trek from level to level, unlocking new traps and earning skulls to purchase upgrades.  The spellbook is a lot more impressive, providing the player with more traps and upgrade options.  Thereâs also a page for trinkets that give both passive and active effectsâ¦a welcome addition in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, Orcs Must Die! 2 is a great game that Iâve had a lot of fun with so far.  I look forward to unlocking more of its content, all the while listening to the gameâs soundtrack.  If you liked Orcs Must Die! or just enjoy a good tower defense game, then give this game your attention.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyew8B7VJGE","October 13, 2014","true","44.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The developer team made many efforts for the combination of stuffs. At first, it has the most amount of stuffs(including weapons, trinkets and guardians) so far during the tower defense genre. Secondly, the combination of different traps, weapons and trinkets makes its strategies much more extensive and variable. All right, I admit its normal mode is quite a bit easy. But in nightmare and endless mode,you will pay more concentration on the combination of different useful stuffs for victory. Its co-op mode is another excellence compared to other similiar games. Unlike Dungeon Defender, you must have close cooperation with your partner in OMD2. Or you will surely be defeated by the orc very soon. Heroism creed is not necessary and is a poisonous seed to the playing experience. I remember when playing co-op in Dungeon Defenders, the only thing I can do was to rest and watch beside if one of my partners used the magician class. That was so boring that I gave up playing with others. If you worry about how to combine various stuffs, this game has the weekly challange to teach you the trick of most stuffs. If you are a fan of tower defense game and co-op, this game would be the one you must have.","April 17, 2013","true","117.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a 3rd person tower defense-style game, where the objective is to stop orcs from getting to a rift by utilizing various traps and weapons/spells. If you enjoyed the first game, you will definately enjoy this one as well- same orc slaughter, but more traps and weapons to use and upgrade. Orcs Must Die! 2 has a big upgrade system- you get "skulls" after each map to spend on upgrading your traps and weapons in many different ways. The better you do, the more skulls you get, and your upgrades persist thoughout all of the modes, allowing you to tackle the very hard modes such as endless and nightmare.\n\nThere is also is coop, which I think is a big selling point for this game. I just completed the story mode with my friend, and it was a ton of fun. Watching your combined traps massacre hundreds of orcs as they try to pass by is just so satisfying. As you get into harder levels, teamwork becomes very important as you try to hold the line against and army of orcs.\n\nEven after you complete the story, there is still much you can do- endless mode (never ending waves of orcs, see how long you can last), nightmare mode (harder difficulty, but you keep your previous upgrades as I mentioned before), and many other modes.\n\nThere are a couple of downsides, though, that I will mention. First off, the in-game voice chat is downright awful, and overrides the steam chat so you can't use it. There is no way to turn it off, so my friend and I just made it push-to-talk, bound the key to something we never used, and then used skype or mumble.\n\nAlso, there really isn't much of a "story", it is not what this game's focus is- it is all about the gameplay. So if you are a person who is looking for a good story to drive you through the game, this is not it.\n\nThis game is not for everyone. If you don't like 3rd person action or tower/wave defense games, I don't think this will really change your mind about the genres. But if you have any interest at all in the game, I would definitely pick it up. It is very good at what it does.\n\nLastly, many of the levels seem to be made with coop in mind. If you plan to play though this game solo, you might have a difficult time getting through some of the levels.\n\nOverall, this game was a blast to play with my friend. If you are looking for a good coop game to play with a buddy, I strongly recommend you try out Orcs Must Die! 2. Even alone, though, this game can still be a fun time. It has a light sense of humor about it that makes it all the more enjoyable, despite the fact that you are slaughtering orcs by the thousands!","January 1, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Offering new features such as co-operative play with a friend and levels with unlimited play, this game is definitely an improvement on its predecessor.  In this title, you take up the role of the War Mage, previously tasked with closing all magical rifts allowing orcs into his world and now tasked with protecting that same world from an orcish incursion alongside his old enemy.\n\nOrcs Must Die! 2 plays as some sort of hybrid between a third-person action/shooter game and a tower defense title.  With good fortune, the game does this beautifully and seamlessly.  Levels are spent with players both working on building up their defenses and then taking upon themselves the challenge of killing any orcs that may have managed to survive through the vast and sometimes comedic array of traps that they've established.\n\nIf you enjoy third person shooter or action games and have any interest in tower defense, this game may be for you.  This game may also suit anyone wishing to find a shooting/action experience with a little bit of unique element implementation.  Anyone looking for a great game for two-player co-op should also look here.\n\nKey Features:\n- Co-Operative Experience (2 players)\n- Tower Defense Elements\n- Third Person Action/Third Person Shooter Elements\n- Waves of Enemies\n- Heavy Comic Relief\n- Upgrades and Skill Trees\n\nTime Personally Spent on Orcs Must Die! 2: 18 hours","December 31, 2013","true","26.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You set traps for incoming enemy orcs, playing solo or co-op (recommended, the game excels in co-op) and also strike down the orcs with your weapons. The goal is to not get any orc escape. While maybe lacking in depth and a very repetitive idea for a game - it's brainlessly fun and addicting, especially in co-op which is a new feature to the series.\n\nNote that Orcs Must Die! 2 makes the first game very much obsolote, yet the first game is worthy of owning as you can get the maps from it to play in OMD2.\n\nIt's worthy to also note that this game plays very similarly to the first game. If you didn't enjoy it, the sequel won't do it for you either. But if you did enjoy it or are new to the series and have a friend to play it, I really recommend this game for some fun, smooth action.","December 13, 2013","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
