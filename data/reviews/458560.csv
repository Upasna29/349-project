"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chatoten/recommended/458560/","Chatoten","Chatoten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chatoten/","482 products in account","Plastic Playground has some serious technical issues. I cannot imagine the developer not having encountered these issues in playtesting, and I have no idea why the game was allowed to be released with such game breaking problems. I try my best not to judge a game, especially one by a small studio, for technical problems, but I legitimately was not able to play the game. I was able to load a into a match with myself for a short amount of time, but anything more than that would cause the game to fail in one way or another.\n\nThere are two HUGE issues that completely ruin the game for me:\n\nTrying to host a game with more than just myself would cause my game to crash. To be fair I did not extensively test different scenarios to see what was causing the problem, I only tried it with two online friends, but considering that many other reviews appear to be having the same issue I am not sure there is a fix.\nThere appears to be a rather serious memory leak issue. After about 7 minutes of being in a game alone, the only setup that ever worked for me, my framerate dropped considerably to around 15 FPS. Up until then the game ran perfectly fine, but unfortunately all I could do at that point was close the game and relaunch it.\nI also had a few other minor issues, though I would have excused the game if these were the only issues:\n\nI do not think an IP-based, peer-to-peer hosting system is ideal for this sort of game at all. This is one of the more serious issues (though not game breaking like the first two issues) because I feel this ruins any online component of the game beyond trying to play a game with a few friends. I do understand that any other system would have been considerably more expensive and complex, and I get that the developer probably intended for this game to played in a LAN party sort of setting, but a multiplayer only game needs players and the current setup drastiaclly limits the number of available players.\nControl over a match you are hosting is very limited. You can only select a game type, a time limit and a score limit before the game starts; beyond that you have no control of the game whatsoever. You cannot kick players, call any sort of vote, or change/balance teams.\nA player cannot join a game already in progress, even if that game is empty.\nVery few graphical options, and you cannot modify them during a game.\nThe worst part of this whole situation is that I legitimately wanted to play the game with my friends, and I simply couldn't due to the technical issues this game has. The trailer looked fun, and I had fun playing with the mechanics of the game while I was alone in a game, but as soon as I tried to actually get to the real game everything just fell apart. I even commend the developer for trying to fix issues; I don't think the resolutions that have been created/recommended are that great, but there was effort put forth.\n\nIf the game was playable it could have been fun.","May 17","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I was walking home one day from my day job as an ant farm rancher, when I came across this little toy. I didn't hink anything of it at the time, but I later find out that it belonged to my little sisters older brother... me. I had a bad case of the feels for about a day or so. I was sad and using my head thoughts a lot, basically wandering around to dust in the wind for 48 hours. Until I woke up on the third day like our lord and savior, more hungover than a week bender with a keg and pool full of wine, with a shine in my eye. This was the game that reminds me of that toy that put me through hell and brought me back to heaven in only the best of ways. Thank you Plastic Playground.

First, it took like 1 or 2 minutes on my computer to load, idk why. Then, when the game finally loaded, I tried to join a game, but I couldn't click the menu options, so I quit, and started the game again, and the same problem happened. When I got to click a single option, it was like christmas, and the problem was that the resolution of the game was bigger, so I had to drag the mouse at the bottom of the screen to click.\n\nWhen I got to "join" a game, I was expecting the game to have less than 12 players or some per server, but there weren't any servers... The last thing I did was to play alone, just to see the game itself, and it was a little bit like I was expecting, just a "Little" bit... The sound effects are average, the music is boring, controls... well, okay-bad, and the jetpack is awkward to use. Funny thing, I was lagging in the menu, but not in-game. Don't get it until they do something, or at least  when it's playable, and there's people to play with, not more, just some, because there aren't any.","May 28","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
