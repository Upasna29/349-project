"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekmet/recommended/61600/","kekmet","kekmet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekmet/","501 products in account","Growing up, I had this cat.\n\nShe loved going outside, but was too wild to stay in the yard and out of traffic, so whenever she wanted to go out, we would hook her into a harness and let her roam the yard in that. My cat hated the harness, and as soon as it came out, she would turn into a puddle of fur, meat and disconnected bones that made threading her into the harness both an act of frustration and love.\n\nZen Bound 2 is a lot like that cat.\n\nThe object of the game is to wrap up an item with string, which places paint on the object. The objective is to completely cover each wooden effigy with paint. The main object in your arsenal is just to turn and rotate the item to slowly wrap it up, but the game includes nail bombs and paint bombs that also splash paint across the item. It's a simple enough premise in theory, and certainly something I had never come across before.\n\nPerhaps it simply takes a certain type of person to appreciate this kind of game, but I found the puzzles in Zen Bound 2 frustrating me more than relaxing me, and the ambient sounds of rope pulling taut just made me go tense alongside it. I've seen other reviewers say it was soothing, though, so it all depends. The controls seemed tense and unforgiving to me, like I had little control over where the rope would fall, and what it stuck on or slid off of seems inconsistent.\n\nYou unlock new levels by covering a wide and delightful array of lovingly-rendered wooden figures, and each 'level' is represented by paper lanterns hanging from a tree. The aesthetic appeal of this game, with its clean and warm graphics, is undeniable, and even clever. I've only seen some of them so far, and look forward to unlocking the rest. The music is similarly Zen, very appropriate to the game.\n\nI did encounter some freezing, stuttering, and long lag times, with items getting 'stuck' mid-turn and glitching out, along with the music and sound effects.\n\nThe fact that the game did not give me the experience I had expected doesn't mean I did not enjoy it, though, and find my own reasons to enjoy it. The game is challenging and maybe even punishing, as Perfection always is. There's more to this game than its claws.","July 4, 2014","true","27.6"," 77 of 84 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","77","84","8","2"

Wherever the rope touches, a 'halo' of paint is applied, and the main goal is to cover as much of the object in paint as possible. Pins or nails are sometimes placed at strategic locations which can make the task easier or harder, based on your point of view.\n\nThough at times, it can be frustrating to get the rope to stick or slide where and when you want it to, this is an engaging and brain-bending puzzle game. There are numerous solutions to each puzzle because of the nature of the paint mechanic, but as the difficulty increases, the objects get more complex, and the rope gets shorter, you have to carefully plan your paths to make sure that full contact is made at the right depth levels before you move to other areas.\n\n100% completion is impossible, so if you strive for that satisfaction, don't search for it here. Casual puzzle gamers and people looking to burn 15-20 minutes at a time will love this.","October 17, 2014","true","1.0"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","1"

I enjoy having these lo-fi games installed amongst the more brash, louder and bigger titles that I play at any given point and Zen Bound 2 is one of those games that relaxes yet frustrates me in equal measures (especially when I realize I have screwed up my object yet again).\n\nHaving originally started out as a game for mobile touch screen devices, the conversion to PC is pretty much spot on. In fact this is the ideal kind of game to have installed on a mobile device that you play in bursts whilst traveling or waiting for a meeting to begin (in my case) or during a meeting (as in my case when the meeting is simply boring me to death).\n\nThe concept is simple - you are given a wooden object which you simply have to cover in string. This has the effect of applying paint to the object with the ultimate goal of having the entire wooden object decked out in paint before progression to the next object begins. Along the way you will encounter paint bombs that will need to be wrapped over in order to use. These paint bombs have the added effect of spreading the paint to more difficult regions and areas of the object. You are also limited by the amount of string you can apply to the object so you will have so spatially work out your next move by continuously rotating the object and making sure you are reaching all the paint bombs to maximize your efforts.\n\nThe object you begin with is easy enough and one should be able to cover it in one's sleep but the further you progress (wonderfully represented as different themes each containing a tree with hanging oriental lanterns). As each challenge is completed, these lanterns are lit and the player is then able to move onto the next challenge. The spatial puzzles do get a bit more difficult and tricky as the wooden objects get more complex and it can become quite a handful trying to make sure you cover as much of the object as possible whilst also trying to maximize your paint bombs with the limited piece of string you are given.\n\nGraphics and sound are wonderful and very Zen - as I am sure you would imagine considering the games title - and if you enjoy these kind of experiences I wouldn't hesitate recommending you pick it up. If you can,  rather purchase the tablet version which will allow you to get in some casual gaming in the work-space when you just need some downtime from your busy day. Zen Bound 2 Is an incredibly low-fi and pleasantly enjoyable experience that sometimes veers into frustration the further up the object tree you climb.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","January 30, 2014","true","10.3"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","34","46","2","1"

To me it is an intense mindbending challenge!  The object of the game is to get 100% coverage of a carved wooden shapes by wrapping it in as little of your length of rope as possible.  The rope is tied to one nail and you must tie it off (touch) to the finishing nail after getting at least the minimum amount of coverage.  The shapes and difficulty increase as you go.  It is really a wonder to me the amount of control you have moving the shape around as you work to wrap the rope around it.  It is extremely fluid.

The soundtrack is relaxing and emotional, assisting players to maintain a steady, calm focus throughout their play.\n\nBeing a game that was originally designed for the iPad and ported to the PC, the developers managed to do an amazing job.  The interface is simple, and grants a medium of challenge in controlling the objects being painted.

In fact, if it wasn't released years ago, I'd think this game was in early access...\n\nLet's get the good parts out of the way first: it's relaxing, plays reasonably well and has great music. And (as said) is pretty original, which means a lot. It has that typical "one more" sort of thing going on.\n\nThe bad part about it is that it makes mistakes that could've been (or even should have been) avoided. The main part: the intro. Yes, I get that it's going for a minimalistic approach. But a simple meter that displays which percentage you've 'covered' isn't too much to ask for, right? Or a visual feedback that you've completed the level.\nEven more bothersome is that you have to actually exit the level to see which percentage you actually covered. Or whether you did reasonable, okay or great (not unimportant, as you need to know that for unlockable future things). There's no tutorial either. On one hand, it's not like this game is hard to wrap your head around, but nothing at all is just not enough.\nAnd I'd love it if there were some options on the screen. It's like the only keyboard button to be used is 'escape' (which you'll need to press once you finished a level if you want to actually do anything but admire your wrapped present). I only accidentally stumbled upon the 'restart' option, and I think I'd rather have a rewind and forward button with it...though that may have been too hard to implement. Same for my wish to temporaly turn the object to glass and make anything but 20 cm of rope invisible...I'm sometimes just binding in the blind.\nOne thing that really shouldn't be that hard is an option to zoom in and out. For the same reasons already mentioned.\nEDIT: just noticed that there's some sort of bug...there actually IS a percentage meter, as well as an indication of length. It's just not displayed on my monitor by default for some reason (I get it by alt-tabbing out of the game and then back in again...which for some reasons causes me not to be able to start a level :-\ ). Rather than deleting the above, I'll mention it. Perhaps my 1920x1080 resolution is to blame? :-\\n\n\nWow...seems like my last paragraph is quite a lot longer than my previous one. Don't let that fool you, though. I gave it a thumbs up for a reason: the game is certainly fun to play. And despite the mentioned quirks, you actually feel like you're in control of what you're doing.

You wrap rope around different shaped things and try to cover as much as possible, there's other mechanics added in, and it's ridiculously addictive. One problem for me though is that, for some reason, sound effects keep cutting out halfway through, but I'm sure it's either a result of my probably mediocre sound card or a bug I will get around to working out.","October 18, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it as part of a bundle that had some other games I wanted in it. But it was an interesting experience playing it.\n\nI have to say that it is a very unique form of puzzle game. You're given a 3D object in 3D space, and you attempt to tie it up with rope, and cover it in paint. A very simple game mechanic that can very quickly become complex. The levels themselves come in various complexities and styles.\n\nInitially, I found managing the camera to be quite odd, but once I got the hang of it the game plays quite well.\n\nThe graphics in this game are not overy complex, but they do a fairly good job at detailing the materials of the the objects. The rope can get a bit glitchy at time, though.\n\nThis game has a calming "zen-like" soundtrack to go with your ropework. It fits very well.\n\nI still don't think I fully understand the concept behind this game, but if you are into the whole "zen" and "calming" puzzle game experience, then this is definitely worth a buy.","November 28, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this game doesn't deliver the down-tempo experience that the description states. Unlike Osmos or Eufloria (true down-tempo indie games), there is never a single second of time when you can sit back and enjoy this game's atmosphere while watching your plans unfold.\n\nZen Bound is basically a game of fidgeting and fighting with the controls until you get your desired result. The lack of a "z-axis" control means you don't get all the control you want, and instead this is 90% frustration, 10% grim satisfaction. There is no euphoria, no "a ha" moment in this game.\n\nPresentation is attractive, and the sound is very good, too.

Tie ropes around 3D objects and try to cover as much of the object area while using as little rope as possible.\n\nIt gently introduces the player with simple objects at the beginning where you can afford to miss out a few inches of rope and gradually introducing more and more complex objects where every inch of rope must be carefully analyzed and conserved to prevent wastage.\n\nGraphics are simple but look very nice and sharp. Music has a very alternative feel, and is soothing, relaxing and meditative.\n\nAlthough the game's control scheme of using a mouse works well, there are times where it feels more suited for touchscreen devices which it was originally designed for.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.0 / 10\nDefinitely worth to buy if you like very casual and relaxing puzzle games.","July 17, 2012","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can plow through the content in fairly short order, or take the time to set your own challenges.  Admittedly, the controls can be a bit finicky at times, and it doesn't lend itself to longer play sessions.  The audio and visual presentation is top notch, however, helping set a chilled out tone, with a strong influence of traditional Japanese aesthetic.  Definitely recommended if you enjoy games that don't really pressure you and help put you in a state of decompression.","December 22, 2013","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's just a puzzle game where you wrap a rope around a wooden piece, trying to cover as much of the puzzle as possible. There's sometimes nails to use to help you, or nooks and crannies on the piece that make it more difficult.\n\nThe biggest issue was the learning curve with the controls. Playing it with a mouse is a little tedious... but it is supposed to be a zen game. It's fun to play once in a while, and relaxing as well. It's calming to watch the paint spread out over the puzzle whenever the rope touches it, and the background music is mellow.\n\nYou unlock more puzzles as you go, so there's a bit of motivation there.

The background textures are a little bit pixelated on my computer at a resolution of 1600x900, but the actual models and the menus are perfect.

A calming, almost minimalist gameplay style and visual makes it easier to contemplate what you need to do to get that obsessively desired 100%. The visuals are wonderful - shaded and detailed, while an out-of-focus background gives a feeling of containment within a world, it doesn't cramp your playing space. The audio features simple rope creaks and paint pops, all to an asian instrumental soundtrack.\n\nThe entire gam is tied together by trees - each puzzle being a hanging ornament on your tree, and your level rating being rated by your karma, giving the game a truly satisfying, yet calming whole.","June 1, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I have to say that this was one of the most relaxing gaming experiences I ever had. There's something meditative about wrapping all these wooden 3D models with rope to paint them. And while in theory the mechanic of painting these objects is fairly simple in execution it can lead to a few quite hard objects so it truly challenges your spatial visualization ability. Thankfully I have plenty of experience working with 3D modelling software so to me it's fairly straightforward how I have to use my mouse to rotate an object in the desired way, but I can imagine that for people who aren't used to this it can be quite challenging. It took me about 4 hours to play through the entire game and never did I feel bored with the experience. Yeah, there's no story to this it's simply gameplay that's presented with an excellent aesthetic - both visually and aurally - with high-resolution textures and very pleasing sound effects. 5 bucks for that, definitely worth it, though I probably need to mention that I bought it at a Humble Bundle for 20 cents, but still, it's worth the asking price if you buy it when it's not on sale somewhere.","October 27, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's just a puzzle game where you wrap a rope around a wooden piece, trying to cover as much of the puzzle as possible. There's sometimes nails to use to help you, or nooks and crannies on the piece that make it more difficult.\n\nThe biggest issue was the learning curve with the controls. Playing it with a mouse is a little tedious... but it is supposed to be a zen game. It's fun to play once in a while, and relaxing as well. It's calming to watch the paint spread out over the puzzle whenever the rope touches it, and the background music is mellow.\n\nYou unlock more puzzles as you go, so there's a bit of motivation there.

The only big flaw with the game is that the rope's "stickiness" sometimes feels uneven since it will sometimes act like it's glued down and other times slip off easily.

Wonder no more!\nThe gamey aspect is that the thread or rope "paints" a little area where it touches the wood. You have a set percentage you need to paint to proceed, a limited rope and you need to finnish to the starting nail. Physics engine works quite nicely, although sometimes the control scheme with mouse feels a tad inadequate.\nIt's a perfect game as such but would really - really benefit from VR support.
