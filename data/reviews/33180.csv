There is definitely more of an RPG feeling as you get to choose from quite a few perks to make the gameplay more interesting. There is more of a story, and the graphics look less arcadish and more gritty. Definitely stronger than the first title. This is a fun game to play when you want to kill zombies and relax while doing it.

However whereas with the two original Zombie and Alien Shooter games Zombie was the slightly better game with the sequels Alien Shooter is the superior speciment, for what little that means.\n\nThey're still pretty much the same game. For the sequel a small RPG feature was added and the maps opened up a bit more. Unfortunately it's still a pretty crappy game, not really worth your money.\n\nThanks to the Indie Gala however many people will end up owning this and if you do you can get quite a few more hours of out this because it's done away with the atrocious short campaigns of the original. With a bit of exploration there is 5-6 hours in Zombie Shooter 2 and while it can be good for a bit of fun the game is just such a low budget money grab that you will feel a little dirty after playing.\n\nBest selling point of Zombie Shooter 2 is the dialog and voice-acting which is so bad it actually is hilarious.","November 8, 2012","false","15.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

I enjoyed the first game, so I was slightly excited to see what improvements were made with the sequel. Instead of being sprite-based, it has polygon zombies and character models. That sounds like an improvement, but it chugs on my system. My computer can max out any AAA game as of this review. Even after turning the settings to low I have the same problem.\n\nAlso, you can see that they tried to change/upgrade the weapon system, but it turned it into a clunky mess.\n\nThe voice acting is terrible. You can tell it's europeans speaking with terrible American accents. Actually, that may be the best part of the game.\n\n","May 14, 2014","false","1.5"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","2"

How do we start?\n\nThis game is slightly better than Zombie Shooter, but as a sequel it's still weak.\n\nPro: - Characterbuilding and choice of different characters.\n- Graphics that look darker and more fiting to the genre.\n\nCon: - The gameplay still is sucky, there are sometimes invisible obstacles that stop a shotgun burst amongst other bugs.\n- The sound gets soon very enervating, especialy the noises that double up as music.\n- Though it's dated, the game could have been more than what was delivered. It is better than part one, but since part one was the original sin - this game doesn't at all get away good.\n\nAll in all there is to say, this game is only good when on some kind of bundle. And even then it might dissapoint you.\n\nI can't recommend this game even to genre die hards, because it has only a limited charme.","May 13, 2014","false","1.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Play first the Campaign mode, then the others.\nThey extent the gameplay time significantly. Only the Campaign Mode took me 5 hours to complete it.\n\n-When you start playing the Campaign mode of the game and you are ready to select a character......READ THE BIOS OF ALL THE CHARACTERS!!! The Bios are the best part of the game!!!\nI'm joking of course, but please read them.\nThey are the most wtf, weird, unbelievable, hilarious, background stories I ever read!!!! Pure gold!!!\n\n-You start the game with a special perk for your character. I wanted to say all the perks are good, but..........select the Vampire perk right away. Killing millions of zombie/mutants hordes and getting health for each kill is the best way playing this game [for me at least].\n\n-The gameplay is a pure action shooter with some RPG elements on it. You get levels after you killed enough enemies and you can update your character by putting point in different skills.\nAlso you can change the weapons/items you are using depend how useful/powerfull is for you.\n\n-The weapons are indeed the biggest part of the game. Nearly all the weapons you are using in the game are perfect and enjoyable murdering the endless waves of enemies you meet. Also they are so many of them that I finished the Campaign mode without using them all!!!\nEvery single time I found or bought a weapon, I acted like a little kid trying my new awesome toy.\n\n-Many secrets you can find in the game and gladly nearly all of them are actually worth find. Find a secret a get a powerfull armor/weapon is always welcome.\n\n-Big Variety of enemies to fight from a simple zombie rat to giant mutants with rocket launchers!!! My favourite enemy are the wing naked ladies you fight :3\n\n-The story is hilarious, classic ,cliche B-Movie style and ridiculous. Even the dialogs are cliche as f*ck.\n\n-The enjoyment of killing thousands or enemies in a sigle room after a hard day at work......Aaaaaaaaa the feeling is good.\nI suggest you to buy the Minigun and a giant Multi-Rocket Launcher as soon as possible.\n\n-Controlling a Tank and a FlameThrower Robot is a nice break and relax a little for worring about dying.\n\n[Cons]\n\n-The graphics are VERY outdated and look indeed like a 10 years old game, but let face it, they serve their purpose and the gore look good. Personalty not a con for me, but for others it might be.\n\n-Before start playing, go in the Graphics options and turn of three things:\nFilm Effect, Vsync and Bw/Color.\nTwo reasons why:\n1.If the Vsync is on, the game surprisingly lag REALLY bad. I hope this not happen to others, but test it first to be 100% sure.\n2.The Film Effect and Bw/Color make the game look like a black n' white Horror B-movie. However this didn't worked for me....\nI prefer to see the things as it is in this case.\n\n-Problem with the screen resolution. I tried many times to fix it for a 16:9 monitor, but again the screen doesn't fit.\n\n-The unpleasant feeling when you try to move around to small places and get stuck from small objects.\n\n-At some point you will drive a car with a giant gun on top of it. Sound great but sadly the driving is terrible...\n\n-It is a Zombie game. Yes, in our days the Zombie Theme is a negative and I will admit, I am sick of it as well a little myself.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nIf you want to have a relaxing day by killing a massive hord of zombies with a giant variety of weapons, this game is for you.\nHowever I suggest you to seek for guidance on Forums if you have technicals problems with the game.\nAlso if you are sick of Zombies, then this game isn't for you.\n\n8/10","March 22, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not really, the music is the same, the graphics (and environments) are the same, the characters you can play are the same- same for the gameplay. The three survival missions are the same as in the other games, too.\nOnly difference- you shoot zombies instead of aliens.\n\nSo why do I like this one more than Alien Shooter 2? I like the layout of the screen, start screen and the menu more- they are more sombre and better fitting the the theme of the apocalypse.  I also like the "storyline" more- although you won't get any Shakespearian plots here.  The campaign and missions are different from Alien Shooter 2,so you are playing through different levels- although the environments are basically the same as in Alien Shooter 2.\nOh, and this time round you have also the option to play the game in black and white- with only the blood as red (or green). Quite atmospheric.\n\nShould you buy this?\nIf you liked Alien Shooter 2 and like more of the same, I can recommend this, I had quite some fun with this one.","January 23, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/33180/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","This sequel manages to be worse in every game play aspect. The graphics, models, sounds, and music appear to be the same, so you should expect a very cheap presentation and overall quality. This is very low budget even on a 1990s standard. The voice acting is absolutely terrible, which made me actually laugh a few times in the beginning, and the game gives you the chance to cringe because of it quite often. The AI has not been improved over the first game, and this is made obvious from the very first zombie you face. They have a tendency of spinning in place and being stuck, with conjunction of terrible path finding abilities. The developers decided to make the display grainy and purposely of lower quality than it would already naturally be, as well as using a very small amount of color throughout the game. There are spelling errors throughout the bleak mission briefings, as well as many bugs and glitches that manifest themselves as menu issues and clicking problems. The game play mechanics have stayed about the same as the original, where you simply move and shoot at any zombies coming your way, but also with the addition of operating a turret from a moving car that you have no control over. Zombie Shooter 2 looks and feels like an extremely low-end development, with all of its facets being obviously rushed, poorly designed, badly implemented, and generally deprived of creativity and any true enjoyment. The original Zombie Shooter provided the player with mindless and lackluster game play, but at the very least it had its few game play merits of running and gunning with the occasional smile or smirk. The sequel fails in the continuation of the series, and carries on lousily while adding many other problems that did not exist in the original. The character's movement is sluggish and sometimes not very responsive to control. It feels like Zombie Shooter 2 was a junior college computer programming project that was barely finished. It lacks polish, imagination, and game development technical skills. The folks at Sigma Team have showcased how limited they truly are. The game's description boasts RPG elements that do not actually exist in any way, shape, or form. There is simply nothing there to make any such absurd claim. You are able to make weapon and ammunition purchases, as well as some other items that may aid you through each of the levels, but there are no RPG mechanics or elements whatsoever. This claim is basically not true. Upgrading health, speed, and accuracy do not equate role playing mechanics. The difficulty levels are not programmed properly, in addition to some of the stronger zombies being extremely overpowered and with an unreasonably large amount of life. Sadly, there is just too much wrong with Zombie Shooter 2. It is almost entirely crippled, unbalanced, and limited in every describable way. The music is also rather poor and of low production value, but thankfully, you are allowed to turn down its volume or to mute it completely. The loading times are atrocious for such a low quality game run from a modern computer. The vehicle levels where you are able to control direction while shooting can be slightly satisfying, yet short lived. The save system is nothing short of idiotic. It does not use checkpoints, and it does not allow you to save mid level, or any time you so desire. What it does instead, is that it saves it for you at the end of each level only. This means that if you die during a level, or near the end of a level, you will be forced to do it all over again from the beginning; meaning that you may waste another 30 minutes or longer attempting to beat certain levels again and again. The unbalanced and overpowered enemies makes this bad design decision much worse. If you have enough patience for an extremely poor, low budget title, there is some small amounts of fun to be had with Zombie Shooter 2. There is really not much to enjoy in it.\n\nZombie Shooter 2 is bad.","March 20, 2014","false","3.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

In some ways the departure from the series is good, but mostly it’s bad and ruins what makes the original fun. Zombie Shooter 2 has way more structure than the original as there is actually some degree of freedom and choice with weapon selections now. You can buy guns and sell those you found or guns that you no longer have any use for. Sadly that’s all the positives. The gun control and accuracy is the most important aspect of top down shoot-em-ups, Zombie Shooter 2 flops hard on this aspect with it’s floaty ♥♥♥ controls and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t terrain hitboxes. The graphics while acceptable were overdone with shadows, film grains, and other post processing to hide imperfections, low detail and cloned foliage, as well as bad textures. This in turn causes horrible performance issues in some action packed scenarios.

I say that because I'm not either. the difference between an excuseplot of the original to the sequel's full-on b-movie feel isn't very enjoyable because the game's artstyle and music do not coincide with the scenario. this would only be a minor complaint if the game delivered on its gameplay but sadly it does not\n\non the positive side, stats and perks actually matter. on the negative side, because now they do matter, it is possible to have a character that really isn't equipped to face the final levels (I recommend cash perk if you're going to play). cash is MUCH more important so save for the bigger weapons and only the big weapons. you see, instead of having fps weapon bar with everything at your disposal, you have only 3 weapon slots: small, medium, and large. this more or less means you use a pistol, machine gun, and rocket launcher... the whole game. being that the enemies are generally idiots the lack of interesting guns until very far in contrasts with the pacing of the original. the insistance on rpg elements makes the early half of the game a sort of a grind and, really, I just wanted to shoot zombies, not deal with half-arsed progression\n\nso there is equipment now, but it is just armor that functions like old fps (and the previous game) and implants that raise your stats. changing implants for your situation can supply depth, but it is marginal. sometimes I wanted more hp, sometimes I wanted to move faster. the OPTIONS! anyway it's stupid expensive to repair armor so you're further punished for just playing the game. if you take damage in a level run through then you're digging yourself into a hole unless you're wearing cheap or no armor - and then why is there even armor? ammo for powerful weapons is also expensive, so yeah. have fun with your pea shooters\n\nthe game is an exercise in poor resource management. the enemies and environments are varied enough to warrant a good time, but instead of being a jump-in action game, it's some kind of frustrating survival shooter. hordes of zombies with rediculous amounts of life aren't really how survival games operate. the inventory system, story, and rpg progression are a step back from the original, basically. I must praise the game's so-called film filter though, it gives the game a unique feel that was somewhat lacking from the original. I'd turn off the black&white option though - what's so fun about black blood. the soundtrack is on par with what sigma puts out, so play your own music gents.\n\nor don't play this game, it's not worth the aggravation. did I mention there are points in the game where you can get stuck in the environment? totally stuck, movement will get you walking into the walls. it's possible to leave the way you came out, but it may take minutes to figure out the precise angle, and many people find that they need to restart the levels. if you, for some godawful reason, really need more zombie shooter, try alien shooter. if you have to play this game, give easy mode a shot. I did not play on easy mode but I wish I did. the modal difficulty does not excuse the game's flaws\n\nto quote the game's villian, "farewell... and let the progeny... understand me..."","September 4, 2013","false","22.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

They're simple and fun, lots of reward for exploring, and tons of guns to unlock/buy as you play. Eventually you get stuff like minigun rocket lauchers and ion cannons, which sounds utter excessive, but the great thing is you actually need bonkers weapons like that at the end of the game. Another bonus is you can beat the game in a single sitting (4-5 hours) so they're great for a rainy Saturday.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucasyari/recommended/33180/","lucasyari","Yaridovich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucasyari/","2235 products in account","7/10\n\nJust like Alien Shooter & Zombie Shooter, Zombie Shooter 2 is very similar to both Alien Shooter 2 games. Same graphics, same gameplay - run and shoot all enemies in sight. Even the same characters as Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded. But also just like Alien Shooter & Zombie Shooter, that works perfectly well since both Alien Shooter 2 games are very good.\n\nWith that being said, the one problem I think the game has is that it's WAY too similar to the Alien Shooter 2 games. There are only three things I can say are actually different. The first, of course, is that you're shooting zombies instead of aliens.\nThe second is that the leveling system is different and attributes seem to work a little better than they did in the Alien Shooter 2 games.\nAnd the third is that the game is somewhat more challenging.\n\nAnd just as with all the other Alien/Zombie Shooter games... The camera is an issue as it blocks the player from seeing items and enemies behind certain walls - it''s something that needs to be fixed if there are any more Alien/Zombie Shooter games to be made.","February 19, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you get over some of the technical issues (game is not exactly smooth when Vsync is turned on, and when it is turned off the camera is acting up; occasional stucking in the objects) it is incredibly fun game! Shoot up everything, have fun listening to hilarious voiceovers and level up your character until it becomes unstoppable killing machine (which happened really close to the end, so I would even say it is balanced).","March 4, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
