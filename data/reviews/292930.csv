The story manages to tweak your emotions throughout, whether desperation to escape, trauma of some event, intrigue of some mystery, or just pure horror.\n\nSome of the puzzles were too hard for me, I admit going to the walkthrough several times.\nIt is important to check william's diary (there is a right arrow to progress through it) for tips on puzzles to minimize having to do this. Yet there were plenty of difficult point and click type puzzles that I was able to do and were very enjoyable.\n\nThere is a bug where sound occasionally screeches at you, and rarely crashes.\n(I had 3 crashes total, not bad for such a long and fantastic game)\nDistracting, but not a game killer.\n\nIt is quite a long game, and very challenging. I was very glad I played, I won't forget it soon.\nI wonder if Black circle II is any good?\n\nNon-spoiler tips:\n\nRight clicking can produce different results than left clicking!\nAs best I can tell, right click is a kind of "super search".\nLeft clicking might tell you that something isn't interesting, but right click might find something big!\n\nSometimes you cannot progress in the story until you exhaust all conversation options.\n\nObjects which were not highlighted before, may become highlighted when they become useful as new information is learned!   So you may need to scan areas you were sure had nothing interesting before.\n\nSometimes a character will tell you to "wait" while they figure out something. This is a frustrating game mechanic where you might have to zip all around the place before coming back to check if they are ready.\n\nThere is one point where it is possible to save your game where a decision you just made has already caused your doom. That means if you only have one save game, you just ruined your game and will have to start from the beginning! I feel I must micro spoil this one, it is an event where you fire a gun to escape. I recommend keeping at least two saves.\n\nOverall, black mirror 1 and 2 were among the best and most memorable adventure games I have ever played.\nHighly recommended.  I had some problems with the latter half of BM 3.","October 31, 2014","true","39.5"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","40","42","0","1"

(the game is now updated and works properly!)\n\nFrom the start Black Mirror offers us a mystery that we want to solve! Most of it looks realistic and authentic. Only the animations of the characters could have been done better.\n\nMost of the puzzles are logical and certainly won't be a problem for the experienced adventure gamer, but some require "external information" as there is no specific hints for them.\n\nSometimes you have to do certain things, in order to advance, without any connection to the event itself. This means that you have to explore other places and talk to other people until you trigger an event, and sometimes you can feel a bit "lost".\n\nThe climax is good, but kinda previsible. The finale is quite unsatisfying, in contrast to the great mystery that was introduced to us. There is also some gaps in the story.\n\nThis game does succeed in presenting an ambiance similar to classic horror stories. The atmosphere of this game is thrilling and chilling! Black Mirror has its flaws, but it is a very solid game!\n\n\nAnálise em português:\n\nAltamente recomendado! (o jogo agora está atualizado e funcionando corretamente!)\n\nDesde o começo, Black Mirror nos oferece um mistério intrigante, que nos empolga a resolvê-lo! A maior parte dele é realista e autêntica. Só as animações dos personagens poderiam ter sido melhores.\n\nA maioria dos puzzles são lógicos e certamente não serão um problema para o jogador experiente em adventures, mas alguns deles necessitam de "informação externa", já que não existe pistas específicas para eles.\n\nÁs vezes você tem que fazer certas coisas para progredir no jogo mas sem qualquer conexão com o evento em si. Isso significa que você terá que explorar outros lugares e falar com outras pessoas até que o evento seja acionado, e às vezes você pode se sentir um pouco "perdido" por causa disso.\n\nO clímax é bom, mas meio previsível. O final é bastante insatisfatório, se comparado com o grande mistério que nos foi apresentado no começo. Há também algumas brechas na história.\n\nO game tem êxito em apresentar um ambiente semelhante ao das histórias de terror clássicas. A atmosfera deste jogo é sinistra e arrepiante! Black Mirror tem suas falhas, mas é um jogo muito sólido!","November 6, 2014","true","19.5"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdsfuckharder/recommended/292930/","nerdsfuckharder","Luckie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdsfuckharder/","51 products in account","I vaguely remembered playing this game as a kid when it came out, it was extremely popular in Germany for some reason, so my granddad would bring me back all the good new PC games when he'd travel. I remembered playing much of this game alone and with my mom but I guess I got bored of it, or maybe got stuck on a level. I was so glad I found it again!\n\nThis game is honestly very underrated. It's old, it has horrible cinematic graphics and the English accents are absolutely awful. True. But the art, the scenery and buildings, the intricate details of everything you could possibly find in one scene, is insanely beautiful. I have never seen a point and click game which had so much artistic effort poured into it. If you dislike the obvious story line, you should definitely appreciate the sheer beauty of the game, which I could not appreciate as a child. The gameplay itself drags on, (with 5 hours of Just. Dialogue.) the story is fairly predictable, the puzzles are frustrating... But all in all, I couldn't stop playing it until I was finished with it.\n\nJust give it a go, honestly, there's much much worse out there.","October 20, 2014","true","3.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

The game is pretty long, though some of the hours I've spent with the game were due to having to replay some portions of it. The game has some quirks that will sometimes frustrate you, so I've written a short guide that should help you avoid some of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/292930/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Not every classic game ages well, and old adventure games tend to have shorter shelf lives than most. You still hear plenty about the standouts, your Monkey Islands and your King's Quests, the ones that were either designed well or were entertaining enough to overlook their design flaws. The others fell into obscurity as the genre grew quiet for a time, and that's where you'll find Black Mirror. Whether you want to revisit this dark gem depends on how much patience you have for some very old-fashioned designs.\n\nBlack Mirror places you in the role of Samuel Gordon, estranged son of British aristocracy. A tragedy has occurred at the ancestral castle of Black Mirror, and Samuel does the prodigal son thing to prove his hunch that foul play is afoot. The game is presented with pre-rendered backgrounds and basic 3D character models that hearken back to the PlayStation 1 era, leaving you shuffling stiffly around and spending a good twenty seconds pulling a photograph from your jacket. I don't know if it's a modern system issue or not, but some of the animations in the game are absolutely laborious, particularly during dialog. Still, the game retains a retro charm that will take you back to games like Baldur's Gate or Sanitarium in terms of appearance.\n\nThe charm extends to the voice acting in a big way, and I have to stress that you need a high tolerance for cheese if you want to make it through this thing. Frankly, I'm not convinced a single British person lent their voice to this game about British people. What you get is a bunch of unconvincing doofs doing silly accents and EMOTING the strangest PARTS of THEIR sentences. If it doesn't drive you crazy, you might find it as loveable as I did... the further in I got, the less dialog I would skip (but yes, you can click straight through dialog).\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, you better have a walkthrough handy. Black Mirror never descends to cat moustache levels, but it has a needlessly complex interaction system that is sure to trip you up. As near as I can tell (no tutorial, of course), left-click is observe/interact, and right-click is... different interact. Every time you left-click on an object, you get a different response. Sometimes you only have to click once. Sometimes twice. Sometimes you have to left-click and then right-click. Sometimes you have to left-click three times and then right-click a different thing. There's so little consistency in interacting with the world, you're guaranteed to encounter at least one situation where you know exactly what to do, just not the sequence of clicks to accomplish it.\n\nThere's pixel-hunting, forced waiting, unexpected deaths, and even ways to doom yourself (though the consequence comes minutes, not hours, later) too. Pretty much any sin an adventure game can commit can be found here, but I must admit none are particularly damning in Black Mirror. The scenes tend to be clear and easy to navigate, without too many NPCs, which makes it easy to run through all your options when you get stumped. A map in the first few chapters provides some very welcome fast travel, and in a bit of genius design, double-clicking on the transition to another scene moves you instantly. Honestly, there were enough quality-of-life features to keep me from getting really frustrated at any of the flaws.\n\nIt's a long game, at least 15 hours all told, and while the story is a slow burn, it digs deep into its own mysteries. There's not enough energy or action to keep you engaged for long periods, but I found it a good substitute for hidden object or casual games as my go-to chillout activity. If you can look past the artifacts of its age and its admittedly rough design edges, you'll get a charming, meaty adventure to keep you occupied for hours on end.","October 26, 2015","true","12.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

It kept me engaged the whole way through, and by chapter five I was just completely immersed it's so well done. The story was engaging and well written, and the puzzles were just the right amount of a challenge.

I went with thumbs up, but with a few caveats.\n\nThe reccomendation is for those who already like the point and click mystery genre. If you are unsure of these type games, or haven't played any before, don't start here. Try Broken Sword or Syberia first.\n\nBe prepared to wait. A lot.  Some of the puzzles require you to wait for a character to do something for you. I still can't work out whether it is based on actual time passed, or how long you spend moving around screens clicking on things you have already clicked on, but at times this mechanic is infuriating. (The last chapter I played had the worst example of this so far... I had already clicked on everything else in the level and had to re do that whilst waiting for some dude to do some damn research! I revisited him 8 times before he finally had finished!)\n\nSome of the quests have you bounce back and forth between a couple/few locations. This can be tedious as animations in this game are so damn slow. In fact, the animations of others when you talk to them, and the weird pause where you say a line and they have to finish what they are doing first, is borderline hilarious at times. Coupled with the strange, awkward dialogue (the main character is sometimes an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to people, and you can't be sure if he is meant to be or the actor just read the line in the wrong context) this can break the flow of what you were doing.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty easy... bar 1 I have come across so far (Which actually required me to look up due to needing real world knowledge not offered in the game.) They are entertaining enough though. BE WARNED some areas you can die... SAVE OFTEN! (And a tip... save to different files. Especially when you get to  the top of the mine, before you try and exit. You can accidentally save at a point where the only option is to die and reload and you cannot progress.)\n\nSo what did I like about it? Well... it looks great and has a good amount of detail in the locales. The atmosphere on a whole is fantastic, and although the story has flaws (so far, even though I haven't finished) it is definitely pulling me back just to see what will happen!","June 10, 2015","true","2.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

The puzzles were decent and the characters were interesting.  The story actually had depth which kept me playing to see what twist I would encounter next.  Had some trouble with crashing when i first played... then came back to it a couple of weeks later and absolutely not one crash...*head scratch*. So just make sure to save frequently as there are certain parts where you can actually die!  A really nice feature in this point and click is the map which not a lot of point and click games give the players.  That and also Samuel wont leave an area if everything he needs for a puzzle is in that particular area which saved me often from searching for a piece of a puzzle in the wrong place.\n\nSo now what I didnt like...\nthere are some parts where you have to wait on characters to do something for you.  When I say wait... I really mean wait.  There is no other task to do.  You simply have to keep checking to see if they are done.  Sometimes when you click on an object, Samuel will say it isnt interesting... however right click and all of a sudden he finds something interesting about it!  I do suggest if you left click and the object stays red... try to right click.  Also sometimes I would be stuck on some task to realize that once you need something it can magically  be clicked when it couldnt be clicked before.  Sometimes this led to meticulously scanning areas over and over when stuck.  Some of the puzzles were really hard.  I really dont like to... but at times I had to refer to a walkthrough because I didnt understand what I was supposed to do.\n\nOverall though, I do recommend and cant wait to play the next 2 installments!","November 24, 2014","true","30.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The environment and the graphic display is amazing considering its release date and the only thing less detailed are the characters themselves and the cutscenes. But that’s no big deal.\nThe story is thrilling from the very first moment. It includes some puzzles (not too many), which were fun to solve. The gameplay is enjoyable. Horror moments and mysteries create creepy effects and you are even able to die by making wrong choices.

There are bugs in the game, the biggest is where the game will crash after certain dialouge bits where a screeching sound will play and the game will then crash to desktop. This can be game breaking as some of these dialouge bits are required to advance to the story. To get around this I found that clicking throught hte dialouge as fast as possible would usually bypass the crashing.

The gameplay is very similar to another PC game called Sanitarium, not as great but still has a very intriguing story and very foreboding atmosphere to it. I don’t really want to get into details about the story because the story is the main attraction to these style of games. I do recommend it if you are enthusiastic about point and click adventures, not an amazing game but still holds up very well in the point and click genre. The con’s are the animation in the game is F#%#!% horrible looks kind of like the early Alone In The Dark games. The Voice acting isn't really bad but you can tell when there just reading from the script instead trying to emotionalize it. The pro’s are the visual I know it’s old game but I enjoy the visual style they use, it feels very gothic with a creepy soundtrack you don’t really hear that much only in some certain situations but still not bad overall. At last I really enjoy the story so far, it might seem a bit cliche but sometimes cliche doesn't always make it bad so give it go if you want to or check out Sanitarium which is a really great game.","September 16, 2015","true","27.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Just love it!\n\nPoint-and-click adventure game with bit of horror and detective elements, nice music which complete the atmosphere and great illustrations.\nI would say relaxing game in the sence that you are just exploring, and interacting with people and objects. Sometimes it takes time to explore and wait till all is updated (some of the elements are active once you do st, but you need to w8 and also go to other corners of the castle and surroundings) and your character needs to walk through rooms till all is ready to continue.\nStill I am finding this game very timeless and I could recommend.","February 8","true","23.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

In a nutshell you go gravedigging for five sacred keys to reveal the Truth. This game was overall great experience. Definitely good price/playtime-ratio especially if get this in the bundle. Hardcore point&click without being too hardcore. Some notes before anyone should start playing to save some gray hair (no spoilers for spoiler crybabies, just made up examples of situations).\n\n1. You can actually die. This was not made clear. I usually go around clicking everything and when there's, say, grizzly bear on the way Samuel might say "Oh gee that's dangerous, can't go there". But SOMETIMES you go and click, say, landmine and instantly go boom. Great. When in doubt, remember to save the game.\n\n2. The user interface is 99% of the time clicking left-button for both action and inspecting. But SOMETIMES you have to use right-click to find stuff. This is very inconsistent because most of the time right-click does nothing. At least iIn the inventory left is for use and right for inspecting.\n\n3. This is not the kind of game you go picking up everything that's not bolted to the floor. You might see hotspot on, say, crowbar and Samuel says "I ain't gonna need that". Later on there's, say, loose nail you need and then Samuel goes "I wish I had a crowbar or something". So sometimes you need a valid reason to activate some items.\n\nLast thing i have to share was this ridiculous case when Samuel needed some stuff and Mr. M says "Yeah I got that stuff in my garage". Then you go to garage (decently much clicking to get there) and see it's locked. Then back to Mr. M (more clicking) who goes like "Oh gee REALLY? I forgot it was locked. Here's the key." You sonava♥♥♥♥♥ why not give me the key the first time...? Luckily, you have a map to fast travel to certain places.\n\nThe praise:\n-interesting mystery story\n-graphics are fine and there's countless little details everywhere\n-long game, took me 16h to complete but felt like The longest journey long\n-much content and many different locations\n-decent dialog\n-great puzzles\n\nThe nag:\n-few artificial problems that were clearly made to prolong the playtime\n-inconsistent point and clicking interface\n-eternally slow npc animations (Samuel animates at normal speed)\n-can't run\n-sometimes no idea what to do or where to go\n-sudden deaths","January 24","true","16.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

And the $9.99 asking price for a game that's 12+ years old is a little ambitious, but I feel it is well worth the price.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty straight-forward point-and-click adventure.  You're the prodigal relative who has returned to the manor after many years of self-imposed ostracism.  William (your uncle or brother or dad, something like that) has died under mysterious circumstances and you take it upon yourslef to find out what has happened.\n\nIt's kind of a modern analog for "The Witness" or "Deadline" or "Suspect", except that it's a touch more linear.  If you remember those games then you like a good mystery.  There are some interesting puzzlers here, nothing too tough.  But truly the plot here is interesting and compelling.  You interact with a lot of characters and you have an opportunity to ask them a ton of questions.  And the characters are written as though they are real people -- that is, they don't see their function in the game as forwarding the plot.  They have personalities, they lie, they have their own interests that they pursue.  They don't just sit there and give you information.\n\nPart thriller, part horror, part mystery, this game makes the hours go quickly.  I haven't even finished it yet at 6.3 hours.\n\nAs I wrote before, there are some tedious moments that haunt all point-and-click adventures.  You really have to be careful whisking the mouse around the screen or you'll miss something.  And sometimes you'll like at something fifty times by left clicking on it and then, for snicks, right click and there comes the solution.\n\nTruly, $9.99 was asking a lot for this game.  I got it at a heavily discounted price.  But overall I wouldn't be disappointed if I had paid full price for it.  I can't say the same for its sequels.  But spend some time with this little gem.  Well worth it and you will feel satisfied.\n\nA shame all modern games can't pay more attention to this story and plot that this game has and spend less time on the flash and dazzle of graphics.\n\nHighly recommended!","February 14","true","7.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The problem is, it's a very different game to both sequels, which I believe are better introductions to the overall story, rather than playing chronologically.  They have a different protagonist, and are more consistent with each other than their predecessor.\n\nI would, in all honesty recommend playing Black Mirror II & III BEFORE Black Mirror I, as they are, in my opinion superior games.\n\nI think that if you were to play BM I first and you didn't like it, you would be making a mistake not playing the sequels assuming they are more of the same.  If you were to play II & III first however you would enjoy the first game far more.\n\nI have played these games prior to purchasing on Steam, and have been a fan for many years.  I have played them all through a number of times now, and would hold them equal to the holy grail of point 'n' click games, the Broken Sword trilogy. They are very different in terms of tone but... in fact, I would go so far to say the Black Mirror trilogy has the edge.\n\nPROS\n\n+ The environments are beautifully drawn.  Some of the best I have ever seen.\n+ The music is wonderfully atmospheric; superior even to my former personal favourite score, from the Broken Sword games.\n+ The story is intriguing, gory and sinister.\n+ It is not an easy game, and challenges you.\n+ The world and setting feel authentic\n+ The in game ambient sounds are excellent\n+ It is a big game, which will take you a long time to get through.\n\nCONS\n\n- Fairly heavy on the dialogue.\n- Character animations can be slow\n- Some puzzles are difficult, and I needed to refer to a guide more than once.\n- The accents are - on occasion - erm... interesting.\n- Higher resolutions are not supported.  I run my PC via a 50" Sony and had to enable image scaling to fill the screen.\n\nI cannot recommend the Black Mirror games highly enough if you want something with a really professional, well crafted feel to it.  Something about the atmosphere and feel of the game is very unique; reviews are mixed, but take it from someone who loves this type of game, it's one of the best.  I would start with the sequels, but this is a good introduction to the story and both Black Mirror Castle and Willow Creek are well worth your time.","June 14, 2015","true","15.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The rest is awesome.\n\nLong before I started playing Black Mirror, I already had played Black Mirror II and I absolutely loved it. I couldn't wait until BMIII came out. That game too satisfied my needs. When I saw that the trilogy was finally coming to steam, I insta-bought the first game too.\n\nAlthough I have only played for 15 minutes or so, I already felt like the game wasn't as good as the rest of the trilogy.\nI first of all had difficulties getting it to start up and when I was finally playing the low quality really bothered me. And I'm not just talking about graphics; Whenever I start a conversation I takes the npc waaay too long to respond, because it first has to complete their (really laggy) animation. I also didn't like the characters to all be so uptight. Of course, that's because the setting is in a old victorian castle and all the characters are rich. Nothing to do about that, but it's just not the same to play as Samuel as it is the play Darren(main character of BMII & III).\n\nI can safely say that the studio really did improve the game quite a bit with BMII and III. Of course, going backwards to the first game, I couldn't expect much, but I did. And that's why I'm a bit disappointed; because I wanted more of the same. The game's probably pretty good qua story. I just don't seem to have the patience. I'm ready to move on.\n","February 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game designers should have included an option to sleep for a while in order to pass that time - especially because you have your own room with a bed in it in the castle.\nOther than that, it is a must-have for fans of  p'n'c adventures and horror/mystery.","January 31","true","20.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

There are very few mini games, but all that are there were really fun.\n\nAs always, I must comment on my own personal pet peeve, slow walking protagonists, but in this game it's not just the protagonist that's slow. Every time you click on someone to talk to, there will be an approximately 5 second, animated delay while they stop what they're doing and turn to you. It can get a bit grating but clearly, this is no manic game and is designed for a relaxed game play experience. One small upside is that while Samuel doesn't run and definitely doesn't jump, ha, if you can click on a scene exit, the game will jump to the next screen (though again, after a few second delay).\n\nI also have to warn you about the absolutely most annoying thing in the game, there are two or three scenarios where you have to wait for another character to get back to you about something before you can continue along with the story line. They say things like "Come back later" and well, they really do mean later. There's nothing you can do to speed this along. You can go to every location possible, look and talk to everything or everyone you've already clicked on, or just sit and wait.\nClearly, this does make sense from a story perspective, but having gameplay where the character does nothing but just has to move around or wait is absolutely ridiculous and should never ever be included.\n\nNow regardless of my above complaints, I still really liked this game and I can't wait to continue in the sequel.","March 9","true","15.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Very smooth and good looking pre-rendered backgrounds fill every frame of this game. It's a very beautifully imagined game and the environments truly look detailed.\n\n+ Very intruiging story. It starts out slow but really picks up from chapter 2 and makes you come back for more to see what will happen next. As I will mention later, despite lots of plotholes and bad dialogue, the interesting story is what resulted in me not giving this game a marginal thumbs down.\n\n+ Great sound effects which are creepy when they need to be and that's almost always in this mystery/horror game.\n\n+ Puzzles are usually very logical. There's a challenging slider puzzle and a few more but most of the game is about using objects in your inventory rather than puzzle-box situations.\n\nAnd now the negatives that almost made me lose it every time I played the game:\n\n- HORRIBLE main character that acts like a selfish, blue-blooded lord while borderline insulting NPCs who are even helping him with his quest. Sometimes I just wanted to smash in Samuel's head in to prematurely end his own and other's misery.\n\n- RIDICULOUSLY bad voice acting. Once again, the main character takes the cake for being the worst of the bunch. I can't imagine even if a person TRIED to voice as bland and uninterested as the voice actors in this game they couldn't do it this bad. It's a chore to listen to most of the game's dialogues because you feel like they're not interested in the mystery so why should I be?\n\n- Technical issues with the game's FPS. it would drop drastically whenever I was in an outside scene when it was raining. Everything would slow down to a crawl and a simple 5 second task would take 30 seconds to act out. Although I found a temporary solution to it. You can Alt+Tab out of the game and go back to it and everything would speed up but only for 4-5 seconds and it would slow down again. I had no problem with the indoor scenes.\n\n- Character animations and graphics look very bad. It didn't really bother me though I play lots of adventure games and there are but a few 3d ones that have very good character animations.\n\n- There is some pixel hunting to be done. The environments are really detailed so it's easy to miss an important item. But the main problem comes from the fact that you can only pick up objects that Samuel recognizes as useful for the task currently at hand. So there are several instances when you can't pick something up at some point only to come back to it later and pick it up when it needs to be used in an almost immediate environment puzzle solution.\n\n- The last point leads to LOTS of backtracking and not ever being entirely sure that you currently have everything you need to do something and you have to go back to places you've been to try and pick up stuff you left behind because Samuel thought they weren't necessary at first.\n\n- Most of the investigation and interactions are done with the left mouse button but somehow, with SOME items, the only way to investigate further is right clicking on the item/area. This is very confusing and sometimes leads to dead ends where you think you've looked at everything but what you need to do is right click on everything to double check.\n\n- The story has major plot holes and doesn't entirely explain what happened on in the end but it remained interesting enough for me to finish it so maybe it won't disappoint you either.\n\n- It doesn't run in full screen you'll have a black border around your game all the time. I use a widescreen monitor so maybe that was the problem.\n\n- The cinematics look really dated.\n\nTo be honest, Black Mirror is one of the most mediocre adventure games I've played in a long time. I've heard good things about the sequels and I'll give them a try too but I wanted to start from the series beginning to become more immersed in the mythos. And I think if you want to play the whole series then definitely play this game as well but if you want to buy just a single game from the series, you're better off choosing one of the other two.\n\nA Marginal thumbs up.","April 9, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But overall I cannot recommend it.  The point and click adventure part of the game, which should be the meat and bones here, is too flawed.  I've only played partway through chapter 3, and I've had to consult a walkthrough too many times to figure out what to do next.  There are no objectives explicitly given so often I'm left loading up area after area talking to everyone hoping to advance the game.  When that doesn't work I'm left to pixel hunting scene after scene again and again wondering if I've missed something.  Most of the game so far has wandering around wondering how I'm to accomplish what at least I can figure out what I'm supposed to do.\n\nAnd usually I have problems because it's so easy to miss something.  Once it was a right click.  Right click is used sporadically in this game; sometimes it does something, but most often it does nothing.  One missed right click on an inventory object or hotspot will get you stuck.  Several times it's been one tiny hotspot overshadowed by another much larger hotspot right next to it.  If you buy this game, don't assume all hotspots are separated from each other.  If/When you get stuck look for slivers of a 2nd hotspot along side ones you've already found.  There's also some degree of misdirection in the game.  I was told to leave the main house once to procure an object.  However the game wouldn't let me leave.  After talking to everyone and not getting anywhere I had to resort to a walkthrough only to discover I wasn't supposed to leave at all, but I was supposed to procure a substitute object another way.  That's kind of cheaty IMO.  If the main character I'm playing wants to do that then the game should inform me that's the objective.  There was another event where I died repeatedly; I couldn't figure out how to survive with the objects in the character's inventory.  Again, back to a walthrough to discover that prior events had to be completed in a very precise way in order to survive the dangerous encounter.  I guess I should revise my earlier statement:  one missed right click on a hotspot can get you killed later, so save often.  (Disclaimer:  I don't find point and click mechanics like this much fun.)\n\nThe graphics are fine for a game over a decade old.  The character models were rather pixelated, but forcing Nvidia antiailasing fixed that.  Characters move slowly, and there's a lot of waiting to converse with NPCs, to load up the next scene, to enter and leave animations, etc.  The Black Mirror is a slow paced game, which was unexpected but not a problem after I got used to it.  The voice acting is awkward, but I thought it was entertaining at least.  The story seems fairly good so far.  Then environments do an excellent job of evoking the right atmosphere for the game.  Family relationships are not well spelled out.  You play Samual Gordon and run into various other Gordons without really knowing how you know them, who your parents are, or how these other Gordons are related to you.  I got some of that online (don't use wikipedia, there's a major spoiler there) just so I better understand the situation.\n\nHowever, it's the point and click mechanics that bring the game down for me.  I find them more exasperating than challenging, more tedious than fun.  And occasionally the point and click puzzle solutions are nonsensical in ways I thought were only common in hidden object games.  I will push through to the end of the game, just to see it through.  If the point and click mechanics get better in the 2nd half of the game I'll update my review.  Otherwise, I think The Black Mirror is only for point and click adventure die-hards, those who don't mind pixel hunting, or those who don't think twice about looking up a walkthrough when you get tried of being stuck for so long.\n\nedit:  I finished the game, took me a little over 19 hrs.  That would have been considerably longer had I not consulted a walk through so much.  I didn't care for the pixel hunting aspects which continued to plague the 2nd half of the game.  Several puzzle solutions were totally illogical IMO.  I should have stopped trying to figure out answers and just systematically tried every inventory object on every hotspot.  But that's no fun and you never really know whether you've found every hotspot.\n\nPlus, the game has a certain mechanic where you have to wait for other characters to do something for you before you can continue.  There's nothing else to do except leave the screen, reenter, and try talking to them again and again.  I couldn't tell if waiting was time based or just based on the number of attempts to talk to the character (as a guide suggests).  I didn't think this particular game mechanic worked well.  It was more annoying than anything else and really slowed down the story.\n\nAnyways, the 2nd half of the game was much like the first half except there were more puzzles and less conversation required to advance the story.  The ending was unsatisfying.  It didn't really convey what the protagonist accomplished, although if you think about it you can sort of assume what the critical cut scene was supposed to explain.  With a few exceptions I pretty much knew what I was supposed to trying to solve, unlike the first half of the game where I was clueless of what to do a lot more often.  I also didn't think the ending adequately explained the central crux of the plot.\n\nConclusion:  I liked the story for the most part and the atmosphere and environments were very well done.  But that was slightly overcome by too much pixel hunting and illogical puzzles.  Overall, I'm pretty "meh" on this game, just over the "not recommended" threshold unless you are a big fan of point and click adventure games.","May 20","false","19.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Good plot, though the final twist is somewhat obvious. Gameplay, point & click, is generally good but is marred by a couple of exceptionally long waits for characters who are doing something for you. Puzzles are all logical and none of the finds too difficult as long as you remember to try a right click if the pointer remains red but dialogue does not progress. Really the only downside is the voice acting that sounds like a Toast of London as produced by Clem Fandango voiceover (if you know the reference you will not be able to get that image out of your head)\n\n68/100","February 23, 2015","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And one last flaw, or even curse that haunts most of the adventure games - not the best ending at all. But overall gameplay is really good. It is interesting to follow the plot.

And walkthroughs are available if you need to get through a stuck point.\nSome have described this as a horror game.  It can certainly be strange and creepy, and even violent at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/khatoblepas/recommended/292930/","khatoblepas","Khatoblepas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/khatoblepas/","240 products in account","Black Mirror is a game that has a lot of promise. It contains several interesting plot elements that barely germinate, and some interesting puzzles bookended by thousands of very bland ones.\n\nWhile not incompetent, the writing in Black Mirror is little more than functional, imparting no character on the cast and switching awkwardly between useless vaguery and overblown exposition. The character of Samuel Gordon, in particular, is a complete and utter void, so any plot twists involving him are dulled and ineffective as he never establishes who he is beyond "The Protagonist of An Adventure Game". Even the game's main twist does nothing but slightly raise an eyebrow. One wonders whether part of the problem is in the translation from the game's native language to English.\n\nThe graphics are likewise, functional, but like the rest of the game's production, feels soulless and by the numbers, serving only as a backdrop that functions, rather than a world to explore. Every prop, item, and furnishing does nothing but exist, informing us of nothing about the characters, and leaving us dead to any event that might happen.\n\nThe puzzles are mainly variations on fetching some sort of key, unlocking a door, or asking someone to unlock a door. The myst-style puzzles, such as the puzzles presented on plynths, are far more fascinating, presenting the player with an actual challenge and being a compelling and welcome change from use-key-in-door.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of puzzles that aren't these few rare gems, and some of them involve callously attempting murder, in the guise of getting past unwitting bystanders who act as obstacles. The game never discusses these, nor does Samuel ever think twice about poisoning or electrocuting someone. His entire motivation is to advance the plot, thus we are robbed of character development through puzzle design. The nadir of the puzzle design comes when you need to "wait" for someone to get back to you with information. This happens twice in the game, and due to the game's linear nature, by the time you've gotten to that point, there is literally nothing you can do to allievate the boredom. All you can do is wait. Wait and visit every single room in the game multiple times in the hopes of triggering the next part. Patience is not a virtue I would like to experience in a videogame where I am forced to not play the game for long periods of time.\n\nThe voice acting is dull and lifeless, with some characters acting barely above a Text-To-Speech program, reading their lines with the same vitality as Microsoft Sam. Every dull line made me dread yet another long monologue delivered by the characters.\n\nThe highlights of the game come in the Mine sequence, and the mystery surrounding the manor itself. However, the delivery muted my excitement and dragged a potentially interesting story out over five interminably long and tedious sections.\n\nUnless you are a hardcore adventure game player, to whom bad puzzle design is familiar, avoid this game. It offers nothing that other games have not achieved with defter grace and polish. Even to the hardcore adventure crowd, there is little here for you.","November 12, 2014","false","17.1"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","21","45","4","0"

The story and characters are good and the game slowly begins to suck you in as you become more immersed in the world solving the mystery of your family.\n\n+ The locations are varied and despite the games' age the pre rendered backgrounds still look good even at a low resolution\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nUnlike other adventure games you cannot simply pick up any object not nailed down. In this game their needs to be a reason for you to take an object so things need to be completed in a certain order for you to proceed. On the one hand this makes things more realistic...on the other hand it become much easier to miss important information/objects when trying to complete a puzzle.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- "Pixel Hunting" - The term used when you have to roll your mouse cursor over every little object in the game in the hopes you didn't miss something because the vast majority of the time the reason you can't solve a puzzle is because you didn't see the little object you were suppose to pick up in the very back corner of the dimly lit room. Its infuriating and frustrating and this game has a lot of it.\n\n- Certain puzzles are almost impossible to solve without a walkthrough because the game gives very little if any clues in how to complete them.\n\n- You cannot proceed in the game until you 'trigger' certain events, some of these events make no sense with your current task. I.e. You have to complete one puzzle in one section of the game before you can move on in the story in another section of the game even if both events are completely unrelated to one another.\n\n-Near the end of the game you have to wait for a character to give you information before you can trigger the next events in the story. The problem however is the character sometimes refuses to tell you what you need to hear. Looking online, some people only had to wait a few minutes while others had to wait a few hours...... Nobody seems to know what the trigger is to get him to talk. Very poor design.\n\n- Weak ending\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI would love to give this game a positive rating but the more I played the worse the problems started to become to the point where I was more frustrated than having fun. The game does have a lot going for it and if you love the genre you should at least check the game out, just make sure to consult a walkthrough when you get stuck because it may not be your fault that you can't solve any puzzles.\n","October 3, 2015","false","13.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"

But, alas, it's just not a very good game.\n\nFirst off, in order to get the game to work properly in Windows 8, I couldn't run it through the Steam client, but instead had to run in adminstrator mode to make it compatible. Otherwise, the game screen doesn't fit on my display. This is why Steam shows my only playing .1 hours, but I've played for at least 8, having completed through Chapter 3.\n\nWhile the score and environments are pretty and evocative, everything else about the game ranges from average to terrible. It really is a series of back-and-forth fetch quests that will have you constantly retracing your steps, scouring screens for objects to click, clicking multiple times to get the use out of something and having to endure badly-voiced conversations that do little to enhance to game. Many of the puzzle solutions are either ridiculously obvious, rendering them pointless, or insanely obscure, rendering them unfun. Most frustrating are the times where you have to wait for another game character to do something for you, in which case you have to repeatedly exit and return to their environment until they have what you want. I don't understand how any game designer could think that was anything but utterly aggravating for a game player. The game is agonizing linear, which means in many cases you have to figure out the right sequence of clicking objects to trigger conversations with characters who will give you clues that allow you to go back and click on more objects. WEEE!\n\nOh, and there are points where you can die, and if you haven't saved recently (there's no auto-save feature), you will lose a lot of progress. But that's not unforgivable--what IS unforgivable is that it is entirely possible to permanently ruin your game if you save after expending a resource of which you will need one when you exit an area.\n\nIn summary: well-produced, but horribly-designed.","November 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","1"

In fact, I enjoyed it for all it's worth.\n\nHowever there is a major flaw in this game that make me unable to recommend it to anyone I know. The dreaded 'Waiting time'. Many times, the game requires you to wait a certain period of time before it will allow you to continue on with the game. During these waiting time, usually there will be nothing really worthy for you to do, other than waiting. Just Simply. Waiting. There is no indication of when the waiting is over. Although there are mentioning of time in the game, there is actually no way to track time (actually the game has no time-counting mechanism, other than these timed counter driven events).\n\nSo all you can do is walking around mindlessly, having nothig to do at all. To make things worse, you cannot just alt-tab away to do something to pass time - the game will pause when you alt-tab away. So you have to be really enjoying the pure.simple.waiting.\n\nMy nerves finally snapped during the longest wait in the game - waiting for Father Faderick to check records on Lothar Gordon. Some faq says it's about 10 minutes waiting.\n\n10.Effing.Minutes.of.Pure.Nothing.To.Do.Waiting!\n\nSorry, although this is an interesting game, I really can't recommend it to anyone. Not even my enemies.\n\n(note: Steam is not responding when I post my review, so pardon me if this review appeared multiple times)\n\nEdit: Hmm, definitely more than 10 minutes. After posting the review, I just leave the game running and go fixed myself some snacks, ate it, watched my neighbor's dog chasing the kids from across the stree, take a leak, used my phone to make a few posts in some forums... and when I get back to the game, the wait is still not over. Either i't more than 10 minutes wait, or stnading in the church waiting is not counted as time passed. So i have to move from points to points around the game map for no reason for over 10 minutes?","May 5","false","15.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","1","6","2","1"

Most of the time you can just skip over them, but you have to be fast. That is really the last thing I want to take care of while enjoying the very good dialogues. But there's now one line I apparently cannot skip fast enough, so I can't finish the game. Also there are severe slowdowns, if it rains, which are quite annoying.\n\nSo: I love the game, but I want to play it without these shortcomings.

The first impression was so strong that I almost couldn't fight off my urge to punch my screen the moment when I saw how choppy the in-game graphics were.\n\nThe horror game itself, however, lives up to its name. There were several audio errors that replace the voice lines with loud, high-pitched tics that played with no sign at all. Scared the crap out of me. I thought it was programmed the first time it happened but after a few more and a fatal game crush I figured if the game were to use that as one of its horror factors it would sure to acuqire a better twist in its so-called horror atmosphere.\n\nThe protagonist walks way too slow and refues to comment on an object unless he can get real close and press his face on it. Adds to the fraustrating bits of the classical point-and-click games.\n\nI got it from a bundle given by a friend. No harm done. But if you plan to spend $10 on this game be sure to think twice. It offers on more than a good jump-scare with the sudden audio glitch and the sensation of playing a game from the old times.","October 21, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","0"

Samuel is an as*hole..\n\nHere is my review and little bit of advice for future players.\n\nThis game is nice point and click adventure game with almost horror atmosphere. Beautiful backround and music.\nIf you manage to get through weird voice acting (saddly main character), bit of a wooden movement of characters and many times awkward pauses before dialogs (play it.. you will understand) it have interesting story and even puzzles was really good. In my opinion dialogs was really well written (ive seen much worse mainly in point and click adventures)\n\n!BUT!\n\nSometimes it was really anoying getting stuck on stuff like\n"I need to go talk to some random dude just because no real reason."\nand\n"ohh nice i found the object..thats progress.. now i need to go talk to everyone i know till now so i can move on again"\n\nAnd what i was almost furious about was waiting system.\nI didnt figure it out until second time i needed to "wait" in game for something.\nJust.. why?..\nThis dont have any logical purpose because you cant do anything through that time.\n\nADVICE:\n-If someone told you in game that you need to wait for something dont just wait,\nmove between screens and places until you get what you need.\n-SAVE ALOT. Some deaths are just stupid and more funny than "scary"\nI had problem with audio in some parts in game and mainly around cutscenes between chapters.\nI really recommend to save alot in second chapter, sometimes it gave me just black screen when i was moving from scene to scene and i was not able to do anything just Alt+F4 the game and start again where i saved last time.\n\nBut even with some technical issues and annoying parts it was nice experience with a catchy story.\n\nIts 7\10 for me.\n\nOhh yea..\nMain menu is in right top corner.. you are welcome","December 1, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fans of point-n-click adventure games will likely enjoy this game.  The game is 12 years old so the graphics are dated and it suffers from some classic point-click problems from the days of yore (ie. tricky finding hotspots, alot of back and forth between locations etc) but the story is compelling.  I do not like the protagonist Samuel but at least the character is strong enough that the game will coax you into having an opinion about him.  The old school style of this game will keep you on your toes.  This is no modern, adventure game with pun filled dialogue.  It is dark and your character is not safe!  Make sure to save often or you'll find yourself frustrated when you die and have to redo some puzzles.
