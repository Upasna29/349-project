Gameplay mechanics are overall clunky, the graphics are not there, and the progression is one dimensional.\n\nHere is a bit more depth to the review into the only 3 game modes included in the game:\n\n- Manage game mode: This is where you set up and expand your company. This could have been a great system if there was more interaction than just pressing buy on a skill or item until you run out of cash. That is as much dept as this has.\n\n- Control mode: It is basically a top down click the icon game. An assistance call comes in, you grab the nearest available car and click on the call location. Over and over, and over, ad nauseum. Extremely frustrating that there is absolutely no onboarding for any of the mechanics either. All of a sudden the month ends and you find out you did a poor job, just because the tow trucks you are sending out don't change tires... oh I had to sent out just a basic car? doesn't make sense that the guy on the tow truck can't help, doesn't it?\n\n- Missions mode: This one is the one you get pitched more but its as shallow as a dinner plate. New missions are only unlocked after grinding quite a bit on control mode. Given, the portrayal of the NPC's are something I can completely see happening in real life. Unfortunately the controls are clunky, clicking does not always respond to your input. You get random cars ghosting through the player, etc. To make things even more disappointing is that as soon as you do the mission once, you can do it with your eyes closed the next time. They repeat down to the last detail so there is absolutely no challenge.\n\nIn conclusion I would give this game a pass. Wait for a sale or something as its not even worth the launch prize. I did get some entertainment out of it but, honestly, had I known I would have played something else.\n\nGraphics 6/10\nGameplay 3/10\nReplayabilty 1/10\n\n3/10 overall score","September 26, 2014","false","1.4"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","59","67","0","2"

The "missions" where you diagnose the car hands-on are only about every-now-and-then.  It's very deceiving as the screenshots on the store page only show one pic of the map screen, however the game is played 90% of the time on that screen.  I don't recommend basing your purchase on the "missions".  It's a rather tedious icon-clicking-game.   I built a member base to around the mid-20k's, and am already bored of it.  It's somewhat entertaining at first, so with that being said, I honestly don't' think it's worth any more than $4-5.","September 28, 2014","false","4.3"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","0"

The rest of the time you work with a map overview were you just click on the appearing events to which you send your crew to help the people in need.\n\nBefore you buy the game look for some videos like "Let's play" to make sure about what you are buying and if it is what you are looking for (should have done the same, I would not have bought this game).\n\nPS.: English is not my native language so sorry for any grammatical errors, hope the review helps.","September 27, 2014","false","0.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

Well for this game i only paid $12.74 and for that price it has achieved a great deal more than some more costly games have. Its playable, no soul stealing bugs and it would give me entertainment on a rainy day. It probably should be defined as a casual simulator type game as its not realy a full on simulator. My only minor complaint would be that sometimes its hard to get your vehicle to its destination(rare). Thumbs up to the creators.\n\nNote: I have never forgotten a steam review where a reviewer compained about a 99 cent game. You get what you pay for, if you get more than what you pay for its a bonus and why complain.","September 30, 2014","true","5.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mdann52/recommended/302440/","Mdann52","Cookies52","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mdann52/","111 products in account","So I read through the reviews before I bought this game with a bit of trepidation - usually, lots of bad reviews are a bad sign. But, this was £2.50, so I though "why not?" took the plunge and went for it. 90 minutes in, I'm greatful I did.\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it is limited, I'd admit. There are 3 modes, where you manage your fleet and staff's abilities, a mode where you dispatch units to regions that increase in size, and a mission mode, where you need to investigate and fix faults with customers cars (a bit like car mechanic sim).\n\nOverall, while gameplay is limited, this is a good little game, so if it comes up at a bargin price, get it, even if it just lasts a few hours, the relaxation and addictiveness is worth it for the time. I'm around half way through, and not sure of the replay value, but I'm grateful I went for it after all!\n\n","April 24, 2015","true","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game has a GREAT idea behind it. Do they actually use that great idea? No. 99% of your time is a dispatch telling cars to go from point A to point B in order to gain customers. The game its self I don't think has more then 20 missions that you can do. Thats also something the screen shots don't tell you. I was thinking this was going to be like, I get in my car and drive quickly to Aid someone and figure out what the problem is. Store the information in my Computer and start to RTB untill I get dispatched again. But No. You are the dispatcher and when you do get to do a dispatch you teleport there and its stupid things. Like no gas, or things the lights on the dash that every driver on the road should know about. Its games like this that make me want a refund.....","March 24, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
