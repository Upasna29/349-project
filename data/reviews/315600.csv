This is no sim. You'll rarely need brakes, there's no damage affecting performance, wall-riding and AI-shepherding is a thing, etc etc. Think NFS Hot Pursuit 2 as a budget title. Once you're over that, the game is quite fun, with a variety of unique gameplay modes and challenges, and a ton of unlockables to keep you coming back for a while.\n\nBest control option: Gamepad.","September 10, 2014","true","10.5"," 82 of 91 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","82","91","0","4"

Racing games take themselves so seriously, now. So does Ford Racing 3, but you also get to race in a variety of exotic locales that sometimes borderline on being cartoon-ish caricatures. Golden Buddha statues and giant Tiki mask tunnels await you. These are not boring circuit or street races (but those are available, too.)\n\nThere's also a ton of different event types that move beyond just racing and time trials. Again, it's a lot like Project Gotham in that respect: drive through cones, collect points tokens, practice your drafting abilities and way, way more. There's a lot to do in this game, and a lot of cars to do it with. Trucks, coupes, sport and muscle cars, even concept cars and Model-Ts.\n\nJust don't expect Forza. Don't even expect Need for Speed, really. But if you're in the mood for a racing game, this will serve you well enough. It's just not a revolution.","May 18, 2015","true","8.9"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","2"

Crazy how things change in a decade. its worth a shot espeically for a single pound, £1 is a steal.

The physics aren't great and the graphics have dated (you will need to manually alter the screen resolution from the game's folder in order to stop it stretching things from 4:3 to 16:9), but this game has a few tricks up its sleeve.\n\nIt has a wide variety of unique game modes and is one of few PC games that supports split-screen multiplayer. The car selection is also great, with a mix of rare classics and unique concepts from Ford's history. Some of these cars (like the Ford GT70 Concept) are literally in no other video games, so if you're a fan of Ford this will definitely get your inner car-nerd excited.\n\nAdmittedly the performance of these vehicles is not accurate. They're split into classes which supposedly feature similar vehicles, and the vehicles within these are balanced to be competitive with each other. But in the Off-Road class you get a mix of pickup trucks and rally cars, including the formidable Ford RS200 from Group B rallying and the original Ford F-Series from 1948. In reality, these vehicles wouldn't even be close to the same league, but here they can both bring the fight to each other.\n\nBut the game does have a really nice race and unlocks structure which I really haven't seen enough of in recent games. And at the low price of £4, there's really no reason to not get it if you like these cars.","September 11, 2014","true","15.9"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

It was difficult at first because I hadn't developed strong driving skills in video games. Despite that, I still enjoyed the game, though I didn't finish the game completely because I couldn't do some of the harder races. Fast forward into today, when I became a better driver, such as playing Gran Turismo, Need for Speed, and Test Drive Unlimited 2 and getting my driver's licence, I still enjoy this game, and only got it for 99 cents. Sure, the game is 10 years old, but one of the best classic games I ever experienced.\n\nOverall: If you're a Ford fan, then this game should be fun. There are plenty of cars to race from and from different classes, such as the Model T, Mustangs, F-series trucks, and the supercar Ford GT. There are also a large number of tracks with different terrain and layouts. The game also offers a campain mode as well as a challenge mode.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10.\nThough it is fun with plentiful of cars, most of the game is really easy (despite the "hard" difficulty) and the crash physics are a bit unrealistic. The graphics are alright, but it's to be expected from an old game.","December 26, 2014","true","9.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","1"

For starters, I've had this game for PS2 for a long time now. When I became more connected to Steam and I saw it here, I thought to myself "I just have to get my hands on it!". Then I saw all the people here complaining about this or that detail. So is this game imperfect? Yes. But since when do games have to be perfect? The truth is, I had a lot of fun play this game when I was a kid, and I still equally enjoy it now that I have it on Steam. Sure, comparing it to modern day Need For Speed's or the latest "The Crew" game, this one doesn't even stand a chance. But for a game almost 10 years old, it's excellent. The cars, their sounds, the tracks, the tricks, the different race types, the lady's voiceover. It's old. But it truly is gold.\n\nPros:\n\n- A lot of cars, a lot of tracks, a lot of trophies -- this means a lot of playtime\n- Different race types makes this game everything but non-repetitive\n- Old Fords and new Fords (by new, I mean 2005-new) can be found, meaning a game where certain cars can only be found\n- The lady's voiceover!\n\nCons:\n\n- Your profile can only have 3 letters\n- Gameplay music can be a bit ugh\n- Graphics are, of course, outdated by today's standards\n\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 8/10.

NB: This is not an official guarantee, the developers/publishers of this game and the writer of this review are not liable for any losses of money or temper incurred through the purchase of this video game. (Although my computer is 8 years old and it runs seamlessly.)\n\nThe graphics and controls are very smooth for a game originally released in 2005; I will say that the reduced number of polygons is evident and that the quality of this port is a fraction worse than the original. The physics are, unsurprisingly, not up to the standard of a modern day AAA title, but this can be used to your advantage. (Primarily the use of other racers rather than the brake pedal.)\n\nThe best thing about Ford Racing 3 is its variety.\n•There are 5 game modes available: quick race (get racing only 3 clicks after launching the game), competition, challenge (exactly what it says on the tin), collection (allowing you to choose any car, track etc. you want) and multiplayer (which I am yet to see anyone else on).\n•There are 11 race types from the more common: standard race, elimination, boost, time attack, duel and racing line, to the more obscure (and often more challenging): driving skills, overtake, drafting, relay and seconds out (<--- can be incredibly frustrating)\n•There are 26 tracks that take you through a wide range of scenarios including: oval circuits, Hawaiian beaches, oil refineries, seaside towns, motorways and snow; all raceable in reverse.\n•There are 55 iconic Ford vehicles from the Model T to the Ford GT, but the 68’ Mustang is, in my opinion, the best in the game and it’s unlocked from the start which is a bonus.\nAll of which you will have to unlock and master to 100% the game.\n\nThe game has a good, if limited, soundtrack which suits the game well. Ford Racing 3 features a well developed levelling system that allows you to unlock: race types, tracks, vehicles and even liveries, by completely competitions and challanges. The game is also compatible with a controller which I highly recommend using, for any racing game. If you dont have controller then the game still plays well with the keyboard. If you do have a controller make sure you calibrate it correctly, this takes some trial and error but is worth the effort.\n\nFor 79p in the Exploration Sale this game was a bargain, and maybe it's just nostalgia but I'd buy this game at full price in an instant. I guess there's only one way for you to find out.\n\nFinally I'd like to say a huge thank you for porting this game. My only criticism is that this has not been done with more titles. (Might I suggest 'Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge', I dropped mine down the back of a radiator years ago, I was on the last mission!!!!!)","January 24, 2015","true","9.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","1"

However, I decided to put my csgo skin money into this game, and was surprised. This game has solid driving controls and is not very hard to play. It is very much an arcade racer. It has much more content than I anticipated, containing 26 tracks and 49 cars to unlock. It features 5 game modes.\n-Quick Play: As you'd expect, just hop into a car, track, and racetype of your choice and have at it. Nothing more.\n-Ford Competition: The bread and butter of this game. Features many different cups in different areas of tracks and cars; whether its classic street racing or off road battling. Here you will unlock different cars and tracks to use in quick play and Ford Collection.\n-Ford Challenges: I have yet to touch this mode, but from what i understand it features challenges such as staying on racing lines. This mode will unlock vehicles such as the classic Thunderbirds.\n-Ford Collection: Where you can view all of your unlocked goodies and take them out for a spin.\n-Multiplayer: No one plays it, so it doesn't matter.\n\nOverall, this is a great classic game and a bargain at 74 cents.\n8.5/10 Will probably 100%\n#Ford4Life","June 17, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Supports 360 contoller. Meh sound, good for 99p.\n\nI had Ford Racing 2 around the time it came out, and remembered it being quite fun at the time. I thought I'd buy this to pass the time whilst Theif downloads. At 280mb, FR3 only took a few minutes. This is basically an arcade racer before Arcade Racers became showy, boombastic, DUB filled, EA-Sign-In-Please Racers, and it is all the better for it. Essentially you just race races to unlock cars, and do special challenge races to unlock other cars.\n\nAt its core, the racing physics are pretty good for an Arcade Racer; there is a good balance between grip and powersliding fun, and the cars go far faster than in real life, All in all the driving works well and is the reason why it kept me entertained as well as it did. It supports the 360 controller in that you can bind the triggers to acellerate and brake.\n\nThe graphics are probably equivalent to late Xbox, early 360 graphics, and almost look cartoony. At the end of the day they get the job done well enough, and support all resolutions that Windows allows, but only supports 4:3 so at 16:9 the game looks stretched. Have a look at http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showpost.php?p=27281114&postcount=1243 for some better screenshots than the steam page.\n\nThe sound is passable.\n\nOveral, I was going to spend the 99p on a coffee at work on Monday, so, did I get more enjoyment than I would from a coffee? Yes, absolutely.\n\n","November 29, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/315600/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","FR3 is an arcade racing game with some famous Ford vehicles on variety of closed tracks, with variations and time of day to make the tracks look more varied than reality. There are the typical racing modes, regular race, elimination, but a few special modes like boost where you have to time the use of nitro boost carefully to pass. The graphics are pretty low but then, this game is old, and the frame rate is good. The cars do skid somewhat but in a rather arcadish manner, with no tuning possible.\n\nThere are two sets of missions. First is the Ford Cups. You start with fairly classic cars, classic Mustang, Mustang II, 46 Ford, Ford Galaxie, etc. As you win the cup, you unlock additional cars, additional cups, and additional liveries for the cars. The idea is to win all events and be declared the ultimate Ford Racing Champion. Obviously the later events gets really tricky, as cars get faster and harder to control. And there are many classes of vehicles, from offroaders to trucks, from coupes to moderns, from sedans to super-sport (like the GT and Mustang GT). Once you collected enough vehicles, you can do the vehicle specific challenges, which are even harder.\n\nThe race types are somewhat inventive, as they go beyond the typical race.\n\nRegular Race: race 3 laps and who's the winner at the end?\n\nElimination: race 3 laps, last two places eliminated per lap until last lap as it's down to sudden death\n\nDuel: race ONE other car on first lap, 2 on second lap, and 3 on third lap. Beat them all.\n\nDriving skill: race through the gates (don't hit them) to buy more time and finish the lap before time runs out\n\nOvertake: overtake X cars before your time runs out (overtake adds time on the clock, hitting them takes time off the clock)\n\nRacing line: stay on the racing line to earn boost for overtake\n\nBoost: two boosts for each lap, use them wisely\n\nDrafting: stay behind the other vehicle for X seconds to eliminate them, eliminate the goal amount and you win\n\nRelay: Race one lap, draft your buddy to "pass", then you race that car for another lap... repeat for third lap.\n\nSeconds out: hit the required number of symbols AND finish within time limit to win. Symbols may give or take away time depending on whether you hit green or red symbols.\n\nTime Attack: finish lap within time limits. You have 3 attempts.\n\nThe handling model is definitely arcadish, but not "on rails" as you'd expect. You do slide around corners, and skidding is measured (or drifting). Burnout is also measured. Sliding along walls is not recommended, but handbrake slides are possible for tight corners. And obviously all the vehicles will handle somewhat differently (but not THAT differently... Would you believe a .46 Ford can keep up with a '63 Mustang? )  AI cheats somewhat, but not excessively. It will punish you for your mistakes though.  And as races get longer, you will make mistakes. And on harder levels, the times get shorter, the first car gets a boosted takeoff, and so on.\n\n\nThe game starts to get frustrating about mid-point, when you realize the AI cheats to stay close to you unless you build up a large lead through truly flawless driving, and that's just on the easy races. And this is obviously not always possible. By the end, when you hit the "hard" races, is when you realize that the AI makes impossible turns and you'll NEVER catch up.\n\nThere is no cockpit view, only bumper, third-person close, and third-person far. I recommend third-person far as you need to see the road ahead .\n\nThe races do get a bit dreary as each cup is composed of multiple events and it's just using different cars. As you unlock more cars, you can try different cars but again, same courses over and over, so many laps, it gets repetitive, even with all the alternate racing modes. And when you get to the hard races, where AI makes impossible speeds with you having no chance to catch up, is when you feel like throwing out this game.\n\nGiven its low price point, give it a try, but it's not a deep game, and you should only play it in short stretches unless you get horribly bored. This is basically a 1998 game (similar to NFS High Stakes, with a few extra modes)  The multiplayer ability along with "design your own race" (which is really "remix our races, tracks, and vehicles") adds some replayability, and it is possible to play this game at high res, but this is an old game, and it's severely out of date. Go play NFS: Most Wanted (the original) for a lot more thrills, IMHO.","December 16, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's perfectly playable - bug free and smooth - but it's mind numbingly dull. The engine noises are pretty dire and the music is so bad it really needs to be disabled completely. Despite many competition 'rounds' there are only a handful of tracks that are just re-used by racing them backwards or with a slightly different route. The night tracks are strange because none of the cars appear to have headlights - consequently it's just dark and feels wrong. 'Bare bones' and 'generic' are how I would describe the experience. Not recommended unless you've played every other race game on steam and curiosity gets the better of you.","October 18, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I can say I shouldn't have been surprised though by this game's low sale price, but still, I'd expect a higher quality standard from a game released in 2004.\n\nThe graphics are garbage; the windows are opaque, the reflections non-existant, the detail low with no option to increase graphic quality. The gameplay is awful; the car slips and slides everywhere, there is zero penalty for hitting a wall, and the computer controlled opponents can be spun out by tapping them. The career mode is boring versus where you actually got to do a championship with each car in FR1 to unlock its' black version with enhanced peformance.\n\nTo sum it up, don't buy this.

With poor drift abilities, poor vehicle damage, poor vehicle handling.  their is  additional content such as the ability to upgrade your  cars components , which you hgave to earn by winning races.  The  AI  is pretty dumb and, oh yeah,   the graphics  will tell you this game  was released 10 years ago.   This game is amongst  the worst driving/racing game  I've played in a long time.  If you are determined to buy it, I'd advise you to wait till the   sales.  I'm sure all three will  be  on  sale soon?\n\nIn the Steam sales you can get far superior  Need for Speed titles for the same price you're paying for these games, and Crash Time 2 and 3, which are  on sale frequently   are even less  and are  beautiful games compared to this monstosity.  FlatOut 2 is only  25% more and has so much more going for it, with gorgoeous graphics, fully destructible environments and cars, upgradable  vehicles and  some interesting modes included.\n\nOne other positive (apart from the music), especially if you are into  retro cars; you can race the very first  Ford car  (Ford Model T)\n\nI really don't know why Valve are adding such mediocre games to their library.\n","September 9, 2014","false","0.8"," 32 of 108 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","32","108","0","4"

This is basically a first impressions review.\n\nThe graphics are okay, keep in mind this game is from 2005. The physics are also pretty decent, comparable to modern arcade racers if I'm honest. The sound is... Meh, it's not going to be the best with the game being from 2005 and all but it's not bad either and I think it's pretty obvious that this game isn't very demanding.\n\nIt's probably not something you'll spend long sessions with though. Again, first impressions here but it does feel like it'll be a game that you play, complete and then don't touch for a while. That being said it looks like it has quite a lot of levels so it could last you a bit.\n\n\n\nThe bad points:\nSteam lanches the game.exe rather than the launcher-\nLaunching it with steam will run it in a low resolution (like 800x600 or something like that). You'll want to go into the config file and run a .exe and click run game on that launcher. I'd recommend making one of those config exe files the shortcut for this game as steam seems to launch it in the lower resolution even if you changed it in the actual game launcher.\n\nLimited graphical settings. It's  just a matter of low, medium or high in the game launcher (which steam DOESN'T launch)\n\nThe AI seems easy and there seems to be a sort of invisible wall traveling ahead of you so the AI can't get too far ahead of you. The AI also seems to keep up with your pace but they don't attempt to pass you unless you actually try to do something to let them pass.\n\n\nOverall:\nA pretty decent game from what I've played so far. It has it's flaws (one of which is down to steam) and it's age shows but if you're looking for an old, arcade racer to kill some time then this would be a good pick.\n","November 23, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fairly fun little game and it doesn't cost much only about 5 bucks unless it's on sale for less. Though do keep in mind you aren't buying some ultrarealistic racing simulator but it's still a hell of a lot of fun and some of these challenges can actually be a little difficult (or I just suck). The only real complaint I have is that some times after races the game will stop working and close which can be kind of frustrating.

Multiple challenges unlocks overtime and doing so unlocks a variety of iconic Fords to drive with, pretty simple. Overall not a lenghty game, but a fun blast from the past.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that I could complain about this game, are the snow race tracks.

But l could say that this games 'somehow' rocks. Good musics, amusing challenges and some cars have their own characteristics. l strongly recommend to play it on hard... Much more fun and driving experience. On high settings does not look bad at all. When it's on sale, it's a must buy for every racing game lovers. lt's more realistic any other arcade racing games includes NFS 2015.\n\n\nCons: Some of the cars are just rushed. Looks and sounds bad. You don't have any fun while drive them. Menu looks low quality regardless of screen resolution. Some tracks are really hard to master, you should crash everywhere like a ball if you are decisive to be fast. No damage modelling or crash sounds.","May 15","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game just works and has some fun elements to it. Yes, crashing does jack ♥♥♥♥, and the physics model can be a little janky at times. But come on, it costs 5€, and can run on a toaster. I think that if you want a simple racing game, that can eat away some hours of your life, you should definitely buy this game.","May 14","true","3.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
