More hectic than I'd like.  You have to clear the board quickly because you will get attacked every so often.  I'm used to taking my time with puzzle games and I find it hard to think fast in this one.  But there are spells that help and armor you can buy to boost your defense.  You can heal at an inn, though they are few and far between.  There are one-time use only spells and also ones that you can learn in your spell book and keep permanently.  You can only have 10 active spells or items (one-time use scrolls) at a time, so choose wisely.\n\nI have to say, though, that the map is epic sized.  Looks like an RPG or historical war game.  The graphics are nice for a puzzle game.  There is a little character that moves around on the map, but you don't see any enemies, it just goes to the puzzle screen.  And no story scenes or anything like that.  But there's enough to just spice up the usual freecell game and make it a bit more special.\n\nThe levels start out really short and easy but they do get harder.  Also you only have one free cell in the beginning.  You gain more by collecting random cards after winning battles or buying them from stores.  Once you have a full deck of all suits it lets you get another free cell, then you start again collecting for your next one.  Later levels have more than one set of card suits, like there might be on heart, one spade, but two diamonds and two clubs.  If you hover your mouse over a town it tells you the difficulty you are facing so you can decide where you want to go and work your way up to the difficult ones.  If you get into trouble you can back out, go heal, and come back to try again.  I haven't figured out if the levels are random or pre-arranged.  If they are random, then some of the difficulty is due to luck of the draw.\n\nIf you like free cell, you will probably like this game.  It will give you a reason to play because you want to conquer the world!","November 4, 2015","true","53.1"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

I'm not disappointed!\n\nEspecially intriguing to me was the "Quest" portion of the game's title, and for the most part, it lives up to it. Sure, it isn't on par with something like the original Puzzle Quest's transformation of Bejeweled into an RPG-lite, since it currently appears to lack any real story elements. However, it is a nice game of FeeCell, and includes RPG elements such as experience, leveling, gold, equipment, shops, spells, character classes, health and healing items, to add some more depth and purpose to playing beyond just a game of cards.\n\nIt doesn't have gamepad support natively, but the mouse-heavy controls map nicely to the Steam Controller, if you've got one of those.","October 19, 2015","true","54.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

Eventually you might also want to invest in some spells to help calm the storm as well as making sure you have collected enough cards to unlock another FreeCell to hold cards for you.","October 22, 2015","true","11.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The variation in the number of suits and stacks, as well as being able to develop more free slots throughout the game,  alters the difficulty and keeps things interesting.\nI'm not sure that the rpg elements, overlaid on it, work all that well.   It is an interesting idea but I think it needs to be refined.  Freecell is a game that rewards taking time to think through numerous moves in advance.   The game, by having attacks upon your health while playing, which essentially functions as a fancy timer,   forces you to play quickly and make dumb mistakes as well as constantly interrupts your concentration.  The early boards are so simple that this isn't a problem, but as the game progresses you will feel more harried.  It becomes more irritating than enjoyable.  At one point, I found myself having to backtrack to capital cities to rest and restore my health and mana after one or two boards.  This was more a chore than anything else.   Thankfully this was ultimately alleviated by being able to open up another free slot.\n\nStill, if you like playing freecell, this is a variation that I would try, especially when it's on sale.","December 9, 2015","true","8.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Some beat themselves in a move or two) so I was able to get the rules down pretty quick, more then I ever did playing it in the standard windows games version.\n\nI didn't notice the rpg elements for a while because the start was so easy. I thought the game was staying too easy for too long, until I noticed how insanely massive the map is. As I got to the harder sections, I can see how the RPG elements will force you to play faster and smarter. It's not just a matter of trying to beat the game, but doing it so you don't run out of options in a tricky situation.\n\nYou get spells and items that make it unlike a normal game of freecell, mostly useful if you get stuck and are about to take damage, so it does change it up.\n\nThere are different classes... but the game is so large by the looks of it, I guess doing multiple playthroughs as different classes must be for the most hardcore of completionists?\n\nWell, it's Freecell, and if you want an excuse to play a ton of freecell of varying sizes, difficulty, and with some randomized twists, the game will do that. Accomplishing it's own goals is a thumbs up from me.","November 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to spend a lot of time (ok, hours) playing freecell after school, but FreeCell Quest is a refreshingly original twist on a classic game.  You pick a "role" for your character, and each role or class has a specific attribute that is helpful in your quest.  Your character roams the map to play matches to liberate the locations that you visit.  I have only gotten through six towns, but I can see that the game will steadily increase in difficulty as you unlock futher locations on your map.

It takes the standard game and adds a lot of variety to it. There's an element of limited time, since you're getting attacked, but you can also dispel the attacks before they are executed, giving you more than just the card sorting to think about. The difficulty gets harder than any other FreeCell I've seen, but you get spells to help you cope with that. Using the spells to "cheat" the rules of basic FreeCell is a cool twist.\n\nThe map artwork is beautiful, and freeing the cities as you go through the different nations is a fun way to track your progress. And there are a lot of levels, so you can play one file for a long time.\n\nSo in the end, it's FreeCell with added RPG mechanics.
