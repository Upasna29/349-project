I might try again and go for some achievements, but I'm pretty close to uninstalling right now. I sincerely hope there are updates that will improve gameplay because I hate leaving a negative review.\n\nI wasn't Huniepop's target audience (at all), but it was fun and fresh and funny. I love management sims, and I like the progression of clicker games, so I expected to enjoy this, but it's just boring. It goes nowhere. It's so quick and shallow that it feels pointless. They're calling it fast-paced in the description, but being brief, dull, and repetitive doesn't measure up. There are no real gains to restarting, so why bother?\n\nI have no idea how it took so long to release either. I almost feel as though I'm missing a huge part of the game. After a few minutes of playing, I was like, is this it? (The 'Is it in yet?' response of gaming). There was potential, but it completely misses the mark. It's more like a free flash game. Sticking an adult industry theme on top doesn't make it any more interesting.\n\nI had no problems with the artwork changing, and I wasn't expecting Huniepop 2. I was looking forward to something new. But I'm not even sure what kind of game to call this one. It's not a good clicker without a restart that gets some kind of bonus to get further/do better the next round (the clothes/hair unlocks could give better stats, for example). It's not a good management game because you don't get to do a lot other than dragging girls onto a task or holding down a button to get your money faster. Even the achievements are uninspired.\n\nHuniecam isn't long enough to really care about, and there's extremely little of the humour I expected, and even less of the voice acting. At this time, I can't recommend, and that's so disappointing because I was ridiculously hyped for this game's release.","April 4","false","4.9"," 353 of 425 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","353","425","6","4"

But I found out by playing it just how barebones the gameplay feels. In the game your goal is to get as many fans as you possibly can to earn trophies- but you earn trophies in the first 21 days of the game, everything after that has no point or reward. Sure, the girls are creative and seeing some of my favorites from HuniePop was entertaining but overall besides the upgrades ( which I maxed out in only 40 or so in-game days ) and the 18 diffrent girls there isn't much else to this game. You drag a girl to 1 of 7 buildings, click or wait for time to run out, and then drag her to a different building all while managing addictions and stress levels. But other than different addictions ( to alcohol or cigarettes ) all the girls are basically the same- with no prefrences.\n\nI cannot, in good faith, recommend this game despite the fact I love these developers. I just wish there was more put into this to make it a better micromanagement game then click and drag. It was not difficult and I really didn't feel like I was ever working to a higher goal. I was basically done with everything the game had to offer in the first hour of gameplay and the rest is filler while you unlock upgrades that don't feel like rewards at all.  I'm surprised free games like Adventure Capitalist kept me more entertained than a game I paid about $7 for, so overall a major disappointment.","April 9","false","17.0"," 178 of 219 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","178","219","2","1"

I am also a fan of this style of game though I have only played a small handful of time management and clicker games. Both things considered, I figured I'd enjoy it.\n\nI've got to go ahead and say, a LOT of fellow Cam Girls are highly offended by the over-the-top negative stereotypes that are portrayed in the game. The addiction and STD themes, especially, but also calling the fans "disgusting". The vibe of the game lends to the stigma that only girls who have made "poor life choices" and dirty/addicted/desperate people participate in the cam world. Hopefully people can appreciate the satire of it and not actually believe that's the reality of the industry, even though there are some "sleazy" studio operations out there...\n\nThat being said, I thought this game was fun. I've played through 3 times in order to beat previous scores and get tokens for wardrobe/hairstyle upgrades. I don't think it will be a long-lasting sort of fun, but it's enjoyable to pass the time if you're in the mood to boss cartoon chicks around and click buildings.","April 8","true","12.0"," 438 of 584 people (75%) found this review helpful 98 people found this review funny","75","438","584","98","39"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/426000/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","HunieCam Studio is a fairly short clicker management parody game. Your first playthrough should last just over 2 and a half hours, but achievements and the desire to beat your high score can increase the replay value. It would take 4-5 games to unlock all the achievements. The game comes with a fully voiced acted tutorial and many cam girls that all have responses when you click or drag them around. The art is consistent and gives it a mobile game type of vibe.\n\nI'm really not sure what to think of this game. The first hour seems okay and it has its jokes, but the end is just a frantic rush to make money which isn't that interesting. I just drag all my employees to the Cam Studio building over and over and over again until they build up enough stress for me to drag them to the Day Spa building to help them chill. Then I just drag them to Cam Studio again. That’s not exactly compelling gameplay. There’s a giant lack of depth, even when compared to money hungry F2P mobile games. Many of those are good until you hit the progression wall. The jokes don’t even last for this game. It just turns into an empty experience for the second half. Then you see the phallic trophy at the end when you win and listen to Kyu for a bit.\n\nThe game has a meta-progression with cosmetics for your ladies. You earn tokens based on performance for purchasing hairstyles and clothes in the main menu. You can unlock pictures if you grab all the cosmetics for a character. The art is not meant for titillation, but they’ll be in suggestive poses.\n\nI will say that I do appreciate the click and hold function to make sure my fingers don't break. I wouldn't want to actually click that much. Some of the achievements can change how you play. The late game is always the same in every session. Cam Studio, Day Spa, buy Promos, repeat.\n\nHuniePop had some real meat to it with its solid match-3 gameplay and dating sim aspect. This title falls a bit short and definitely feels like something produced in-between real projects. I don't see much of a reason to play it more than twice. Or even more than once unless you're a completionist. I managed 3 playthroughs, but that was to see what the game had to offer.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this game. Go buy HuniePop instead if you want a parody pervy experience with some real gameplay.","April 5","false","6.3"," 182 of 232 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","182","232","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheetarah/recommended/426000/","cheetarah","Goosies Moosies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheetarah/","74 products in account","As the hours of play suggest, I really really wanted to enjoy HunieCam. In a way, I did, but at the end of every play through it felt hollow.\n\nIf this game had new modes after meeting high scores--new characters, new setting, new challenges, that would have made repeating the same 21 days over again more tolerable. As it is it's just the same very short game played several times with little variation. The hard mode option doesn't add new challenges, it just makes things more expensive, so it isn't really a satisfactory solution.\n\nThe game feels unfinished, especially compared to its fun, content-rich predecessor. If this were a 1-2$ mobile app the scantness of the gameplay and replay value would be somewhat understandable, but to be honest, tons of free phone apps have kept my attention longer, so even that valuation might be a stretch.\n\nThe pros are that this is a visually appealing game, even if the art style isn't to everyone's taste (and I did prefer the older style, but this one is fine too). It has the potential to be fun, but if this is all it's ever going to be then it's a serious let down.\n\nIf updates are on the table, consider giving the characters more personality--those of us who played HuniePop already know some of them, but others are only given brief descriptors and voice over acting. Maybe instead of a character recruiting people, you do the recruiting--some kind of mini game to convince girls to work for you. Considering the draw of the game is, mostly, the characters, I think they should have more to do than be portraits with one-liners and fetish fan counts.\n\nThis game would benefit tremendously from having more things to do. Sitting and holding the mouse button down (or clicking) on a building quickly loses its intrigue when there isn't any other gameplay element to break up the monotony. You are working toward a goal, sure, but you also know that at the end of the 21 days your efforts will have accomplished little more than giving you wardrobe tokens and a ♥♥♥♥♥ trophy, so the motivation is somewhat dubious. Mini-games, character interaction and more, better, unlockables would make a massive difference.","April 7","false","15.5"," 109 of 132 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","109","132","2","0"

Despite my low expectations I was hoping the game would be more intuitive and/or creative then it looked. I am sad to say I was wrong.\n\nThis game completely lacks everything that HuniePop had, which was fun writing, creative characters, and entertaining yet challenging game play. It instead gives us a fast paced, depersonalized, and tedious clicker game that's over so quickly you never get a chance enjoy it. I am very disappointed that the same studio that gave us HuniePop felt that this was in some way the right step forward for them.\n\nYou are better off saving your $7.\n\nTL;DR: A facebook quality clicker game that you can beat in under 2 hours with no real incentive to replay.","April 6","false","1.6"," 197 of 263 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","197","263","5","2"

It plays well. It has great mechanics. What it lacks... is kinda everything else.\n\nThe game is about 2 hours long, give or take. There's zero replay value, unless you want to unlock everything like the achievements. If you don't want achievements, all you get is different hairstyles and clothing that do nothing.\n\nThe new girls are really cute, I admit it. But they have no personality aside from flavor text and a few voiced lines. I really wish they got more. Speaking of characters... the special girls from the main game are missing. Sad times, considering Celeste is my favourite.\n\nThe game's humor is... questionable. Yeah, we're all getting a laugh out of cake farting. But there's incredibly offensive stuff in it as well. Then again, we all expected that. Just putting that warning here for anyone who doesn't know. But aside from the cake farting, nothing is funny so don't come in expecting Huniepop's humor.\n\nIt's a fun time sink, and I'm going to 100% it. But it's not worth $7. It's worth $5 at max, though if I had known it was like this I would have only paid $3 or so if I could choose my own price. Hopefully Huniepot either adds more or lowers the price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/momosrl/recommended/426000/","momosrl","Mvllsk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/momosrl/","329 products in account","I'm going to be honest straight away: This "review" is going to be biased and a bit salty, so be aware of this.\n\nObviously, I am going to compare this game to HuniePop although, quite frankly, the two games have far less in common than we all hoped for and I assume that the Dev intended it to not be compared to HuniePop. But I am also the kind of fan that wanted a "HuniePop 2.0" and I am not talking about the Match-3 Element.\n\nKeep in mind that I played this game for over an hour so I havent really "experienced" the entire game, but if you know HuniePop, I can assure you that this game doesnt have long introduction either and I feel like after almost 2 hours of game time I can at least share my opinion about why I do not want to keep this game in my steam libary in its current state.\n\nMy general complaints:\n\n- 1. **Art Style**\n\nThis one is the obvious complaint but I was willing to accept the "chibi" comic look at first if it was working with the overall concept and style of the game. Honestly, the art*style* didnt really bother me too much although it is nowhere near as good as the HuniePop style. Much more am I bothered about the *lack* of art within the game. Which brings me to my actual main complaint:\n\n- 2. **Lack of Personality**\n\nThe game lacks what made HuniePop great. You no longer connect with the girls. This was made obvious from the game concept at first glance, yes, but there is an absolute lack of personality from all the girls. The only difference I noticed was the two starting traits ("fetishes") each girls has and, well, the unlockable outfits and hairstyles. But due to the various items, you can basically turn any girl into the same fetish with the exception of their base traits. No girl will refuse getting forced into Bondage, Anal, Water Sports, Furry or Squirting (which is a selection of fetishes that you can apply to your girls by buying certain items). There is no like or dislike meter for each girl. Essentially, the only things that also varies are the "base stats" as in attractiveness and talent, the asked pay and the "addictions".\nAlso, did I mention that Nikki suddenly has DD breasts? Just another thing that takes away from the likeable girl-personality of the first game.\n\nIt seemed to me that there were no collectable splash arts or artworks as in the first game. I might have not been in the game far enough but I feel like if after 2 hours of playtime (and I did try to go for a fast-pace playthrough as the tutorial somewhat recommended) you still have no indication of a reward (other than the "♥♥♥♥♥ trophies"), then there is a huge lack of motivation for the player. As far as I can tell, you get to see nothing of neither the photoshoots nor the cam shows. This, of course, might be an end-game element, I cannot tell. But the fact that it is missing completely in the early game makes this a big negative point for me.\n\n- 3. **High Stress**\n\nThe last mentioned new feature "addictions" is an added element that forcefully increases the difficulty of the game. This is far less a "management" game nor is it a "girl collectathon" as it is a clicking simulator (think Cookie Clicker). In order to stay on top of your payments and the requests of your girls, you are asked to click on the various buildings to collect and speed up certain actions. And I felt like I nearly broke my mouse. The overall speed of the game is incredibly fast for my personal taste. There is no down time to relax and enjoy your achievements or you will quickly run out of money. Alternatively, you *can* play the game slow but then you will be able to only sustain a small amount of girls, you will make positive progress far slower and you have the constant worry of not making the deadline that is mentioned in the beginning of the game. Overall the game seemed too hectic for me.\n\n\n- 4. **Management Elements**\n\nYes, this is a Cam Studio Manager, of course there are going to be management elements. But those that I am presented with are neither deep nor utterly exciting. I was accepting the shallow modifier options in HuniePop because the game offered more depth in the personality of each of the characters and hence gameplay depth wasnt as important. But this game removed the connection between the player and the girls and therefore I wished a more strategical gameplay element would have been added instead. But nope, your options are pretty limited. I do have to give credit for the "escort" service, even though I wasn't a fan of it in my moral view. You get the option to risk STDs for a faster money gathering service. STDs can either be a mild annoyance or, as I experienced it in the game, render a girl completely useless. Permanent STDs that affect pay and status of a girl will be devastating and you definitely want to prevent being reckless and prepare accordingly by buying condoms and medicine. But the time pressure mentioned above makes this almost impossible if you want to pursue an effective business. This could raise moral questions and start some deep discussions but honestly, I, as a HuniePop fan felt like it ruined the fun of the game. Because the game expects you to ditch all your morals and just "go for it" but then the one girl that you *connect* with and train to your likings catches a perm. STD and suddenly becomes compeltely useless to your business. Welp.\n\n\nI do have a few positive points that I want to mention:\n\nThe music is great, not as good as HuniePop but still on a similar level. The voice actresses seemed to be consistent with the previous game and the reappearance of the characters was a welcome element.  Also the art style of the items and menues seemed just as good and intuitive and the game is generally easy to understand.\n\n\nBut yes, I felt like this game was a huge disappointment even though I already came in with lower expectations. It's not expensive, but then again, it's still not worth the money if you ask me.","April 4","false","1.4"," 288 of 410 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","288","410","5","7"

Just in case you didn't get that yet, this game is not much safe for work (though there is not anything sexually explicit).\n\nSo, have you ever wanted to get into the camgirl business? Here goes your chance, as you'll be paying your dear employees (women only, sorry) to do... their stuff on webcam. You know, that thing some people like watching and paying for. But that's not all, they'll be also taking photoshoots, learning to get better at stripping (you want only the best girls, right?), or if one of your girls won't be so good at her job, you can let her just go shopping for cigs and alcohol that her colleagues love. But if you'll ever feel desperate, you can escort the girls for a quick money... if you don't mind them having a wonderful STD.\n\nThat all may sounds nice and somehow complex, but it isn't. All you'll be doing is mostly clicking to increase your money or fan count by units, and checking the interests of your fanbase. Because it's obvious that if your fans love fit and asian girls, you won't be looking for more MILFs. To make even more people happy, to satisfy their fetishes, you'll also go shopping for special items, like animal ears for furry lovers.\n\nBefore I get to the negative part of my review, let's mention the game excels at presentation. Everything feels really polished on the design part, which I found pretty surprising for an indie game. Also, the game has voice-acting for owner of the camgirl business (as you are a manager, she'll be talking to you a lot, in form of tutorials).\n\nTo give you the practical example of the gameplay, you'll start with one girl, and objective to get as much popular as you can in 21 in-game days (that's aboout 90 minutes of playtime). So you let the girl work at the cam, clicking on her to make her work faster. Then you click many times to collect all the money she made, then repeat. After few work hours she'll get tired so you'll send her to spa. Many minutes later, you'll still be doing the same thing, just with more girls, and with training, promo ads, STDs, alcohol and cigarettes added.\n\nIt gets really boring and repetitive after a while. I believe that many people will just stop on the end of the first playthrough, and only completionists will probably want to get all the awesome achievements like: "Catch 'Em All! Contract all 6 STDs." It isn't even much complex - after all, you'll just end up clicking like a mad man to get the best possible outcome, like in Cookie Clicker, or Adventure Capitalist, or... just pick any free clicker. Oh, and one more thing - if you have a big fanbase after 3 weeks, you'll get an awesome D trophy!\n\nConclusion:While HunieCam Studio has a nice idea for adult management game, it turns out being just a pretty boring and repetitive clicker. Well, at least the girls are pretty too (if you don't mind their STDs or alcoholism).\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","April 12","false","6.2"," 108 of 143 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","108","143","7","2"

I loved Huniepop,  I like time management and clicker games.  I've played dozens of each type, both clean and naughty.  Why.. why did this game have to be so shallow, and poorly made?\n\nIt isn't even the art that bugs me, which is something I see a lot of people having issue with.  The art is ok, it isn't as good as huniepop, but it isn't that bad.\n\nThe issues are as follows\n1: No personality.  All the girls are more or less the same, with no voice work save for the tired lines of "task complete"  No one has likes or hates, and you can pretty much do or give anything to them with no objection.  There is no variation besides numbers and starting kinks.\n\n2: The gameplay is a boring grind.  You move a girl to one of the various buildings and wait until she is done unless you click on the building a bunch of times.  You can do this hundreds of times for each girl, just click and drag, then do it some more.. then more..  getting nothing in return besides stats.\n\n3: Time limit.  At first I was rather upset at there being a time limit, but by half way through it I was so bored I was begging for the time limit to end.  It is still an issue.\n\n4: Last but sure as heck not least is the lack of variety and small touches.  If you I gave the straight lace school girl Tiffany drugs and told her to get busy in a cheap motel, she will do it and cheerfully say "complete" when done.  All the girls are just the same,  nothing happens inbetween days,  nothing changes on the map screen,  just the tired grinding until you hit 21 days.\n\nAll in all I've seen better free flash games that I find online.  The game isn't sexy or funny or worth your time.  I am sad that this game will get a lot of money because they made a previous title which was good.","April 6","false","2.3"," 75 of 93 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","75","93","0","0"

Regardless of the behind the scenes drama, it was a step in the wrong direction.  Either way, the art is meaningless to the core of the game as the only time you really see any of it is when you acidentally click on the girl's icon instead of dragging\n\nMusic:\ngood:  it's pretty well produced like most games of this genre.\nbad:  it's repetitive and gets boring since you're only really looking at one screen the entire time.  I muted it my first hour in.\n\nWriting:\ngood:  there's some writing in there\nbad:  if you're coming from huniepop, you're expecting each character to have some development or depth and understand their story a little bit.  in this game, there is no development or understanding of the character unless you look at the girl's bio.  you (as the main character) have very little interaction with anyone other than tutorials and the ending which basically goes, "THANKS FOR PLAYING!".  I am not joking when I say there is no dialogue (other than tutorials) and the sound clip of when a girl is ready or is assigned for a task ("Okay, I'm ready!")\n\nStory:\ngood:  the girls have bios\nbad:  THERE IS NO STORY BESIDES THAT, PERIOD.  okay, so you are in charge of a ring of cam girls.  now what?  oh, that's it?  oh, she got the clap.  how does she feel about this?  oh, she won't cam because she's embarassed.  damn.  I'm all about making up a story in your head as you go along (see Sunless Sea) but there's no substance to do this here.\n\nGameplay:\ngood:  this is actually one of the best clicker games I've ever played.  there is a lot to keep you going and quite a bit of management and skill to balancing time, money, resources, etc... A+\nbad:  this is the tricky part.  the game aspect of this I had no problem with but coming out of huniepop, I had thought I was walking into great comedy mixed with good gameplay.  you could have made this game about anything and had it more of an entertaining experience.  this is the key: this is the followup to a game that was more known for it's edgy/sexy humor than it's fun puzzles.  as great as the clicker style gameplay was, I was finished with the game altogether once I easily obtained the needed fans to get the highest trophy (this took me 2 attempts.. no joke).  also, the fact that it basically went, "YOU WIN! THANKS FOR PLAYING!  YOU CAN CONTINUE FOR FUN IF YOU WANT," made me want to do nothing more than turn the game off.\n\nReplay:\ngood:  you can unlock alternate clothes and hair for the characters you barely see and most of them are well designed.\nbad:  there is no replay once you beat the game.  it encourages you to basically ♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nOverall:\nI was genuinely excited for this game at the initial announcement and discussed it with a few of my friends who also liked the game.  Once the details came out little by little, I became skeptical but positive.  Once the game releases and I saw reviews, I got excited again until I got home and played it.  Seriously Huniepot, you forgot the most important parts of what made Huniepop so great.  In all honesty, the art, even though I was on the fence about it, is good... it's just not what most people were thinking they were walking into.... but how could you forget the comedy and edge that made the first game so good?  Seriously, you could have just re-released the first game with new art and a different story with the same core and people would have been happy.\n\nGood alternative to this game:\nIf you want a good time management game with great story, check out Sunrider Academy.  It's not known for comedy but the story is solid and funny at times while the core gameplay is quite challenging.  It's on Steam and it's worth every penny.","April 5","false","3.8"," 86 of 114 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","86","114","3","0"

You do get to change the girls' clothings and hair choice however you have to gain coins at the end of the game which is given to you by the medal you recieve.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idioticmuffin/recommended/426000/","idioticmuffin","IdioticMuffin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idioticmuffin/","17 products in account","HunieCam Studio is rather adequate for a game, both gameplay and lore-wise.\n\nFirst of all, story and lore wise, this game takes place XX years after the first Hunie game, HuniePop. Here, the player is now  someone who has to run a cam girl industry whilst focusing on getting fans, which is pretty much important if the player wants to get the most valuable phallic trophy. It's one of the most tycoon-based stories you could get.\n\nCharacter-wise, however, the HuniePot devs decided to massively change everything up entirely. Audrey is now a drug addict, Aiko ends up becoming a B-cup, despite HuniePop announcing that she had D-cups, and Nikki has suddenly become everyone's favourite character due to her massive mammaries. But, due to the game focusing more on the gameplay rather than the characters, every ounce of personality that the original characters had from the first game is pretty much removed, save for some quirky quips and the short backstories given to them after XX years from HuniePop.\n\nGameplay-wise, it acts extraordinarily like, as everyone else has said, a Facebook or mobile game. After playing for a while, it acts very similar to Cookie Clicker due to its repetition, Sakura Clicker because of context (both involve boobs), and any other game that has a hard mode included. I understand that the HuniePot devs were trying to change the gameplay styles for each game that they try to make, but, after a while, it gets quite boring due to not much else about the game being changed, except for the recently added in 'Rock Hard Mode,' which only makes it harder because every cam girl in the game has their payroll tripled in price, making it less 'hard' and more 'trying-to-use-your-brain-to-save-money-because-everyone-suddenly-costs-$16-per-hour hard.'\n\nLet's be honest here, self-deprecating developers of this game, the target demographic of your games are those who care less for the gameplay and more for the lewd materials provided by your artists. The only reasons these games get sold so easily is because of high-end Youtubers like Markiplier, ProJared and JackSepticEye, and because fans of the previous game think that this one will also be successful.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be nice if the devs of this game were to try something new, such as challenges for those who have already acquired the trophies, such as, as an example, 'Classic Mode' which only uses the characters from the previous game. It would add a fun little change in a game that gets about as dull as joining an actual tycoon business.\n\nNow if you want to play HunieCam Studios, go right ahead. The price is alright for those with very little change in their account, and, if you actually like trying to support the developers of these games, then sure. It's only the supposed lack of excitement produced from this game after playing it the first couple of times that makes this game lose the wow factor.\n\nOverall, it's just alright, nothing more or less. I have only made this review despite my inadequate amount of time playing it and my lack of achievements for the sake that this review reaches out to the developers who realise that, if anything, this game has only served to be bittersweet; it's gotten good sales, but some of the reviews are rather scathing and suggest improvements for the game.\n","April 15","false","8.2"," 74 of 99 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","74","99","6","0"

It's easy to spend a lot of time in the game if you are trying to optimize or are just bored.

I wanted to give this game a chance. I really liked HuniePop, especially Audrey and Kyu. However, in order to improve games, we have to give them our honest opinion or else they'll never improve and you'll wind up with something like the downfall of the Resident Evil series.\n\nI absolutely did not like this game from the beginning. It is literally just a point and click management game. I thought you'd get to actually take pictures of the girls and make art, but I did not see any of that when I played it. You never bond with the characters or get to see them in their naked glory. Also, I'm really not liking the new characters either. I found myself just sticking with the original cast. I know in future games, they'll need to likely get rid of a few characters or try out new ones, but this new batch did not fit my preference. They weren't memorable. I just kept using Audrey a lot because I was lucky enough to unlock her right away. To be very blunt, there's not a whole lot there in this game.\n\nHere are the things I did like. I'll admit, it was nice to hear Kyu's voice again and whoever makes these games is smart to keep her as the sort of host fairy who always introduces you into things. That was very smart. If you ever want to butter me up, that'll do it. Kyu is one of those characters that's easy to bond with. Also, they were smart to include Audrey. I'll admit, I don't want Audrey to go ever. I really like her. She's a popular one. Keep her around or create new characters I like just as much if you want to keep me along for this ride. Other than that, I'm sorry, I didn't care for much else.\n\nOverall, I would not buy this game. I know it's fairly cheap, but it's not even worth that. When  you make a game that gets so much popularity and momentum, this kind of move just slows down the process of a sequel and it kind of hurts your reputation. Don't become like Call of Duty or Battlefield where they just pump out half-made games and still expect fans to buy them. Let's get back on track here and make a solid Huniepop 2. That's the direction you should be looking right now. Go back to the original art style and don't be afraid to try new things in the next game, but remember that change is only good if it's an improvement.","April 4","false","0.2"," 62 of 90 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","62","90","2","0"

Nobody would complain about Mario Kart not being a platformer - it's just a Mario-themed kart game. Well this is just a HuniePop-themed management game. And a good one too.\n\nIf there's one thing that makes me bored when playing management games, it's all the waiting. Clicker games tried fixing this by keeping the player occupied by mashing on something, but it gets boring very quickly. HunieCam makes you hold the mouse button over a building to speed up the girls inside it, but if you see yourself spending a few minutes doing the same thing again and again, you're playing it wrong.\n\nIn fact, this game shares something I love with HuniePop: there are multiple layers of micromanagement. You have to try and put all the girls in the same building so you can speed them all up at once, but you'll need to increase the building capacity for that. You have to make sure not all your girls get tired at the same time or you won't be able to make them work and they can't all rest at once. You can invest your money now, but if you don't have enough money to pay the girls at the end of the day, your accounts will go red. Some girls will drink or smoke so you'll have to buy supplies, but you don't want to send your best camgirl to a store while she could be winning you more money. This also affects which girls you might pick, as well as their beginning stats. Sure, a girl with low stats will need to be trained later on, but at least she charges cheap. Fetishes influence the core decisions you should make: if only teens release free photoshoots, your MILF camgirls won't be popular enough - but if you train all your MILFs to be good at photoshooting, they'll want a better pay rate. You're better off having a teen that's only good at paid camshows and one that's only good at photoshoots - she'll gain fans for both of them. But then something else about that girl might gain popularity so you'll need another camgirl with that aspect... I already wrote a paragraph and I haven't talked about all the features that can be optimized, and that's what I like about the game. It seems very trivial at a glance, but working out the best strategy requires thinking. Just like HuniePop looked like your average match-3 puzzle but was much more!\n\nOff course, the game isn't very generous on content, so if you're not as interested by the theme and multitasking games, you probably won't play it for too long. A few games, maybe. Or if on the contrary, you're too good for the game, you might beat the hardest mode in a few attempts. Luckily, the devs have already added an even harder mode, so the game won't lack a challenge.","April 6","true","20.1"," 68 of 101 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","68","101","4","0"

I played Huniepop and really enjoyed it. It was a fun and fast paced puzzle/date sim game that was surprisingly addictive. HunieCam studio was nothing like that. I followed HuniePot dev since I first played Huniepop and I was excited to see what else they could do. I have known about the garbage art style for a long time, so it didn't really bother me when I actually played the game. My problem with this game is that it is just a clicker. Nothing more. How do you follow up from Huniepop, which was a surprisingly good puzzle game, with a simple clicker? The last game was so good that even feminists enjoyed playing it. I like it when people advance sexuality in gaming, but I hate it when they used such a s hitty game to do it.","April 6","false","0.3"," 47 of 70 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","47","70","0","0"

I followed the development of HunieCam Studio and was excited to play this. When it was released, I felt kind of disappointed. I thought this game would be a lot more in depth than it actually is. It's just a clicker game with some management options. It has an arcade style replay value of trying to beat your old high scores.\n\nPositive:+ Detailed characters with good voice acting and descriptions\n+ Cool idea, wish more games went in this direction\n+ Funny\n+ Steam trading cards\n\nNegatives:- Artwork (I was on the fence before the game was released, but prefer the old artwork). The characters look very child-like and do not fit the adult theme of the game\n- There isn't even that much artwork, most of it you see in the beginning of the game and doesn't add replay value\n- Clicker game that gets repetitive and boring pretty quickly\n- Because the game gets pretty boring quickly, I think the price is a bit high. This should be priced like a mobile game since it's close to being one. I'd say get this at 50% off or above.\n- Games pretty easy, I have 14/16 achievements\n- Was hoping for more things to control, but really the game kind of runs its self\n- Replay value seems low, you get to unlock costumes as a replay value, but most of the costumes/hairstyles were already in HuniePop, so nothing new to work for\n- Sound is okay, but like the rest of the game gets a bit repetitive\n- Has an empty feeling to it compared to HuniePop\n\nBelow Average Game: 4/10\n\nI don't recommend the game because the negatives outweigh the positives. I didn't not recommend this because of the art or because of the lack of "fapping" material. I've played about 6 hours of this game so far, and will probably play 1 or 2 more 21 day sets to try to get the remaining achievements. Other than that, probably won't touch the game ever again.\n\nProbably should have been a mobile port.","April 4","false","5.4"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","32","44","0","0"

This game was made by the same people and when they announced this game I was excited! However, after playing it for roughly an hour, I was so bored to death and didn't find the game fun.\n\nFirst off, the presentation is really weird. I do like the new design, but at the same time it's just really odd. The characters look way too childish for an adult game and look really weird especially compared to the original HuniePop art style. The voice acting is amazing though just like the original game, but the look? Can't say so much.\n\nSecond, the gameplay. I didn't expect it to be anything like HuniePop outside of the humor and characters, but this game is SO BORING. It's a clicker game where you manage cam girls to raise money and what not. Seems okay right? Not really... The game is sadly really tedious and repetitive and even feels RNG based at times. I played through 4 save files and failed all of them within the first four in-game days. Some girls are just way better than others causing you to get really crappy ones and the game never tells you what are the best strategies. They just say "get ♥♥♥♥♥es, get money, or your fired". To me that's just lame. There's almost no fair chance of getting a successful week going without playing the game over and over and I REALLY don't feel like doing that.\n\nLastly, the music and voice acting. I loved HuniePop's voice acting and soundtrack. They were both excellent. This game is pretty much lacking in that. Kyu is as sassy as ever and still does her role extremely well. Sadly all the other girls don't do that great of a job. Saying the same lines over and over and some of the returning HuniePop characters feel out of place in the game. As for music, it's very forgettable. Nothing too much to say about it.\n\nPros:\n\n+Returning Characters\n+Cute Design\n+Great concept\n+Easy controls\n\nCons:\n\n-Out of place characters\n-Boring gameplay\n-Unmemorable music\n-Feels way too RNG and luck based at times\n-Tedious as all hell\n-Feels rushed\n\nFinal Rating:\n\n4.5/10\n\nI sadly can't recommend this disappointment known as HunieCam Studio. Maybe next time HuniePot.","April 4","false","1.3"," 36 of 52 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","36","52","0","0"

It's really what's in between that counts, and boy howdy does it count.\n\nHuniecam Studio is a game dripping with style (and maybe a few other fluids). The girls all have fun, unique personalities, ranging from hippy to sex-positive domineering to condecending. You'll have no problem finding a favorite future waifu among them. Add in the varieties of fetish and roleplaying and you end up with a tune-a-fantasy simulator that's pretty refreshing in a video game space.\n\nI'm not going to hide it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angryjedi/recommended/426000/","angryjedi","Amarysse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angryjedi/","481 products in account","Remember "time management" games? Diner Dash and the like? They were a large part of what constituted "casual games" before f2p crap entered the marketplace and ruined everyone's fun with microtransactions, throttling and "fun pain".\n\nHuniePot, developer of HuniePop and now HunieCam Studio, clearly remember the good old days of casual games before free-to-play. Not only have they made an excellent puzzle game in the form of HuniePop -- a game that successfully puts an interesting twist on match-3 and doesn't just clone Bejeweled -- but now they've made an enjoyable and surprisingly addictive time management game in the form of HunieCam Studio.\n\nHunieCam Studio describes itself as a management/tycoon game, but set aside any thoughts of the complex '90s/'00s-era tycoon games here: this is a game that is extremely simple to pick up -- thanks in part to an amusingly well-written (and skippable) tutorial starring Kyu, the perverted fairy from HuniePop -- but challenging to master. And it's a game that's designed to be replayed and experimented with, too; both to beat your own high score and to tackle some of the challenging achievements on offer.\n\nHunieCam Studio takes much of HuniePop's cast along with some newcomers and puts them in a new context: the seedy underbelly of the Internet, specifically the "camgirl" industry. Ideal video game fodder, wouldn't you say? No? Well then, you'd be wrong.\n\nHunieCam Studio's gameplay takes place on a static town map. Beginning with just one girl in your camgirl empire -- HunieCam Studio's take on camgirls has you working for Kyu, who in turn wants nothing more than to roll in big piles of money obtained through the sleaziest means possible -- you assign your charges to various tasks, each of which takes a varying amount of time, but which can be sped up by clicking or holding the mouse button down on it. This has led many people to arguably erroneously describe HunieCam Studio as a "clicker" game, but it differentiates itself from popular clickers such as Clicker Heroes by having a clearer structure and goals in place rather than just playing endlessly for the sake of it.\n\nThe tasks the girls can take on include putting on cam shows (which earns money), doing photo shoots (which earns fans, which equal more money when doing cam shows), training their talent (which improves the money they make per fan during cam shows) and style (which improves the number of fans they acquire per photo shoot), shopping for booze and cigarettes (both of which cause those with varying degrees of addiction to either or both to remain somewhat more stress-free than their clean counterparts), banging punters in a sleazy motel (which makes money more quickly than cam shows, but which carries a risk of the girl catching one of several STDs, each of which has its own negative effects that restrict her actions), shopping for accessories (which carry passive bonuses) or resting at the day spa (which alleviates stress built up through all of the above activities).\n\nMeanwhile, as Kyu's assistant, it's your job to manage the girls' time effectively and upgrade the overall operation using the money they earn. As you progress, you can unlock more slots to hire more girls and consequently perform more simultaneous actions, and you can also improve the pace at which clicking on things speeds things along as well as automating the collection of the resources actions produce. This becomes particularly important later when the girls start earning large amounts of money and fans with each action; clicking over a thousand times to collect all your ill-gotten gains isn't going to work.\n\nYou also have to manage the overall budget. The girls have an hourly rate of pay that increases as their talent and style levels increase, and at midnight each day you have to pay them. If this puts you in debt and you're not back out of debt by midnight on the next day, you lose. There are no other consequences to getting into debt, however, so sometimes it can be tactically advantageous to quickly blow all your money to get your operation in a good position, then spend part of the next day recouping the deficit you're left with after paying the girls.\n\nThe overall aim of HunieCam Studio is to have as many fans as possible by the end of a 21-day period. Once this time period is up, your final fan total is totted up and you're awarded a knob-shaped trophy according to how well you did. This, in turn, provides you with coins that can be spent on unlocking new hairstyles and costumes for the girls, with a mildly lewd picture on offer as a reward for each girl if you unlock all her variations. (Interestingly, during the game itself there's no explicitly lewd content whatsoever; everything is implied or mentioned in text. This is not a game to fap to.)\n\nHunieCam Studio appears simple, but there are some interesting things going on under the (clitoral) hood, particularly with how the "fans" system works. Each girl starts catering to two specific fetishes, usually relating to their physical appearance -- "MILF", "Teen", "Latina" and suchlike. Fans you acquire have specific tastes, meaning that girls who have a greater share of your total fanbase will make more money doing cam shows, and more money means faster upgrades. Ideally, you'll have multiple girls with overlapping fetishes, and this can be partially manipulated by purchasing accessories from the shop -- buying butt plugs and giving them to a girl allows her to cater to fans who enjoy bum fun, for example, but this won't do you much good until you attract some fans of bum fun in the first place through photoshoots or paying for advertising to a particular audience.\n\nAs the game progresses and you get more girls in your little harem, things get surprisingly hectic if you want to keep things running as efficiently as possible, and STDs can throw a real spanner in the works, particularly if they're one of the serious, incurable ones -- AIDS, for example, prevents a girl from doing anything at all because she's so depressed about the situation, making her completely useless to your operation. There is, sadly, little time to feel sorry for her, though; not if you want to make money and attract fans, anyway. Such is the way of a capitalist society.\n\nI enjoy HunieCam Studio a lot more than I was expecting to. Its controversial new art direction -- taking a distinctly more "Western cartoon" approach than the anime-inspired art of HuniePop -- actually looks pretty good in the context of the game, and it's enjoyable to play. A full 21-day game only takes about an hour and a half tops, too, so it's easily replayable, and for those with little free time, you can save and come back at another time. You can also continue playing the game in "endless" mode after the 21 days are up, but you can't achieve the better trophies in this way -- you'll need to start again for that.\n\nA lot of people describe the people making consciously "arty" indie games as the punk movement of the games industry, but I have to say, I feel a bit differently; while I have nothing against the art-games movement and indeed encourage it in many cases, it's a very cliquey little part of the industry that has very specific ideas about what is and isn't "acceptable" or "good", particularly with regard to controversial and/or progressive themes.\n\nHuniePot, meanwhile, don't give a damn what people think of them and deliberately set out with their games to be as provocative and offensive to those with delicate sensibilities as possible -- while taking care to ensure that what they produce is also actually technically proficient and enjoyable to play. That sounds pretty punk to me -- and they've set out to achieve what they wanted to twice now. I hope we see more from them in the future.","April 4","true","4.6"," 87 of 143 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","87","143","7","0"

I played it and it was alright, but found it to be kinda dull compared to HuniePop. Also, before you go looking at my total time played, know I have a copy of the game DRM-free that I spent about 12 hours on.\n\nNow yes, HuniePop had its bad moments but it was a likeable dating sim coupled with a Match-3 game that required a lot of strategy in order to make it work, and this game has things to like, like there is no limit to cash and fans, and the game has a decent replay value, but the reward system in my opinion is lacking. All you get are trophies that look like a male organ. Yes, really.\n\nThere is no nudity, and that is kinda a downer for anyone who is tired of watching social justice warriors ragging on sexiness in games, all the sexiness in this game is done for dark humor. Also, none of the characters are the same as they were in HP. I grew attached to the characters in HP, but here they're pretty much throwaways here, especially if a character ends up with an STD, and there are six of them in this game. As much as went into development, the characters have only 3 or 4 lines of dialogue the entire game. I want to know more about the new characters, but they don't even have a last name.\n\nThat's right. If you have a favorite character from HuniePop, be careful with choosing her in this game because she may be completely useless after one trip to a hotel because she has AIDS! Isn't that hilarious?? Oh and Kyu instead of being your sardonic pervert-in-crime, she only cares about lining her pockets with virtual money you have to provide. That is really all that matters to her, is getting money and keeping the cam business alive.\n\nI hope that when the developers do another game, they do one more in the drawing and gaming style of HuniePop. This game is a passable time drain, but unless you want to spend an hour and a half getting carpal tunnel syndrome from doing nothing but clicking like a demon and watching numbers pass you by, expect yourself to not get a high score.\n\nI got it for free, and it was worth every cent.\n\nMy rating is 5.5 out of a possible 10.

Click to pick up money from the camshows (there is no such thing as direct deposit payment accounts in hunieworld, apparently), click to speed up the rate at which the girls work, click to manually pay them their daily wage (although they get paid automatically at midnight anyway so I dont know why you'd bother), click click click click click.\n\nI can't fathom how this took huniepot so long to develop, because the only part of it that doesn't feel phoned in and sloppy is the small filesize of the game, which suggests to me that at least they remembered to compress the audio files. So 1/10 for that, I guess. I've requested a steam refund for this game.","April 4","false","0.1"," 59 of 96 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","59","96","4","0"

Whether you agree or not its very much true.\n\nThis is a Clicker, simulation, strategy type game with some comedy elements thrown in, as a lovely friend had best described to me thank you skull ;). The store page tells a much better story and what you see is what you get, and to me its all done with in reasonable taste and  NOT be taken so seriously, I find it quite funny actually and nothing more, IT IS AFTER ALL JUST a GAME. There is no nude pictures { maybe other than the Achievements you can earn, BUT they are harmless and they look like very nice charming frogs with no legs to me, so again harmless, I feel no shame. :) }  and also nothing of a  violent nature in this game.\n\nThe wardrobe outfits that I have seen so far, look lovely and very tastefully done, after all this is a game about a modeling studio and photo shoots, and models wear lovely designer cloths again no rudeness, its all very appropriate and tasteful in my opinion, you don't even see the girls while doing a game run only their face's, unless you check there stats and add accessories YES some are kinky and some are not .\n\nI wont go into details on game play, to much for me to type. :P\n\nGame is harmless fun and not to be abused in any way shape or form. This game is suitable for both Male and Female players if you like clicker strategy type games, and you should not feel no shame if you have this game, and enjoy playing it, as I very much do. :) We have a right to our opinions,  while I DON'T encourage nor support this type behavior "Escorting" in real life, always stay safe and wise Protection is very important! , it is apart of this game as well.\n\nThe game has 16 achievements, to keep you on your toes and lovely trading cards. The badges are even lovely and tasteful as well. I'll be getting me that badge eventually, and maybe even the foil if its a nice 1 too.  :)\n\nI wont comment on the price as I have purchased 3 copy's as 1 was  for a great trade that was offered to me.\n\nAll I will say is that I am enjoying this game, I'm having my giggle. I'm over looking what others may perceive as perverted and disgraceful regarding this game, there are far worse games out there than this 1, LIKE say Sakura Clicker Free to play { which is not my cup of tea }, and there are plenty games with violence and killing people in them, they just pixels and nothing more. So please don't take these games so seriously, and behave appropriately in the real world as well ok\n\nPLEASE don't judge me over this game. I feel no shame its just that a game. I'm running a modeling agency with in the game and the main focus is to get as many fans as possible with in 21 days, using different Technics to acquire the cash and fans, while having  fun and a giggle. Again this game is not to Everyone's tastes OK","April 10","true","58.0"," 46 of 73 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","46","73","6","9"

Very simplistic clicker that constantly rushes you with extremely boring and tedious micromanagement. You constantly have to re-send your camgirls to do stuff manually. Buying cigarettes for the 500th time is not fun, it's boring. You can't set any schedules for them, everything is done manually and repeatedly. So every few seconds requires input that you already did hundreds of times. And the game is fastpaced and rushed. One playthrough will last around 2 hours. You can replay for a highscore but there are no more gameplay elements other than the ones you find in the first few minutes.

It lacks a gallery and doesn't have any hentai/nudity so if you're here for that you'll be disappointed. Regarding the art style it's pretty hit or miss either you like it or you don't; I don't. The gameplay is repetitive as all you're basically doing is clicking since that's the only way to manage your girls which gets boring after awhile. Overall on a scale of 1-10 i'd give the game a 3.5 as it just doesn't suite my taste, but that might not be the case for you so if you're into management sims and like the cast in the previous Hunie series then knock yourself out. Sadly I only see myself playing this further to unlock the steam cards and get the trophies, it's gameplay is incredibly boring, art style doesn't suit my taste, and no gallery. Wait until it's cheaper before you buy if you decide to get it.\n\nEdit: After giving it some more playtime I could honestly say it's not as bad as I originally thought. Before I stated that there isn't a gallery, but there is a unlockable picture you can get for the girls after you unlock all of their outfits and hairstyles which might give you more drive to play the game (it did for me at least). I still feel like the core mechanics to the game are bad (imo) but I have a little more drive to play it now.","April 4","false","15.9"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","24","38","0","0"

The bejeweled-esque and relatively deep gameplay from the last game from this developer has been replaced with a resource-management game that rewards basic min-max logic. Two playthroughs and you've both got the basic strategy and probably nabbed all but the highest ranking in the game. Although the price tag isn't bad for the amount of content, the only real distinguisting feature it's got going for it is the racy content, and even that's mostly separate from the game experience itself (you can unlock cartoon-y cheesecake shots, one per girl, after earning coins from playthroughs).

I will probably never play this ever again and uninstall it.\n\nAlso don't let my play time fool you, I probably have only about 5 or 6 actual hours of game play to complete it (I left it on in the background and forgot about it because it got THAT boring)\n\nThe fact that you get the "special photos" of the girls in the loading screen is bad enough but theres nothing in the game to keep me going, now new levels, areas, like take some tips from diner dash which I've been playing for 10 years and still love to this day.\n\nI'm so unsatisfied and unfufiled in this game.

It takes place in the same universe, seemingly two years after the events of HuniePop but the similarities end there. HunieCam Studio is a clicker/time management/sim type while calling it a "clicker" game doesn't really do it justice. You manage a cam studio corporation where your goal is to get as many fans as you can using different girls and fetishes.\nPros:\n-Great interface\n-Easy to play once you figure out the learning curve\n-Obtainable achievements\n-Pleasant soundtrack\n-Great voice actors (though you don't hear much of them)\n-Many different STD's and effects brought to the girls from them\n-Many more fetishes that I didn't really think about until this game (so thank you for that)\n-Challenging gameplay\n-"Rock Hard Mode" where you can up the difficulty if you find it too easy towards the end (thank you)\nCons:\n-I found myself to be a bit bored the last couple playthroughs, just trying to get enough tokens for the last achievements, watching YouTube while I just clicked and moved girls around\n-After you've obtained all the achievements that's really it for the game.

Managing consists of dragging character avatars to buildings you want them to use, and waiting or holding your mouse button on the building to speed up the process. You have 21 days to achieve the highest score possible, after that you can continue playing, but to be honest I don't see the reason to do so, other than learning a bit more about the game so you can make a bigger score on your next playthrough.\n\nAfter 21 days your "accomplishments" are evaluated, and you receive tokens which can be used to unlock hairstyles and clothing. As far as I know, they don't serve any other purpose than cosmetic.\n\nOverall I think it's a fun game, which I definitely recommend.","April 9","true","4.0"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","28","49","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaibutsu/recommended/426000/","kaibutsu","Viscera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaibutsu/","507 products in account","First up, if you're hoping for an involved camgirl management simulation (unlikely as that is), you're probably going to be disappointed. I can't say how realistic it is, but I think it's safe to assume that real management of such a service involves much less touching buildings repeatedly.\n\nLike the devs previous effort, Huniepop, it's pretty much a casual game. And like that game simulated dating with a match 3 puzzle, this one simulates saving time while doing a photoshoot, a cam show, shopping, resting and everything else by clicking on the respective building. It does have much more depth than a clicker game though (which, admittedly, doesn't say much). Strictly speaking, that element is actually optional, is it only slightly accelerates things, not makes them happen in the first place.\n\nThe point of the game is to get as many fans as possible in 3 weeks via photoshoots. Of course, the girls don't do that for free, so you also have them do camshows to collect money. That money is not just used to pay your employees, but to also buy improvements to hire more girls, let more of them work in the same building, get more money from shows, more fans from shootings and other stuff. Lastly, it's also necessary for advertisement, which is available later in the game.\n\nFor the most part, the game boils down to a good balance between making money and attracting fans. If you neglect the former, you can't pay your camgirls and buy improvements. If you neglect the latter, you get a terrible end result. And don't get all that much money either, as more fans also mean more money.\n\nNot all fans are the same, though. Everyone prefers a different fetish and the popularity of every girl  (and the money they bring you) depends on how whether they cater to them. It's not so important if you only have one, but when you hire more, “shared fetishes” can help the popularity of others. Every girl caters to two fetishes (like “Glasses”, “Asian”, “Fit”...) on her own, but with certain items, she can acquire more (like “Furry”, “Anal”, “Squirting”...).\n\nYour employees have more needs than money, though. Many smoke and drink and you actually have to take care of their stock of alcohol and cigarettes yourself by sending them out to buy more. They also acquire stress and have to relax at a spa to be ready for more work.\n\nYou can also acquire items (if you buy an inventory). It's free, oddly enough, but you have to send a girl to fetch it. The selection is always random, but no item is useless. Some are temporary buffs (like, decreasing the time they need for anything), while others have permanent effects (like attracting more fans with a specific fetish or cutting their wages in half), as long as the respective girl has the item equipped.\n\nFurthermore, all girls have two skills, which respectively raises the amount of money they make and the amount of fans they attract. They're easy enough to improve, but higher skills also mean that they demand more money, so it comes with a cost (literally).\n\nLastly, after some time you can sent your girls out for a “private show” with a customer. This is much faster than a camshow, but brings the risk of STDs, some are curable, others are permanent. You can get single-use condoms to somewhat prevent it, though.\n\nAfter three weeks, the game is over and you get an evaluation. As mentioned, the single most important statistic is the amount of fans you acquired and you get a... questionably designed trophy depending on your performance (starting at 5000 fans). You also get tokens, for which you can buy alternate clothes and hairstyles for all girls you hired at least once (no matter what save file). If you wish to keep playing, you can just load your finished game again for an endless mode.\n\nIt's pretty clear this game is meant to be played many times in short attempts, instead of a single long game. And it works pretty well like that. On it's own, it's pretty easy and there's not much you can explicitly do wrong. But with the time limit and the demand to get a rather high amount of fans in only 21 days, it's actually pretty challenging. Like that, it's also easier to see when you did badly than in a longer game, where you might not even be aware of your mistakes until very late. On the other hand, you can't really lose and even when you're below the minimum rating, you get some tokens, so it's not too discouraging.\n\nOne thing that got a very mixed reception since the first pictures came out is the art style. It's very different from the standard anime-style of Huniepop. Personally, I'm rather fond of it. However, unlike HP, it's very suited for an erotic game and indeed, Huniecam does not have the explicit elements of it's predecessor. So, your enjoyment of this game might decrease depending on... what exactly you used Huniepop for.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty enjoyable, but not very big game, whose appeal lies in the unusual theme and the challenge of the time pressure. Considering that, the asking price is pretty fair. If you want an epic game where you build the ultimate camgirl empire, it's probably not the right game for you. But if you can find enjoyment in a rather tricky management sim and don't mind clicker game elements, it might be worth considering.","April 4","true","2.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","18","30","0","0"

Which may help with sales if they had nudity(rather then the softcore you get here)\nAnd I personally love resource management games and time management games, guess I'm just weird like that. Anyways,\nHuniecam, gives you a decent tutorial, to bad it always restarts with each new game, and yes you can skip the whole tutorial, however it's a pain in the bum. I've ran through this game twice now, and I hit 73k fans( would have got more if the time didnt strike 12am right as i clicked the damn promos!) So without farther babbling heres some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nSomewhat challenging\nArtstyle I actually like it for some reason, it works for this format of game\nSmall hints to the backstory of evens in Huniepop\nUnlockables to you have to kinda replay it or get super lucky to get a ♥♥♥♥ ton of gold coins\n\nCons:\nNo pause feature so you can kinda plan your strategy\nYour hand will get tired from contantly moving your mouse( not your other hand this time guys...sorry)\nThe luxury items(cigs and booze) seem to go rather quick if you are playing rather aggressively\n\nAll in all I give this game a 10/10 for the management sim it is, and a 9/10 overall seeing as it's a bold risk for them to make a game like this and not do fanservice....good job devs!

It's all just a super hectic mess, pretty much the only fun thing was Kyu(?) complaining about your performance, but she's barely there after the tutorials. The game is just watching numbers, raising numbers and clicking numbers for 2 hours... on a really strict timer. Maybe by roleplaying you can get something interesting out of it, but there's very little enjoyable that's actually in the game. Would've rather seen HuniePop 2 or, alternatively, a real management game than this thing.\n\nCan't recommend, especially if you're looking for something that's similar to HuniePop. About the only positive things I can say about this is that the game is really cheap (so you don't feel too bad about having thrown away your money like that) and that there's some of the HuniePop cast there (yay nostalgia?).","April 23","false","1.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoomKat/recommended/426000/","DoomKat","DoomKat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoomKat/","305 products in account","It's a fun little management game.  I'm not a huge fan of the artwork, but I figure that the darker themes, like girls getting STDs and coking up a girl so she can run errands faster, would be a lot weirder if they weren't all drawn to be so cartoony.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game has to be the kink system.  There seem to be 12 kinks, 6 that are girl specific, and 6 that are based on items you give the girls.  I have two problems with this system.\nThe first is that the 6 item based kinks are equally available to all girls.  If you give a plug to a girl, they do anal now.  There aren't girls who are more interested or less interested in anal, it's based entirely on whether you give them an item, and that bothers me a bit.\nThe second is that since every girl is supposed to fit 2 kinks and only 2 kinks, and they didn't want any kink to be more accessable than any other kink, there are always only 3 girls with any given kink.  That means that you have 3 ebony girls, 3 latina girls, and 3 asian girls, period.  So the other 9 girls are white, and there's no kink for white girls.\nIt also leads into some strange issues where, say, Nikki is a white teen with large breasts and glasses, her kinks are 'glasses' and 'huge ♥♥♥♥', her age doesn't factor into the equation, even though she's a teen, because there are already three other teens.  There are three 'MILF's in the game, who all have large breasts, but none of them fit the 'huge ♥♥♥♥' fetish, one fits 'tattoos' one fits 'glasses' and one is listed as 'chubby' even though she has a tiny waist.\nThis could have been easily fixed if they'd made kinks slightly less valuable, but given each girl 1 age based kink, 1 race based kink, and then 2 other kinks.  Then you could have a 'pale' 'teen' with 'glasses' and 'huge ♥♥♥♥'  or a 'Tan' 'fit' 'MILF' with 'Tattoos.'\n\nOther than that small annoyance, the game is pretty fun for a time killer.  I like the idea, maybe there'll be some updates later to fill it out some more.  6/10","April 10","true","93.4"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","20","34","4","1"

The interaction with the girls, the puzzle, the humor, the messages the everything. It was just all so good. The developers over their knew what they were doing. Combine twoo popular genres add humor and then boom, great game. The dating Simulator portion of the game was funny and very enjoyable. Each girl had their own unique personality and when you talked you had to keep this in mind. But when you would ask them out the dates you’re put into a candy crush type puzzle. This was a whole different approach to a standard dating sim. Instead of just clicking things to talk to girls and buy them gifts and yada yada yada you also got to do a very interesting puzzle and thus a great game became. It had some much content and it was so addicting it was nuts. I myself spent 192 hours on the game and I know many who spent more,  this game was ♥♥♥♥ing good. Then they made Hunie Cam.\nHunie cam was supposed to be a spin off game to huniepop. As the developers put it huniepop is mario and HunieCam is mario tennis. In the months leading up to the game most people were so pumped for something new and fresh and then the game finally came out. So here’s what they did right in huniecam studio. Number 1 change in content. Huniepop was good but huniepop 2 was not the best option for the next game it would’ve be too similar and too much of the same thing so instead of a dating sim combined with candy crush it was a management sim and this was a good thing. A new gameplay style leads to more variety to keep fans playing. It was neat. Number 2 New girls. I can’t think of 1 one girl in huniepop i didn’t love. Each girl was unique and interesting to talk to so when i found out that there was going to be 18 girls i was super ♥♥♥♥ing pumped. Being able to interact with all the new girls and learning their personalities sounded ♥♥♥♥ing great and i was hyped my friends were hyped my dog was hyped everyone was hyped it was going to so cool. But it wasn’t , here's what they did wrong. Number 1 Game hours. Uhh the game is short, after about 7 hours or so it is just so repetitive and there is no point in playing anymore. You may be saying “ Well you try and get a high score and that takes time “ and to you i say you’re right but getting the highscore is unsatisfying. When you get that high score you exclaim yes or yeah i did it but then what, the game just ends there is nothing left to do. You could try to beat your score but it’s just boring and repetitive.\nNumber 2 Interaction. Everybody loved talking to the girls in huniepop it was so entertaining to get to know them and the dialogue was amusing. I’m not saying i wanted huniepop 2, right now at least, But i still wanted to talk and interact with the girls especially since there were so many new ones. i was ♥♥♥♥ing pumped to learn their personalities and talk to them but instead you get no interaction with the girls at all. They do say short little things when you tell them to do stuff like “Sure thing” or “ okey Dokey” or when they finish something and things of the sort but you never get to talk to them 1 on 1 and i believe that was one of the things that gave huniepop so much of it’s charm. Anyways you can’t talk to the girls and that’s lame. Number 3 Content. Listen up, based off of pre alpha trailers to release trailers huniepop took 7 months to make and huniecam took 9. Either game could have taken long but i’m going off of that to judge it. Huniepop as previously said has so much stuff to do it’s crazy. So i expected huniecam to be the same, especially since it took longer to make. Huniecam took 2 months longer to make than huniepop so i thought that there would at least be 20 hours of fun enjoyable gameplay but there's not. It’s just boring. I found myself not wanting to play anymore because it wasn’t fun, not because I don’t like management simulators but because it’s the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing over and over and over again. You may argue that this is the same in huniepop “ oh it’s just the same puzzle over and over” and I say you're wrong. Huniepop Has date gifts and date gifts totally affect the way you go about the date. If you’re using the infamous pearl neclace set up you go for the most sentiment, but there's also the ring which is based on power tokens so now instead of going for sentiment you totally change how you go about the date and instead go for power token, it’s completely different and that's why huniepop was so much better it had date gifts. I originally thought that after 1 run in huniecam you would unlock something similar to date gifts to change the way you go about the next run through, but all they added was wardrobe tokens which do absolutely nothing except new outfits, they could have made those outfits do something special but they didn’t and all those reasons is why i rate huniecam a 4.5/10. It’s fun for a bit but after that it’s just lame and boring.\n","April 8","false","16.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Took two runs to really get the hang of, which I appreciate, because if I had gotten that dope ♥♥♥ Diamond ♥♥♥♥ after just one run, that would've been very disappointing. If you're the kind of gamer who's addicted to collecting all of a game's trading cards, achievements, and other community rewards, this game has a lot of replay value. I've been playing this game all day and, as one of those types of gamers, I have absolutely no regrets spending a few dollars ($15) to pick up the trading cards in the market to complete the badge.\n\nI've also enjoyed going through and grabbing as many achievements as I can each run and unlocking outfits and hairstyles in the wardrobe. Recruiting and using the girl you just customized with the tokens you got from your last run is a nice feeling.\n\nThe game is a little challenging at first, but pretty easy once you get the hang of it (as long as your girls synergize well with their accessories and fetishes). It does get very repetitive, though. The music is the same two tracks for day and nighttime and the background isn't very engaging (besides the mandatory dragging girls on buildings). The longer I sat down to play, the longer it seemed to take. I recommend taking breaks to grab something to eat or stretch, because playing this game for a long period of time actually makes you feel like you're managing a bunch of cam girls, and it is taxing. Oddly enough, though, after playing this game literally all day, I feel a bit of attachment to the girls I've had the most success with, and, even if they're not very good, I still feel the need to use them and make them the best little cam girl they can possibly be (Kyanna is best girl).\n\nOverall, I've enjoyed playing HunieCam, and after I've collected all the achievements, outfits, and hairstyles, I'll be setting my sights on HuniePop. The game is worth it's price tag, and if they update it in the furture with more girls, background music, achievements, etc., I'll definitely come back to it.","April 16","true","13.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Next The Robert Crumb award (Robert Crumb, the famous SF Bay Area underground  comics artist from the early 70's who made Zap comics famous with Tales of Mr. Natural. He made sarcastic, sexy comics that poked fun at, and portrayed the lives of hippies who were also his readership.

There is no actual nudity. The artwork isn't bad, it's just not great like before. The game play is repititious, but that is typical of it's type (time management). My best moments in the game were getting the achievements. The voice acting and scripting falls short. I turned off the sound before the first playthrough was over.\nGenerally I felt like too many shortcuts were taken to cut costs in developement.\nI am recommending this game, but advise you buy it on sale if you're a cheapski like me.\nI want to let the dev's know, I'm giving them another chance.

The tutorials are extremely helpful as well. It's a very easy game to learn in general, as far as what the goal is and how to achieve it.\n\nUnlike a lot of Sim esque games, HunieCam has a time limit, which means there is an end game, which also makes it hard to get OP and bored.  You're not going to end up just watching the numbers go up without challenge.\n\nAs adult themed as this game is, it really is more innocent than you'd think. If you're squeamish about sexual themes and swear words, then maybe it's not for you, but there's actually very little as far as NSFW goes. Really the most NSFW thing you'll see is a butt plug, and it's just as an item, not even in use. Unless you're afraid of swearing. The pink haired girl who shows you how to play the game does a lot of that. (Especially if you don't do well. My feelings.)\n\nThe art style is fairly ironic. It has a cute, innocent look to it which is funny in comparison to the actual idea of the game.\n\nOver all a fun and fairly addicting time killer, takes about 2 hours to play through once.

Huniepot is setting high expectations.\nThe lack of nudity isn't a huge deal, but that as an end goal in Huniepop made it a little more worthwhile, and gave you something to look forward too. Regardless this is a fun game, and inexpensive, so play Huniecam!","April 4","true","9.1"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","21","39","3","0"

I personally found this to be a good format. The short length of each play through allowed me to work on my score without investing obscene amounts of time.

It is definitely not somethingI would recommend for children or those who are offended by cheap sexual humour.\n\nHunieCam Studio comes trading cards, achievements and has no paygates or microtransactions.

I have a good sense of humor, I like games of this nature, and I liked HuniePop, enough to where I was looking forward to seeing what would come next.\n\nThis is an OK enough successor, although it's not really much to write home about. It has some addicting game play, but nothing so astronomically terrific that it's really worth the full price of admission. If it were half the price, it'd be perfect, but it's not really worth seven dollars. It'd probably help if there was some sort of bonus for playing past the first 21 days, like maybe a checkup after the 100th day. There's really no benefit to continuing your game play and in order to unlock anything you have to start up a new game. This was something the original game did, but this didn't seem so much of a let down with the first game. It does here.\n\nThis is OK but I know that the creators can do better, which is probably why this is all so disappointing. It's fine as a time waster, but this is one game that's likely to get forgotten pretty easily in your game library. If you can get this for three dollars or less, go for it.

Once you've played it for about 15-20 minutes, you'll have experienced everthing the game has to offer. People have been comparing it to a clicker game, but HCS lacks the hamster wheel progression chase of those games. The gameplay consists of you dragging girls' faces onto buildings until you hit the arbitrary 21 day deadline. At which point you're awarded a trophy and some costume tokens, and then you start over. That's it. You can keep going beyond the deadline if you really want to, but there's nothing to earn or unlock once you pass it.\n\nI don't know if the devs plan on adding content to the game (seems unlikely), but in its current state HunieCam Studio is a waste of both time and money.

They usually have great humor and style to their games. I understand that after creating the masterpiece that is HuniePop it would be difficult to live up to expectations on a 2nd game, but to be honest HunieCam is more disappointing than it should be. After only about 2 hours of play-time I've seen 100% of what the game has to offer. There isn't much replayability, there's no "dating sim" aspect like there was for HuniePop, and the gameplay really is just clicker/mindless activities. I can get past the artstyle and accept that as their artistic decision, but all around the game kind of just falls flat. I hope that this doesn't impact on HuniePot's future because I want the studio to continue to make games. I just hope they go back to "dating-sim" type of games with different mechanics incorperated similar to HuniePop.

Instead of a bejeweled-like dating sim, HunieCam Studio is a business management game where you're in charge of a group of cam girls. Each girl comes with 2 fetishes to please the fans, but she can have up to 5 depending on what items you give her. The object of the game is to get as many fans as possible, so investing in promotions is a must. There's no right or wrong way of playing this game, but after some trial and error, you'll find a strategy that works best for you.\n\nHunieCam Studio vs. HuniePopSo it's no surprise that HCS and HP are two totally different games, but that doesn't mean they can't be compared. Although HCS is not a sequel by any means, it still has some of the HuniePop girls, along with some fresh new faces. These are some other things that separate HunieCam Studio from its predecessor:\nNo Nudity- That's right, there is absolutely no nudity of any kind. The devs weren't joking when they said "it does not make great fapping material."\nNo Character Development- Without a story or dialogue, this shouldn't come as a surprise. There are brief descriptions about each girl, but nothing in-depth. And sadly, you won't be able to interact with the girls, they're just there for work. Honestly though, being the type of game that it is, it doesn't need anything too in-depth since your only goal is to get as many fans as possible; anything more than that would be unnecessary and defeat the purpose of time management.\nNew Girls- What I loved about HCS was the addition of some fresh faces! Sure, we know very little about them, but that just means that the devs will have more opportunities to work with their personalities, interests, etc. in upcoming projects. *fingers crossed*\nNew Challenges- Aside from having to come up with new strategies to maximize your fan count, we're also introduced to the struggle of dealing with STDs. Yep, your cam girls can contract STDs if you send them to the motel without protection (oh, the sad reality of it all!). Each STD will prevent you from doing something - like "Audrey can't do this because of...", or if any of your girls are unfortunate enough to contract AIDS, then they won't be able to do anything. And for all you pros out there, Rock Hard Mode will present a real challenge and put those fingerblasting skills to the test! ;)\nReplayability- Unlike its predecessor, HCS offers hours of replayability. Because it's so fast pace, it doesn't take too long to go through the 21 days, which will make starting a new game feel less boring or tedious. You can go back time and time again to try to beat your old score and keep your fingerblasting skills on point.\nFinal ThoughtsLet's face it, HunieCam Studio isn't for everyone, especially not for those expecting it to be a sequel/successor to HuniePop. This game still has a lot to offer, and it's just unfair to write it off because it's not "HuniePop 2." In my opinion, I think HuniePot did a great job with this game; it was definitely a nice addition to the management category. HuniePot has sold me on their games and I'm now invested in the characters, so I'm greatly looking forward to what they come up with in the future.","May 17","true","34.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zdrijne/recommended/426000/","zdrijne","Rounds should be 30 seconds...","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zdrijne/","203 products in account","-Game takes less than two hours to beat (there's literally a timer on it). After that, you just get asked if you wanna do exactly same thing from scratch and beat your own record. So much goes for replayability. Ofcourse, after first playthrough, you'll maybe have some ideas how you can do business better. But as long as spamming leftclicks is not your favourite thing in life, you'll probably give it a second thought.\n\n-Game lacks layers. HuniePop used to suddenly introduce you to new characters, some of which not only had very unique flavors, but some also asked questions from different hemisphere than the others. In HunieCam Studio, you would expect at least a new town with slightly different set of rules, after a first playthrough, so you'd have to adapt. But no, you're just being asked to do exactly same thing (the clicking) again.\n\n-Not to mention, learning about the characters was already the thing that made HuniePop great. I mean, they threw the winning formula out of the window, which is the worst part about whole transition. You have to deal with (seemingly) lifeless $luts, which may be a fitting outlook when your goal in life is to become a godfather of cyber-PIMPing. But in a game like this, it's probably not worth it to sacrifice tons of satisfaction for a bit of realism.\n\n-Game still has some good in it: pretty decent amount of content, fine learning curve, nice amount of hyperbolization and humor.\n\nSome people will think this game is good, probably if they like min-maxing or setting records, or if they're just in love with LMB. Other will think this game is terrible, cause they won't like spamming clicks for diks. I think it's alright, considering the cost was only 2$ in my location.\n\nI still will put a thumbs up on the game. Not because it wasn't a big letdown after HuniePop (it was), and not even because the game is fine in vacuum (although it is IMO). The main reason why I write this review is because I like authors and want them to get back on track and release another bang on game, so I can buy it and play it. Please, go back to drawing board and make a game which contains lots of RELATIONSHIPS with GIRLS and SEXUALITY.","April 4","true","6.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

To enjoy this, you do have to seperate it from Huniepop- no, you can't focus on your camgirl's personalities, because they aren't your girlfriends. They're girls who work for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kankrivantizzle/recommended/426000/","kankrivantizzle","Kankri Vantas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kankrivantizzle/","41 products in account","HunieCam Studio is a game about recruiting and hiring camgirls for a studio that youre operating under. Gameplay mostly consists of strategizing and buying upgrades to get as many fans as you possibly can within 21 days. At certain milestones, you can get a ♥♥♥♥♥ themed trophy for your troubles, and at the end of each playthrough, you get tokens to buy new outfits and hairstyles for the girls in your hare-ahem, i mean, ensemble.\n\nAt first, the game is extremely easy and almost seems like it plays itself. However, the deadline comes before you realize, and it gets as hard as that diamond trophy you can get at 100k fans.\n\nThe game features characters from its predecessor, HuniePop (albeit probably not canon) and a set of new, original characters to the work in a quirky, cartoonish art style accompanied by all of the girls having heart-shaped pupils. The plot and tutorials are fully voiced, and all of the girls contain various lines they will say if you perform certain actions that involve them. The story itself is pretty humorous and both breaks the fourth wall and bashes itself a couple times. However, if you are in the camgirl or camboy business, some of the humor might offend you, so be forewarned of the heavilly offensive satire in this game.\n\nThe gameplay itself can get a bit repetitive at times, of course; you have one main goal and you get there. However, the predecessor of this game, HuniePop, was really no different. You solve puzzles, buy upgrades, solve harder puzzles, win, the end. Neither game has very "deep" gameplay. It isn't meant to. It's meant to be a quick paced management/clicker game that you strive to beat your high score with. You hire girls, make them get more fans, make them do shows to earn money, and use that money to invest in upgrades to make your life slightly easier. Pretty much rinse and repeat, albeit with other gameplay features mixed in that I won't bother listing here. Simple concept. However, it's the games with a simple concept that add that replayability, and this is one of those games worth coming back to time and time again, even if you take a large break in between.\n\nMany of the negative reviews on here either cite the art style, the lack of depth in gameplay, the lack of nudity, or the "unfairness" of a certain STD you can catch from sending your girls out to the nearby sleazy motel: AIDS.\n\nThe art style is different and quirky, but definitely shouldn't be criticized. It is high quality art; just because it's not "desu desu anime desu" shouldn't dissuade you from playing.\n\nAs I've stated before, the gameplay isn't designed to be deep. It is a simple game that is meant to be played more than once to beat your own high score. In addition, there was already an update adding a super hard mode; who knows what is in store in the future?\n\nThere is no explicit nudity in this game. There are slightly lewd cutscenes and outfits, but that's about it. However this isn't a bad thing; not everyone constantly wants ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in their faces, and you can stream this game. However, if you're in it for the nudity, move on to another game.\n\nIf one of your girls catches AIDS, they can no longer do anything. This sucks, yeah. However, you can always just switch out places with another girl. It's a welcome risk to me, and it encourages players to think twice before spamming the motel for easy money.\n\nIn conclusion, while not a game for everyone, I think HunieCam studio is pretty fun and humorous, and adds in a classic game style of "try to best yourself". if you don't take games way too seriously (and why would you, it's a GAME), you're in for a good amount of fun.\n\nIn my opinion, a solid 8.5/10, and definitely worth the low price tag.\n\nP.S. Sorry for the lengthy review, but with some of the bad ones on here, I figure it's probably needed to elaborate.","April 11","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't stop.\n\nHunieCam Studio is a fun game, sure it seem's boring after the first 2 hours but it seems challenging at the same time, trying to beat your own high score, collect all the outfits for the girls, get over 100K fans. The game provides a ton of re-play value that some people just ignore entirely.\nIt's not HuniePop. HunieCam Studio is a game of its own. It brings back characters from HuniePop  like Nikki, Tiffany, Jessie, ect. But adds a ton of new girls. In total HunieCam has 18 girls and it provides a bunch of oprotunites to play with. Like having an entire all MILF Harem or no girls that smoke but drink constantly Harem. It is a fun game. The art style is cute, the voice actors are great and the game mechanics are easy to understand. So I'd recomend HunieCam Studio to fans of HuniePop but are into slower paced games like tycoon games. 8.5/10 <3 I love this game.","April 9","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics are deep and the game itself is quite challenging. Similar to HuniePop the mechanics can get repetative but the humour and your own drive to complete the achievments are the big driving factor for playing this game. 100% this game can be a real challenge if you don't really focus. Some of the achievements are simply grindable and others are truly challenging and interesting. This game is not for someone who doesn't think of achievements as part of a game.\n\nOverall, the game is worth $7.00USD IF you want to get all the achievements and appreciate some of the more lewd humour the game has to offer. If you liked HuniePop for anything but the lewd pics, you'll probably find some value in playing HunieCam Studo.","April 5","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nrspringfield/recommended/426000/","nrspringfield","NrSpringfield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nrspringfield/","493 products in account","Pretty fun game, it's both a clicker and sort of a business sim game. The first two-three girls will determine who your primary consumers will be, along with whatever fetish devices you decide to have them use (I didn't even know cake farting was an actual thing).  After that, you have to juggle employees between training, free promotional pics, resupplying, and working, as well as upgrading your business and buying ads on websites.  I'd recommend only using the escort service if you really need upgrades and/or are in the deep red.  However, if you keep your head on and plan your moves ahead, you won't need to worry if you dip into a little debt, since you'll pay it off in an hour or two (in-game time, of course).\n\nOnly complaints I have right now is that:\n\nI don't favor the art style they did for this game over HuniePop (opinions)\n\nThe only goal in the game is to get as many fans as possible.  Not even "Achieve this much revenue".  Some of the    achievements sort of address this, such as "Get to Bronze without using any accessories". "Complete the game without falling below a certain amount of this thing", etc., but I digress. I thought the game would've been more challenging, if it had more mandatory goals.\n\nIt won't even take you two hours to beat the game.  At the time of making this review, I've logged 3.5 hours, according to Steam, and I've beaten the game two times already.  If I had to compare it to something, it'd be like "Wow, this movie about [your favorite game/book] is fantastic, they got decent actors and stuck to the source as much as they could.  Too bad it was only 20 minutes long".  My example may be a little unfair, but I think you get the gist, it's a nice but short game. Real short.\n\nNot a lot of replay value.  This point is the embodiment of the previous two points.  Sure, you can unlock clothes and hairstyle for the girls, but, as you can see in the screenie link, I didn't get ♥♥♥♥ for the first run, but I did get the golden weenie on the second try.  I got enough points from both runs that I could max out three-four girls.  If I keep getting just gold, I imagine I could unlock everything within a short amount of time.  And that's if you're the type of person that gives a damn about cosmetics.  Speaking of which, that's the only thing that you can unlock.  The game has nice little loading screens here and there of the girls doing cam-girl things, but there's no gallery like in Huniepop. If they had that, I'd have been okay with replaying the same thing again and again for it.   Maybe even some development art, I'm a real sucker for that.  Anything besides just having clothes/hair to strive for.\n\nThat said, despite everything negative that I've said about the game, I feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I would very much like to see the developers add more content to the game in the future, either for free, or for a nominal fee.  Preferably the first few/all of them for free, the game is a little barebones, even for the price of getting a fast food meal.  It's a great time waster, and I'd recommend picking it up, either on sale or for regular price.\n\n\nI will reiterate though, I got the Gold ♥♥♥♥ on my second try, after getting my feet wet with the first.   So either the game is easy, or I am the cam, I am the one who faps.  Not really, it'd have been more impressive, albeit sadder, if I got Platinum or even Diamond.\n\n","April 5","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Essentially, this game is a management/tycoon game, but with less simplicity for newbies.\n\nBreaking it DownFrom all of the "online nudity videos" (I am phrasing it this way to avoid being censored.) you may have watched in the past, you should know that all videos have their own tags. I won't list any due to Valve's censorship, but that's how this game is organized.\n----------\nWhen you first begin, you start off with a potential star of online nudity. To get up off of the ground, you must make fans. The more fans you make, the more popular your camera shoots become. With that being, you haul in more cash. Cash you get to keep your business running and to become stronger.\n----------\nYour fans have a variety of different fetishes. Fetishes that are provided from each individual model. With those fetishes, that will determine how much cash you receive.\n\nTL;DR Just think of the game as Rollercoaster Tycoon, but with a bit of sexuality added into it.\n\nPros- Great voice acting\n- Nice soundtrack\n- Very realistic (logic-wise)\n- Sexy women ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n- Sexy women with boobs ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nCons- STDs are a thing in HunieCam (not really a con, but just something you gotta watch out for)\n\nOverall Rating8.5/10\n\nAdditional NotesCake farts is the best fetish by far ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","May 10","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics are deep and the game itself is quite challenging. Similar to HuniePop the mechanics can get repetative but the humour and your own drive to complete the achievments are the big driving factor for playing this game. 100% this game can be a real challenge if you don't really focus. Some of the achievements are simply grindable and others are truly challenging and interesting. This game is not for someone who doesn't think of achievements as part of a game.\n\nOverall, the game is worth $7.00USD IF you want to get all the achievements and appreciate some of the more lewd humour the game has to offer. If you liked HuniePop for anything but the lewd pics, you'll probably find some value in playing HunieCam Studo.","April 5","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nrspringfield/recommended/426000/","nrspringfield","NrSpringfield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nrspringfield/","493 products in account","Pretty fun game, it's both a clicker and sort of a business sim game. The first two-three girls will determine who your primary consumers will be, along with whatever fetish devices you decide to have them use (I didn't even know cake farting was an actual thing).  After that, you have to juggle employees between training, free promotional pics, resupplying, and working, as well as upgrading your business and buying ads on websites.  I'd recommend only using the escort service if you really need upgrades and/or are in the deep red.  However, if you keep your head on and plan your moves ahead, you won't need to worry if you dip into a little debt, since you'll pay it off in an hour or two (in-game time, of course).\n\nOnly complaints I have right now is that:\n\nI don't favor the art style they did for this game over HuniePop (opinions)\n\nThe only goal in the game is to get as many fans as possible.  Not even "Achieve this much revenue".  Some of the    achievements sort of address this, such as "Get to Bronze without using any accessories". "Complete the game without falling below a certain amount of this thing", etc., but I digress. I thought the game would've been more challenging, if it had more mandatory goals.\n\nIt won't even take you two hours to beat the game.  At the time of making this review, I've logged 3.5 hours, according to Steam, and I've beaten the game two times already.  If I had to compare it to something, it'd be like "Wow, this movie about [your favorite game/book] is fantastic, they got decent actors and stuck to the source as much as they could.  Too bad it was only 20 minutes long".  My example may be a little unfair, but I think you get the gist, it's a nice but short game. Real short.\n\nNot a lot of replay value.  This point is the embodiment of the previous two points.  Sure, you can unlock clothes and hairstyle for the girls, but, as you can see in the screenie link, I didn't get ♥♥♥♥ for the first run, but I did get the golden weenie on the second try.  I got enough points from both runs that I could max out three-four girls.  If I keep getting just gold, I imagine I could unlock everything within a short amount of time.  And that's if you're the type of person that gives a damn about cosmetics.  Speaking of which, that's the only thing that you can unlock.  The game has nice little loading screens here and there of the girls doing cam-girl things, but there's no gallery like in Huniepop. If they had that, I'd have been okay with replaying the same thing again and again for it.   Maybe even some development art, I'm a real sucker for that.  Anything besides just having clothes/hair to strive for.\n\nThat said, despite everything negative that I've said about the game, I feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I would very much like to see the developers add more content to the game in the future, either for free, or for a nominal fee.  Preferably the first few/all of them for free, the game is a little barebones, even for the price of getting a fast food meal.  It's a great time waster, and I'd recommend picking it up, either on sale or for regular price.\n\n\nI will reiterate though, I got the Gold ♥♥♥♥ on my second try, after getting my feet wet with the first.   So either the game is easy, or I am the cam, I am the one who faps.  Not really, it'd have been more impressive, albeit sadder, if I got Platinum or even Diamond.\n\n","April 5","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay mostly consists of strategizing and buying upgrades to get as many fans as you possibly can within 21 days. At certain milestones, you can get a ♥♥♥♥♥ themed trophy for your troubles, and at the end of each playthrough, you get tokens to buy new outfits and hairstyles for the girls in your hare-ahem, i mean, ensemble.\n\nAt first, the game is extremely easy and almost seems like it plays itself. However, the deadline comes before you realize, and it gets as hard as that diamond trophy you can get at 100k fans.\n\nThe game features characters from its predecessor, HuniePop (albeit probably not canon) and a set of new, original characters to the work in a quirky, cartoonish art style accompanied by all of the girls having heart-shaped pupils. The plot and tutorials are fully voiced, and all of the girls contain various lines they will say if you perform certain actions that involve them. The story itself is pretty humorous and both breaks the fourth wall and bashes itself a couple times. However, if you are in the camgirl or camboy business, some of the humor might offend you, so be forewarned of the heavilly offensive satire in this game.\n\nThe gameplay itself can get a bit repetitive at times, of course; you have one main goal and you get there. However, the predecessor of this game, HuniePop, was really no different. You solve puzzles, buy upgrades, solve harder puzzles, win, the end. Neither game has very "deep" gameplay. It isn't meant to. It's meant to be a quick paced management/clicker game that you strive to beat your high score with. You hire girls, make them get more fans, make them do shows to earn money, and use that money to invest in upgrades to make your life slightly easier. Pretty much rinse and repeat, albeit with other gameplay features mixed in that I won't bother listing here. Simple concept. However, it's the games with a simple concept that add that replayability, and this is one of those games worth coming back to time and time again, even if you take a large break in between.\n\nMany of the negative reviews on here either cite the art style, the lack of depth in gameplay, the lack of nudity, or the "unfairness" of a certain STD you can catch from sending your girls out to the nearby sleazy motel: AIDS.\n\nThe art style is different and quirky, but definitely shouldn't be criticized. It is high quality art; just because it's not "desu desu anime desu" shouldn't dissuade you from playing.\n\nAs I've stated before, the gameplay isn't designed to be deep. It is a simple game that is meant to be played more than once to beat your own high score. In addition, there was already an update adding a super hard mode; who knows what is in store in the future?\n\nThere is no explicit nudity in this game. There are slightly lewd cutscenes and outfits, but that's about it. However this isn't a bad thing; not everyone constantly wants ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in their faces, and you can stream this game. However, if you're in it for the nudity, move on to another game.\n\nIf one of your girls catches AIDS, they can no longer do anything. This sucks, yeah. However, you can always just switch out places with another girl. It's a welcome risk to me, and it encourages players to think twice before spamming the motel for easy money.\n\nIn conclusion, while not a game for everyone, I think HunieCam studio is pretty fun and humorous, and adds in a classic game style of "try to best yourself". if you don't take games way too seriously (and why would you, it's a GAME), you're in for a good amount of fun.\n\nIn my opinion, a solid 8.5/10, and definitely worth the low price tag.\n\nP.S. Sorry for the lengthy review, but with some of the bad ones on here, I figure it's probably needed to elaborate.","April 11","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although with how many people complain about the art style, I think a lot of people would have been disappointed even if there was porn. (Personally I love the style, but art is subjective and blah blah)\n\nIf you want a cute/quirky management game to waste some time on or keep you occupied, this is a really well-done and polished example of one. The tutorial allows you to get easily acquainted with each new feature as you progress, so you don't get as overwhelmed. Each girl is likeable in her own way and you're sure to have a favorite that you hire on every run. I also feel motivated to keep playing the game to get more wardrobe tokens and see all of their new hairstyles and outfits.\n\nLike I said, if you want porn, you're gonna want to wait for the Huniepop sequel if there ever is one. However, I think this is a fun little spin-off and it's nice to see our favorites from the original game make a return, and the new girls are a very welcome addition. It's a great time-waster and I plan to continue wasting time on it for a while.","April 5","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

HunieCam Studio is based around the style of a tap to click mobile game in which you manage a developing camgirl operation. The base mechanics are simplistic and involve large chunks of simply waiting around for the various girls to finish up tasks or earning you money. The ability to manage and multitask is needed to play this game. Characters (and their respective VA's) return from HuniePop, but personalities are reduced to short "I'm on it" style soundbites. Enjoyable in a time waster sort of way, but not the breakout smash that HuniePop was.\n\n\nLong Review:\n\nPros:\n1: Surprisingly deep strategy elements. Every action needs to be balanced against how long it will take, and what the girl charges\n2: Most of the characters from HuniePop make a return apperance, with their Voice Actors reprising their roles. Once again you get to her Tiffany say "What's shakin', Bacon."\n3: Despite causing such controversy early on, the Chibi art style works well in this format of game.\n\nCons:\n1: The personalities of the various returning characters are reduced to short 'acknowledged' voice clips, meaning the only real difference between them is the fetishes they cater towards.\n2: The game has the feel of being built as a mobile game, wtih a PC port thrown in as an afterthought. Graphics and Resolution options are lacking, with 1600 x 900 being the maximum resolution (as of the time of writing this review).\n3: Replayability is limited to trying to better your score, and unlocking outfits for the girls. For those who don't care about achievments, one playthough will be more than sufficient.\n\n\nLet's get this out of the way right now: HunieCam is NOT HuniePop. It is made by the same people, and features most of the same cast of Pop, but it is its entirely own game, with differing mechanics and play style. Just as Pop was built around the ideas of a dating sim, and match 3 gameplay, HunieCam Studio is a similar take on the Farmville style clicker.\n\nKyu returns, seeminly having been promoted from Love Fairy to Porn Pixie, and she has decided that you need to be the one to run her blossoming empire and build it up from one girl doing amature camming in her freetime to a veritable smut factory pumping out constant 24/7 depravity.\n\nYour objective is to gather as many fans as possible within a hard 21 day deadline. You can buy upgrades to employ more girls, multipliers to earn more money, and collect consumables to provide either one time or constant bonuses. Between having the girls do camshows for money, dance at strip-clubs to develop talent, and do booze and cigarette runs, you have to be able to micro manage quite a few factors all at once, meaning that a clear plan is needed in order to avoid going broke or missing the deadlines.\n\nGameplay is fairly simplistic at first. You can tell your girls to do various activities, which then take differing amounts of time to complete. The rewards - fans, money, talent or style points vary depending on how much you have invested in upgrades and the various skill levels of the girls themselves. As the game progresses, you will need to start playing heavy attention to the various fetishes of your fans in order to maximise profits, and to the hourly costs of employing each girl, meaning that soon every decision you make will have to be checked and balanced against the cost/benefits ratio. Having the girl who charges $4 an hour do a camshow for $40 dollars while the girl who charges $64 an hour go grab a pack of smokes will drive you into debt faster than Kyu finding your porn stash.\n\nThe cast of avaliable girls is drawn from the roster of HuniePop, with a number of new girls being added in to round out the selection. Each girl will cater to a specific set of fetishes, so it is up to you to find a combination of girls that will work well together. Sadly, your options to interact with the girls is rather limited. You can't actually talk to them, and while the Voice Actors for the established characters return, their lines are generally limited to short 'I'm on it' or 'That was Fun' style remarks. Kyu is the exception, as she voices all of the tutorials.\n\nOverall, the game is a nice attempt at spicing up the oversaturated Clicker game type, but within half and hour your will have seen just about everything the game has to offer. HunieCam Studio's greatest sin is that it has to follow in HuniePop's footsteps, and while it tried hard, it is unlikely to be the same level of breakout success that its predecessor was.\n\nRecommended for when the game is on sale.","June 3","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is a bit on the easy side, as  I got a diamond medal by my third playthrough, and have almost all clothing and hair styles unlocked after around 6 hours. I don't mind the art style as this is an even less serious game than huniepop and is less adulty, at least with the pictures.\n\nOverall it's a pretty good game, although you'll probably have everything unlocked within 8-10 hours.

However going into the game the game is anything but simple. You have to run and operate a cam girl business starting with one girl. To make your business grow you have bring in more cam girls while managing your company's daily earning without going on the red and losing your business.  You'll have to be mindfull of this while managing yours girls' daily routines and getting the biggest possible fanbase all in  21 days.\n\nPros:\n-Most of the returning girls from HuniePop appear along with brand new girls in the mix.\n-Controls are simple to grasp\n-There's a decent number of approaches on how to keep your company profitable while trying to gain the biggest fanbase possible within the game's 3 week time limit\n-Assessories for your girls vary from the weird to completely ♥♥♥♥ed up factor\n-The difficulty is surprisingly challenging trying to find a good playstyle that works to the player's methods in getting the highest rank and score possible\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n-Those who hoped to find some graphic nudity this time around may be dissapointed\n-The simple looking graphics/artstyle and clicker based gameplay may turn off some, easily passing this for another Facebook game\n-Though there are upgrades to help pass the time during activities you choose your girls to participate in, the game at times can feel like sloth\n-Beyond the 21 day span, there's little to do outside the minimal unlockables and an "endless mode"\n\n\n\nVertict: Thumbs up. Though HunieCam isnt as involving as HuniePop when it comes to interracting with the characters. The gameplay seems to be the bigger priority as oppose to the eroge aspects. I would mostly recommend this game for those looking for a good time killer in their managment games along with some dark humor. The $7 price tag fits this type of game just fine, but just dont expecting anything epic to see. For you HuniePop fans you might have mixed feelings on this one. For those looking for a good fap or two in their gaming you may want to look elsewhere. For others looking for more out of their games beyond porn, give HunieCam a try.","April 5","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has more of a "mobile" look, though that may be intentional.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is great.  The clock keeps ticking, and you have to budget your time between training girls, having them work, and making sure you have enough cash on hand to keep everyone paid while still getting upgrades.

It's a challenging, fun management sim on it's own, and a great timewaster. This game is hectic, with the pace only accelerating towards the end, but that's half the fun. Filling out your team, grinding fans, and trying to collect all the damn money will keep you busy.\n\nOnly suggestion I would have for HuniePot is a $1-5k addition of "Collect All Money/Items at Location" rather than just escalating the automated collection bot. It gets a little excessive, and can be annoying.","April 4","true","25.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is no "ascending" feature that other clicker games have, so there is almost no strategy, no mathematics.

I don't usually buy into that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but sending one of the girls to go get ♥♥♥♥ed by some rich guy and having her say "Do i really have a choice?" is a little on the nose.

This game is the  BALLS .\n\nI love HCS. I haven't even gotten a proper score on it yet and I still love it to pieces.\nThe voice acting is great, the soundtrack is as good as the last game, the art direction, I think, is stellar (Despite what literally everyone else thinks) and the way the game plays is just fun overall.\nIt can be tedious, but that comes with the sort of 'clicker' genre, but once I got the hang of it and the rewards just get gradually higher, it tends to leave me with a nice sense of accomplishment.\nOverall HunieCam Studio delivers a steady sort of relaxed gameplay environment which is a nice refresh from the type of things I usually play I.E ArmA 3, Dark Souls et cetera; and I am really pleased with how it turned out. (And looking forward to how many close minded people it's going to make angry :P )\nI woudl reccomend this to anyone who has a great sense of humor, lives in their mother's basement and faps on the daily kek.\nI can't wait for HunieDev's next masterpiece, and I'll be watching for future updates to HCS also.\n\nThanks HuniePot guy. 10/10 it was okay","April 4","true","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I know the developer got some flack for it, but I could not be more satisfied with the look of this game.  And for those of you who don't like this style.. can you at least appreciate that he's giving us some variety?  If you can't, then poo on you.\n\nWith that said, this is a pretty standard management simulator under the hood.  However, the hood in this metaphor belongs to a car with one awesome paint job.  This game is really funny, and most of the humor comes from how casually it treats its subject matter.  Who knew that running a porn studio that doubles as the front for an underground prositutiton ring would feel so much like running a restaraunt?\n\nAnd yeah, it is pornographic.. in the loosest sense.  The girls are supposed to be attractive, and they DO say and do lewd things, but the game is actually totally work-safe.  For me, this makes the game even funnier, and if you're the kind of person who gets off to cartoons, then this is still lewder than what you're probably used to, so it's a win/win.","April 4","true","12.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

(Also, it's a relatively light casual tycoon/clicker game with plenty of silly humor to spare.)\n\nIf you're curious, take a look at the following video for some early-game content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVtLTCijB1A\n\nOverall, I would say this has met my expectations (not sure what others on here expected from the game).  Just don't go into this thinking you're going to get HuniePop all over again.  It's a different game (capitalizing on a different casual playstyle).\n\nPROS\n------\n\n- Still has that HuniePot sense of humor\n- Light and casual, something to play a little here and there without having to really expend mental energy on\n- Despite whatever controversy there may have been about the art style, the game looks polished and the art fits the gameplay and atmosphere\n- It's a camgirl tycoon/clicker game...come on!\n\n\nCONS\n------\n\n- It's not HuniePop, just deal with it.\n- It's not the deepest tycoon game in existance (heck, it's more clicker than tycoon).\n- While the game becomes more random the longer it runs, the first few days/steps are pretty standardized (i.e., you're always presented with a choice of the same three girls to start, etc.)\n\n\nVERDICT\n---------\n\nThere's a reason that the Steam page has a "courtesy warning" about this game not being fap-tastic material.  It's not.  The subject is a little risque, there are some dirty words here and there, and the visuals are certainly suggestive.  But this isn't a game designed to arouse -- just to give a little bit of sleazy fun.  Worth a buy (to support the developer and given how cheap it is).  You'll get your money's worth, but the experience depends entirely on what you expect going in.","April 4","true","1.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I really enjoyed that game and I've played it heaps. So naturally I was excited when the team announced HunieCam Studios.\n\nThis game is a clicker/management game with the concept of the pornography/cam business. You'll send your girls (total of 8 girls at a time with a grand total of 18 different girls) into stripclubs, cam shows, sleezy motels, shops, boutique stores, sex stores and modeling agencys to level up your girls and make them earn you more money and fans. You use this money to pay your girls, buy sex toys and invest in stuff to overall make your business boom. This was cool when I first heard of it as I knew the team behind HuniePop could pull it off but I honestly don't think they did a good job. The game is boring and bland, there wasn't enough to keep my attention or nothing that I haven't seen before. This is something you'd see on a flash game website or as an iOS game, so the $6.99 is a very steep asking price.\n\nI would honestly wait for this game to go at least half price, but if you NEED it, go ahead and buy it. I'll have to award this game a 4/10, just for its lack of original content overall the the boring gameplay.","April 4","false","1.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muticere/recommended/426000/","muticere","Muticere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muticere/","210 products in account","I'm having an excellent time with this game.  The art is great (screw the haters), the gameplay is deceptively simple with plenty of hidden depths (similar to HuniePop), and it's extremely addicting.\n\nThe surprise gimmick with this game is that it is a TIMED management sim!  Typically management sims let you play for an indefinite period of time and you only lose if you go bankrupt or fail to meet some other pre-conceived expectation.  HunieCam, however, gives you 21 in-game days and after those days are up, you're scored on several factors, the main one being how many followers your girls have accumulated in total.  If you don't meet any of the qualifying amounts, you essentially "lose".  You can continue playing, but there isn't anything to achieve now, so you may as well start over, unless you want to use this save file for practice.\n\nThe neat thing about structuring your play with a time limit is it forces you to play the game more strategically than you normally would.  This opens up the possibility for a multiplicity of play styles and your approach to victory can be completely different almost every time.  Do you want a multiplicity of untrained girls who don't earn much, but can build up a sizable fanbase fast?  Or do you want a more select few who are highly skilled, girls who cost a ton to keep around, but have the potential to rack up huge fanbases as well?  I'm still discovering different approaches to victory and can tell those two aren't the only ways to win.\n\nAfter playing through several times, though I have to say I wish this were a mobile game a little more than it being a PC game.  It would work well on an iPad.  Also I hope HuniePot decides to support this game better than they did with HuniePop and give us more content in the future.\n\nAll-in-all, I like what HuniePot has done here.  I'm pleased they didn't ask for another handout to create this game and instead used resources earned from the success of HuniePop.  I think they released a quality product with a good gimmick and interesting gameplay.  If you like management sims that require some inventiveness in order to succeed at and especially if you have fascination with the porn industry, you should give this game a try.","April 4","true","10.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

If you like clickers, you'll like this.\n\nI was excited to play this game primarily because I'm a lonely degenerate who liked Huniepop. While I won't say that I didn't enjoy this game, because I did, there isn't much to it. If you've ever played a facebook management game or a clicker game, this should feel pretty familiar to you. You'll spend most of the game clicking on different buildings to collect different kinds of numbers so you can upgrade things so you can get more numbers. You'll then get a score at the end depending on how you did. There is an element of replayability in that you get coins at the end of the game that you can spend on different outfits and hairstyles for each of the girls.\n\nThe problem for me is that, after about an hour, I started to get bored. It's not like Huniepop where the core gameplay is engaging. I found myself catching up on my Netflix queue while I played this. For some, this could certainly be seen as a benefit: a game that you can play while turning your brain off and doing something else. Personally, I'd rather play something more engaging.  Ultimatly, if you like clicker games and simple management sims, you'll like this. It may also apeal to people who like to collect outfits for characters. Otherwise, I wouldn't recomend it.\n\nHappy fapping, and I look foward to seeing what Huniepot does next.","April 4","false","3.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

What makes a game a clicker is being able to leave it idle for long times while still making progress. If you leave this game idle for 5 minutes, you're gonna lose a lot of money. Yes it has an element of clicking (or holding) in order to speed up production, but this game gives you a time/day limit, so the clicking is an important and pretty much required function, leaving the comparison void.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed this game, but before anyone buys this, I think it's important to know that in my 4 hours of game time so far I've beaten this twice; it's very short and fast paced. If you like simplistic tycoon/management games like Game Dev Tycoon or Band Star, you'll like this. It's a good game, but not necessarily a good game for HuniePop fans.\n\nAlso if you're like me you'll be disappointed there's no art gallery of any kind.","April 4","true","7.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

However, that doesn't make Hunie Cam Studio a bad game, and it's got some good basics in the Management/Clicker genre. While the girls take a back seat to the gameplay, those who want to find the right formula for maximizing their profits will feel at home here. Trying to use the fetishes effectively while keeping your girls healthy does have an addictive quality to it, but it does lose some shine over time due to a lack of variety. While the girls have a variety of costumes and only get their personalities out via their voice lines, this actually led to a good in-game moment and a realization, at least on my side. But overall, those looking for complicated game mechanics and real length are not looking in the right place with Hunie Cam Studio. It's very much like the cam girls that are within the game: it's good for some time, has a certain charm to it, but can't replace the great management games out there. But it'll do a good job at the cost.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nThose who like optimization and trying to find the right formula for gameplay will be at home with this game.\nThe clicker part of the game isn't overbearing, thanks to the hold down mechanic, which does collect at a reasonable rate.\nThe art style, while not the focus of the game, does a good job of parodying facebook/flash/games of this genre.\nSome clever writing at some points and some references to recent controversies that I found to be pretty funny.\nLove the introduction of the Sleazy Motel for the Risk/Reward mechanic, as well as the condom that you had to work for to take away that risk.\nGood selection of costumes.\nDespite having been banned on Twitch, the game did give a moment of a moral lesson that I really loved. This is why games are great for everyone: you take away your own experience. And this game delivered in terms of a message that you had to find, but wasn't shoved down your throat.\nI like the music, despite a lack of variety. Good for the subject matter\nNegatives:\nNeeds more variety. Events or some random element needed to be added to give the game some options for longevity.\nThe girls take a backseat to the gameplay, and the characters that we connected with in HuniePop aren't able to get their personalities over here. Lacks the charm and personality that HuniePop had.\nNeeded more flash overall in the presentation element.\nThe artwork being regulated to loading screens seem a little bit weird.\nMake ESC go to the options/menu.\nReally wish it went to 1080p.","April 6","true","10.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Once you finish a playthrough, you're awarded token coins based on how many fans you accumulated, and with those tokens you can unlock different hairstyles and outfits for your girls.\nEach girl has 4 clothing sets and 4 hairstyles to unlock, and if you unlock all of a girl's alts you'll unlock a bonus photograph of her to look at, although there's no explicit nudity in those either.\n\nIf you enjoyed Huniepop then you could probably kill an hour or two with this game, provided the lack of explicit nudity isn't a deal-breaker for you. It's nothing amazing and even a Huniepop fan like myself could probably live without it, but it's a neat little mini-HuniePop experience in case you've been missing it.","April 5","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The mechanic isn't fun as the % of getting something is way too high. once you get something it takes days of meds (that you have to get from the adult store, randomly) before the girl is fully healthy again. in my opinion the disease mechanic isn't worth the hassle, and shouldn't be in the game. I like the escort mechanic idea, but it should be balance a different way. Perhaps only granting 1/xth the money for the shorter duration.\n3. Some other balance issues, mainly gaining fans, early game pictures are important, but after getting one or two paid advertisements, it becomes pointless to raise that stat, boosting other items becomes a priority.\n\n\nTo sum up though, If you like short silly games that shamelessly flaunt what they are. That aren't afraid of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off SJW's, that's genuinely fun to play for short bursts and has a few unique concepts. That unapologetically plays on stereotypes and entertains you along the way.

Something that could really do wonders for this game is some kind of leaderboard as well as a "Hard Mode" of some kind.\n\nI was somewhat shocked at how short each playthrough is since you'll be done a playthrough after a couple hours or so. However, there is some replayability in that after you finish a playthrough, you get Wardrobe Tokens that are used to unlock hairstyles and outfits that can be changed for each girl for her to have in future playthroughs.

Huniepop was little more than one of a thousand Bejeweled clones out there. The main difference is that it was wrapped in anime graphics with a really crappy dating sim and a sad excuse of a story (seriously there are p0rno's with better plots). Seriously, every single day played out the same. Track down chick. Give presents. Go on date. Repeat x3 and sometimes you'd be rewarded with partial pixel nudity.  But it was the same thing. Every day. And it was boring. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but after I had gotten a few days into I just wanted it to be over with. I kept going because I wanted to "catch 'em all" so to speak. But don't kid yourselves. The girls weren't some amazingly deep creations that were so awesome I wanted to get to know them better. They were basically cardboard stereotypes with a thin excuse of a personality.\n\nAll that said. I enjoyed the game. Because it didn't try to be anything other than what it was. And after I got all the girls and finished the game I felt a deep sense of accomplishment. I was happy with it. But I haven't picked it up since.\n\nI bought Huniecam Studio roughly 5 hours ago and have played through it twice already. I was getting ready to do a third run when I decided to swing by and leave a review.\n\nThis game might be boring to some people, but not to me. There's a hint of time management and a dash of tycoon game...in the end it is neither of those thing. It lacks the urgency of time management if you're not swimming in cash by the end of the game then you're doing something wrong.\n\nIt's not about either of those things. The game is all about increasing your fans and cash has no bearing on that. Just like Huniepop, it's all about finding the right combos and matching things up correctly in a specific amount of time. This time, however, the combos are much less obvious than different colored icons flashing on the screen.\n\nThis isn't a deeply innovative or life changing game and I wasn't expecting it to be. Instead it just is. It's enjoyable and it's best approached without trying to compare it to Huniepop. They're completely different games and Huniepop pales in comparison.\n\n","April 7","true","11.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

On one hand its nice to see finally released so called "sequel" to HuniePop, but on the other hand this game is not what i expected to be.\n\nFirst off, art style. It simply just pushes me off of this game, why on earth devs couldn't stick with original art style from HuniePop?\n\nSecondly, a clicker simulator? Hell no! I hate clicker simulators. (why do i have to break my mouse on one game?)\n\nThirdly, manage all girls is just pain in ♥♥♥, their stress and addictions just fills up so fast that in blink of an eye you are in debt, oh and if you have negative "bank account" for 24 hours you lose game. Not to mention you have given limited time in this game (3 weeks), after that game ends, of course you can still continue, but you won't be able to earn D-ick award "achievement".\n\n\nOverall, I'm disappointed. requesting refund","April 5","false","1.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This spiritual successor of HuniePop is no exception. While this game does not focus as much on dialogue cleverness (it's still there just not as prevalent) instead it uses everything having to do with the sex industry as it's satire material. The art style was quite a controversy for many fans of the original HuniePop and to see it changed in this game caused quite a stir, however I see no issue and still has charm with this new art style. The navigation and city map does feel like a mobile-game which isn't necessarily a negative thing, but people may get turned off because of it. You run a cam-girl business and basically simulate your girls lives, have them do shows for money, have them increase their skills through many means such as strip clubs to improve their show performances or the boutique to improve their style to bring in more fans. You must manage what kinks to focus on for what your fans enjoy most. There is a lot to it and many things to increase. The game is rather short, you must gain a high score by the end of 21 days, which is comprised of how many fans and how much you did of many different things throughout the 21 days. You then get wardrobe tokens to spend at the main menu on new outfits and hairstyles for your girls. You can continue your save file or make another to gain more tokens and thus, the gameplay loop. The humor is still there in full force, just in a different way. At seven dollars and a major fan of HuniePop and its developer, I can see myself sinking many hours into this game before unlocking everything.\nPros.\n-The humor from HuniePop remains ever present.\n-Over 20 girls you can hire, more girls than you could interact with in HuniePop.\n-Many things to level up such as girl's skills and company operations.\n-Actually pretty challenging in a good way to manage everything.\n-High replayability\n-Only 7 bucks\nCons.\n-The artstyle (not a con for me but I can see this being a con for many other people).\n-The game can be short if you end up not caring about unlocking new wardrobe. You can continue forever and ever if you so wish, but the soft end of the game is 21 days. This may also not be an issue because of the fact you can go on forever.\n-The look and feel of the game can feel like a mobile game. Again, not necessarily a negative but may be a turnoff for some people.\nIf I were to give this game an arbitrary number score, it would probably be either a 7 out of 10 or an 8 out of 10.\nGood job dev!","April 4","true","8.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

You first have to choose 1 of 3 girls that are what i call "pure" (they are not addicted to smoking or drinking)\n\nDuring the gameplay you must manage your money to pay the girls wages, buy marketing deals and upgrade your clicker to do a variety of things such as collect money, fans, cigs or booze faster. You also need to make sure that your girls have similar "fetishes". This is a mechanic i really like, because it kind of feels like the combo mechanics of Hunie Pops puzzles were you have to match the tiles, in this however you need to choose a handful of girls with similar fetiches to gain popularity the fastest.\n\nHunie Pop was a dating sim, so the habits of certain girls (new and old) still exist, this is what i meant before by the "pure" girls. Some girls will be addicted to drinking or smoking and so you must keep up your amounts of cigs and booze so that they dont become stressed out, when a girl is stressed out they have to go relax (basically on cooldown).\n\nItems in this game add fetishes, some include : Furry, Water Sports, Anal and Cake Farting (no idea why lol). By giving these items to a girl you add the fetish so that if your company has fans of that fetish they will also like that girl. It really does keep the element of combo's from the original game just in a different way.\n\nMy biggest issues are with 2 things.\n1. After so long it can get slightly tedious to wait for actions to be completed especially since you may need girls scattered everywhere so you cant hurry a large group up by clicking.\n2.Everything but the Escort service can be boiled down to strategy, the Escort Hotel however cannot, i get its their as a high risk high reward type deal but it just does not fit my playstyle (im sure some others would like it)\n\nOverall i really love this game so far, and im glad after just 3 playthrouhs (1 failed 2 succeeded) i manage to get the Diamond Trophy (100k fans). I will now list some of the pros and cons.\n\n*Pros*\n-Sexual Themes\n-Combo Mechanic\n-Items\n-Old Girls\n-Some New Girls\n-Clean Aesthetic\n-Addicting Music\n-Learn How To Drop Sexy Girls On Buildings\n\n*Cons*\n-Can Become Repetitive\n-Escort Service Is Random\n-Art Style Is Massively Altered From 1st Game\n-Glasses Not An Item (Doesn't make sense to me)","April 5","true","3.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Its more about management and strategy, with a side of sexual humor.\n\nIts not fap material, it doesn't even pretend to be fap material. They straight up tell you its not fap material.\n\nLet me re-iterate THIS GAME IS NOT FAP MATERIAL.\n\nThat said and out of the way; the game itself is fun.  Yes, I said it. its FUN.  Its a micro-management sim; you don't have to worry about any of the big issues, you just micromanage how camgirls spend their time; to maximize their fans, and make them earn rediculous sums of money.  I mean, seriously, I calculated it out... one of my girls was pulling 16 million a year in her take-home-after-tax-revenue.  Thats ALOT of money for shoving a butt-plug-shaped cake up your bum, and farting it out, while hugging a subscribe pillow.\n\nI digress... yes, you can beat this game in a couple of hours.  Will you beat it the best way to beat it on your first play through? Unless you cheat and read a guide, likely not.\n\nIs the game terribly hard? No.  Not even the 'hard mode' is terribly hard... you just have to know how to min-max.\n\nIs performing the various trick shot playthroughs difficult? Moderately.... but not so hard you'll be ripping your hair out.\n\nPeople are calling it a facebook quality clicker... I disagree. Have you SEEN facebook quality clickers?  'Upgrade auto-collection takes 60,000,000,000 cash... or 5,000 gems!' in this game, auto colection not only isn't DLC, the base version of it costs 50 cash.  FIFTY. you can have that on your first day, when you pay your first girl 6 bucks for a full day of streaming. Not only that, but facebook quality clickers are designed to -never- have an ending.  Yes, you can keep going after 21 days in this... but there really isn't any point, save to unlock all the girls for outfit selection later, or to practice strategies dealing with chainsmoking lushes.\n\nPoint is... this isn't a one-and-done game.  Its a management sim that you can come back to, do a run through, try and beat personal bests, or try and do the various trick shot achievments.\n\nThis developer is great about adding to games, and adding in additional value later - See challenge-mode for huniepop, etc.\n\nAll that said, TLDR.  - Its a 7 dollar management sim game with sexual comedy themes; not to be confused for fap material, and its designed to be replayable.  If you are looking for fap material, may I reffer you to google or bing, and remind you that there is endless amounts of it on the internet for free.\n\nGame is actually priced at a great value for play-time... Even if I were done playing it.... I paid a dollar per hour of entertainment.  And that value is only going to get better, because the quick replay and game duration.... Makes it easy to just sit down, play a session, and call it done.. almost anytime, almost anywhere.\n\nTo the dev.... Add in game-mode type selection with different goals at different durations of play.  Say, 21 day fan-rush, 18-day cash rush, 30-day combo-rush.","April 7","true","7.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

HunieCam Studio is a spin-off time management-style game where you run your own camgirl operation with the help of Kyu's girls (the original 8 girls from HuniePop as well as 10 new additions).\n\nThis game turned out to be real fun to fool around with. You're kept on your toes from the get-go as you are given a time limit to gain as many fans as possible while managing business investments and expenses. Your time-management skills can really be tested in this game. The main goal is 100K+ fans and without proper management of your girls' appeal levels, stress levels, and on-hand resources (money, booze, cigs, etc.), you can end up playing this game more times than needed if you aim to achieve each achievement.\n\nAlthough not as deep in content and gameplay as HuniePop was (in my personal opinion), it is still a very well done game and still has that HuniePop vibe. And just to address the elephant in the room, once again, this is only a fun spin-off the devs decided to do. THE ART STYLE FOR THIS GAME WAS DONE FOR THIS GAME AND THIS GAME ONLY! If there will be a HuniePop 2, the art style will probably revert back to that of the original HuniePop. So if a game's artstyle is your main selling point, just continue playing HuniePop and patiently wait for HuniePop 2.","April 7","true","15.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you wish to see some "saucy" pictures, you may be disappointed. If you aren't a fan of management-like or clicker games, you're gonna have a bad time buying this. HOWEVER, if these things don't bother you, it's a fun little game.\nHunieCam studio is (in my opinion) an entertaining clicker game. It has a fairly long play time and actually has a reasonable end goal (unlike many other clicker games I've played in the past) along with some challenging achievements to get. It also has a wide variety of employees you can have, from some of our classic girls in the original huniepop game to new ones (no hidden characters though, sorry). It's art style is also cute. I would recommend buying this game and hope the HuniePot team works on making more fun, enjoyable, (and maybe lewd) games in the future!","April 7","true","18.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

No, but if you loved some of the humor behind the original game and into time/resource management games that are replayable due to wardrobe unlocks and score attacks then I would recommend giving this one a shot.\n\nSo far from three play throughs I have completely enjoyed my time playing this game and looking forward to picking it back up again a few more times to try out the hard mode to see what that's like.

That said, it's a very shallow sort of gameplay, which leaves you finishing a bit underwhelmed.\n\nAt its heart, this is a 'clicker' type game. Much like Cookie Clicker before it, you use money to pay girls to earn more money. With that said, every action is on a timer and you can 'click' to shorten the time an activity takes. Whether its shopping for ciggies and booze, or the girls' spa sessions, every event has a time it takes to complete, which you can hasten through.\n\nBecause of this, the dynamic of the game never really changes. There are few, if any, surprises, and the only replayability really are the tokens you gain at the end of each game which can unlock new costumes and hairstyles for the girls, ultimately culminating in a free gravure shot (non-nude) of any girl you buy all the outfits for.\n\nIt's harmless fun, and mostly family-friendly aside from a few choice dialogues for the tutorials and the phallus-shaped trophy. That said, it's not a great game. There's not much do to from a player's standpoint besides clicking and holding, and once you have the general idea of the game, it becomes very easy very quickly.\n\nIt was a brave new direction for the devs, but I think this one missed the mark a little.

It's not HuniePop and it's not trying to be. Those who are complaining didn't read or chose to ignore the Courtesy Warning at the start of the game description.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, it's a simulator, tycoon style game AND a clicker. Clicking is optional, and I mean it. Mechanics are simple and very easy to get used to. There's not much depth regarding what can be done, but there's a decent variety of ways of achieving the final goal.\nGame is played in sessions of 21 in-game days. After that, your score is computed, you are awarded tokens to unlock outfits and hairstyles and you can either start a new session or freeplay the current one. Last trophy is something.\nBy the way, I missed the speed up setting.\n\nRegarding the artstyle, it's cute. It's not as explicit as in HuniePop (there again, this has been warned beforehand), but it's provocative. I'd say it fits the purpose well. If you compare this and HuniePop, you might find the art strange at first, but there again, it's someting else entirely. Keep that in mind and you'll be able to appreciate the toonish characters and conclude hat the more "serious" style from HuniePop simply doesn't fit the atmosphere here.\n\nDialogue is surely superficial and could be improved. Sure the game sessions is relatively short to contains extensive voice acting, but it's something you'll be playing again and again. So it does sound repetitive very fast. Maybe not at first, but soon enough.\n\n\nTL;DR - 8/10 Could be more polished and offer speed up settings. Delivers what's promised and is worth a try at this price tag.

The only story to speak of is that you are employed by who I assume to be Kyu to manage her camgirl opperation. That is it and as for characters well..they all have little bios you can read about them and they all have appealing designs but aside from the occasional lines they speak when you interact with them there is little to no characterization which I was honestly fine with when it came to the original Hunniepop girls because I already got to know them before but I could honestly care less about most of the new girls. At the end of the day though this isn't the kind of game you play for character or story, I mean did anyone play Diner Dash for the story?\n\nVisuals/Sound -\nOkay I know I am in the minority here but I actually don't mind and even enjoy the art direction. True I would have preffered the visuals of Huniepop but considering this is a spinoff and not a sequel I am okay with them experimenting when it comes to the art and honestly I think it looks pretty good. Its more cartoony and less anime looking sure (though the anime-esque qualities are there) but its bright, colorful, and fun to look at. It's not quite as "sexy" as the last game either but that wasn't the main reason I liked Huniepop anyway, not to mention the developer clearly states that the erotic qualities of this game were meant purely for comedy purposes and not for fap material (unlike the last game which was kind of a combination of the two).\nAs for the music it is a bit repetitive but it still has the same fun and poppy sound as the last game, it serves its purpose. The sound effects are all really appealing and aid in making the game more fun. The voice acting much like the first game isn't AAA quality but the cast all clearly has talent and do a pretty good job.\n\nGameplay -\nThis game is essentially like those old sim management games (again like Diner Dash) mixed with those clicker style games you find on mobile all the time. Yeah it isn't very deep and the replay value is limited to unlockable outfits and highscores but that is honestly what I was expecting out of this games and you know what? I had fun, yeah it won't be something I will be playing months from now but it is fun to pick up and play here and there and can honestly be pretty addictive. As far as these kinds of games though I think this deserves to stand among the best of them (for one NOTHING is locked behind a wait or pay model like a ton of newer games of this type).\n\nVerdict -\nThe biggest difference between this game and the first one for me is that the first game was a "don't judge a book by its cover" scenario. On the surface it just looks like a nother ecchi visual novel game with candy crush thrown into the mix and in its basics yeah thats what it was but the visual novel aspect stood out with its fun characters and humorous approach to its erotic aspects not to mention one of the most addictive and surprisingly deep bejeweled style puzzle mechanics out there. This game however is something that I honestly feel like you'll know immediately wether or not you'll enjoy it. If you like this style of game and don't mind the art change then you'll probably like this game, if not then you likely won't. This game aside from some similarities with the humor and some returning characters is NOTHING like the first game so don't assume that becuase you liked the first game that you will like this one they are two different beasts and deserved to be critiqued as such and not constantly compared.\n\nI give Huniecam Studios a pretty good 7/10\n","April 7","true","12.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

The game faced a good deal of criticism for its rather radical shift in artistic style and deviation from the original, but HuniePot remained stalwart in their earnest game design philosophy. While some fans of HuniePop will undoubtedly be lost with this title, I am NOT one of them. Why?\n\nBecause holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is fun.\n\nTop praise goes to system design:\n- Just like its predecessor, the game UI is intuitive, concise, and (like the girls) easy on the eyes. Kyu returns with her witty narrative as she seamlessly integrates story with tutorial, and while I had no idea what to expect going into the game, it was very quick to pick up, understand, and play.\n\n- Game balance is spectacular. While my first playthrough scored pitifully enough to deny me a bronze, flaccid shelf ornament - as well as some scathing remarks from Kyu, my second proved to arouse the phallic trophy sufficiently to get a silver and almost gold rating. The game feels simple enough on the surface to play as casually as desired, while also being complex enough as a whole to feel like a steep yet surmountable challenge when going for a higher score.\n\n- Initially I was worried I would not be able to play the game with as relaxed a pace as HuniePop, but every menu and many time-consuming interactions pause the clock and allow for as long a rest as desired.

I will go through the assumption that this game is a spinoff (hopefully) but it kind of hurts to know some characters I liked from the original game (Nikki and Aiko) had to go into being camgirls.\n\nFor example, an author decides to write a book with that current MC going through the usual trials and problems of life with a positive thought. Then the sequel uses a different MC but introduces the older MC with "its hopeless/this sucks" outlook because bad things happen to him, one after another until he gave up. It is probably not that extreme but come on, show respect for the characters you create, don't just create them in one game and set them up for something like this (even if it is a spinoff). The gameplay isn't that complex, just send girls to one location for a certain amount of time until times up then collect stuff, then once stress is near 100% send to spa, invest in upgrades and repeat all over again. Truthfully, if you want a clicker game, I would say adventure capitalist or sakura clicker because they are free and will continue to play when you exit them to earn w/e currency for you.\n\nMusic is okay but I don't really find it that memorable or catchy, probably because my focus on constant clicking made me ignore it. I wish that I found out sooner that I could just hold down the mouse button to speed up actions because I went through one hour of this game just constantly clicking before reading the other reviews that I that was a option.","April 5","false","14.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is in no way like HuniePop, you'll get that vibe just by looking at the screenshots and 30 seconds of google to figure that out. So if you're upset about that after buying and playing it, you're probably an idiot that just buys on impulse.\n\nThe real issue with Huniecam is that it falls a bit short. Within 30 minutes of play (if not less) you've experienced everything Huniecam has to offer. Which is a whole lot of clicking and dragging. Most of the replay value if you ignore achievements comes from unlocking Cosmetics and beating your previous score. The clothing and hairstyles are only seen when you click on that characters information sheet, which makes them nearly pointless since the majority time spent will be looking at the face portrait.\n\nSadly even the scoring system falls a bit flat due to it being completely centered around fans. Your money and other activities don't really contribute to your final score, so the goal is to just amass thousands of fans. If you actually care about achievements, they can be fairly fun to work towards. They at least change the flow of gameplay and give you a reason to develop new strategies.\n\nI know it sounds like I hate the game, but in truth I enjoyed it. I got 14 hours out of it, something AAA $60 titles struggle to do. The concept is neat but the gameplay is very VERY subjective to taste. If you enjoy clickers or are looking for something to pass time casually then this is a decent choice. If you're looking for Huniepop 2 or lots of depth you wont find it here.\n\nTL;DR Huniecam is shallow but enjoyable in small sessions of play.","April 7","true","14.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you enjoy management games with a more adult theme, then this is for you. If you're expecting a game like Huniepop, this is definitely not it.\n\nPros:\n-Old characters from Huniepop return (along with some new faces)\n-Lots to manage and there's a learning curve to getting it right\n-Reasonably inexpensive\n-Voice actresses return\n\nCons:\n-I got 30 ish hours out of this game before I had ALL the achievements under my belt. Now I feel it's lost it's playability as there's nothing more for me to accomplish. Basically, in short, it lacks content.\n-Minimum dialog and interaction with the girls, you basically drag and drop and hear the same few phrases over and over\n-Not many achievements to be had. I think there's room for a lot more. The newest mode "Rock Hard" doesn't even have an achievement, so why even bother messing with it?\n-I have other minor niggles with the game, but nothing worth mentioning - purely a preference thing I think.\n\nIt's hard not to compare this to Huniepop - but considering some of the old characters make a return I think it's fair game to do so. I really enjoy management type games and this appealed to me - despite the fact that I'm probably not it's target audience - I had fun. You think as a female I'd take offense to this type of game, but it's just that.. a game.. and since it is just that, I think it's pretty fun and unique. I'd love to see this game updated - with more achievements.. more fetishes.. more girls.. more.. well.. just more everything. While the art style isn't for everyone, I think it's pretty cute and considering it's not as sexually explicit as Huniepop it definitely doesn't feel out of place. In case I didn't stress this enough though, it's nothing like Huniepop. Overall I give the game a 7/10 but I'd happily raise that score if the game was updated with more content.\n\n\n\n","April 22","true","50.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Steam has too many visual novel/dating sims that pad their runtime with stat managing elements (♥♥♥♥ you Sunrider Academy and Always Remember Me).  That being said, Huniecam is suprisingly fun. It's not very long, with each game lasting about ninety minutes. But that's kinda the charm. You play through the first time and get a bronze ♥♥♥♥ trophy while Kyu rags on you for being a ♥♥♥♥ manager. And then you play through it a few more times. It gets more fun on subsequent playthroughs once you know what you're doing and learn to play efficiently. Unfortunately, not all the original voices are back from Huniepop, and there's no nudity, but some of the art's okay and there's a good amount of risque content.

This is in no way like HuniePop, you'll get that vibe just by looking at the screenshots and 30 seconds of google to figure that out. So if you're upset about that after buying and playing it, you're probably an idiot that just buys on impulse.\n\nThe real issue with Huniecam is that it falls a bit short. Within 30 minutes of play (if not less) you've experienced everything Huniecam has to offer. Which is a whole lot of clicking and dragging. Most of the replay value if you ignore achievements comes from unlocking Cosmetics and beating your previous score. The clothing and hairstyles are only seen when you click on that characters information sheet, which makes them nearly pointless since the majority time spent will be looking at the face portrait.\n\nSadly even the scoring system falls a bit flat due to it being completely centered around fans. Your money and other activities don't really contribute to your final score, so the goal is to just amass thousands of fans. If you actually care about achievements, they can be fairly fun to work towards. They at least change the flow of gameplay and give you a reason to develop new strategies.\n\nI know it sounds like I hate the game, but in truth I enjoyed it. I got 14 hours out of it, something AAA $60 titles struggle to do. The concept is neat but the gameplay is very VERY subjective to taste. If you enjoy clickers or are looking for something to pass time casually then this is a decent choice. If you're looking for Huniepop 2 or lots of depth you wont find it here.\n\nTL;DR Huniecam is shallow but enjoyable in small sessions of play.","April 7","true","14.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you played Huniepop for girls accented with games then you'll be dissapointed like all the other negative reviews. On the other hand if you played for a game accented with girls then this delivers. I disagree with the claims it's a "clicker". You're constantly allocating girls to actions and deciding whos role needs to be changed and what upgrade is happening next. Basically there's no dead time where you're idling waiting for cash; always something to do. Me and my boyfriend have a blast playing it co-op and boardrooming it up with the fetish pie and fan statistics.\n\nIf it's missing anything from Huniepop it's that touch controls are broken.

Huniecam, being a cheaper game, did not have this reward system everyone was hoping for. While this was the biggest turn-off for most people playing Huniecam, I believe the game objectively did its job in being a clicker, management game. It's adult references were used for humor this time around and Huniepot did a decent job at it. I'm still trying to get the Diamond trophy at the time of writing this review, but I know when I do I'll have the harder difficulty to look forward to. The price to gameplay ratio is good with sessions lasting about an hour and half each with a new RNG every playthrough. I'd reccomend this game to people who are fans of Huniepop that had a similar experience as myself, in which I enjoyed the personalities of the characters and had those characteristics translate over to Huniecam (i.e. I love Beli so much and she would be someone I'd love to know IRL so I refused to send her to the Sleazy Motel). Also, for people who are new to this genre of game, I recommend this to. I really want this game supported as much as possible because I believe the people at Huniepot have created a universe worth exploring into more genres and maybe even a sequel to Huniepop.\n\nThank you for listening to the rant.\nGET THIS GAME!!","April 7","true","15.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The art works even when trying to be erotic(silly as it may look) and the gameplay is fast paced and addicting myself putting in 12+hours within 2days of my purchase. Learning the games mechanics and striving to consistently beat your previous scores and get as many achievements as possible keeps me going back for more and the music along with the voice acting keeps me smiling as i play.

But wish that there was no replay and you could keep going infinitely with your first set up.  Also not as much about the girls.  If you're looking for a NEW HuniePop, this is not it.\n\nLong Review: This is not a bad game, I loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of HuniePop and I still want to support the developers.  I just played 5 straight hours of this and talked it over with a friend who did the same thing.  It's a nice time sink, but I find that I probably won't come back to it.  I like that there are more girls, I like that they just aren't making a cookie cutter sequal for a money grab.  They're trying something new, trying to do innovate things.  I somewhat enjoyed my two playthroughs of this game but a few main problems stuck out.\n1. Not as much about the girls.  You don't get any information about them nor do they feel like they have personalities like the first game.  I loved the diverse personalities and dialogues of the first game, wish that could've at least stuck.\n2. You get nothing for playing endless mode.  If you don't know, after 21 in game days the game is over and you get a small reward based on how many fans you have.  I wish you could keep getting these customize tokens will playing endless, or add more to the endless gamemode in general.\n3. The game feels like there isn't enough to do and it gets old quick.  It feels like everytime you play you're just going to be doing the same thing over and over, but maybe with different girls.\n4. I miss the dirty pictures.

It is extremely shallow - like a F2P mobile game. There's a tiny bit of humor in running a sleazy cam operation, but there isn't enough depth or content to sustain ones interest. Yes, the developers did make it clear that this was not a successor to HuniePop, but with HuniePop they added an element of strategy to a simple game, and gave all the characters dialog and at least a tiny speck of personality. This one has the simple game without the added strategy, without the personality, and is just blah.","April 5","false","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do you like clicking rapidly and simply trying to beat your high score to unlock multiple outfits and hairstyles for the girls? No? Then stay away. This is a game that belongs on a mobile device because of its style and gameplay. The HuniePop girls could be replaced with any generic "hot" girls. It's a shame that the characters we know and love from HuniePop are now just big-eyed cogs in this game's machine. This is a complete and utter disappointment after the legitimate (though absurd) fun that was HuniePop. At least that game is fun and changing. The challenge here is rapid mouse pressing.\n\nHunieCam Studio lacks charm, fun and even the over the top absurd level of sexism present in HuniePop. In short, not worth it. (and they made my main squeeze Tiffany look much less adorable, shame.)\n\n","April 5","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Magisey/recommended/426000/","Magisey","Sey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Magisey/","151 products in account","I want to preface this right now: If you like easy management games, you will like this. DO NOT come into this expecting anything Hunie Pop level (and I do mean anything).\n\nI've played 20.7 hrs so far as of this review, and despite not recommending it, I'll probably play more to try and get achievements and finish off the girl's wardrobes. If you look at this in money vs time, then yeah. I've definitely gotten my moneys worth. That being said, this game isn't fun and it's not very entertaining. And honestly? If I wasn't interested in supporting the devs I would have wished to never purchase it.\n\nThe problem is the game is boring. It's just... Boring. Everything about the game is lackluster. If you follow a guide, you can unlock all achievements very quickly.\n\nVoice Acting & Sound:\nThe voice acting is minimal sound bites for the girls (which is good), but Kyu who has full lines and is your tutorial is... Not into it. That's the cold open. You get a radically different (but cute) artstyle and a VA who very clearly was not into the lines. And while you shouldn't compare the characters from last game to this game, as it is a spin off, Kyu is an exception. She's the only one who speaks more than one line at a time, she's your tutorial, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and even SHE sounds bored. I really don't want to play a game where the tutorial is already bored, trying to teach me to play. Honestly, for the last 10 hrs of play I have kept my sound completely off. The noises are headache inducing when collecting (male voices going yeah and woo repeatedly) and the girls, while having funny and cute lines, just don't make up for the mind numbing music and constant sounds of doodz.\n\nGameplay:\nTypical clicker fare. This usually wouldn't be an issue, but I would have expected SOME innovation from the same devs who made Huniepop. Something new and fun to mix it up. This is just a copy-paste clicker management game. You get girls. You train girls. You get money. You keep them full of smokes and booze and STD free (as much as possible). The upgrades are run of the mill. More girls, more girls can occupy the same space, more money, and speed. That's it.\n\nSecond + playthroughs are irritating in the fact that, no matter what you do, the tutorial appears. I'd understand if the tutorial appeared if you were using a new savestate, but even if you go to a new one directly from your previous play, the tutorial pops up. There's no continuity from play A to play B and it really sucks. Something small like Kyu welcoming you back and asking if you wanted her to explain all the stuff again would have been super. Instead you have to wait about ~30-45 seconds and hear the same boring ♥♥♥ lines and set up until you get the magical 'skip all tutorials button'. And then, the tutorial that basically took 2 days out of your play and slowly unlocked buildings and upgrades as it baby stepped you into playing? It's gone and everything is unlocked. That was a shocker. There was no rebuilding up or strategy needed there.\n\nWhen you recruit girls, you're forced to pick one of the three given. Even if you were to have someone go back into the agency and recruit again, you're still met with the same 3 girls. It's annoying. Likewise, let's say I have three girls, but only 2 have done work while the other is just rotting away doing nothing, not on payroll, never on payroll. Somehow, the fans know she's there (like sharks smelling blood in water maybe?) and anything she represents (fit, teen, latina, asian, etc) now appears on the fan breakdown. This doesn't have a strong impact on the game itself, but it breaks the continuity again. It's a minor detail that bugs me.\n\nArtwork:\nIt's cute. I adore it. I like the fact that you earn coins to unlock new hairstyles and clothes. So that's about the only perk I see and why I still play this.\n\nConclusion:\nI didn't expect Huniepop and I think anyone downvoting this game for not being Huniepop are being assinine. This isn't the same game. However, being made by the same devs, I would expect some innovation and an eye for detail. One reviewer put it well when calling this a weird newgrounds knock off, because that's what it feels like. This FEELS like a free game. It PLAYS like a free game. There's nothing here that knocks my socks off or makes me want to tell my friends. It's a typical clicker management where even the tutorial is bored sounding. I really want to like this game, but I can't and I can't in good conscious tell anyone else to buy it.","April 7","false","55.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The art style is cute, but after what we got in HuniePop it was also ultimately disappointing and inappropriate. Personally I like management games and overall I'm okay with what's presented. It's a basic point and click, drag and drop.\n\nIt feels like this is a game still in Beta and not really yet complete. There's no characterization for the new characters and their bios leave you with very little idea of them. I enjoyed seeing my favorite girls again so this left me with little incentive to hire the new cast. There's no story and the girls aren't even connected like they were in HuniePop. There was potential for way more fetishes.\n\nAlso it's total bs that you can only buy one condom at a time, who does that?\nI wouldn't recommend to anyone who hasn't played or wasn't a hardcore fan of Huniepop.

When my friends saw it on my Steam profile lots of them made fun of me before asking me why I liked the game. I told them the characters were attractive, not just because of their looks but their attitudes. The first game in this series is awesome, sexy, and hilarious with tons of time you can put into it and a main game that will last you awhile. This one has dialogue from one character and that's it. All the other voices are basically short sound bites. While the first was an awesome puzzle game with a lot of memorable characters and gameplay that required a lot of thought this is a simplistic clicker game with terrible businesses management mechanics. Don't bother playing this game as is if you enjoyed the first as you don't even have titillation to look forward to.

This is a very dissapointing game at this cost.  It felt lazy and incomplete.\n\nIf you can pick this up at $1 - $2 it may be worth the hours of repetative game play.\nWarning many of the positive reviews look like joke reviews so the "mostly positive" may be due to this.\n\nGame Play, 3/5\nInvest in girls Drag them to the cam studio.  If you want to increase their popularity drag them to the photography studio.  Each model has two attributes and two fetishes that they satisfy.  You can upgrade to unlock access to a adult shop which lets you add equipment to the girls, this provides the most customization in the game.  Game play takes 21 days, this translates to roughly two hours of game time.  This is fairly bland time management, but play is oddly compelling for a while.  Think of this as a clicker game without offline progress and with a deadline for trophys.\n\nGraphics, 2/5\nThe graphics are cute and functional, but you will be staring at the buildings for most of the time.  The only reason I had not given this a 1/5 is that there are unlockable hairstyles and outfits that add a reason to grind the two hours of game play.   This feels particularly dissapointing after the studio's prior game Hunie Pop with detailed sexy, stylish, characters loaded with personality.\n\nMusic/Sound 1/5\nNot much to say other than you may find yourself anoyed to hear the same handful of voice clips every few seconds.   Most of my game time was muted or toned down to be nearly mute.\n\nCoolness 1/5\nThe majority of the game play is dragging characters to buildings, and buying modifications.  This feels a bit like a clicker game without offline progress.   This is particularly dissapointing as the studio's last game was a puzzlegame/dating sim.    The women in the last game had detailed profiles and the dating sim aspect gave the characters personality.  Unless you think equiping a cake to unlock the fetish "Cake farting", and erection trophies are terribly funny, the humor falls flat . . . or at least gets dull quickly.\n\nBottom line 2/5.  If you catch 75% - 90% off you may want to pick it up to get a few hours of passable time management, but at full price there are countless better options.","April 5","false","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The art style is cute, but after what we got in HuniePop it was also ultimately disappointing and inappropriate. Personally I like management games and overall I'm okay with what's presented. It's a basic point and click, drag and drop.\n\nIt feels like this is a game still in Beta and not really yet complete. There's no characterization for the new characters and their bios leave you with very little idea of them. I enjoyed seeing my favorite girls again so this left me with little incentive to hire the new cast. There's no story and the girls aren't even connected like they were in HuniePop. There was potential for way more fetishes.\n\nAlso it's total bs that you can only buy one condom at a time, who does that?\nI wouldn't recommend to anyone who hasn't played or wasn't a hardcore fan of Huniepop.

Very disappointing\n\nI've played through 5 times, 3 on normal and 2 on hard.\nThe gameplan is very simple, get as many fans as possible during the 3 week span.\nYour rewards for doing well are different costume elements for the character of your choice. And once all of a single character's costume options you are rewarded with an illustation of them ranging from "not very" to "Okay that's a bit nsfw" on the lewd scale.\nNow my main complaints with the game aren't about the game play or the art style or questioning of why he included cake farts as a fetish.\n-The gameplay is what you would expect from a game like this, it's not very deep and can be monotonous. but again what could you expect?\n-The art is different from what everyone loved from the first game and for some people dialed down the sexiness of the characters. But in a game not focused on courting the girls and given the type of game this is and how you're barely even looking at them compared to the timers and numbers you constantly have your eyes on.\n-Cake farts is a meme fetish. shrug whatever\n\nNo the biggest problem are the rewards. For forcing ourselves through a game where we just watch numbers go up and timers tick down for what feels close to an hour I don't feel like we've been given what's due to us. Who's this game targeted to? perverts. right, what do perverts like? Girls doing lewd things and showing skin and fufiling what sick fetish we have, right.  So what are you gonna give us? Just the loading screens of each character???? Seriously? You can see those in the trailer and by just playing the game!! I wouldn't as upset if they were original works you don't see during the trailer or the loading sequences but it seems really weak given who the game is marketed to.\n\nDisappointing\n","April 7","false","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Magisey/recommended/426000/","Magisey","Sey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Magisey/","151 products in account","I want to preface this right now: If you like easy management games, you will like this. DO NOT come into this expecting anything Hunie Pop level (and I do mean anything).\n\nI've played 20.7 hrs so far as of this review, and despite not recommending it, I'll probably play more to try and get achievements and finish off the girl's wardrobes. If you look at this in money vs time, then yeah. I've definitely gotten my moneys worth. That being said, this game isn't fun and it's not very entertaining. And honestly? If I wasn't interested in supporting the devs I would have wished to never purchase it.\n\nThe problem is the game is boring. It's just... Boring. Everything about the game is lackluster. If you follow a guide, you can unlock all achievements very quickly.\n\nVoice Acting & Sound:\nThe voice acting is minimal sound bites for the girls (which is good), but Kyu who has full lines and is your tutorial is... Not into it. That's the cold open. You get a radically different (but cute) artstyle and a VA who very clearly was not into the lines. And while you shouldn't compare the characters from last game to this game, as it is a spin off, Kyu is an exception. She's the only one who speaks more than one line at a time, she's your tutorial, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and even SHE sounds bored. I really don't want to play a game where the tutorial is already bored, trying to teach me to play. Honestly, for the last 10 hrs of play I have kept my sound completely off. The noises are headache inducing when collecting (male voices going yeah and woo repeatedly) and the girls, while having funny and cute lines, just don't make up for the mind numbing music and constant sounds of doodz.\n\nGameplay:\nTypical clicker fare. This usually wouldn't be an issue, but I would have expected SOME innovation from the same devs who made Huniepop. Something new and fun to mix it up. This is just a copy-paste clicker management game. You get girls. You train girls. You get money. You keep them full of smokes and booze and STD free (as much as possible). The upgrades are run of the mill. More girls, more girls can occupy the same space, more money, and speed. That's it.\n\nSecond + playthroughs are irritating in the fact that, no matter what you do, the tutorial appears. I'd understand if the tutorial appeared if you were using a new savestate, but even if you go to a new one directly from your previous play, the tutorial pops up. There's no continuity from play A to play B and it really sucks. Something small like Kyu welcoming you back and asking if you wanted her to explain all the stuff again would have been super. Instead you have to wait about ~30-45 seconds and hear the same boring ♥♥♥ lines and set up until you get the magical 'skip all tutorials button'. And then, the tutorial that basically took 2 days out of your play and slowly unlocked buildings and upgrades as it baby stepped you into playing? It's gone and everything is unlocked. That was a shocker. There was no rebuilding up or strategy needed there.\n\nWhen you recruit girls, you're forced to pick one of the three given. Even if you were to have someone go back into the agency and recruit again, you're still met with the same 3 girls. It's annoying. Likewise, let's say I have three girls, but only 2 have done work while the other is just rotting away doing nothing, not on payroll, never on payroll. Somehow, the fans know she's there (like sharks smelling blood in water maybe?) and anything she represents (fit, teen, latina, asian, etc) now appears on the fan breakdown. This doesn't have a strong impact on the game itself, but it breaks the continuity again. It's a minor detail that bugs me.\n\nArtwork:\nIt's cute. I adore it. I like the fact that you earn coins to unlock new hairstyles and clothes. So that's about the only perk I see and why I still play this.\n\nConclusion:\nI didn't expect Huniepop and I think anyone downvoting this game for not being Huniepop are being assinine. This isn't the same game. However, being made by the same devs, I would expect some innovation and an eye for detail. One reviewer put it well when calling this a weird newgrounds knock off, because that's what it feels like. This FEELS like a free game. It PLAYS like a free game. There's nothing here that knocks my socks off or makes me want to tell my friends. It's a typical clicker management where even the tutorial is bored sounding. I really want to like this game, but I can't and I can't in good conscious tell anyone else to buy it.","April 7","false","55.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Using only the mouse to control the game hurts it, I have a disability that makes it hard for me to move my arm and hand a lot.

If this game had keyboard support and key control it'd be 110% better of a game. I'm not that big a fan of the mannagement games but this 1 was fun for the first playthrough, idk about anymore playthough. I think what made it enjoyable for me was the leveling up the girls to do better then having 1 girl to do all the shopping for you. I'm not sure though, sadly due to my own physical disability I can't recommend this game due to the major lack of fun I had due to no keyboard support.\n\nP.S. This game is listed as having nudity like Huniepop but this one has none, there's a lot of sexual humor such as in buying the sex toys for cam kinks.

I like the idea of adult-themed games done with comedy being it’s primary intention, which I believe is what they were attempting here, but it managed to fall short of actually engaging me. The game’s methods and styles are much more suited to mobile devices than a PC and I feel that on that style of platform, this game and games of it’s type would probably do extremely well. On PC however, the game is left wanting."\n\nSee my full review here:\nhttps://youtu.be/lJBpclCFWXA","April 9","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead of playing Bejewelled you are now playing a cam girl and prostitution tycoon.\nWhile playthroughs of a single save file last 2-3 hours, you still have achievements and unlockable outfits to keep you coming back like with HuniePop. But despite that, this game is still split down the middle with some people, mainly due to this game being completely different to HuniePop gameplay wise. I don't have any gripes with the game but I'm not saying everyone who enjoyed HuniePop will enjoy this, because this requires a whole lot more patience and it's also a different game now.\nI've found it's a good game to play when you want to just take it easy and listen to music, that's how I've spent most of my hours so far playing.\nAnd no, don't go in expecting full uncensored naked ladies, all you'll get is TV-14 art of the girl's covered asses. So if you played HuniePop for the nude waifus, you're gonna be disappointed with this game because it's a whole lot more lenient when it comes to nudity.\nI give this a 7/10 overall.","April 9","true","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With HuniePop, even if you were to take all the images of attractive girls and suggestive sounds out of the game, it would still be able to stand up on its own as a good game. It had a fun gameplay loop, good powerups that created a myriad of interesting strategic combinations, and interesting (if poorly voice acted) variety of characters.\n\nThis game...functionally, it may as well be a reskin of the management sim clicker that you've played a dozen times elsewhere. Sure, there is some middling levels of strategy of where you send the characters to at what point in time and which buildings you speed up, but the bottom line is that this just isn't a very fun or interesting game to play. You click-and-drag, then you click, and you click, and you click some more. Oh, and you can give the girls cocaine to make them (somehow) complete cam shows twice as quickly without financial penalty.\nEven the characters have been made entirely dull, as all personality has been sandblasted off and replaced with a small blurb that is displayed when you recruit them and a couple of bulletpoints that describe their looks. Though, those aren't even consistent with HuniePop (e.g. Nikki's C-cup chest is described as "big ♥♥♥♥")...which begs the question of why they recycled the characters in the first place.\n\nIn short, while there is nothing necessarily egregious or wrong with the game, it's not really worth your time.","April 9","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have 21 game days to collect as many fans as possible.\nI wish to forewarn you the game is extremely repetitive, pick a girl drag her to a building hold mouse button or click on that building to speed time up for everyone in that building. thats about all there is too it.\nIts simple enough to get all the achievements (took me about 8 hours - without reading any guides as there were none on day 1; today you could spend 10 mins reading a guide play a couple of games and have all the achievements.\nSo for such a repetitive game how can i clock up 70+ hours? i keep trying to go just that little bit further and beat my previous score, but i seem to have hit a wall around 360K.

I had a lot of fun playing it for a week, 4 hours a day. It's frustrating but it's also addicting. It starts off slow and gets more frantic as time goes by The graphics are here and there. The humor and sexiness is hit and miss. The girls range from disturbingly child like to gorgeous. It seems like the developers liked MILFs the best because they look the sexiest. There's no nudity but that's forgivable considering some of the girls.\n\nThe sex fetishes are a weird mix. Cat ears don't make a girl furry. What the heck is cake farting? To me they missed their chance to make smoking a fetish, because that's a thing. The other thing that makes me cringe are the drugs. I didn't think the drugs were funny or cool. The coke could be replaced with an energy drink for what it does. The addiction part of it isn't addressed and that's sad.\n\nYou can also ♥♥♥♥♥ out your girls by putting them in a sleazy motel. If they don't have a condom they will get STDs. Frankly, I always got the condom because STDs are gross and dealing with them is a pain. That part of the game could have been better. I would have maybe done one a day porn shoots instead and dump the STD mechanic.\n\nI would buy a sequel to this if they made one. I'd like to see another type of game like this with more options.

The polish that was in Huniepop is here.\n\nBut... it's a very straightforward Diner Dash/Clicker hybrid (Very light on the clicker, you click, but only to make a station go faster or collect loot produced by a station, holding is an option and upgrades will reduce the clicks, but you don't click to infinity like you would in every other clicker, nor is the game fully automated like every other clicker as well.) with an endgame even more degenerate than the subject matter.\n\nFor the early game, it's a rush, juggling between girls, hiring decisions, making your budget, staying stocked in smokes and booze. But that phase ends pretty quick as you get to the late game engine which is an incredibly simple engine crank, but to even describe it would SPOIL THE GAME'S SOLE STRATEGY. Even at about 1.5 hours a run and high score chasing, that's still a bit long. There are a couple of challenges in the cheevos but nothing relating to the game changes meaningfully at all with those so...\n\nI enjoyed it, but I am not going to break it out again after clearing it twice. Huniepop was pretty simple, but there was a lot of engagement with building a great combo engine and the tension of trying to get it to work in the moves you had. Huniecam does not have that.\n\nStill, immaculately polished and charming fun, but it is not going to last you long at all.","April 6","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just wish it was longer.\n\nBottom line: if you just want Huniepop 2, don't buy this. If you want a short fun time with a tycoon game, then do buy it. It's really good for what it is. Just a little short.","April 6","true","4.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

You manage a bunch of camwh.. girls who later give "special shows" to STD riddled Rich viewers.\nLike HuniePop you get pretty often insulted for playing the game and that's it... yes. After this you replay the whole thing again, same in same out. You can now go for achievements or just for the perfect score. But it pretty much stays the same.\n\nWhen I bought the game I hoped for some "Starting at the bottom, now we're here"-story. But it's more like keeping the business for some demented tutor girl, who has no time doing things but keeps around all the time anyway.\n\nTL;DR: THERE IS LITERALLY NO REPLAY VALUE WHATSOEVER.","April 4","false","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you've played Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, or the like, this is a slightly more advanced take on that, but instead of taking days or weeks to win, it takes about an hour and a half. There isn't much in the way of replayability here, and it's pretty easy. On my first playthrough I got the second to best trophy available, and on my second, I unlocked every girl in the game. I would be OK recommending this game if it had some more content, like pin ups you could win or something, but as it stands, you can unlock outfits, and the pictures displayed on the loading screens, which is something I guess, but not enough in my opinion. At least, not enough if the main game only lasts 90 minutes.","April 4","false","6.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In my opinion HuniePop is much better.\nAchievements & Trading Cards : This game does have some pros though. It's got achievements (Which help a ton and give more reasons to play for people like me) and Trading Cards (Which again, give more reasons to play for people like me)\n\nAll in all, this game is alright.

Only tutorial.\n\n- Can be addicting if you like going for high-score\n\n- Low price( though appropriate for only this much content )\n\n- Game is a bit too fast-paced and requires almost Starcraft levels of micro to go for competetive high scores.\n\n- I didn't encounter any bugs\n\n- The best trophy(100k fans) is a bit too easy to get. I got it in 3 hours and there isn't much else to do( unless you have friends to compare scores ). More difficult achievements could be added to increase play time.\n\n- I suspect many people won't like the art style. Not sexy.\n\n\nIn summary, this is a Facebook-like shallow business simulation but if you have some friends to compare high scores with, it can be fun for a while. It requires some skill to come up with an optimal strategy and execute it properly so it may appeal to non-casual gamers also, but only for a short while since there isn't much depth to the game. You can probably expect 3 to 10 hours of fun from this. If you like the genre, I believe the game is worth the price so I'm giving a thumbs up.","April 4","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its definately a unique idea and supposed to be a parody but its a shame where some things could have more time and detail invested into it.","April 4","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That having been said, it's still a clicker game. Unlike most, there is a challenge by way of budget and deadline. Figuring the game's mechanics out and how to best make use of them is a fun puzzle. However, once you have, the game quickly loses replay value as there is a pretty solid formula to high-scoring.\n\nThe toon art is high-quality, if the style is a bit jarring. The UI is sleek and easy to interact with though is too reminiscent of facebook or mobile games for some to be comfortable seeing it in a paid PC product. The voice acting is, as in Hunie Pop, top-tier.\n\nIf you're a fan of HuniePop's setting or characters, you won't find much elaboration on them here. The character's personalities have been condensed to a single sentence blurb description and a few simple voice quips. HuniePop's brilliant humor is present all-throughout what little there is, though. The new characters seem like a lot of fun and I hope to see them again in future Huniepot games, hopefully fleshed out a bit more.\n\nOn the whole, my reception to this game is very mixed. I wish I I could give a neutral or "maybe" rating. If you come in expecting too much, you'll definitely be disappointed, but I had a fairly good couple hours with it. But as I saidm once you master the game the replay value drops off. I may still play this again if I have nothing better to do for an hour or two. (It really does feel like it belongs on mobile, in that regard.)\n\ntl;dr A fairly deep clicker game that presents a fun puzzle to solve once, but only once.

THERE ISN'T ANY!\n\nHuniepop was different from other match-3 games because of two main things: Well drawn scantily clad anime waifus and a decent amount of well written self-conscious diaglogue. The first of these things drew people in and the second kept them playing because they realised that this game had some actual effort put into it.\n\nHunicam however has barely any dialogue, mostly just Kyu's tutorial which is delivered fairly half-assedly.  The meat of the game trys to keep you invloved by forcing you to click buildins whilst you're managing your girls, but honestly it's just boring. And i like management games! I was really looking forward to the idea of this game, but it's just not enjoyable to play.\n\nSorry Huniepot, you're one of my favourite developers but i didn't like the way you decided to go with this game.

HunieCam Studio\n\nDISCLAIMER: Game was provided free of charge as I was a backer for HuniePop. I initially never intended on buying this game because I don't usually play games like this.\n\nTycoon games aren't really my thing and neither is clicking a bunch of things in quick succession to get resources and stuff but that's what HunieCam Studios tells you to do. This will be a short review, as there isn't much to review, so I'll make it snappy.\n\nMechanics are good for a what's essentially a clicker / management hybrid game. Unlike games like Cookie Clicker, there is a fail state, so there's also a bit of resource management as well.\n\nAudio is decent. I never really noticed it, but when I sat down and listened to the music, it was entertaining for a little bit.\n\nVoice work is very basic but works for the game. Audrey is still a ♥♥♥♥♥. Who would've guessed?\n\nArt style is probably the biggest point of contention and actually has turned a lot of people from buying this game. The art style isn't bad for what this game is. Since there's no 18+ patch, you won't be getting cartoon caricatures of the female form.\n\nProbably the best thing about the game are the "DOPE ♥♥♥ dick trophies" you get for doing better. The game is entertaining to play but is actually decently difficult to get the higher trophy milestones. On my first playthrough, I got a bronze flaccid ♥♥♥♥ trophy from Kyu.\n\nTL;DR\n\n- Game has no glaring flaws or bugs,\n- Art style may not be my liking, but it's not bad for the game,\n- Audio isn't bad and voice acting works for the game\n- Play the game to win those ♥♥♥♥ trophies and hold the ♥♥♥♥ing diamond trophy above your head and proclaim to the heavens that your ♥♥♥♥ is truly the largest in the world.\n- Audrey is still a ♥♥♥♥♥. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nThis has been a Robot Maid Review. Thank you for reading.","April 5","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It supports the Dev's, shows them that their work is appreciated and liked. They could've done tons of things better with this game, but for 7 Euro its completely fine.\n\nGet it on a sale and you can't go wrong at all.

The main concepts are easy to grasp, but the game gains in complexity progressively making it harder and harder to micro-manage the actions of your girls accurately. The vices and the stress levels of the girls will make it harder and harder to get things done in a timely fashion if you don't pay attention. As you might expect, balancing the actions of the girls with their cost and the desires of their fans will not get easier as their numbers increase... and with the escort service introduced later in the game you even have to watch out for STD's.\n\nI did enjoy the fact that the vices of each girl can evolve, not only based on the objects you can give them, but also based on their actions. Overall, I kinda disliked the whole "clicker" aspect. I would have much rather liked something with only straight sim management.\n\nThe music is nothing to write home about, unlike the bombastic music that was used on the first reveal trailer (and that incidentally motivated me to keep an eye out for this game). It's okay but won't motivate me to ask for the OST separately.\n\nI noticed that a lot of people didn't like the art style, even back when the game was first announced. I'm one of the people who actually enjoyed it more than what was done on HuniePop. If anything, it's pretty tame compared to what we saw in the first trailer.\n\nAll in all I'd say it's a decent game that may be a bit too expensive for its own good.","April 6","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is the outlook with which I played this game, and it is sadly where I find the game most lacking. Whilst the outspoken and highly recognizable cast of the first game is present (at least for the most part, judging by a first play through), they are reduced to simple statistics in a much greater sense.\n\nThe cast only expresses itself through grunts or short sentances to mark completion of a task, refusal to act, and so on; there is no direct interaction whatsoever. Meanwhile the new characters, with only a few exceptions, appear lackluster or just plain absurdly designed. (The haywire design of Zoey springs to mind.) Kyu herself is present, but only to give you a basic rundown of the mechanics, and comment on your performance upon completion. In short, the characters of HuniePop are present in name only, and the cast in generall brings little of interest to the table.\n\nMechanically, this is a timed resource management game, where collecting earned resources has been made tedious just to push another few linear upgrade trees on the player. Ultimately, the threat of bancrupcy is faint, and only emergent if you push yourself for a highscore. To my knowledge, it would be fully possible to "comlete" the game with an unleveled starting character, just bouncing back and forth between three buildings. Mechanically there is little to no replay value; the difference between the starting characters you will be offered is typically miniscule. In its predecessor, this was counteracted by the surprisingly well developed (albeit stereotypical) characters. With that aspect lacking, Hunie Cam Studios offers basically no reason to replay the game, beyond visual unlocks what you won't pay any attention to, or achievments.\n\nThis is not a game for me personable, and I'm leaning more towards going back to HuniePop, but if you're interested in getting the game, let me leave you with a tip:\n\nDon't overstock your characters on items; a character can only equip three items and, to my knowledge, these lock in. Having a free slot for consumables (cocaine and condoms especially) can be very usefull.","April 7","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm glad they managed to bring back the old girls of HuniePop (with the exception of Momo, Celeste, and Venus). While it can get a bit tedious, wanting to beat your fan scores kind of make it worth it to see just how high you can go. Though, I kind of wished that there were more achievements to the game. I know, I know, 16 is a LOT of achievements, but there are a few others that would have been pretty cool.\n\nExamples could be something like:\n\nSell Out - Get Platinum by gaining fans using only promos\nAlcohol Anarchy - Get Gold with a staff of alcoholics without using the wine box or basket\nDiamond Standard - Get Diamond on all save files\n\nSomething like those, I think it'd be kind of cool and give the achievement completionists, like me, a little bit more of a challenge, I guess?\n\nBut anyway, back to the game. It's not for EVERYONE, but if you're into mobile games (which, let's be honest, this reminds me of one) or you have the patience for it, this game is worth it. I think the new art style is pretty cute and at the very least I can play the game without worrying TOO much about passing people behind me, since it looks like an innocent game at a GLANCE (during gameplay at least, since the character and title screens aren't so innocent XD)\n\nBut yeah...long story short, if you're into ♥♥♥♥♥ trophies and heart eyes (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), this game is for you!","April 14","true","36.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bought Huniecam Studio's, loved it as well. Again, simple mechanics in a game isn't always bad, It's actually kind of nice not having to learn many new and complex things when in reality the game shouldn't require it, and that's where this game shines. I like it so far, and think I was pleasantly surprised to see this game actually be fun. I like the artstyle once I started playing it, even though it wasn't what I was used to and that's saying something, because before this game came out, I really didn't like it.

It's really not worth spending money on.\n\nI was somewhat invested in this game since it's announcement. I loved HuniePop, so I was expecting more of the same in the future. The first trailer, I had a reaction many of us had. "What is with this art style?" Given, I don't think it's a terrible art style, I just have a few issues with it. I felt it wasn't going to make good porn, it strayed from the anime style people enjoyed with HuniePop, and god I hate the heart pupils. Made comments on Steam and Twitter about it, voted in official polls (which turned out, the overwhelming majority hated the style), and in the end they still wanted to go with the toon style. Okay, whatever, maybe the game can still be good, right? Eventually we all learned it wasn't going to have any porn at all. At that point, I pretty much don't care about the art style...but it seemed weird to go in this direction from the devs who made HuniePop, and the setting of the game.\n\nMoving forward to the actual game, now that it's released...\nHuge disappointment, as expected. The art style can be ignored as I mentioned, but damn the gameplay is not very exciting. It's an okay time saver, but...it's what I would expect from a Free to Play Clicker Game. It has less features than your average clicker game, it has no long-term goals because it has an end point, and there's no rewarding feelings at all. They slapped on HuniePop characters, added lower-quality characters, made it a sexual theme and concluded "this will sell."\n\nI have no idea how this game took so long to develop. You see the entire game within an hour of gameplay, the rest is just repeating until it's over. I had a ton of complaints about how the gameplay flows and how the UI works/doesn't work.\n\nHopefully the next game (if they continue) HuniePot pushes out will be more like their first. I don't care if it's HuniePop 2 or what, but HuniePop had a good angle. I regret buying this game, I'll probably play it for achievements while I queue in other games, then put it on the shelf forever.","April 6","false","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find it humorous, and while being a sexual game, it also seems to have a sense of laughing at itself, and the whole idea of this mess.

The main concepts are easy to grasp, but the game gains in complexity progressively making it harder and harder to micro-manage the actions of your girls accurately. The vices and the stress levels of the girls will make it harder and harder to get things done in a timely fashion if you don't pay attention. As you might expect, balancing the actions of the girls with their cost and the desires of their fans will not get easier as their numbers increase... and with the escort service introduced later in the game you even have to watch out for STD's.\n\nI did enjoy the fact that the vices of each girl can evolve, not only based on the objects you can give them, but also based on their actions. Overall, I kinda disliked the whole "clicker" aspect. I would have much rather liked something with only straight sim management.\n\nThe music is nothing to write home about, unlike the bombastic music that was used on the first reveal trailer (and that incidentally motivated me to keep an eye out for this game). It's okay but won't motivate me to ask for the OST separately.\n\nI noticed that a lot of people didn't like the art style, even back when the game was first announced. I'm one of the people who actually enjoyed it more than what was done on HuniePop.

Low in rewards, very high on grind.\n\nIt seemed like Huniecam was a long time coming - and its release seems to have fallen a bit flat.\n\nWhile many of the elements of Huniepop - specifically the characters and humor - are in the game, there aren't many substantial rewards for completing parts of the game. You grind each set of 21 days out to get tokens for hairstyles and outfits. It's a maddening rush to day 21, hoping to score some coins for the hairstyles and outfits.\n\nWhile the game seems to run better than Huniepop, the success of Huniepop should have extended the scope of this game, and it seems like it was to get a clicking time-management strategy game out the door. Interactions with the girls are absent, the amount of lewdness or pics is toned down.\n\nI can't reccomend as it stands at release.

I'm sorry guys.\n\nI really enjoyed HuniePop. It's 'spiritual successor', though I know it isn't supposed to be a sequel or anything... isn't as much as I hoped it would be.\n\n1.) Depth\nThe character depth is lacking - I wish there had been more storyline other than 'get views'. I wish that we could see more art in the actual game than when we're exiting or entering it. I really wanted to feel like I had some kind of connection to the characters. I felt like I was experiencing the game through a brick wall.\n\n2.) Reward\nWhile I'm clicking, it doesn't really feel like there's a reward to spurn me onward, no, "oh, hey! YAY! I get a picture of x! This makes the clicking seem worth it." The only reward was whatever trophy you received from the viewers and maybe, POSSIBLY an achievement.\n\n3.) Timing\nThe time frame of the game is really what has disappointed me most - I know Kyu said there were 21 days to reach the goal, but I didn't think that was the ONLY goal to be reached. I thought there would be a tier level system, where you had deadlines to earn each trophy before the axe was swung. Honestly I have no idea how ANYONE could get the diamond trophy without some type of cheat. The more girls you get, the more any type of strategy applied devolves and becomes a mass of panic and a race of cigarettes and booze. Twenty-one days isn't nearly enough to achieve anything. I haven't been able to even achieve the first trophy level.\n\nYeah, you can keep playing that save file after the 21 days, but what's the point if there is no reward and all you get is a 'try again'? It sucked.\n\n4.) Shopping\nAnother thing that bothered me about the timing is how long it would take the girls to go shop at the store. Picking up 20 or more cigarettes is no big deal - it can take ten in-game minutes if you click fast enough... but buying ONE condom can take EIGHT hours if you don't click? I know that part of the game is risking the seedy hotel. I don't want to risk, I WANT to play it safe and having to wait/click through to MAYBE get the chance to pick ONE condom is the absolute worst.\n\nAs a suggestion, why not make condoms a 3-pack like actual retail stores? I don't think that would break the game, especially if it was bound to one character until all three were used and it had a cool-down (like spell casting in other games). I'd really like to justify making trips to the store, I really, really would. This totally subtracted from my gaming experience.\n\n5.) Art\nOn a positive note, while others don't seem to like it...  I love the art! I love when artists branch out from their previous style and introduce something new. Lailani is a sweetheart - she's my favorite design. I love the bold colors of her outfits and her obviously Hawaiian theme.","April 11","false","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish there was more to do in it. Even though the cast of characters was bigger, I still felt like they could have included more. More characters, costumes and photos would have been great unlockables. Thankfully, Rockhard mode is out. I hope these guys continue the Hunie franchise.

The game changes to a more idle and upgrade type of game. Unlike the first Huniepop however it doesn't have too much content. For example in the first Huniepop you could unlock more girls. While in this rendition you have a total of 20 girls all who are unlocked at the start. You only need to recruit them to unlock them which takes virtually no time or effeort on the player's part. Aside from some clothing there is not much you can unlock.\n\nHowever I would still recommend this game. Not to previous Huniepop players. I would recommend this as a casual distraction for a couple of hours or two. It not a bad game by anymeans (It can be quite diffcult if your not paying attenion). Its certainly not for everyone but if you are a fan of idle upgrade games this is a good game for you.

Love 'em. I loved HuniePop, so I, of course, had to try HunieCam Studio. Here's the number one thing that bugs me: HuniePop was cute, and while you were a rather creepy womanizer, it was personal. This?\n\nThis is straight up human trafficking.\n\nIt's so much less personal and interactive with the girls, and the fact that things like cocaine and STDs are involved just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I get it. It's a management sim. It's a broad picture, and it's not meant to be personal.  But some stuff was simply unnecessary. Maybe it's a level of individual comfort. Maybe I shouldn't be playing this game because of that, and leave it to the people who it doesn't bother. It lacks the (admittedly questionable) charm of the original HuniePop, and, at least to me, has a dark undertone that just leaves me feeling remarkably more uneasy than one lame dude getting it on with nine girls, a cat, an alien, and a fairy. It's not like they're trying to hide that it's disgusting, but declaring the fact that it's deplorable doesn't make it any less so.\n\nThe mechanics of the game aren't my favourite--the timer runs rather quickly, and it stresses me out like nobody's business, especially when I have to decide whether to collect or to speed things up. They're not awful, but they're not stellar. They neither make nor break the game. They're completely unremarkable, honestly.\n\nOf course, there's no satisfaction like watching numbers climb at an exponential rate, so I'll most likely keep playing it, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little upsetting.","April 6","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game changes to a more idle and upgrade type of game. Unlike the first Huniepop however it doesn't have too much content. For example in the first Huniepop you could unlock more girls. While in this rendition you have a total of 20 girls all who are unlocked at the start. You only need to recruit them to unlock them which takes virtually no time or effeort on the player's part. Aside from some clothing there is not much you can unlock.\n\nHowever I would still recommend this game. Not to previous Huniepop players. I would recommend this as a casual distraction for a couple of hours or two. It not a bad game by anymeans (It can be quite diffcult if your not paying attenion). Its certainly not for everyone but if you are a fan of idle upgrade games this is a good game for you. I'd give this game a 6/10 not bad but not super deep.","April 11","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm glad they managed to bring back the old girls of HuniePop (with the exception of Momo, Celeste, and Venus). While it can get a bit tedious, wanting to beat your fan scores kind of make it worth it to see just how high you can go. Though, I kind of wished that there were more achievements to the game. I know, I know, 16 is a LOT of achievements, but there are a few others that would have been pretty cool.\n\nExamples could be something like:\n\nSell Out - Get Platinum by gaining fans using only promos\nAlcohol Anarchy - Get Gold with a staff of alcoholics without using the wine box or basket\nDiamond Standard - Get Diamond on all save files\n\nSomething like those, I think it'd be kind of cool and give the achievement completionists, like me, a little bit more of a challenge, I guess?\n\nBut anyway, back to the game. It's not for EVERYONE, but if you're into mobile games (which, let's be honest, this reminds me of one) or you have the patience for it, this game is worth it. I think the new art style is pretty cute and at the very least I can play the game without worrying TOO much about passing people behind me, since it looks like an innocent game at a GLANCE (during gameplay at least, since the character and title screens aren't so innocent XD)\n\nBut yeah...long story short, if you're into ♥♥♥♥♥ trophies and heart eyes (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), this game is for you!","April 14","true","36.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked honey pop  Becase It had   great voice acting  .\n\nThe   sales video is a bit misleading  in that  it shows the loading screens . Unlike honey pop  there  are no converstional choices with the  game sprites  and the majority of the audio for the game sprites is taken directley from the honey pop sound track . Its   a  clicker game which uses sound bits from honey pop   .  There where some oportunitys  for  some interesting adult humor in this game which where missed by the game author .    For example you can  send a girl to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ herself at the sleezy  hotel   but it does not matter what you click on  the game sprite gives you just her catch phrase .\n\nThis is  just  a  fast cash money grab    to take advantage of honey pop fans\n\nThe game also insults you in the process  as a joke\none of the first lines in the game is  this " Lets be 100 % here this is the   olny interaction your getting with girls "\n\nsee picture link  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665138906\n\n\nLike the game  being repeted  the joke    About honey pop fans is repeted     the start of the sales pitch  for this game  the author warns you that this would not be great materal to  masturbate  ie fap to\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/426000/\n\nI do realise both of these are meant as a joke  but the joke is the same one .

As a clicker game it is ok.

On the second playthrough, I knew what to expect and how to succeed over my past playthrough, and I found myself having more fun and trying things I never did before, which was a fun learning experience itself.\n\nFor those who are sceptical about the game, it's dirt cheap.

The game pacing is done pretty well and the resource management aspect is well designed. Unfortunately there seems to be a optimal strategy if you look into these numbers. It'd be better if the developers introduce more random events into the game and make it more like FTL. Currently the only elements of randomness are:girls for hire, ads, STD, and inventories.

THERE ISN'T ANY!\n\nHuniepop was different from other match-3 games because of two main things: Well drawn scantily clad anime waifus and a decent amount of well written self-conscious diaglogue. The first of these things drew people in and the second kept them playing because they realised that this game had some actual effort put into it.\n\nHunicam however has barely any dialogue, mostly just Kyu's tutorial which is delivered fairly half-assedly.  The meat of the game trys to keep you invloved by forcing you to click buildins whilst you're managing your girls, but honestly it's just boring. And i like management games! I was really looking forward to the idea of this game, but it's just not enjoyable to play.\n\nSorry Huniepot, you're one of my favourite developers but i didn't like the way you decided to go with this game.

It's not much, but the voice acting has plenty of snark and nuance.\n\nThe only complaint I have about the game is the short format. It's not cumulative in nature (besides the extra outfits and hairstyles you can get with the points you earn at the end of each game. That said, it's given me plenty of reason to go in again and try to get as many points as possible.","April 5","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GodSpeedEdge/recommended/426000/","GodSpeedEdge","GodspeedEdge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GodSpeedEdge/","55 products in account","A short clicker game with LOTS of adult references and HEAVY sex humor. You spend most of your time interacting with buildings, icons, and text. It isn't bad per se, it's well made and feels like the devs took their time to complete it.\n\nThe game is painfully short, each run takes about an hour and a half. After your second run, you'll likely have fleshed out the entire game. With about 2.5 hours clocked, I enjoyed it and its humor a great deal but feel like their could have been more to it. Namely, I would have liked to see more interaction with the girls and to have had more than the 21 days you are given to build Kyu's Porno Empire.\n\nHunieCam Studio delivers the same parody of the fanservice dating-sim genre as HuniePop before it did, this time taking the sexual references to 11. You can't go more than a few seconds without seeing a ♥♥♥♥♥ on screen or reading a promo for ♥♥♥♥ fetishes. If you've been around the block on the Internet, you'll most likely get a chuckle from it and sometimes you'll have to pause the game to laugh a good minute.\n\nUnfortunately for such a fanservicey game, there's no sexuality or nudity on screen ever. It would have been nice to have a bonus mode after landing a Big ♥♥♥♥ Trophy (Yes! You get ♥♥♥♥ Trophies!) where you can interact with the actual camgirls doing their thing. But for 6 bucks, it is what it is. It's also a bummer to have no bejeweled-styled sex puzzle games, but there's always hype for HuniePop 2 some day.\n\nIf you want some dirty laughs and to work out your clicking muscles for a few hours, or to catch up on your Hunie Waifus, give this game a go. If you're more of a Puritan looking for an in-depth management game, Roller Coaster Tycoon World or Punch Club are much greater adventures to be had.\n\nI'm mixed to give this game a recommendation, but Koons is a great guy who isn't afraid of making dirty games, which is much needed in this era of fear of objectifying anyone and anything. I recommend HunieCam Studio with high hopes that this series will continue to grow.","April 5","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed Huniepop, you'd  probably like this game too.  The artstyle is more "cartoonish" than Huniepop, and despite the synopsis, there is very little in terms of nudity or sex. Some still frames outline the labia, but that is pretty much it.\nA single game usually takes about an hour or two, during which your score is based on how many "fans" you've managed to recruit. There is a lot of depth when it comes to strategy; Huniecam is essentially a time/money management game.

Because this game was enjoyable for me, but I can easily understand why other people might not like it. Other reviews compare the gameplay to Farmville, and call it a clicker game. Which I hadn't thought about while playing it, but I can agree with as descriptors.\n\nI expected and assumed I was enjoying the gameplay because of its label as being a business management game, but it was probably more due to that addictive quality clicker and Facebook games tend to have.\n\nThe gameplay really doesn't get too complicated. There's not much time management involved, either. It's just making money and earning fans, but if you have any understanding of the mechanics it shouldn't be hard to at least stay afloat. Like I said, it acts like a Facebook or clicker game, so that's the bulk of the gameplay. Directing girls to do tasks that raise your various types of numbers. Each game is limited to 21 days, which I think is a good amont of time both because of the repetitive gameplay as well as ensuring there's a challenge.\n\nAs for story, very little beyond what you can find out from the Steam page. You manage a group of girls earning money through sex work. There's also extremely limited expression in personality from the girls, save their little bio paragraph and whatever one-liners they say when you direct them to do tasks. And yet, I ended up being attached to and having preferences for specific girls, just because they were cute and how they sounded in those limited amount of lines. But, like, I'm just a huge lesbian so it's not like there needed to be much to make me like the girls. They're just all so cuuuuute. I played this game before I played HuniePop, so this game became my first impression of the 8 main HuniePop characters who are in HunieCam Studio.\n\nOf course, because of their functionality in HunieCam Studio, the HuniePop girls' personalities vary from a little to extremely different from HuniePop. If you're attached to how they were presented in HuniePop, this might be annoying, but like I said, HunieCam Studio is my first impression of them, so I don't actually care if they're different.\n\nI've seen some criticism of the art. It's heavily stylized, kind of has a part chibi, part cartoon thing going on. Personally I prefer this art style over HuniePop's. I think it's better done, too. I tended to notice anatomical errors in the HuniePop art, and overall it just didn't really do it for me. Again just a personal thing, but I found the girls cuter and more endearing with this art style than I did HuniePop's.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I like it. I feel like I can be easily pleased though, and I don't find many reasons to dislike games most of the time. Maybe you won't like it though, if you don't like Farmville-type games or clicker games. Or if you're still on the fence, wait for a sale, because maybe $6.99 isn't quite worth it in that case.","April 23","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me start off by saying that I don't think I have ever played a "tycoon" game so I thought it would be fairly difficult.  With my first try I did fail by being in debt two days in a row but after that I beat the game in two hours.  Like most people I am very disappointed in the 21 day time limit as there doesn't feel to be a reason to mess around with the city after.  I played 3 times and on the third I got the bronze trophy but after that I had a sudden "Meh why bother" feeling at trying to get any other trophies.  I think that the only thing that pushed me to get the bronze was the fact I had paid for it. The game play, at first, feels fast pace as you try to balance making money with upgrades and investments but at some point it simply becomes mechanical (put her here, put her there).  Like most people I've played huniepop and loved it but I understand the developers desire to expand into other game catagories.  It's not a bad game it simply is a disappointing game.  I'm not talking about the art or the concept but simply the lace of incentive to replay more than a couple times, the singular goal that, once completed, you're done, no ifs ands or buts.

Let it sink in that an asexual female has wasted that much time with this game.\n\nIt's no HuniePop, certainly, but I enjoyed the hell out of it. I pulled an all-nighter trying to get all of the achievements (which I still haven't quite managed). The character designs are cute. The voice acting can get a bit repetitive (and in the case of certain characters is flat-out annoying to begin with), but my fondness for the original Huniepop girls (and the relaxing background music) stopped me from muting my computer.\n\nHuniepot clearly cares about the games they make, and the love they put in makes me love them, as well.

Basically, this could be considered a watered down tycoon game, but it is a fun, silly, and surpisingly addicting take on these kind of games.\n\nYou run a cam girl company, and make a ton of fans with your line up of girl streamers.... yeah.\n\nYou have 21 days to run this business and get a grade at the end of the days, ranging from bronze to diamond depending on the amount of fans you have at the end of day 21. You can still play after the 21 days on that save file too if you want.\n\nAfter my first 21 days, finding out how to get closer and closer to that *cough* wonderful diamond trophy felt rewarding. The game doesn't give a super obvious hint on how to become op enough for the diamond, so coming up with a plan that works FeelsGoodMan.\n\nBUT, this game does kinda bite the dust after getting around the 7th playthrough or so (at leas for me) where it's the same thing over again, and I had a good idea how to make this experience easy. So, as a result, it was sort of a grind for the last few achievements. But it didn't really bother me that much, I was still engaged in the game. ( And they added a Rock Hard Mode as an update for those people who were dank memers in this game. Gj HuniePot)\n\nSo, I do recommend this game if you want a short and fun experience.

It's a "see how high you can get the numbers before two hours" game. You can go in an free ball it or you can actually think economically (shocking to hear for this kind of game, yes I know) by managing which girls you hire to see if their traits match each other to earn more or how much they cost. There's also items that give them new traits to make them immune to debuffs/STD's and drugs to make them do things faster.\n\nGirls in question range from the black weaboo to sexy asian teacher to indian house wife to russian dominatrix and nearly everything between. Though you don't see them at work, the small tidbit of backstory you can see on their stat cards matches the amount of content in this game as well as the price. That's if you're actually interested in 2d waifus or whatever.\n\nTL: DR It's a time sink with two hours per-game to race to the highscore. Don't expect nudity, this is totally PG 13 material.

The mechanics of it are decent and smooth, very simple - you recruit girls to make money for you through cam shows, and you gain fans from having your girls take pictures. You spend money and make money in turns.\n\nUnfortunately, while there is a cast of recurring and new characters and the mechanics are kept simple, its a very short, very skimpy game. You're given 21 days to have your girls get as many fans as possible, and once those 21 days are up, that's it, game over for that save file. You're told to either go back and start again to earn more tokens so you can change the many girls' wardrobes (which is also fine), or continue to play on the same file for fun.\n\nYou end up with a game that cuts you off at the knees just as things are getting good, and that's frustrating in its own way. I would like to see more added to HunieCam, but more than likely that's a dream that's never coming true.\n\nOverall, a disappointing game, but not the worst one out there. 5/10.","April 7","false","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is really simle to get the hang of. You have to pay the girls money bc they re working for you, but they get more cash in then they can take if you pay attention, plus you can train them, 1 way is to get more money from cam shows and the other leveling way is for the fans that you get after each photo shoot, but leveling them up you will have to get them more money as you would if this was some how real.\n\nYou get to buy perks, investing, and they help you out alot, plus you get to buy promo's which will get you a fast number of fans but at a cost. You may have up to 8 girls going at once and they will all come with their own " fetish", this is the way the put their fan bases around, some people like small girls, some like large ones, some to glasses, and some to "cake farting", the promo youget will tell you which fan base it is for.\n\nill leave the rest out for you all to find and learn about, this is just some simple things in this game.\n\nI do recommend buying this game, it can kill time, the acheivments are somewhat easy to get, and its really fun if you are into shop type of games.\n\n10/10","April 9","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no depth to this game. It is not impossible to go from new to this game to a virtual master (obtaining the most challenging trophy) in two 1.5 hour playthroughs. If you want a fun (and free) clicker game, try Time Clickers.\n\nThere is no story other than a couple of sentences about building a cam empire. In terms of characters, it is quite possibly the most disappointing aspect of the game. HuniePop had a cast of memorable characters that encouraged attachment, or at the very least, your attention. These characters return in HunieCam Studio, but they have been robbed of all personality (not to mention dialogue, with all characters but one having maybe 10 words of spoken dialogue). Each character is boiled down to 2 static traits, that's it. As to the new characters, I played through this game 7 times or so, and I can't recall a single new character's name, much less anything about their personality.\n\nThe music is also a huge disappointment compared to HuniePop, if nothing else due to being so scarce. HuniePop had a soundtrack worth buying, but this game has almost nothing.\n\nNow, on to the art. This was probably the most divisive aspect of this game among fans. I wish I could say the reaction was overblown, but it really isn't. The art in this game is atrocious. The creator stated that the art was inspired by Facebook style games, but I honestlly don't see it. After the relatively simple, but extremely expressive and clean art of HuniePop, the art of HunieCam Studio is probably the most disappointing aspect. I really wish the creator would have listened to fans last year when the vast majority of fans opposed the change in art, but hopefully he will learn from this.\n\nOverall, this game is not worth your money. I played through the game several times trying to pin down my opinion of it, but in the end it wasn't worth it. It might have been worth something if this review dissuades someone from buying this game, and using that $7 on something that deserves it more.","April 9","false","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
