Meaning that I will have no regret to report any copy/paste of my review. Some of you may have experienced that with Galaxy Admirals. Do you really want to have your 10 credits revoked because you're too lazy to try the game and to write some lines?\n\nI wanted to believe in Moonbase 332. I didn't care about the graphics but I wanted to believe in a little FPS that I could enjoy.\n\nMoonbase 332 having been in many bundles, I got a key for myself thanks to that. I decided to give it a try yesterday because I was wondering if it would be any better than Galatic Hitman. And it is better than the latter. At least, levels are differents, you have a lot of weapons and the enemies are moving.\n\nYou're arriving in a secret base used by Austria to develop a virus that would have infected Germany. And guess who will clean it? You!\n\nWhile the story isn't the plot of the year, I was immediately thrown into my biggest mistake: changing binding keys. Yep, it was still in beta. But I would have never imagined that I would loose my reload button. I couldn't reload ANY weapon. Any! I had to wait until I wasted my bullet to reload.\n\nAnd the reload action.... My god, why is it so slow for the dual weapons? Even other games take less time for that.\n\nI never understood why Zombie Nazis, walkyries with crossbows and slashers appeared in the game... or flying skulls for the matter. For a game about infected people, the developer added some paranormal stuff.\n\nBut the best? I don't know how the zombies with bazookas managed to hit me even when hidden. And I was dodging the rockets, I really was. Apparently it's vain because they're hitting you each time. That's how I managed to loose many of my lives.\n\nBecause you have 10 lives before a gameover... and you have to keep counting. Because the HUD only shows the weapons and your ammo. No health bar. You don't know if you need to reload a save or not.\n\nAbout the weapons, they're nice: the shotgun is powerful through three bullets isn't enough. I couldn't enjoy two weapons because despite showing having still ammo, they refused to reload when it was at 0. I cursed that because they were among the most powerful! Yay!\n\nI don't care about the graphics but when you see the last bonus level, you're asking yourself why it's more "alive" than the main story. And in general, bonus levels are refreshing.\n\nAnd why did the dev ignore completely puzzles? I mean, the last bonus level showed that you could have mixed shooting and brain. But no, you're just running around to find buttons to open doors.\n\nThe big problem is also that I've crashed constantly at the end of a loading level. The only answer you'll get is "reload the autosave - problem solved". Yeah, apart that my computer is in the recommended specs and that having the message "FPSC stopped working" without any cause is hard.\n\nI would have been more positive about the game if it wasn't for the crash, some problems with enemies with bazookas and my ♥♥♥♥ed up rebinding, though I think that the dev will probably patch that one.\n\nBetween Galatic Hitman and Moonbase 332, choose Moonbase 332 because the dev did work on the game and didn't take you as fools. But in the end, I can't recommend it if the game is always crashing. I really can't. Would the problem disappear, then, you can go ahead and try it.\n\nSorry to put a "No" for this game. I really wanted to believe in the game. I was happy to see the keys in the bundle. I put it in my wishlist. In the end, I still want to believe that there will some improvements though....","November 7, 2015","false","3.9"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","4"

Futuristic FPS? OK, but why are there running skeletons with pistols? Those enemies looked like they're from a Serious Sam game... they were soo funny. Also, why are there unknown soldiers, or what are they? Why are there US Army zombies? Why are there zombie Nazi officers? Why are there middle-age soldiers with bows? And what the hell is wrong with the voice? I could only recognise max. 60-70% of the words. Yeah, and the graphics... I don't know what they did, but the picture is soo... depressed or maybe there's no human word for that. And still remain that after I changed the resolution of the "game" to the res. of my desktop. I never experienced that graphics problem working with FPSC.\nWell, as I said, true example when a dev don't know what to develop. This product has been stalled in the very first part of the procedure called "software development". That part is called: Idea.\n\nPros:\n- Can be farmed for cards\n- Example for young devs what not to make\n\nCons:\n- Anything else\n\nEdit: The game stops working after the first "boss fight", so there's only 11 "somehow" working levels. And so:\n- Story is idiot and the cutscenes - ohmm, there are no real cutscenes.\n- Difficulty level NOT varies with Your behavior. I think it's nearly impossible to make in an FPSC game, and definately: if the dev could not make the other parts of the game how could they make this?\n- The game speed increases with each level - Ohmm, I really don't know what is the meaning of this, I did not experience any speed changes by the way.\n- Health regeneration does not exist - there's not even a healthbar to show Your health percentage. Anyway, there are health packages... but don't even know how many health they add...\n- Ranking System and Online-Highscore list - that one is working, but why? Nobody cares about the points while the game s*cks.\n- Lifetime free updates - should I comment this one?","February 3","false","3.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"
