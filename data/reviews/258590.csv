Not a bad thing at all.\nPerformance is good, controls are tight and has support for 1440p+/120hz/60fps+.\n\nVoiceover work has been done by the original cast. Plenty of new lines have been voiced which tie into the 'video game' world very well which is important. Most of your favourite characters from the series make appearances, both the friends and foes. Set across the different worlds each containing at least 5 levels, you will come across a bunch of familiar collectables while following your main 'quest' to obtain the relics.\n\nUpbeat chiptune 8/16bit styled soundtrack. Not only fits the theme but is rather catchy too.\n\nGreat game for the price and fans of the series.\nEasily recommended from what i've played. :)","April 11, 2014","true","6.4"," 338 of 418 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","338","418","2","17"

Reminds me a bit of Toejam and Earl, with some Diablo/Skylanders/Torchlight thrown in. The retro-style music is incredible, and having the original VAs was an outstanding idea as it definitely feels like Adventure Time. Make sure when you're attacking to slowly press the key in time with the attacks, rather than mashing; it gives you a brief moment to realign your attack if the enemy's hitbox is out of your range.","April 11, 2014","true","0.4"," 105 of 174 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","105","174","0","0"

Adventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest is a fantastic game that mixes the great elements from RPGs with the awesome level schemes of ToeJam & Earl.\n\nStory:\nAdventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest takes you out of the Land of Ooo and throws you into a new world that splits Ooo into floating islands. You play as Finn and Jake as they find themselves in a video game, which they use to explain all the weird elements. BMO has gone missing and it’s up to you to bring him back, but where is he? As you progress through the game you receive clues that help you find your lost comrade. In order to solve the mystery you must find artifacts scattered throughout the worlds, and eventually you will find the key.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is split across four worlds, which you can either run through quickly or if you take your time exploring every corner. Each world has six levels and a boss, which you must use different tactics to defeat. The first world is the Witch’s Garden (if you remember the show this is where Jake loses his powers for an episode because he stole a donut), Ice Kingdom, Fire Kingdom, and Land of the Dead. The levels have various minions which are all from the show, and you will fight bosses that are all characters who Finn and Jake got into scruffs with.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game takes elements from hack ‘n slash titles and mixes it with that of ToeJam & Earl. In fact this game is almost exactly like Toe Jam and Earl except you can attack enemies. You find pages of the Enchiridion which you can use producing some sort of result either positive or negative. You can pay Princess Bubblegum to identify the pages, which if you ever find again it will remain identified (unless you use a page randomizer). Your character has a maximum level of 15, and every three levels you gain a new weapon. The weapons make your character stronger and grant them with special abilities. Jake is the powerhouse and Finn is for speed. As you progress throughout the game you will find keys which you can use to unlock chests, and you must search for artifacts. Similar to ToeJam & Earl you will be informed which levels artifacts are on so you don’t need to search every level. You can fall of the edges of the world which allows you to return to previous levels meaning you can go backwards in the campaign. Although unlike ToeJam & Earl you can only fall one level at a time, and the campaign seems to save the previous levels enemies so if you go back the levels are empty. The Enchiridion offers about thirty pages: two have negative results, three help you get across gorges, two of them give money, one of them gives health items, and the rest provide you with some sort of buff. Overall there are not too many pages, but you will enjoy them if you use them.\n\nHints:\n> I found myself searching every nook and cranny of each level, but once you hit level 15 there is no point in hanging around.\n>Levels with artifacts tell you that they have artifacts, so you don’t need to search every level.\n>Don’t use any pages until you’ve had princess bubblegum examine them (because if you select the page randomizer you can lose really good pages).\n>I beat the game on hard and I played the entire game only using the occasional food page. If I were playing this game again I would use as many pages as possible because the game is incredibly easy either way.\n>The keys pass through the levels, so if you have some keys on one level you can bring them to the next one.\n>If you need to get off in a hurry just jump off the edge of the world, it saves the game for you and puts you at the end of the previous level.\n\nResults:\nAdventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest is a brilliant game that brings together elements of traditional Hack ‘n Slash and combines it with the greatness of ToeJam & Earl. I would not be amazed if the developers made this as a tribute to ToeJam & Earl. The game has four different bosses, loads of different enemies, crazy amounts of Enchiridion pages that give you special abilities, 24 levels (28 if you include boss fights), and quests that keep you going. If you like adventure games, RPGs, and Hack ‘n Slash this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n+Long campaign with 28 total levels, including boss fights.\n+Loads of Enchiridion pages which allow you to essentially cast special spells.\n+Fifteen levels, which allow you to become stronger.\n+A funny story that brings Adventure Time to life.\n+Great voice acting and awesome music.\n+Four crazy boss fights that require you to use various tactics and strategies.\n+Two different characters which you can switch through using different abilities.\n+Decent graphics\n\nCons:\n-The game can get rather repetitive; you definitely will want to take a break from it every now and then.\n-When you fall off a level it puts you right at the end of the previous level.\n-The audio volume settings are in the same page as the graphics settings (if you change the audio volume it also reapplies the graphic settings).\n-There could be more Enchiridion pages, the book seems kind of bland at times and most of the pages seem to accomplish the same thing.\n-There isn’t that much voice acting involved, there is very little conversation between any of the characters.\n-Even on hard this game is ridiculously easy.","May 6, 2014","true","7.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

HONESTY TIME!\n7/10\nRecommended for fans of AT\n\nThis game, is as others may have already said, is Toejam and Earl but with an AT skin. For those of you not familiar with Toejam and Earl, it's this game but with aliens and colorful presents instead of Finn, Jake and Enchiridion pages.\n\nGameplay itself is a blast and beating up all the AT villains is just fun and partly crazy, freaking enchiridion pages out the ying yang lets you use whatever you want whenever. You think you've had all the fun then PARTY GOD shows up and you go maraud some more.\n\nAs stated above this is honesty time. While the game is a lot of fun, its only a lot of fun till the end of third world, where everything caps out pretty much. By then you'll have long since found all the enchiridion pages and have probably maxed out the level and gotten all the weapons. This leaves it feeling a bit wanting, as the next seven levels in world five may simply be glazed over as the only reason for fighting enemies is to level up or get coins. Not needing anything else really you're free to scamper by every enemy as they really dont chase you.\n\nIn short, had this game ended with beating up Fire King, it would be well rounded and just plain tons of fun, which it still is.\nI enjoyed it myself and I hope more come out like it, just a little more fine tuned.\n\n","June 10, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are several game-breaking bugs;\nsuch as killing the forest witch when she sits on Finn or Jake - your camera zooms in all the way and all weapons except scrolls are useless.\nAfter the update I lost all my save data; I was already at the Ice King.\n\nAnother problem is the weird control scheme. It uses the arrow keys instead of WASD and it kinda catches you off-guard.\n\nI also felt that there was a lot of hit and miss moments in this game, from the cutscenes being either poorly rigged mouth movements to just being a zoom in on the low resolution screenshot from the actual cartoon series.\n\nI do appeal to the original voice cast, and many references to previous episodes. However a pet peeve of mine is the world isn't open.

Very reminiscent of games like ToeJam and Earl. Gameplay can be rather repetitive. Lack of open world saves or savepoints is a bit of a let down (saves at world entry portals i.e. checkpoints).\nIt's more of a novelty purchase than anything.\nVisually mathematical and audibily algebraic, whether you're five or thirty-five, by the power of Glob, you'll be slamacow'ing across the Land of Ooo for hours on end.\nOriginal voice cast (Jake, Finn, BMO) provide their talents in game and commentary/instruction.

It is not "like" an RPG, it IS an RPG. Very fun. Sure, the first level is a 1 path stage; but after that, it becomes big and tough. By level 3, you'll be walking all over the place trying to find that 3rd key for the 1st chest! And if you've never seen Adventure Time, no worries! This game can still be fun without know any characters or Levels. If you're a first timer in AT, you'll love it. And If you think money is easy to get, think again. Prices are  pretty high in the store. This game will keep you up for hours.

The mechanics aren't ground-breaking and not having a way to view the whole map is a little disappointing.

Then there's a randomizer page that resets what you have already used and now all those pages that you've learned what they do is just gone. The audio lines are pretty repetative and the thump when you switch between Finn and Jake is really loud for no reason.

Sure there'll be some new worlds a few levels ahead but I couldn't bother. Reviews called it a kid's Diablo but even compared to D3 it is really shallow with a good lot of backtracking and lacking a sense of progression, plot or going anywhere. Even though ARPGs are seldom plot-heavy the slow gameplay and lack of variation killed it fast for me.\nWhile not being broken or glaringly bad there's just nothing remarkable about it if you're a seasoned player who played the top 75% games of the last two decades.\n\nEven if you are a die-hard fan or just play an hour per week I believe there are dozens of better games you could waste your time on.

There's plenty of references to the show, at least, and they are integrated with moderate success through the decision to make them affect gameplay rather than just be a collectibale on the side.\nThe mechanics are, for the most part, bad. A fairly simple combat system with lots of walking in-between. Would have benefitted greatly from a more comprehensive map possibly accessible from the pause menu. All the collecting is meaningless; money and silver keys only get you enchiridion pages which are already in abundance and the combat is, again, so simple that the pages aren't really all that useful.\nThere's been a lot of fuss over how much support the devs have shown after release. Well, cool your boots; its been like four days since release and, frankly, the game is so riddled with bugs it shouldn't have been released so prematurely. This is all the more embarrassing when you consider its a re-release of an, otherwise, free game.\nAll in all, the reasonable pricetag makes up for a lot of its shortcomings, and, for the fans, being able to interact with the Adventure Time universe outside of the show is great. But, ultimately, its not as good as the show, or other videogames, so maybe consider investing your time in those instead.","April 14, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Being a HUGE toejam & earl fan from age 7, this game was a must buy for me and I'm not in the least bit disapointed. Gameplay is faster paced than toejam & earl and instead of mainly avoiding enemies like in tj&e, your fighting them. A very lite level up/upgrade system is also included. This game is a instant purchase for fans of tj&e. This game gives you a hint of what tj&e 3 should have been or what tj&e 4 needs to be if we ever get that. The only complaint is lack of MP, which will hopefully be added down the road, but if not I'll still be having a blast with F&J's Epic Quest.","April 11, 2014","true","1.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/258590/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","While it's called Adventure Time, this game doesn't really benefit from having AT title.\n\nFirst off, if you're buying this game because it is an adventure time game, you're not buying it for the right reason. It has characters from adventure time, and that's about it. The story isn't gone into too deeply. You find yourself thrust into a videogame world. You try to find bmo. All explained in the opening sequence that's pretty much it.\n\nThe main premise of a world is 6 levels and a boss. You hack and slash (kind of button mashy at times) through enemies, collecting various enchiridion pages that offer powers. It's worth mentioning that the game will be very easy unless played on the harder difficulty setting. The pages themselves are plentiful, so you can almost never run out.\n\nI feel that this game might have benefited more from a rogue-like procedural generation level structure, rather than having fixed levels. It would have made it more challenging, and it would have given the game a lot of replay value. As it is, the static levels don't do the game any favours.\n\nThis game can be played with both controller or a K&M setup. The controls cannot be customized through the menu, but thre are a few "presets" to choose from. Peronally, I found using a controller to be the more logical way to play this, as there are not many keys to be used.\n\nThr graphics are very good during gameplay, but when you are shown close-ups during cutscenes, the models look very odd. The cutscenes might have benefited from being animated and pre-rendered. There is a fair amont of variance throughout each of the worlds, which is good.\n\nThe voice acting in this is limited to that of finn & jakes's cutscenes and some BMO is thrown in there too. Oddly, none of the bosses were given voice acting, despite the fact that they speak in the show. I found this rather odd. The background music for this game is very good. It has a sort of retro gaming feel to it, but it's not fully 8-bit in style.\n\nThere are some bugs in this game, but none I found to be game breaking in any way. The game devs included a "return to start" option in the menu, which helps if you get stuck on a floating island in the middle of nowhere. Fun fact: You can actually use this option at any time, even if it is "greyed out".\n\nIn short, don't buy this game just because the adventure time label is slapped on it. It is a fun game for a single playthrough, but beyond that it has no replay value, as far as i'm concerned. If you're a fan of roguelikes you probably won't be interested, but it might appeal more to people who want to get in to roguelikes, as this game is about half way there already, if a bit button mashy at times.","September 11, 2014","false","7.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

I am a huge fan of adventure time and was excited to play this game. The graphics are so BAD, even on the highest setting. There are a ton of glitches. Your shield doesn't protect you at all, and you are much slower than most monsters, meaning you die ALOT, even on the normal mode. The whole games story line isn't really explained well, which was disappointing seeing as it is based off of a TV show that typically has a hilarious one. The map is hard to read and also glitches often, telling you there are places to walk where there aren't any, so you can't rely on it at all. Each new map is an island, meaning you are surrounded by open ground all around you, and if you fall off, which the game will make you do if you even get CLOSE to the edge, you are sent back to the previous level. Then you have to walk you're extrodinarily slow character back to where you were. Combine that with many of the coins you need being close to the edge and you have an annoying headache. Lastly, the color was horrific. It gave me a headache to watch it within half an hour. I've honestly never been so dissappointed by a game I've purchased on Steam before. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

With elements of Zelda, Metrovania, open world influences. If any licensed material ever called for an amazing video game adaptation, it's Adventure Time.\n\nWell this isn't what I have always hoped for, but it is good. The gameplay is pretty basic dungeon crawler style but in an overworld. There is nothing to hate about the controls and gameplay but nothing to fall in love with either. It just works, Nothing too special. What is great about this game is that they crammed TONS of things from the series into the game. And just playing the game and pointing out all the things that appear that are from the show is a lot of fun. They also did a great job of incorporating these things into actual gameplay.\n\nIf you are a fan of the show you should pick this up.

It's Finn and Jake. Uses voices from the shot and a near little storyline about them being stuck in a videogame and such...

It's review time. I'll get right down to it: this game sucks. At first you think it's going to be fun playing an exploration game in the vein of Adventure Time, but it's anything but fun. The "look for stuff and backtrack" design of gameplay is just tiresome by the 2nd world map, and by the 3rd, you just want it to be over and done with. The first Toe Jam & Earl game for the Sega Genesis had a similar feel and look, but was loads more fun.\n\nNot very challenging since you can easily avoid most enemies. Also disappointing that you can only level up to level 15, and as a result, you don't feel very powerful when defeating enemies.\n\nThe last boss is awkward to fight since I beat him by chipping his healthy away very slowly and healing constantly - NOT good game design.\n\nOh well, I know better. I won't be playing this again or any Adventure Time games anytime soon until they make the game mechanics fun and addicting.","December 17, 2014","false","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The powerups are stupid and useless. Music is made of annoying 5 sec loops. The game design insults Toejam & Earl by completely ripping it off. There is no story or content tying in to the series. It's just a horribly awful freeware game with an Adventure Time skin on it and with an atrocious price tag.\nWould never recommend even if you were paid to play it.

It also seems Jake can be hit when not being used which is just a detriment to the party and reminds me of Minnie from the Mickey and Minnie game where if she dies you die.\n\nAlso I recommand right now avoiding the Tree Witch as her greatest power is locking the whole game up.  She has an attack in which she sits on you (makes sense she does it to Jake in the show) and you have to quick time out.  Except sometimes she does the attack and the game just locks.  Oh you can see the mobs moving around and you can even quit to title but for whatever reason the quick time event doesn't load and you are just screwed.  This has happened to me now 4 times forcing me to lose all progress and restart the entire level.\n\nAs for the game it's Toe Jam and Earl.  You are two aliens; searching for space parts. On levels that have holes that you can fall down to get to the previous level.  Gathering presents that you do not know what they do until you use them.  Looking for elevators to get you to the next level.  Replace aliens with Finn and Jake.  Replace space parts with game artifacts.  Replace presents with spells.  Replace elevators with portals.  Now you have Fine and Jake's Epic Quest.\n\nYou would think this would bother me but frankly Toe Jam and Earl was a great game and if you aren't going to come up with your own good game at least rip one off.\n\nAs I said at the start if you can ignore the bugs and have been looking for a Toe Jam and Earl game skinned as Finn and Jake then I recommend this game.  But until the bugs are fix I can't recommand this game right now.","April 12, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

(and you are likely to spam one of these)\n- too few enemy types, that are just being reskinned\n- you can walk trough the whole game, without hitting one single enemy\n- they stretch the game time with unnecessary fetch quests, kill x, open x chests, get x pages.....\n- the story is so dull and boring, especially for Adventure Time, I was kinda shocked\n- you can control Jake and Finn, but it doesnt seem to change things up enough, you can play just one of them the entire time (Jake does a little bit more damage, likely everybody played with him)\n- though there are 2 characters simultaneously on the screen, there is no coop mode! NO COOP MODE!\n- gamplay is tireing fast, you have no courage to play it through - nothing is rewarding or cool\n- Adventure Time paint job, it feels tacked on, nothing is really like in the show and feels incredibly lifeless\n- the power ups are ok, but a lot are just not useful, like the spitbubbles or Lady Rainicorn\n- extremely easy difficulty even on hardest setting, I got bored to death\n\nHow anybody can recommend this is beyond me. Even hardcore fans must admit how boring the gameplay is and that every level is just copy and paste with slight variation in terrain. I love the show, but this game is a huge disservice to all fans of it. You must be an extremly fanboy to miss all the flaws the game has.\nNothing will keep you invested. If you like the shows imaginative stories......then stay away from this boring grindfest mindless game.","November 30, 2014","false","7.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Again you play Fin and Jake as you walk along a bland landscape, once again avoding that same enemy you got tired of hitting on many encounters ago.\n\nAdventure time, the show, is about storytelling. Good storytelling with deep characters. Why do the games contrast to this so much? why are they all about mashing the a button? Is that all video games are to Adventure time? Pressing A and collcting coins? Do something interesting. It's as if the people making these games have never actualy experainced the show.","April 11, 2014","false","0.3"," 36 of 193 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","36","193","0","9"

The map doesn't allow you to look at the whole stage.\n\n- Combat is weak, dodging out of enemies vastly telegraphed moves makes it boring after the first stage, combined with few varations. (Tree Witch in the Fire Kingdom, come on...)\n\n- Upgrades are based on refrences from the show, and that's about it. Some are just plain hard aimed for no reason and deal no real damage (looking at you Ice Shuriken, seriously I'm better off with Light attacks), some are powerful but are also hard to aim, and some are just much, much better than the others but takes away what little effort this skilless game already had.\n\nThe last of the upgrades are just a big 'you hoarded some good upgrades to make the last fight quick? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, player'. Thanks guys, as if your game wasn't alreadý boring me to tears. Small appreciation in being able to play as Fiona and Cake, but that should have been an unlockable bonus, same with other characters.\n\n- No boss dialogues. (understandable given the ending, but still wth?)\n\n- Music is repitive and boring.\n\n+ Art is decent, original VA, but that's about it.\n\nSo what made me finish this game? Well I love AT, and I just wanted a good ending for my efforts of playing this pile of 'the stuff', but even that they denied me. I got a pat on the back and the ridiculous notion that I should play it again.\n\n2/10\n\nThanks, but no thanks!","April 7, 2015","false","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is nice (but unfortunately let down by the graphical fidelity). It runs fine too. That's about it.\n\nThe Bad Ignoring the fact that this used to be a free browser game (http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.au/games/adventure_time/epic-quest/) and hasn't changed drastically since that iteration, this game is boring, repetitive, lazy and cheap. It looks like crap, controls like crap, feels like crap and sounds like crap. This game sort of feels like it was made by people who do really care about the show, and wanted to make something that does it justice, but there simply wasn't enough money or talent to do so.\n\nVisuals While the art style is good, the graphical quality is terrible and there are "jaggies" everywhere you look. Each stage has a single, static, unfathomably low resolution backdrop. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=423231818 The levels from each world look very similar, and there are not many landmarks to help you remember where you are. This isn't helped by the lack of a mini-map.\n\nControl The controls are fairly responsive, but the animations don't flow well into each other, which along with other things, results in really bad game-feel. Running around and fighting does not feel fun. I find myself actively avoiding enemies just because they simply aren't fun to kill. The camera nauseatingly jerking back and forth as you change directions, and vibrating slightly when you run in diagonals does not help the cause. Nothing in this game feels fun; the only enjoyment you get comes from completing tasks and advancing through the stages.\n\nSound The sound design was put together in an obvious rush. Sound effects cut abruptly in and out, play at seemingly random volumes and sound like they were pulled straight from a stock library with little to no afterthought. Although the voice actors do a decent job, the dialogue during cutscenes is riddled with pops and clicks. The music is clearly trying to simulate the style of the cartoon, with beeps, boops, clicks and melodies played in unprocessed analogue synths. The sentiment is nice, but it falls short, sometimes sounding less Adventure Time-esque and more midi file-esque.\n\n\nTL;DR The combat isn't fun enough, and the enemies not versatile enough to make up for how mind-numbingly repetitive this game is. Once you've played the first 3 levels, you've experienced most of what you're going to get out of the rest of the game.\n\nThis game isn't worth your time, or your money.","April 11, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's why.\n\nIt feels like this game was only half finished before it was released. The gameplay is very stale and repetitive.\nI don't mind the simplicity, but there is an extreme lack of creativity. The trailer makes this game look like there is a lot more to it. The game is even called "Epic Quest", leading you to believe that you're in for a good adventure game. But all of the "quests" are just tedious levels of fighting the same monsters over and over.\n\nThe dialogue is terrbile for Finn and Jake, and the other characters don't even speak at all. The story is really boring and will make you feel that the entire game is pointless; ending off with Finn and Jake saying "Let's Play Again". I had this game 100% complete in 6 hours, (which most of you could probably do faster) and I never will "Play Again".\n\nLuckily I purchased this game when it was on sale. $9.99 is a bit too pricey for this game.","July 17, 2014","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whilst I do ultimately recommend this game I feel it has plenty of issues which I'll go into.\n\nThis game was so close to being this generations 'Toejam & Earl' so very close. For those of you that don't know Toejam & Earl is a game that came out on the sega genesis/megadrive way way back in 1990... or around about then. Regardless it went on to become one of my favourite games of all time and was a favorite between me and my friends when we fancied some co-op action.\n\nSo when I found out this game was clearly inspired by Toejam & Earl I was over the moon and very excited. So much so that it coloured my early judgement of the game quite heavily and made me have more positive thoughts at the time than I perhaps should've.\n\nSo Finn & Jake's Epic Quest is game where Finn and Jake go around a world (broken up into 6 levles + a boss battle) looking for the portal to the next one. In order to progress though some maps have artifacts (ship pieces for those familiar with Toejam & Earl) which must also be found along with the portal in order to progress. Other similarities to ToeJam & Earl include power ups which are a complete mystery until used which can (more often than not) give a benefit or (unfourtenetly rarely) a disadvantage... this includes the elusive Radomizer which made Toejam & Earl such an unforgiving game.\n\nWhich is my first problem with this game... it's not nearly difficult enough. In Toejam & Earl the predictable nature of the enermies was completely forgivable because every last one of them was a genuine threat but in this game the enermies become moslty a means to grind out levels. All of them are completely avoidable and aren't particuarly fun to fight in large number and whilst the combat isn't bad, it feels okay and in groups can be mildly challenging, it becomes pretty tedious with only one apparent combo being present in the game 3 hours and 4 worlds in. Therefore the enermies become a meaningless obstacle which are just there for coin. Which is another issue... you never 'need' money... another thing about Toejam & Earl is money was scarce and it'd cost way more than you'd ever aquire to get everything you'd want on a single map. Here the enermies are easy enough to vanquish without the aid of powerups with the powerups only speeding up the time it takes to kill things and are only every needed when you need to fly or float to specific areas.... the powerups are fun though and the is a lot of variety on offer. But asides from the Randomizer and 'Knife Storm' I saw no powerups which reminded me of 'Total Bummer' or 'Rocket Skates' on Toejam & Earl... in other words just go nuts and dont worry about any ill effects you'll be able to get them all identified again anyways because it's so cheap to do so.\n\nAlso the is no co-op, this is a galreing omission from a game thats inspired by a game that is known for it's innovative co-op mode where players where able to individually explore other areas of map but other stages entirely... the tag system from toejam & earl is here but no co-op.\n\nBut on it's own merits it's still a decent game for the price, it looks good enough, the gameplay provides a nice distraction in small bursts and you get quite a lot for your money. (I reckon 5hours if you try to complete everything and level up your character) and it's a solid homage to one of my favorite games of all time. It's not bad for a licenced game and is worth the asking price but those looking for a true spiritual succesor to Toejam & Earl this isn't it. It's so close to being a very nice modernized version of it but it falls short of truely capturing what the game great and instead is just a fairly enjoyable romp for a small fee.","April 12, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The references to the show are lovingly integrated with the gameplay mechanics and the original voice actors reprise their roles.\n\nI recommend Adventure Time fans to pick it up as it makes for an enjoyable experience for those who understand all the subtleties and nuances from the show that were translated into game mechanics.\n\nFor those who have never seen Adventure Time, I would recommend trying the Unity version first just to get a feel for how the combat is.
