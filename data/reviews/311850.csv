We all know it can be played for free at any time. Reason most of us buy solitaire games is because we expect a bit more than the regular game that we're used to.\n\nZombie Solitaire seems to try and give us that but falls very short. Unlike original Solitaire, you can move in any direction and your colour suit doesn't matter, which ends up making the game pretty easy. In between different escape stages, you solve a point and click 'puzzle' (if it can even be called that) which never takes more than a few seconds. You'll start getting bored on the first chapter and because the game doesn't offer any challenge, regardless of your progression, that's how you'll feel the rest of the game.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, I would place a spoiler tag here but there is nothing to spoil. The tiny, weak pieces of story that are CLEARLY forced, are put in without consequence. Throughout the entire game, you're led to believe once you make it to a specific place on the map, you'll be safe. Yet once you finish all the levels, nothing happens. NOTHING. Even if you complete all levels with perfects, there is no reward. A simple 'You escaped!' would have been satisfactory.\n\n+ It's still solitaire\n\n- Extremely repetitive\n- Unnecessary point and click scenes\n- Attempt at story goes nowhere\n- No achievements/trading cards\n- 7.00 usd\n\n5/10\nIf you're looking for anything interesting alongside your solitaire, look elsewhere.","May 26","false","14.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/recommended/311850/","zulmetefza","zulmetefza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/","1233 products in account","This game has simpler mechanics than actual solitaire.\n\n...A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-...-2-A-K\n\nUsing this sequence u try to eliminate all cards, both in your deck and in the screen. Colors do not matter. There are some locked cards which can be opened by "raven repellers"and "machetes" which are also cards, hidden in elsewhere in screen. And for each 15 chapters, you got a minor point and click puzzle, which is either too simple to be called a puzzle, or just glitched.\n\nSounds really simple right. And I know this is not a problem in itself, since no one expects Dominions 4 when trying to buy a game called "Zombie Solitaire". So, what is the problem? Actually there are three problems.\n\n1) First, game algorithm is not well designed, so you can fail even with perfect moves. Random generation mostly works well, but you can lose the game by just random generation. When you win a level, the game claims, "Level Solved", but actually you are not guaranteed that there really is a solution always.\n\n2) Saying this, finding optimal moves is not that hard. Optimal move can be deduced by following steps. If you do a mistake, it is not because you were not able to think through or something, it is mostly because of that you misclicked.\n1) Check how many possible moves exist for each turn.\n2) If there is only one, do it.\n3) If there is more than one, check combo possibilities. Pick the best one. But since, you can not predict what will you encounter after your move, that is mostly redundant.\n4) If everything is equal, try to use the cards from columns with more cards in it.\n\n3) Designers knew how shallow are the mechanics, and how bad is their generation algorithm, so they implemented an additional mechanic. Buying gravestones to use an additional, free to use deck, and special power cards that can be used for eliminating a single card, making all cards visible, eliminating a column, and.... ELIMINATING ALL OF THE LEVEL.\n\nSo, if you are deceived by game's being a puzzle ambition -like me- you will mostly skip buying this special cards, since they kill the very purpose of finding optimal moves. I just bought some graveyards until getting nearer to halfway through. Then I realized, these levels were not designed for being played as a puzzle. You NEED to buy those special powers. If you suck with the game, you NEED to buy better cards, so grinding is incentivized. BY grinding, I am meaning losing the same level over and over again with no hope of winning, just to please developers that you had enough of that. Or, if you are a better player, you will hit the wall at a later stage, with 150000 gold in at your disposal.\n\nWhat is the optimal strategy then? You will check Shop, it includes a card, as I said that eliminates all cards in the level, effectively skipping a level. When is the optimal time to start a shopping spree, just skipping all of the remaning levels? Doing this in the last 25 levels is exactly the threshold that finishes the game with no money remaining. Where am I getting to? This game is the only game I have, whose developers knew that their game is so bad, they actually put a mechanic to skip last 25~30 chapters! Almost 1/3 of the whole game.\n\nWith better generation, with some differentiation between raven cards, and jungle cards, and with redesigning of shop concept, making their use optional to pass the levels, but making them fun to use without causing massive difficulty decline, this might have been a better game that will fit the average expectation of the buyer. Now, what I see is, just a mish mash of two words with high marketability with no real effort put on mechanics.\n\nAvoid. I spent 6 hours to say this. You can safely ignore this title, even if you are actually a necrophilia, or a hardcore solitaire fan. And if you are actually a hardcore solitaire fan, please add me as a friend, since I have not meet one.\n\nNice to meet you.

Background art feels like stock images with some zombies pasted in. The "shop" part feels like it was supposed to be a cash shop for noobs in a mobile game. Points and gold make no sense what so ever, you'll have plenty all the time unless you suck at solitaire. Fixed unchangeable resolution. Frame rate capped at 50FPS leads to jerky game-play on 60FPS screens. "Run" mechanic is totally worthless. Why would I ever run when there is no timer, it reduces my score, and there is no consequence for not running? No Replay button for when you pass a level but didn't get the best rating. Confusing interface, very unclear what's clickable and not. Levels auto end even when you have wildcards which could get you a perfect score, thus meaning the level must be repeated to get a perfect score. No achievements.\n\nThis game is a result of a programmer saying I can code solitaire and zombies are in, and then I can totally shovel this onto Steam. The programmer wishes they were Popcap, but fails to even be half as good.  The programmer of this game simply doesn't get what makes a tight, enjoyable game with a bit of a challenge.

That was a rite of my childhood back when Windows 3.1 was cutting edge technology and it is sacred to my people.\n\nWhat I will tell you is that ZOMBIE SOLITAIRE only loosely resembles traditional Solitaire and I guess for that at least, the developers deserve some credit. It's become pretty easy to sell something in this day and age by plastering the living dead all over it and some limited effort has gone into making the game bright, playable and attractive in a kind of third party PopCap clone sort of way.\n\nUltimately though, it's pretty pointless. You steam through 103 practically identical levels, revealing a redundant story as you go, with the only saving grace being that gold coins are easy to come by and can purchase you power-ups in the game's store. One of these, Sudden Strike, is basically a nuclear strike that wins the stage for you instantly. I mean, most of the other cards will win the round for you too but they'll at least have the decency to make you arbitrarily click a few times to get there. Sudden Strike just wipes its backside with everything on screen, gives you a perfect three star rating that you will forever know that you didn't earn and dumps a busload of coins on you to go buy another one.\n\nZombie Solitaire is one of those strange games that feels like it was designed for a mobile Pay-2-Win model and then had its difficulty scaled right back to utterly impotent levels for the PC release. Then again, I guess if the point of your title is to rob people blind then yeah, £4.99's pretty criminal.

That game looked good, with lots of unlockables, achievements, and Steam trading cards, but the faeries theme didn't really appeal to me. Then I saw this game. It looked like it was basically the same game as Faerie Solitare, but with a zombie theme. I also thought it was by the same company, so it too would have unlocables, achievements, etc. I threw it on my wishlist, and once it went on sale, I snapped it up.\n\nI guess I need to pay more attention and/or do a bit more research before buying anything. The game is *not* by the same company that made Faerie Solitare, and is in fact kind of a ripoff of that game. Although the game plays well, and there are some powerups to unlock and purchase, there are NO achievements or trading cards. The zombie theme does add some entertainment value, and even at full price the game is cheaper than Faerie Solitare, so I guess the lack of extras is somewhat justified.\n\nAll in all, the game does play well, and there are things to unlock in game, even if there aren't any achievements or trading cards. So, if you like zombies and think a solitare game based on them sounds fun, go ahead. Just don't expect too much.\n\nMy rating: 7 out of 10. It does what it sets out to do, but is nothing special. Buy it on sale if you like zombies and solitare.","October 31, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Nothing stands out like in Faerie Solitare. If your looking for a great card then Faerie Solitare is the better game. The issue I have is that while it does nothing bad per se it doesnt do a lot of great or interesting ideas either.\n\nThe zombie idea was interesting however they fail to do anything interesting with the idea. Its basically you have cards and can go up or down in value. So the 2 card you would need a 3 or an ace to play that card. If you dont have a card you need you draw from your deck. You can buy some powerups that reveal cards or get rid of cards. The graphics are good and the music while not great is ok.\n\nI just feel like the entire game is a missed opportunity. It lacks a hook like Faerie Solitare has with their pet collecting. You do get to play little mini games but they are short. The regular price seems very high to me. I got this in a bundle along with 5 other games. No achiements or steam trading cards and looks like this game will never have them.\n\nSomeone made a suggestion via email and it was a big nope were a small company and dont have time.

You match up cards in ascending/descending order (card suit ignored).  During progression of the game, you can buy power up items that vary from completely necessary to absolute cheaty.  The more powerful the powerup, the more you pay for it.  However, money is somewhat irrevelant due to the fact you gain money almost every game you play, regardless of how well you do.  Sometimes it is nice to have an absolute cheaty power up if you start getting frusturated.\n\nUltimately the game is what you make of it.  I would prefer to play something like this over a social media equivalent, being that I don't have to bug my friends for power ups, or buy power ups with my own money.  On the other hand, the game is pretty flimsy over all.  If you enjoy it, try Faerie Solitaire by Subsoap.\n\nI also want to add that although most would say it is suitable for all ages, I do understand that some parents will be concerned with the fact that they do have elements of fantasy violence, as well as images and sounds of firearms.

That should be ok, but the game keeps getting more and more annoying because of that, making me fail many times. The zombie + solitaire idea is great, but the game loves to throw many useless cards at you, sometimes even repeating the previous card (not that rare). As I got this on a bundle, it was no big deal, but I cannot recommend buying this game.","December 20, 2014","false","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

The humor and cartoony graphics are what make this game fun to play.  You kill zombies by removing cards.  You can purchase a maximum of three special cards like wild cards at once.  The special cards and the search for hidden items between the levels make this game more fun to play than a typical game of solitaire.  I thought this game would be really short.  I thought there would be a maximum of 25 levels at most.  There are 103 levels.  The levels become more difficult because of the way the decks are arranged.  There are also special cards in the decks that make the game more difficult.  Something else I like about this game is that it was designed to work with wide-screen monitors.  Most solitaire games have stretched graphics and blurry details if you try to use a wide-screen monitor to play them.  Try to finish a level without buying an extra deck of cards from the shop.  That's the real challenge of this game.","December 27, 2014","true","23.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It was a 386, and my choice of games were limited to the bargain bin at Wal-mart. Still, I got to play a lot of games that would influence my interests as I got older.\n\nCastle of the Winds - Got me interested in rogue-likes, and then loot-heavy action-RPGs (Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exile).\nThe Bard's Tale - Naturally it led me into other dungeon crawlers like Elminage, Etrian Odyssey, and so on.\nWolfenstein - Enough said.\n\nAnd then there is good ol' Windows Solitaire....I hated that game so much. When I got bored of everything else it was back to Solitaire. You know that saying: Wherever you go, there you are. That's how I feel when I play Solitaire, it's such a depressing game. Today I own an Xbox 360, a WiiU, a Playstation 3, a PC that can play most anything, a 3DS, a Vita, and a freakin' Japanese Saturn. Next year I'll probably get a PS4, but you know what? None of that ♥♥♥♥ matters.\n\nBecause I'm reviewing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Solitaire game right now. I just can't get away....I....just...can't....get.... ARGH!\n\nAs a bonus this game is called Zombie Solitaire. It's like my own personal hell. Zombies used to be cool, but when rotting undead that eats brains is somehow as kid-friendly as Strawberry Shortcake, you know something's wrong. Personally I'd rather the zombie apocalypse actually happen so I'll never see these freakin' games ever again.\n\nWhere was I? Oh right...I'm reviewing a game or something.\n\nZombie Solitaire has all of the qualities of a Solitaire game, it is addictive as hell, and it kills your productivity. Unfortunately ZS isn't even a better game than the Solitaire that came with your copy of Windows (Unless you're a Win8 user). No it's not just because it has zombies in it. ZS doesn't work because it's a bland overly-safe vanilla soft version of Solitaire. It's good at wasting your time, and not much else.\n\n(This paragraph was originally an overly-long explanation of how Solitaire works.) Basically the goal is to get rid of all the cards\n\nZombie Solitaire adds a bunch of stuff. First off there's a store where you can buy special cards and tombstones. Tombstones are numbered cards (2-9) and you can use them whenever necessary. Special cards are straight up cheats. My personal favorite is the sudden strike, which simply destroys all of the cards, making you the winner. This is just plain silly because ZS has a ranking system, and even if you use the sudden strike, you still get the best rank. Sure they're expensive but money is easy to come by. Sure you know you cheated, but the game doesn't treat it as such. By the way, getting the best ranks in Zombie Solitaire is not at all brag-worthy.\n\nEven without the overpowered cards, this game is still too easy. About 90% of Solitaire games are winnable, so it stands to reason that luck plays a factor. Zombie Solitaire has tons of levels, but there's still randomness to the cards that are dealt. The later levels are supposed to be more difficult, but if I get a good deal, then it's all rendered moot. At least Windows Solitaire tracks your wins & losses. Plus it captures the main appeal of the game, the combination of logic & luck. It's dealing with potential worst-case scenarios, decision-making, regret, and ultimately despair.\n\nYMMV however. I spent far too much of my free-time playing Window Solitaire, and have become jaded because of it. If you're looking for a way to kill time, this is a decent way to do so. I'm not hip to the PC Solitaire scene, so I don't know if there's some Ultimate Solitaire 2014 simulator or whatever, but if you want something different, you could probably do better than Zombie Solitaire.\n\n","October 29, 2014","false","3.2"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","11","27","0","0"

Having spent many many hours playing Faerie Solitaire (FS), I'm a big fan of that game and I enjoy its mechanics that improve the base game. Thus, I am inevitably comparing this game to that standard.\nThis has some interesting game mechanics over FS that improve the gameplay, for example modification cards such as a grab card, a kill card, and kill wnole stack. I also like the map and being able to jump into old hands at will compared to FS's linear storyline.\nBut, there are things about this game that are just annoying. First is the music, which is very loud (I turned it down to half to make it bearable) and discordant (yes zombies, but really?) and loops after a fairly short period. FS's music is calm and relaxing and enjoyable to play to. Next is the end of the deck; even if you have gravestones, once you hit the bottom you are done. Unless you have a powercard that you bought in the store, then you can choose to use the card or a gravestone. Why not just have a button at the end to finish the hand like FS?\nFinally, FS has Steam Achievements and trading cards; 'nough said.\nOverall, Zombie Solitaire has some interesting gameplay features, but Faerie Solitaire is much nicer to play. Just get Faerie Solitaire instead.","March 19, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Progressing through the levels lets you travel along the path to escape from the zombies and get to a safe place. In addition to the varied layouts of each level, there are also various powerups you can buy in the shop which unlock as you progress, and which occasionally show up on the game board itself. While doing well (making long combinations and winning the level) will net you a large number of coins with which to buy the powerups, even losing a level will gain you some amount, meaning it's unlikely you will ever be stuck on a level for long. The powerups can be anything from a single card to help you bridge a gap between the showing card and what's on the table, to clearing an entire column of cards with a bowling ball, or even just an outright "I win" button for the level that clears everything. While I felt like the powerups made the game a bit too easy, it's likely that with over 100 levels, I would have gotten bored of the game and given up before I completed it, given the random nature of the levels and the probability that I would have needed to restart many of them repeatedly to win. Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys solitaire that wants to try a new twist on a familiar game.","February 13","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
