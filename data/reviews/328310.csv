Large problem though, it doesn't get there and neither did I. 5 hours in I finally had to give up as I found the gameplay slow, buggy, and lacking luster, but most importantly; physics.  I will keep this short and sweet folks. You can't name your company. You can't have workers to help you when things get busy. You do everything! Pick-up and drop-off of canisters is a finicky, tedious, and glitchy process. My dream of driving a Rail Mounted Gantry was quickly smashed to smithereens when the game awarded me with damage for smoothly picking up a can. This happens all the time! To me that is almost like watching a porno and having the power knocked out mid-way through. So what do I like about this game? The idea of it. Maybe if this game were as polished as Farming Simulator 2015, then it might be awesome. Save your money folks.\n\nUPDATE:  The game is unplayable after a certain point and you risk losing your save data! Do not purchase this game until developers fix this issue.","November 5, 2014","false","7.1"," 258 of 272 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","258","272","2","10"

First of all. DonÂ´t understand this bad reviews. For a simple Simulation, itÂ´s a great game. Gameplay-Time = 2 HOR (Hours on record) ;) You are a Harbor-Worker and must manage you orders and your work-stations. ItÂ´s a simple Rig and letÂ´s roll trucks, trains and ships... U can earn money to buy some new Rails, Parking Lots and so on to get more offers... U can jump to all work-stations and take a preview of the orders or to see what to do. No need for super-graphics. (Choose the Window Mode with u desktop-resolution). If u run it as administrator and set the game-compatibily to Win 7 (Choose u OS) it will start without problems and runÂ´s well without game-crashes or bugs. [My game runs @ Win 7 Ultimate 32bit] The secret is the camera. Use all u camera-views to manage the container-bridge and the mega-forklift to control them without problems. The controls are a lil bit unstable and u have not many options to handle them. OK. But the game is for a (Rondomedia) Presentation >> Controller supported (X360 Gamepad) absolute ok. I would recomment this game. But not for the official price. ;) *Notice: Also u canÂ´t compare this with some SCS, Astragon or Giants Game-Programs. But for a Logistic-Managment-Game itÂ´s ok...Not as a typical UIG \ Actalogic-Simulation-Program. Haha... ItÂ´s programmed from: Crenetic GmbH Studios. Never heard of this Programmer before... Tip: Take some time to practice to learn skills and handle all vehicles \ Harbor Tools...\n\nSo here are my results:\n\nPro:\n\nGraphics: 8 \ 10\nController-Support: 8 \ 10\nGameplay: 8 \ 10\nGamefun: 8 \ 10\nSteam Key supported\n\nContra:\n\nPrice\nInstable Handling (Will try to edit the phisics \ handling script in the next time... ;)\nNo Steam Trade cards\nNo Steam Achievements\n\nRecomment 5 \ 10  = - [Game-Price] :(\n\nSupport the developers and buy the game if u like here >> http://store.steampowered.com/app/328310/\n(May u wait for a reduced offer @ GabeÂ´s :) Autumn Sale soon)...\n\n\n","September 17, 2015","true","23.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ararielfett/recommended/328310/","ararielfett","[á´¸á´¼á´³] Arariel Fett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ararielfett/","285 products in account","This game was released November 5th of 2014, making it four months old.  Normally, for a game that is so new, you'd be okay with the bugs and patiently wait for the developers to fix the issues.  The biggest issue with this game isn't even a fault of the game - the developers have given up on the title already.  This is not confirmed, or something that the developers have straight up said, however, the last update to the game, as well as the last developer/staff interaction we had was in December, the exact day they released an update.  To the developer's credit, they fixed issues that had the game crashing.  However, we have gone three months without any sort of word from the developers.  I was told that development stopped in November, meaning they had this update done in the middle, or toward the end of November, and just completely stopped development after that.\n\nLets move onto some of the bugs that have been encountered and reported.  The first one I encountered was that a train was supposed to have two of the same company brand containers on it.  However, after receiving one container, it'd leave!  The other container would then be accepted onto the second train that was there for different cargo.  While the train took the wrong brand container, it of course didn't end the job because it was on the wrong train.  I reloaded the game several times, but it was a constant issue.  This indicates that two of the contracts were conflicting with each other.\n\nThe second issue was that the truck you pick up and remove pallets from will often despawn when you're still on it.  Most of the time, the truck waits until you're off of it, and then drives away.  When it does despawn, you're left out front, possibly with a pallet that you're now supposed to drive all the way around (slowly, I may add, as forklifts aren't fast) the warehouse just to get back in and unload the pallet or park the forklift back inside.\n\nAnother issue was the physics.  My truck would often get stuck on fences, light posts, and/or walls.  Sometimes if I tried hard enough, I could wiggle it free, but most of the time the truck would have to be reset.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/s2kZHlX.jpg\n\nLooking on the Logistics Community Forum, there is no community anymore.  Yes, you may get one post or two from myself or someone else, but those are either bug reports, asking for help, or asking if the developers are even around.\n\nIt's really sad and frustrating to see that the developers put money and time into this game and got it released, then got one update out, and then abandoned the game all together.  The saddest part is that this is a fun game with really good graphics, and does what a good simulator game should - make you feel like you're actually a worker.  When you take on a lot of jobs, and end up with multiple containers, you find yourself wanting to stack them together and keep them appropriately stored so you know where they are, you know how many there are, and you know if you're getting a little more containers than you can handle.\n\nI got this game just a few days ago, and already put in 20 hours just because of how addicting and fun it can be.  However, because of the lack of updates and lack of proper fixes, there's a good chance I'm not playing this game again.\n\nI do not recommend this game, especially with it being $20.  It is simply not worth that much, and unless the developers get their sh*t in order, it will never be worth more than $10 (but even $10 is being generous in this instance).","March 2, 2015","false","20.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

First was annoying with the container stacker very slowly migating towards the railway line whether you are left, right or head-on which makes loading trucks difficult. I could put up with that one until I bought the warehouse. Doesn't even work, exemption error after exemption error. Wish I done a video of my somarsalting forklift. If it worked then yes it is worth the reduced price, however not in it's present state.
