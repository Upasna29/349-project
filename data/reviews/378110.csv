It's a hacking style / text adventre game that requires you to think and unless you plan on playing it all in one sitting, take old fasioned notes.  The story unfolds via email converstations that lead you to more emails that lead you to more emails.\n\nThe first half of the game is reading emails to get the next users email account password. It even requires you to visit external sites which adds a bit of immersion, but also runs you into the ground. Once of the sites in game is down at the moment and now I am have to cheat to make progress.\n\nNot worth the five dollars, as guessing passwords and user names gets boring.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/recommended/378110/","keohookalani","keohookalani ~plotting~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/","2712 products in account","Hack RUN is an old school text style adventure game, under the premise of you being a master hacker. Unfortunately, hacking is not something you do in this game, but rather, you are a script kiddie extraordinaire. Find out what happens the deeper you go and all will be well?\n\nThe game is run off the windows console, which I didn't realize at first. That wasn't such a big deal, until the game started running my programs on my machine. It has the ability to open notepad, your default browser and open a url, and I'm not sure what else. I'm not entirely sure how I felt about this. Other applications can do the same, but under the premise of the game, it felt odd. Moving right along, the game consists of you tracing down information and using it to proceed to the darker and darker secrets.\n\nSounds: There is one sound that I know of. I don't know how to even rate it.\n\nGraphics: It's all text, except for a few external websites that the executable relies on for you to finish the game.\n\nControls: What controls? It's all about typing.\n\nGame Design: Well the game is extremely linear and achievements unlock as you pass each 'stage' or 'level' though the game. It actually calls them levels. I found that odd. It sort of breaks up the text adventure style concept and breaks the 'narrative' though I'm not sure I can call it that. You're not really hacking in this game, or even doing minor coding as in Hack n' Slash. You're basically an investigator with access to a computer and various scripts/programs are given to you to do more as you proceed further in the game.\n\nMost of the information you need to progress is directly inside the game, and given to you if you look and follow the directions. However, there are a few external sources, where you must access websites outside the game in order to proceed further. This is likely done to enhance the experience and make it more 'real', but for me it made me wonder how long those sites would be up? If those domains aren't renewed or those hosting contracts expire, then the game becomes unplayable.\n\nWhile there are commands built directly into the game, such as, hints, or even answer, sometimes those tell you that you would have to get the information off the aforementioned site. If the domains ever went down, the developer would likely have to release a patch, but more than likely if the sites go down, the dev is abandoning the game. So, that's something to watch out for.\n\nStory: At first it reads as the typical underbelly of humanity hiding themselves from each other. As you progress further and further, you find out more and more and eventually you will reach a moment where you go, "That's how you decided to explain it all?" Personally, because it's a rather disjointed story, I didn't really enjoy the game much. I'm familiar with running systems, and some of the restrictions on what I could do felt rather forced. Further, there was no real digging or searching to really find the information I would need to progress to the next level. The dev typically included only the relevant information. Who keeps their computer systems so clean and organized and free of spam, etc. At least if I had to start digging around, I would have felt like I accomplished something as opposed to correctly proceeding through a set of hoops.\n\nOverall: 4/10 - Skip it unless you're really fasciated by fake commands in fake computer systems. Or grab it in a bundle. If you know anything about running a real network, you'll likely laugh at the 'commands' used to manuveur. Maybe that alone is worth it for some people to buy it. If you really like Text Adventures, then maybe you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, I seriously recommend taking a pass on this title. The base price is way too high for what it is.","May 28","false","0.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Well, I don't play them often but when this one was announced, I've been intrigued.\n\nI've finally decided to play it a few days ago and it was.... wow. Simply flashy green, with commands to write and nothing else around. It's called going straight to the point. And the big negative point? NO MUSIC! Hacker Evolution had music. Good music. Very very good music. And here? I'm playing in a deadly silence....\n\nYou're staying in the game for 2 main reasons:\n- You want to know the story\n- These achievements unlocking each time you're hacking, or receiving, or... in other words, it can be a quick release of achievements.\n\nBecause, let's be honest: typing always the same thing because the piece of information you need is always in an email isn't really captivating. Well, thanks god, there is at least 5% of the game that aren't about typing m and e.\n\nAnd yet, if typing the same thing is boring, trying to find passwords, or usernames, or any clue that can help you is very very enjoyable. I'm only thinking about those that aren't singing the alphabet song in English, because I had to rely on wikipedia to find the right song (and the right version) before giving up and looking at a guide with passwords only (and you're facepalming because you never realized that for three letters, it was a pause after them). And the principle to open notes in the basic notepad and your browser to check websites specific to the game... and even listen to a song - yay, the only track of the game - is awesome. You can keep track of names for exemple. Well, my Notepad++ was already opened to write my walkthrough, so, I never needed to write "notes".\n\nAnyway, the game managed to hook me to the series (though I'm still preferring Hacker Evolution). Maybe 5 bucks is a little too high (as it costs less in app stores) but I'm not feeling like I was robbed.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, my character is now trying to save - again - his loved one in Hack RUN ZERO. After al-\n\n-----press any key to continue----\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONGRATULATIONS, YOU ADVANCED TO LEVEL X - YOU SUCCESFULLY INTERRUPTED VIC'S REVIEW\n\n(I'm not going to reveal here the big twist but 10/10 for the game by the way)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","September 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Note that you are not so much hacking systems, but rather devise usernames and passwords through social engineering. The game has you connect to terminals, read e-mails, use the data from those e-mails to access other systems etc. etc.\n\nThe game starts out simple enough but as more and more systems get piled onto each other, you are bound to lose oversight about 3/4 into the game. Keeping pen and paper nearby to jot down all accounts and passwords is mandatory. If you have bad memory you may even want to keep a list of all systems.\n\nThe game is fairly easy, except for a couple of moments where you basically have to guess passwords ... or prisoner numbers. I had to turn to a walkthrough twice and, looking back, it would have been impossible for me to deduct the needed information myself.\n\nThe story goes into WTF country very fast unfortunately. MASSIVE SPOLER! Aliens??? Also it just does not make any sense that you are one of the first people mentioned in e-mails yet - you the player - doesn't realise that, you have to look up your own name and you don't know about your girlfriend being abducted. Com'on, give us some credit!\n\nStill, the game is recommended for peeps who like text adventures. Stay clear if you don't like to read lots and lots of text. Stay clear if you want action.\n\nAlso, I am a bit wary of the game using external websites. Yes, actually existing websites are needed to gather information! This is a gaming technique that was relatively popular at the end of the 20th century and you can probably guess how that turned out ... When those sites don't get renewed (which is bound to happen at some point in time), the game becomes impossible to solve. I don't understand why the game  just doesn't store its sites in the local gamefiles ...","May 6","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You're given commands which you can run to attempt to access restricted systems.  If you can guess a valid set of credentials you can use that to gain the information you need to target the next person.  Sometimes you get new scripts to run and new targets to use them on.  You never need to devise your own hacks, just acquire the scripts to do what you need.\n\nThis game is clever, but sometimes too much so for its own good.  (Some of the solutions are very obtuse.)\nIt's innovative, in a very retro way.  (It uses the Windows console for the majority of the gameplay)\n\nAll-in-all, it was worth picking up in a bundle and dedicating an hour or two to it.

Some of the puzzles were a little confusing, because maybe I wasn't very good at catching the clues. I like that it sends you to actual websites and videos as a means to make it more immersive. I was caught off guard at first, thinking it was an ad or something. Good job.\n\nThe screen is a bit difficult to read if you have too much text sometimes, and when I clear it, I sometimes forget what I was supposed to do (I was very sick when I played it, thus the lack of concentration and memory). Maybe not a good game for someone who cannot read line after line of text without breaks. I know, obviously, it's supposed to look like that so I can't complain.\n\nThe story execution was a bit confusing and strange, mainly because it was an unforeseen turn. For a moment, I felt like Neo uncovering a huge plot point in the Matrix until the ending kicked in. I have finished this game a few days ago and I still can't grasp who or what wrote this story but I'll assume it's out of this world.\n\nOverall, pretty amusing game. It's not too difficult because we get hints and answers if we ask for it. It's a short game for when you're bored and have nothing to do. Though I can't say when I played it, I thought it was worth what it costs on Steam.","November 17, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wtf\n\n\n\n\nAlien/10 would comprimise aliens to another alien so that alien could kill that alien but that alien would escape to the stars.\n\nI love hacking into alien's accounts.\n\nI also love how the aliens have absolute no firewalls so that a baby could hack them.\n\n","July 17, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No real hacking or code skills required.  Being comfortable with a terminal window is recommended, but not needed either.  A little short, only took 3.5 hrs with minor distractions during play, but for the price, it's worth it.\n\nDitto on the story at the end taking a turn for the WTF lol, but entertaining non the less!!!","June 23, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you have no prior experience, or have a lot of experience, this "riddle" will be very fun to solve.\nThe time and detication put into the game is truely astounding: Multiple websites for the game have been created (that are a PART of the game and not just a fanbase), twists and turns in the plotline, and sense of achievement when you figure out a puzzle. Based on a very big, very powerful company that you need to get intel on, Hack RUN truely has it all.\n11/10\n","February 6","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a simplified command type game that reminds me of those text based adventures I have played in the past. The main objective I suppose is to expose the company in question, RUN. You do this by analyzing emails, websites, videos, and other media to uncover passwords and such. It is really interesting and that is the best word to describe it. While it may not be for everyone, I can certainly say this game is worth trying, possibly if you can find it on sale or in a bundle. Still a good game nonetheless.","May 4","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot near the end was really out there, and the overall storyline just felt really lackluster. There were some difficult puzzles that required a bit of the almighty Google to help research like binary alphabets and translations, but other than that, you just read a lot of emails and figure out things from there.\n\nOverall, not bad.\nA bit pricy though, so buy it when it's on discount, otherwise I don't really recommend it.","September 23, 2015","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
