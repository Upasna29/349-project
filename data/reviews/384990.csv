"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/recommended/384990/","PresidentSkele","Green Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/","1181 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game was made by some degenerate furry, with their vore fetish at the forefront, and I thought I could just buy it, trash it in a review and move on, yet it's one of the best, most authentic arcade experiences I've ever had.\n\nI mean look at this.[41.media.tumblr.com] What the heck am I supposed to say? I can't defend what this comic series is about. I don't know ♥♥♥♥ about it, but it kind of sickens me. However, if I astral project myself away from this and just think of the game as its own thing, well, I'll explain why I like it.\n\nWhen I first started it, I was confused. "First person perspective? Being able to move around? Why?"\n\nThen it hit me when I was playing: The noise. The atmosphere.\n\nThe sound of the joystick, the click of the button. Playing with a 360 controller, I could swear I was playing with an arcade pad. There's no way you can replicate that in an emulated fashion unless you get yourself one, but even then. There's something about staring down into a simulated CRT monitor of an arcade machine that playing it as any other game wouldn't have given you. Arcade machines were something special - like a big bulky advertising box that wants to sell itself to you. (Or maybe a prostitute comparison is apt here?) Arcade machines were the kind of thing you dreamed of taking home with you, as opposed to some crappy home port no doubt Acclaim had something to do with.\n\n"Gon' E-Choo!" (I kinda don't like that name) is as it says on the tin: A 3 stage "platformer" where you collect letters (The paper kind. Although for awhile I thought they were white hats for some reason) while avoiding a gator and bees. Avoiding the gator is just plain fun, like a primitive stealth game, where obfuscating simple AI patterns feels like you're tricking something - like showing a dog a mirror and it thinks its own reflection is another dog. There's not a whole lot to discuss here besides the sublime, simplistic design, which yes, does take its cues from Popeye - but you know what? I like Popeye, but the game is different enough from it that it's not an outright clone. At worst, I'd call it an extremely well done rom hack that adds new levels, as opposed to how I think of it as an homage to a classic. (It even has similar Thru signs.)\n\nIn fact, the game feels very much like a love letter to arcades. If you look around the room you're in, you'll find fictional flyers and the guts/parts of an arcade machine you can examine. There's also a tape player you can blare over the music and sound of the game. (A nice touch is that you can turn off the arcade machines music and just leave the SFX on, which is pretty awesome. Custom music tape mod when?)\n\nSo I've gushed about it. Any problems? Well... there is kind of one, but it's not in the way you think. You see, it's the controls. They're far too precise. With a keyboard, the game works as you'd expect,  the problem is the Xbox 360 controller. It was never truly precise, it's a good controller that fits a lot of games like a glove, but for Gon E-Choo, I got myself into a few too many pickles I knew I could have prevented if I was using something better. At the same time though, I want to use a controller for this game, cause it's the right kind of game for it.\n\nFor minor problems, I guess the side panelling of the arcade machine could be more eye catching. I mean I could be wrong, but how common are arcade machines with black and white comics on the sides of it? Maybe the power up could serve more of a purpose than letting you eat the gator? Maybe a mini game like a lot of later arcade games started adding? I don't know, at this point I'm nitpicking.\n\nI know furries are a punchline, but this more than anything proves to me that a person can have bad taste in fetishes, but they can have supremely excellent taste in video game design. I think a lot of indie devs that think they're "totally like, making retro games, man" could learn a lot from this title. I recommend it.\n\nThe Pro's:\n+Feels absolutely authentic\n\n+Throwback arcade design that's still fun today\n\n+First person view adds a lot to the immersion\n\n+The price is excellent\nThe Con's:\n-Vore... furries... oh god\n\n-360 controller is just too imprecise for such a precise game","November 2, 2015","true","4.1"," 69 of 90 people (77%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","77","69","90","21","6"

Here you go.\n\nFeels like Popeye, vaguely reminds me of Mappy, and I would gladly let it eat my quarters any day if I were to see it in real life.\n\nThere's Easter Eggs, and everything involved with this title creates a lost world that time forgot, but never really existed.\n\nThe levels are fair enough to be playable, but still believably hard to be an 80's arcade title.\n\nFor the price, it's fair. On sale, it's a steal.\n\nGive it a spin if you love old school hardcore.

You pick up paper airplanes while running from the gator and killing flies with your yoyo, and once per life you can pick up the power-up comic book(?) and devour him instead. Picking up all the airplanes lets you advance to the next lavel.\n\nThe back room in which the game is situated is an interesting device in itself. It's a dirty back room that looks like a workshop, given the bins of parts and pile of speakers. I'm wondering if there's eventually going to be an easter egg that lets you open that door and see what's beyond. Perhaps something having to do with the letters that appear when you retrieve each airplane.\n\nOverall, worth a look for $2, and it'll be interesting to see what'll be coming in the future.","August 19, 2015","true","4.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","0"

The music and graphics are spot on for an 80's arcade game. I'm also really digging the overall look of the arcade cabinet.  Lots of nice little touches too, like the cabinet joystick moving along with the player's actions. I kinda geeked out when I saw scan lines on the game screen, simulating an old CRT monitor.\n\nA treat for fans of arcade classics and totally worth the asking price.\n\n10/10 will try to not get eaten again.","July 29, 2015","true","10.4"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","21","28","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jit/recommended/384990/","Jit","Jit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jit/","291 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPretty much like any other arcade game. As in, the mechanics are simple, you can get caught off-guard easily, there's a good bit of challenge as your pursuant gets faster and pauses for less time before grabbing for you, and if you know how the mechanics all work then you can try to pull off risky manuevers or just game the system and all that. Not to mention, besides the game, there's the whole arcade-cabinet-in-basement/garage environment where you're actually looking at the screen, hearing the music in that close environment through speakers, click of the joystick and buttons and all?\n\nAt any rate, for 2 bucks it's not bad. It's simple, the levels repeat (with growing difficulty), and the gameplay isn't hard to pick up, but grows challenging over time. I come back to it fairly often, mainly to give it another go and get farther, and also because I want to beat my friends' high scores because we're one-upping each other. So yeah, I think it's a fun little game.\n\nBy the way I should throw this disclaimer on here, I was the one who made the bleep bloop sounds and music, yeah. I didn't have anything to do with the gameplay or art or deciding mechanics or anything, though, I just supplied noises. I do legitimately think the game's decent, though, but yeah just putting that bit of transparency out there in case people think I'm reviewing my own product or something.","August 11, 2015","true","13.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lobst/recommended/384990/","lobst","Lobst","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lobst/","1191 products in account","Gon' E-Choo! replicates the "feel" of a classic game better than any other modern retro game I've experienced. The others seem too focused on delivering the aesthetic (usually with too many colors) alongside gameplay that conforms to modern videogame expectations: there has to be an overarcing story, a metagame, a save system, character growth, a difficulty curve that gently guides players to credits. Gon' E-Choo! doesn't do any of that. This game only sets out to deliver a new-one-of-those, and absolutely succeeds.\n\nWhile there's no explicit campaign, the game does give you an overarcing goal: a notepad tells you the game can be broken to the point where someone can play it all day on a single quarter. But the only way to do this is the same way you'd exploit a classic arcade game: by learning the AI patterns to the point where nothing can surprise you. (There is a helpful cheat code, but even when it's used I can only make it to stage 57 or so.) I currently have a text file full of AI notes and stage strategies; it seems like I have it all worked out, I just need to get my reflexes to the point where I can do this in my sleep.\n\nThere is a motive for getting as far in as you can, from a this-is-merchandise-for-an-actual-brand standpoint: the webcomic has a cryptic side to it, related to the gator's origin. The comic teases a letter that may hold some answers, but it's only shown the first line so far. The whole thing appears to be in this game, however; it's drip-fed line-by-line with every three stages you complete. But that's only a motivator if you're interested in the lore of a silly furry webcomic (which -- and I'm going to take a wild guess, here -- I bet most people aren't). The game itself stands on its own.\n\nIf there's anything else in this game, I'll update this review -- but for the amount of fun I've had with it so far, I'd absolutely recommend it at $1.99.

I don't remember playing a modern retro-style game that has transported me back to my quarter-crazy youth so enjoyably and thoroughly.\n\nYou play the role of a derby-wearing pink cat who is trying to collect letters in the form of paper airplanes that soar back an forth to the bottom of the screen. While running around collecting them, there is an alligator trying to eat the cat. Also, there is a power up that allows you to turn the tables and eat the alligator. This simple premise, like a good arcade game, is addictive.  A lot of quarters would have been pumped into this back in the day.\n\nThe sound is spot on for the chips that were used at that time and the music is a happy little jingle. The characters are unique yet familiar and could have had their own Saturday morning cartoon. The CRT screen emulation, animations, and graphics are straight out of a time-warp. For me, it really captures the atmosphere of playing an old cabinet game and it offers the fun of learning to master a new machine.\n\nSome might not like the simplicity and repitition of a game with only three different screens (a treehouse in the woods, a backyard and a shopping mall) or appreciate the charm, but I think those people are going to be few and far between. And even at full price you can own it for less than 8 plays on a real quarter-operated game.\n\nNOTE: The developer is very active in the forums and has already made some excellent updates since release.","July 29, 2015","true","18.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","3"

Is this because it's a VR-focused game and head movements are supposed to be minimal?\nThankfully, you have the option to skip using the hub entirely and go straight to the game, without any "trappings of reality", but a lot of the magic is misssing when you do that.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nCome on, its got an otter protagonist. How could you NOT play this?\nIn all seriousness, for its price, it's got decent gameplay, good story, fun music, and a fun level design.

It's not a very long game, but this isn't much of a gripe, as most games were similar back in the day. The real fun comes from the challenge and addictive high-score chasing.\n\nThat and the vorephiliacs amongst us will probably have a blast too.

Exploring your cement cage will only result in locked doors and various promotional materials for 'Gon' E-Choo!'.  There might be a sub plot about child base diseases wiping out humanity.\n\nThe game you play in the game is a simplistic platformer where you collect paper airplanes while avoiding a crocodile trying to eat you.

I think it's a lot of fun, but that's because I'm an old-school arcade gamer. To me, the £1.59 price mentally comes up as "16 credits at 10p a go" and that doesn't seem like terrible value.\n\nIt's a lot like if you took a few early 1980s arcade games and mushed them together - it's mostly like Popeye - you collect falling floaty things before they get to the bottom of the screen while this big angry guy chases you, unless you get the power-up that moves about at the sides of the screen. The animations are very reminiscent of that original game, as well as the mechanics.\n\nThe animal theme and the inventiveness of the second level, with the big tree and the way you can jump and springboard from one side of the level to the other remind me of Peter Pack Rat. It is a looooong time since anything made me think of Peter Pack Rat!\n\nAnd "getting a power-up and eating the bad guy" makes me think of Pac Man. :)\n\nThe arcade game is, for some reason, in an arcade machine in a tiny dingy room containing spare arcade parts, flyers for the game, and a tape deck with a piece of music that's like real people recorded the game's theme. I guess it's to add "atmosphere" to the experience, but to me, this just felt kind of lonely and claustrophobic. So I went into the options and made it display the game only.\n\nThe graphical style, the font chosen for the text, the music with its authentic sounding bloops and bleeps, and gameplay are all the atmosphere I need. They are very faithful to arcade gaming of that era; I feel that a lot of love has gone into getting the small details right.\n\nThe one drawback is that the game has too few levels before it repeats. It's only got 3 levels. I mean, to compare, Mr Do had 8 levels before it repeated, and I think that's a fair number.\n\nSo - I would recommend this game, but really only to people who already have fond memories of early 1980s arcade gaming. I don't know if it would hold the attention of anyone else.","January 18","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
