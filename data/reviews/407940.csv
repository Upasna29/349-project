You control a circular \"ship\" as you defeat red enemies and bounce on blue ones.\n\nThe game has a wide range of different game modes to choose from including Arcade Classic, Time Rush and Tournament mode with 2 secret, unlockable modes that are just too hot to handle!\n\nThere\'s also a lot of customization options you can mess with like game speed (Up to 200%) and various visual effects like pixelate or inverse (Inverse will set your cornias on fire, you have been warned).\n\nThe game is definitely Flump Studios\' best release to date and they\'ve improved on their shoot em up formula quite a bit with Hyper Bounce Blast as well and it\'s great to finally have seen the final product as well.\n\nWe gave Hyper Bounce Blast 4.2 stars out of 5 in our full review and we\'re going to be giving the game our recommendation here on Steam as well. Defijnitely worth checking out if you\'re a fan of bullet hell games.\n\nWe\'ve also recorded a gameplay video which you can find below, happy gaming!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weTfbhqOffE","May 31","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I played and enjoyed Horizon Shift, but this game goes above and beyond what Horizon Shift did in terms of fun.\n\nGameplay is pretty simple. You bounce around on blue enemies, absorbing bullets when you are hopping around, and shoot the red enemies. Of course there a boss battles and bonus stages to play as well. When you pair the awesome, varied gameplay and a great soundtrack, you have a great game.\n\n1/1 good game","May 28","true","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadliar/recommended/407940/","Deadliar","Jack Darx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadliar/","544 products in account","Hyper Bounce Blast is a sort of follow up to Horizon Shift, as in it's an another game that puts an another new twist on the classic arcade shooter genre. Now Horizon Shift was a cool game however I felt confused by it's mechanics at times (probably my own fault because i'm not that used to crazy mechanics) however this game is a completely different story.\n\nHBB's main mechanic is as expected, bouncing! You bounce off blue platforms and enemies and while you are in the air bouncing, you cannot be killed and the higher you bounce, the more points you will get when shooting enemies.\n\nSo it becomes an interesting game of multitasking because you have to maintain your bouncing while also dealing with enemies and obstacles that appear in later waves and frankly? It never gets TOO HARD, it's always fair, so when I mess up it is my fault because I wasn't paying attention because everything in this game is telegraphed very well in advance.\n\nAlso the bosses definitely not dissapoint and make full use of the mechanics, so expect hectic platforming shooting action on those!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game for everyone, even those who do not play these games. PS. Try to get 5 stars so you can witness the amazing tribute to a classic ;)","May 29","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As an old-school gamer, I alwys value playability over any kind of story.\n\nThis title, much like the previously released Horizon Shift, epitomises how a progressive, balanced and well implemented set of gameplay mechanics can take a genre like the humble shmup and bring it bang up to date.\n\nAfter 5 waves, i was interested... After 10 waves, i was hooked! Invest your time into learning the stages and see your scores increase almost exponentially. Soon you\'ll be bouncing and blasting your way around the screen with reckless abandon. And your reward for mastering these mechanics...? You can play them again, with MUCH harder settings!\n\nIf you consider yourself a lover of games, you really should own this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warrn/recommended/407940/","warrn","Warrn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warrn/","387 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis game is a very creative take on a shmup with platforming elements. Shoot the reds, bounce on the blues. Kill all of the few green enemies in each wave to reach a very fun bonus round. Gameplay is simple and easy to start, but difficult to master with so much going on! I was immediately reminded of Geometry Wars not only by the visual style but also by the mess of things happening all at once. Fortunately, in this game you are completely invulnerable to enemy attacks as long as you stay airborne by bouncing off the blue enemies. As an added bonus, when bouncing, you actually absorb enemy fire to power up your screen-obliterating special attack! Despite the invulnerability, it can still be quite challenging as blue enemies aren't always spaced out evenly. If you aren't keeping the reds and their projectiles thinned out, hitting the ground can spell the instant loss of a life. Boss battles limit your bouncing and provide a bit more of a bullet hell experience, but are not too challenging and very fair once you learn their patterns.\n\nAll in all, Hyper Bounce Blast is a lot of fun and can be very addicting. I definitely recommend it!","May 29","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I would also like to mention that the developer is a cool person and is willing to talk to customers about problems they have with their product.\n\nHere is my honest review, this review reflects my feelings towards this game and it's soundtrack.\n\nThe game is just pure fun. To go into more detail the game has unique concepts that blend well when you are playing the game. The platforming feels great, satisfyang, and responsive, which leads to some satisfyiong jump combos. The shooting also does it's job just fine. I use mouse and keyboard instead of controller, but I can only imagine that controllers are better than the M+K setup. The game is in all honesty just pure fun, I genuinely can't think of any cons at the moment; not to say that there aren't any cons, but none of any significance.\n\nI'm glad to say that the soundtrack is just as awesome as the game itself. The soundtrack not only sounds great, but also matches the game through the type of rythm's. During the waves of enemies the soundtrack is energetic, but before a boss it switches to give you a sense of approaching danger, then it goes to a new song that is different then the ones played during the waves.\n\nAll in all I couldn't recommend this game enough, espescially since the asking price is only 5$. I would also recommend everyone to check out other flump studio games, they are all fun.","May 30","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
