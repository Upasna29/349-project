I purchased the game on wii-ware a long while ago, and I enjoyed it thouroughly.\n\nAs for the game itself, I would say it is much better than the previous installment. It continues where it left off, but if you are forced to play only one game, I'd say play this one. The season change mechanic merges wonderfully with the metroid-vania style exploration gameplay. It makes the game, as a whole, a wonderful and unique experience.\n\nAs for the port, it's a competant port. It works completely fine: No stuttering, visuals are still wonderful, and the mechanics/controls are slightly updated. However, it does seem to lack very many general options such as keybindings, graphical options, etc. But that is most likely due to the fact that it is a wii-ware port.\n\nYes I know its an metroidvania platformer: a genre often critisized for oversaturating the market. But its "wind" mechanic and wonderful exploration puzzles show a remarkable appretiation for craftsmanship that are rarely seen in games.","March 26","true","0.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Its abit longer than the first. I finished the game in about 4 hours. Once I get all he collectables, I doubt I will play it again.\n\nThis game need sound controls badly. The music while beautiful, is too loud compared to the sound effects. The same control issues in the first game are in the second.","March 26","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
