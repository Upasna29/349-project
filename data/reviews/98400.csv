It combines oldschool FPS gameplay from the Unreal era with shiny modern visuals, then adds a light sprinkling of modern shooter mechanics (a regenerating shield meter, two basic weapons that can be upgraded into several very different forms) that enhance the core gameplay without overwhelming it.  Graphic novel-style cutscenes between levels tell a serviceable cyberpunk tale that provides context for all the shooting, but once the action starts, the story elements have the good grace to step aside and let you get down to business.  The levels are open and reward exploration, with secrets to find and explosive items scattered about that let you set up environmental kills - another nod to oldschool design.\n\nIf you have even the slightest interest in oldschool FPS's, you owe it to yourself to check out Hard Reset.","November 23, 2013","true","13.7"," 249 of 269 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","249","269","0","1"

This game is ludicrously obscure.\nSimply put, Hard Reset is Bulletstorm done right. Made by 35 people on a budget of less than 5 million bucks, you can see the personality in this game.\nThe gameplay is a solid case of using the environment to your advantage, and the soundtrack is some of the best cyberpunk-esque you're going to hear in a long, long time.\nThe graphics put a very large number of triple a games to shame, and all in all the gameplay, sound design and aesthetic come together to make grenading a large group of enemies very, very, very satisfying.\nMy one and only complaint, as you tend to have with budget titles, is that the story was visibly handled after the rest of the game, being told almost entirely through a comic book style series of cutscenes with voice acting (that sometimes doesn't even match up with the guy voicing the character in gameplay) that doesn't exactly go out of its way to win any awards.\nAside from all this, the developers get major kudos for releasing extension DLC a good 8 months after the game's release completely free.\n\nHard Reset is a beautiful snack for folks who love retro shooters the likes of Doom, Serious Sam and Duke Nukem, but anyone else should steer clear, as this thing is a hell of an obscure niche title.","October 19, 2013","true","34.6"," 178 of 194 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","178","194","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmsnake/recommended/98400/","mmsnake","pH. mmSNAKE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmsnake/","296 products in account","I picked this up for cheap and put it on the "do play" pile. After it finaly got to my notice I went through it and was plesently surprised. This game might not be perfect but in some respect it gives plenty of good shooting without most of the modern flaws that plague FPS genre.\n\nLet me get the downsides off first. The game is extremely linear. This is pretty much a coridor shooter with few hidden nooks and crannies that serve as game's secrets. There is very little variety in what you do, you go from one area, flip a switch fight enemies and move on. This in itself isn't a bad thing as long as the shooting is good, which it is. Another issue  (which does have a fix) is the checkpoint system. You can't manualy save, for the most part it works fine but on harder difficulties there are sequences of encounters where there are no checkpoints in between and each encounter requires near flawless execution to proceed. It can be frustrating repeating the same bit over and over, just to die by one small enemy that sneaked past you. Thankfully via console you can bind a key to set your own checkpoint whenever you like. It works but beware, I wouldn't set checkpoints mid fight, do it only between encounters or you might end up corrupting your save file. With this little tweak the game becomes substantially better, because the biggest source of frustration is removed.\n\n*Press ctrl+~ to bring up the console*\n-Type: bind *whatever key you want* save //this will make that key set a checkpoint at that moment\n\n-Type: bind *whatever key you want* load//this button will become quick load button to your checkpoint\n\nDifficulty in this game is done right surprisingly. Game's harder difficulties are legitimately hard. They aren't unfair hard, you have plenty of tools at your disposal to deal with anything the game throws at you at any point, but if you are playing the first time and don't know what to upgrade...well you might run into good amount of frustration.\n\nUpgrade system is simple and robust. Killing enemies and collecting nano will "level  up" Fletcher. Then you can spend points upgrading one of your two guns or your suit. The two guns aren't really two guns. Each gun has 5 modes(you start with only one each), and each mode has 2 different fire modes. In essence you have 10 guns, with half of them using one ammo pool while other half the other.You get to pick which gun you get next, and which upgrades for it via the upgrade system. If playing the game the first time that can be a bit unfair because some upgrades are clearly more beneficial over others without the game giving you any sort of hint of what you need.\n\nEvery enemy type has simple ways of dispatching it, but the game gives little hint to what you need to use, you have to figure it out yourself. That can be harsh when you never knew you had to upgrade emp blast for the blaster or stasis for the mortar. However once you figure this out, it's a very pleasant skill based shooting experience. Speaking of enemies, beware, even the smallest enemies will rip you to pieces in seconds on harder difficulties. You will die if you let anything get near.\n\nOverall this game was a really pleasant expereince, a little bit of take on Painkiller formula but not quite there yet. Still if you like a skill based shooting where you can get plenty of challange, this is the right game to play.","October 4, 2013","true","21.4"," 97 of 103 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","97","103","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/recommended/98400/","internisus","internisus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/","2421 products in account","I kind of hate this game.  Playing it well requires constantly harnessing the diversity of your arsenal, and I am just not good at fighting with more than one gun at a time.  It is often difficult for me to assess a situation rapidly enough in the middle of battle—while my brain is consumed with the effort of dodging, shooting, and navigating to health and ammo pickups just in the nick of time—to see an opportunity for a better tactic represented by one of my other weapons.\n\nSo it has been an extremely frustrating experience, particularly because I stubbornly insist on sticking with Hard difficulty to the end (just regular Hard, mind you; there is worse available, if you wish for it).  I can only play one level per session because it's such an exhausting ordeal, and I've spent the entire latter half of the game wishing it would end already.\n\nYet, objectively, I recognize that Hard Reset is a very good first-person shooter of the old school style.  There are moments when I actually manage to adapt and perform well, and it is quite gratifying.  I certainly do recommend it.  Just be honest with yourself about who you really are before you make that purchase.","October 26, 2014","true","18.6"," 91 of 103 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","91","103","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/98400/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Went in with no expectations and left 8 hours later think... that was a bloody fun game!\n\nSo, imagine a movie from the 1980s, it's about Humans fighting machines, only the movie isn't Terminator, it's some B-Movie Polish Sci-Fi movie starring a guy that vaguly looks like Michael Biehn. They wanted to hire Michael Biehn to be the actor, but sadly the producer had spent the entire budget on the SFX - that's basically Hard Reset.\n\nForget about trying to make sense of the story, which is pretty off the wall and has liberal use of swear words (like a teenager out of earshot of their parents). For this game isn't about an deep storyline where the plot is a social commentary - no; this game is about one thing... shooting robots. Lots of robots, and causing some really impressive explosions.\nThat's where Hard Reset excels - making things explode.\nIt has some of the best lighting effects I've seen in a computer game, which it uses it effectively throughout the game. I'm not one to really care or comment on lighting in computer games, but for once I'm willing to give it a go.\n\nThe neon world (insert Blade Runner comparison here) contrasts well with the dark gritty under-streets you start in. Yet that isn't the most impressive part of the lighting, it's the lightning that comes from your gun, or sub-stations that spew out lightning shocks that attack the robots and cause environmental damage. Wonderful stuff. Or the huge fireball explosions that emit from Gas Mains and Pipes. It's all nice stuff.\n\nAlso, like all good 80's Movies this game plays host to one amazing soundtrack that underscores the entire gameplay experience. Like classic shooters before it the music kicks in when the action ramps out and dies out as the last robot's motorservers slowly whine down as it dies in front of you. It's hard to describe the soundtrack, but it fits like a glove.\n\nBasically this is a First Person Shooter. It's not ashamed of being a FPS; it grabs the genre and runs with it, only it doesn't stop after the first down... no it continues. It doesn't attempt to re-invent the wheel at any point in the game, so it might get a little stale towards the end, but for me the fun lasted a good 7 hours. It was just refreshing to play a game that knew what it was and tried to be the best it could be at it's genre.\nI'm not going to claim it's an 'old school' FPS, as it isn't, but there are some nice nods to previous FPS throughout the game that fans of the genre will pick up on.\n\nThe biggest compliment I can really give this game is that I expected nothing, and came away wanting to raise awareness of the game and get more people playing it.","May 22, 2014","true","10.1"," 68 of 73 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","68","73","0","6"

Energy weapon have plasma rifle, shock blaster, railgun, homing projectiles and electric mortar with slowing field. In addition most weapons have alternate fire mode. Hard Reset is challenging, foes are quick and deadly even the smallest one which will swarm player with maximum ferocity like ants.

Yeah, go figure.\nThat's why they decided to not waste a DVD on it.\n\nTHE POSITIVES\n\n1. This is a PC exclusive (a rare breed these days) with the fully optimized graphic options. The controls are smooth and responsive. I also found myself being swept over with feeling again and again that I was playing a PC exclusive. It is worth paying money to have that feeling - that's what the consoles are turning us into.\n\n2. Your character is not a mute like in most shooters.\n\n3. I will say that the new engine delivers. The distant vistas, the textures, the physics, the explosions, the graphics in general are great, DirectX 9.0c and all. The details are meticulous especially up close, you can see the tiniest scratches and dents on the objects.\n\n4. True, there is no health regeneration.\n\n5. The game runs smoothly, no FPS spikes, the dozen or so near-simultaneous explosions are an eye-candy.\n\n6. Upgrades for the 10 weapons as well as the gear is always welcome. However, just like in Witcher 2, as soon as you finish upgrading one "tech tree" or one upgradable branch the game ends.\n\n7. Finally, this game has style. Even though the streets and the slums are empty except for the rampant robots, the peculiar sci-fi world where humanity has learned to download its consciousness into the computer is pretty cool to ponder about.\n\n\nThe minuses:\n\n1. No crouching.\n\n2. No melee (I doubt it's useful against the machines anyway but quite often they do get close enough to ram you)\n\n3. You cannot see your legs and you do not cast a shadow.\n\n4. BUT there is SHIELD regeneration - something the previewers failed to mention. So the concept of the old school no-health-regeneration kinda goes out the window.\n\n5. No reloading.\n\n6. The story is kinda blah.\n\n7. The amount of enemy types is very limited.\n\n8. The jump is realistic. And I by that I mean it is practically nonexistent. You cannot jump over the rails and some other objects even when it seems like you can to save time.\n\n9. The game is extremely short. (4.5 hours)\n\n\nThe debatable table:\n\n1. Initially, there is little to no tactics involved. Once you are met by a group of enemies you will tend to just retreat/move in circles and shoot them up. Since there is no reload option, there really is no incentive for you to stop shooting or taking time for aiming. You will also quickly utilize the environment for more efficient destruction. Tesla coils from the consoles, the explosions from the barrels, the gas balloons, etc., it's all there.\n\n2. The gameplay is a cross of Doom 3, Serious Sam, Pain Killer and perhaps Unreal Tournament. Oh wait, all of those games have the same gameplay, that's right you move fast and you blow things away with the hundreds of rounds of ammo. So do not expect this game to make you ration your ammo or even health for that matter since your shield will regenerate.\n\n3. The game is extremely linear [duh, it's a shooter) although there are plenty of secret areas that can be accessed if you blow up one of the adjacent oil barrels. Do not expect these secret areas to hold any secrets pertaining to the game, you will just find extra ammo most of the time.\n\n\nIn the end, I found myself being sucked into this game nonetheless somehow. True, it is short, but on the other hand, you do not have to commit too much of your time into beating it.","November 27, 2013","true","4.3"," 131 of 172 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","131","172","0","0"

The plot is simple: You're Fletcher, working for "The Corporation" holding the perimeter of Bezoar city against incursion of killer robots from the outside. When a breach in Sector 6 happened, you're the closest unit to respond, and you must defeat the robot minions, from small swarmers (size of dogs) to gorillas (they charge you, hard), to shooters and more. There are 4-12 secrets per level for you to discover. Some are quite visible, but you have no idea how to get to (some require strategic demolition of certain walls, just like Doom).\n\nThe plot has a couple twists and the voice acting... well, falls to the cliche at times. But the cutscnes are rendered in comic book style (albeit with sprite animations) to make for a unique look.\n\nAnother uniqueness to the game is plethora of environment kill objects, i.e. the proverbial 'exploding barrel', except in this game, they are all over the place. Explosive gas containers, barrels, high voltage fans, trash collectors, heaters on walls, they all explode or zap everything around them for a few seconds when hit. And you get extra points for using enviro-kills rather than your own ordnances.\n\nYour guy gets three area of upgrades... body, projectile gun, and energy gun. Each area has 5 items that can be purchased / upgraded, and each item can have up to 2 additional upgrades. You come with plasma (for energy) and rifle (for projectile), as well as simple shields (i.e. you have 1 of each). As you advance, and collect N.A.N.O. the currency, whcih are "yellow/gold" in the game, you can eventually spend them at upgrade machines to buy the upgrades.\n\nCertain enemies are more vulnerable to certain types of weapons, so you'll need to switch things up a bit. The enemies are helpfully color coded to help you sort out which is which.\n\nThere are PLENTY of boss battles, but basically, defeat all the minions that rushes you, then when the boss starts glowing red on certain sections, shoot those sections. Those areas don't glow red until you defeat the minions, so you can't concentrate on the boss alone. There are probably several groups of these vulnerable points you need to destroy before you can destroy the boss, while its minions hound you.\n\nAnd there were many many levels. When you die, you are sent back to the nearest autosave / checkpoint, with one death recorded against your accomplishments on this level. There are plenty of achievements, such as time spent, how much of the level's NANO did you gather, how many kills, how many envirokills, damage done, damage received, and so on.\n\nThere are some jumping puzzles, but nothing too dramatic. There is no crouch, so it's shoot only.  Some secret areas requires extended attempts at jumping and running.\n\nAll in all, Hard Reset is an old fashioned shooter with a better than decent plot and lots of action, but the call for enviro-kills seem to go against the shooter philosophyit adopted. It however, is a lot of fun to play.","August 9, 2015","true","14.2"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","49","58","3","0"

Whilst there might be some games you could reasonably say this of, Hard Reset is a shining example of how this statement isn't always true.\n\nThe graphic fidelity shown here is stunning for such a small developer, and the world created is very believable and detailed. As soon as you jump in, you definitely get a Bladerunner kind of vibe going on, and it serves to create an excellent atmosphere.\n\nI personally found the story to be a bit generic and therefore lacking (although I do confess in not exactly being a story person for games), but this doesn't really matter as the game does so well in it's execution. From the very start, the game sets a good pace, along with a fair challenge that never feels cheap or unreasonable. From the very first battle, I found the lovely destructive explosions of the robots expiring along with the smacks and clanks of hitting the machinery incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe only real downside I had with the game is in it's length - it's a few short hours, and does indeed feel like it's only getting going when it ends.  I understand this may be mended somewhat with the inclusion of the DLC, but I haven't played it myself so can't comment.\n\nSo, on balance I'd say for it's full price of £9.99, you might be better served by looking elsewhere. However, if it comes up on offer for anything less, then it is a worthy purchase.\n\nI think it may end up surprising you!","November 27, 2013","true","2.9"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","45","55","0","9"

If you like either of those games at all, you can stop reading now and just buy and play Hard Reset especially given the price.\n\nMany of the game play elements, points accumulation and level crafting are very similar to those of Pain Killer.  But Hard Reset has a Cyberpunk/AI based theme and evokes the sensibilities of Blade Runner including Industrial/Urban rainy scenes in low light though it is has many scenes that are very bright.  It actually has some truly beautiful though Industrially themed scenes.\n\nIt has many secret areas and collectable items.  The character movement is fairly traditional though is not too stictly scripted -- you can fall to your death in many areas.   There is some tricky jumping and climbing involved to access the secret areas (some are as difficult as those in Pain Killer).  There is a weapons/armor crafting system that allows one to buy upgrades for weaponry that suites your style (the shotgun is authoritative, I like it).\n\nWhile it is not an open world, and has no optional quests, the level design is very complex and involves significant maze running.  You  won't likely be bored by traversing similarly designed levels -- the scenes are all quite different.    The visual quatlity is very good and the game performance is remarkably good and has no real bugs or jarring graphical artifacts.  The AI's are very good and at higher levels will brutalize you.  But this is well suited to an aggressive style of guns-blazing play style that starts in the first 30 seconds of play.  It's a shooter :)\n\nThe game is very replayable which I think makes up for it's main problem -- it is a bit short and difficult (think of it as a Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ short story).  So you might want to try it first on a difficulty level that is a notch down from your typical settings.  You can replay the game at higher level using the weaponry you acquired on a lower level.\n\nThe best thing I can say is this: in my first play through, I was sorry that the game came to end.","November 29, 2015","true","73.6"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

Indeed, it has some specifics from earlier times such as non-regenerating health (shields regenerate though), health and ammo pickups, secrets and waves upon waves of enemies. However, developers must have thought that "old-school=hardcore" and this game suffers from several major drawbacks.\n- no quicksave. actually, no save at all. game uses autosave functions whenever it thinks is the best time\n- story is some mess\n- bulletsponged enemies. even on normal the weakest enemies require to waste your ammo\n- practically all enemies use the same tactics - to jump on you or to charge at you and deal melee damage\n- if you manage to hide, than you will be damaged by homing ranged attacks\n- if you try to "head-to-head" fight, your only way to defend yourself is sidestepping. But guess what? You move VEEERYYY slowly, all enemies are much faster than you\n- lackluster guns. out of all 10 weapon upgrades, 2 or 3 are capable of dealing at least some sort of damage: RPG. Grenade launcher, Railgun and for the best - Smartgun. You will spam smartgun 99% of the time when you get it.\n- Lackluster guns make you too much dependable on environmental damage\n- slow and clunky movement and jumping makes finding some secrets very frustrating. it is unknown whether you can't reach some places because there is an invisible wall or because your jumping sucks. Not to mention jump-stepping, when you wand, you automatically step forward or sideways\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥eeet boss battles, especially that sucker from the Exile DLC.\n- all these drawbacks make Hard Reset a really hard game (thus probably the name, it resets you brain)\nThe positive points are:\n+ Nice graphics and art\n+ Interesting evolving weapons (similar to Bioshock)\n+ It is not "a modern realistic military shooter"\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this game for those who want a challenging scifi shooter that puts you in a disadvantage all the time. If you just want to kill waves of enemies, play Serious Sam instead.","May 30, 2014","false","26.7"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","1"

The story? There's a story? At least one to care about.. NO!

OK maybe not too brainless, since the game will test you to figure out strategies to outsmart a gang of robots in a very small space, that's when the thinking kick into play. Might be me but i had to think a bit, maybe it was share luck but the fact is i got through.\n\nThe graphics is pretty good so that's a plus and like i said the kill is satisfying. you feel the explosions and destruction by the hands of your weapons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/98400/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","Hard Reset is a game that very clearly sets out to evoke the more generic and traditional FPS style of yesteryear with the visuals aesthetic of a more modern game.  It does that pretty well and it's a fun and enjoyable game, but it fails in a few areas that are somewhat glaring, and it does have it's problems.  If you're about to stop reading this review because I'm not going to be 100% positive about this review, well, that's your perrogative, but I'm not saying it's by any means a bad game.  It's a good game, bordering on great, but it has some foilbes that hold it back from true excellence.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is probably one of the parts it really does very well, and it extends entirely through the game.  It has a very heavy cyberpunk aesthetic, loading screens are hidden behind very artfully done comic book intermissions, and the visuals of the game are absolutely gorgeous.  It has an actually fairly strong story for a FPS (which .. admittedly isn't saying much), and things thematically are pretty strong and engaging.  However, there's two fairly large problems with this aesthetic and both of them essentially boil down to making things hard to distinguish.  First of all, having robotic enemies in a game level that largely involves a lot of technological set pieces makes it very difficult to distinguish enemies at a glance.  Compare this to something like Painkiller or Serious Sam where the enemies are relatively speaking very easy to distinguish from the scenery.  Also, having electrical particle effects for hit confirmations on enemies when the destructible environment pieces also give off the same or similar particle effects make it difficult to say whether you are hitting an enemy with your shots, or the environment. The two guns in their different modes also are difficult to distinguish what mode they are in just by looking at them.  They do have differences in the modes, but they are subtle and hard to tell at a quick glance.\n\nThe gunplay is simultaneously a very strong element of the game but also very disappointing.  The fact that the two weapons in their different modes handle so well, with a tangiable feel of weight, satisfying visuals, and good sound assets, only serves to accentuate my disappointment and frustration with them having the two weapon mode system.  I don't feel the system adds anything to the game of value in this case.  In some games with a two weapon system what you have is a large weapon selection and you have to choose the two of them that you feel best work for the tactical situations and enemies that you will be facing.  However, with all the different modes available at all times, I kind of am left in agreement with TotalBiscuit's comment in his first impressions that it seems like they used the two weapon mode so that they didn't have to create a series of different weapon models.  It's unfortunate.  These weapons would have been easier - and truer to the 'old school' FPS, if they were simply seperate weapons.\n\nThe level design is a fairly strong aspect of the game, with lots of areas to explore and a large amount of secrets to find in each.  I like the feeling in several of the levels that you are actually in coherent areas which actually make sense in canon as well; for example one section being a little shanty-town of trailers where people live.  It evokes memories of the level design of Duke Nukem 3D, which is a comparison I make as highest praise, as that was a high point in FPS level design.  The Levellord was a master of the craft.\n\nOne thing that bears touching on to is that the overall pacing of the levels and the game in general is executed tremendously well.  There's a feeling of momenteum to the game that keeps things going at a decent clip unless you pause to go rummaging and every time I would think to myself that the enemy variety is thinning out there'd be a new enemy, and every time I started feeling comfortable with the level of difficulty the game would ramp it up again.\n\nAll in all a very well-crafted game with a good theme let down by a couple of fairly large issues that don't stop it from being a very good game and well worth your time and money.","February 8, 2014","true","39.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","2"

The mechanic in question is the constant 'jump-scare' type of enemy spawning in the levels. Not once during the main or DLC part of the game does the player initiate combat. It is always the enemy who makes a massed rush against the player in hopes of taking him out. Rinse and repeat from beginning to the end. Only thing that changes is the enviroment and mix of enemies you encounter. Difficulty level is actually pretty constant. Some bosses every now and then force you to think a bit on how to deal with them.  Using enviroment to your advantage is a key component in the game too.\n\nThe statement that this is a hardcore shooter is pretty accurate. You complete levels, find secrets, grab health and ammo pick-ups, earn nano-bars that can be exchanged for upgrades. You have two weapons at your disposal and those two weapons have large add-on modules that can be purchased. (example:Assault rifle-Shotgun-Grenade Launcher-RPG-Mine Layer are all the same fully kitted out weapon but different firing modes)\n\nEarly game is the worst part. you dont have any choice for weapons so just surviving and picking up nano-bars and hard to find secrets is what you need to concentrate on. As you start kitting out your weapons the game starts to shine. And once you have completed the game you realize you have 2/3 of the achievements left.  (Go on, try it on 'Insane'). For me this was a very good game.","February 13, 2015","true","11.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","8"

Huge, giant, glaring problems. Problems that really drag the game down. And that's a shame, because if Hard Reset didn't have these problems, it might actually be a decent game.\n\nHard Reset bills itself on being an old-school shooter, and in some ways it succeeds. You get to wield a veritable arsenal of different and unique weapons that you can switch to fluidly with a twist of the mouse wheel. The controls are very well optimized, most of the weapons have some weight to them, and the action keeps coming at a constant pace. Worth mentioning is the wonderful synergy between all your weapons. You can launch a gravity grenade at your foes to condense them all in one place, then quickly swap to your rocket launcher and take them all out with one missile. The things that are done well in Hard Reset are done very well. On top of all that, the graphics and environments are gorgeous.\n\nUnfortunately, the things that Hard Reset does poorly, it does very poorly. First and foremost is the story. The story is not just terrible, it is utterly incomprehensible. It borders on EYE: Divine Cybermancy levels of lunacy, but without that tongue and cheek feeling of "we know this doesn't make any damned sense". It tries to sell its bizarre and nonsensical story straight, and fails utterly. It is told only by cutscenes inbetween levels, and it's very telling that the game gives you the option to automatically skip all of these cutscenes in the options menu during any playthrough. And the ending... ugh. I won't spoil it, but the endings to both the main game and the DLC campaign are terrible. Once the story suddenly starts attempting to make a tiny bit of sense, the game just ends.\n\nBut on to the gameplay. In Hard Reset, you shoot a lot of robots. That is the gameplay. Sometimes there will be small robots, sometimes there will be large robots, and on three levels there will be a boss. There are, quite literally, only three or four different types of robots: the big ones, the small ones, the flying ones, and some other one that I can't even remember but vaguely recall the existence of, as if from a dream. You will be doing this for several hours. At first it will be incredibly satisfying. Then it will become dull and repetitive. Then the difficulty will spike, and it will become torturous and frustrating.\n\nAnd those difficulty spikes are a doozy. You know those robots that take seventeen rockets to kill? You know how you finally downed one? Well, Howsabout you fight two more? Then two more after that. Then two more after that. Then three more and some assorted tiny robots to throw you off-guard. Then one more, but this one has twice as many hitpoints for some reason. And where is the checkpoint in all this? Why, its about five minutes before you even downed the first robot. And yes, the checkpoints really are that terrible. One of Hard Reset's greatest failures is that, for an old-school shooter, they have completely omitted one of the most useful and revered functions of old-school shooters: the quicksave button. Granted, you wouldn't need to quicksave if the checkpoints were any good, but they're not. They are terrible. I really must reiterate how terrible the checkpoints are.\n\nDespite doing some things terribly, Hard Reset isn't a terrible game, it's just by no means a great one. There are so many games that do what Hard Reset tries to do, but better. If you want a satisfying old-school shooter, pick up the Shadow Warrior remake or dig through Steam's backlogs for proper old-school titles. Hard Reset might be worth picking up on sale just to knock around with, but with so many better games out there, I can't recommend you pick up this title at full price.","January 20, 2014","false","8.6"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

They hand you a variety of interesting and unique weapons, add in a no-nonsense upgrade system, then throw you into a well detailed and absolutely gorgeous world and throw large numbers of fairly challenging enemies at you to overcome until they turn you into a badass. Coming out a year before the equally awesome Shadow Warrior, Hard Reset is an arcadey, clunky first-person romp through a near-future, lightly-cyberpunk city that flew almost completely under the radar.\n\nHighlightsMuch like Shadow Warrior, Hard Reset is a game that puts everything together really well, and gives a strong level of immersion that's missing from most games these days. I caught myself feeling like I was a detective inside a Blade Runner movie, trying to figure out what was going on while fighting off hoards of robots and passing through grimy city streets under the classy neon embankments, which, at times, is a real pleasure.\n\n* The Flying Wild Hog Engine was built specifically for this title and is absolutely gorgeous while still performing really well\n* The production value is clearly high, and it feels a lot more solid and well designed than just about any other indie title\n* Extremely good content updates and freely released DLC which adds to the game deserve special mention\n\nMistakes\nThe settings and characters for this game give a ton of possibility and are really a blank canvas. It's a shame then, that what could've been an extra special experience ended up being merely an above average game due to a very forgettable plot and story and Comic-book intro scenes and good voice acting help the world come alive, but don't add much to the story or suspense.\n\n* Feels like a corridor shooter at times and tends to feel very samey towards the end, despite the wide variety of weapons and upgrades\n* For an FPS, it has lacklustre boss fights and a forgettable ending purely because of the lack of consequence, again because of the story\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at £9.99/13.49€/$14.99 at the time of review and clocking in at 8 hours gameplay, and with all the new content being released for free, Hard Reset is good value. It's also routinely on sale for as little as $4.99 on Steam and $1.49 from various Indie Bundle retailers.\n\n* There's a fantastic Developer Artbook with characters, landscapes and plenty of concept art which is definitely worth a look.

Graphically impressive with an art style that matches the tone of the game perfectly. Weapon effects, explosions, rain... Everything looks top notch, especially this being the first game of a small company.\n\nGameplay is fast and brutal. You only have acess to 2 weapons, one that uses bullets and the other electricity. "Just 2 weapons?" you might think. No, not REALLY 2 weapons, as each weapon can be upgraded and transformed into various other weapons at the same time, so the machine gun you start off with will be able to transform into a shotgun, a rocket luncher or a grenade luncher for example. Oh, and every "weapon" has secondary fire, and none of that "aiming down the sights" BS here either. Just run fast and hold down either fire button and have fun.\n\nThere's also secret areas to be found, wich hide ammo, health or the currency you need to upgrade your weapons or health/armour and all that.\n\nUnlike most games of this genre, wich focus on humour (like Shadow Warrior or Serious Sam for instance), HR's tone is darker. As i said before, the artstyle matches this and so does the story, even if the plot is only serviceable most of the time.\n\nA really great, underrated game that deserves to be enjoyed by anyone.

The combat is frenetic (and tough at times) with waves of enemies being punctuated by simple puzzles and a light story line. The graphics are good for an indie game and the environments are impressive and immersive (it’s clearly influenced by Blade Runner, and that’s no bad thing). Physics play an important role: there are plenty of explosive and electrifying objects in the environments to help with the frenzied firefights. The enemies are well-designed and quirky (some even have propellers on their heads) and, although there aren’t that many classes, their attack methods develop as the game progresses to keep things mixed up. Although you only get two weapons both can be upgraded to add lots of additional fire modes (I liked this aspect -- some games have too many weapons).

I thought I could handle an FPS, but then I took insane for a spin. Hard Reset is like an unrelenting Olympic gymnastic coach who never gives you a moment's break. Are you sure you are out of the blast radius? Нет . You miscalculated your shield recharge time? Nein. You thought a few heavy headshots would kill a charging monstrosity in time? 不. Did you think you found good cover from? No. In the first level of the game I felt like I deserved a parade at every check point.\n\nBut soon enough, I realized I was just being lazy. I loved Doom, Quake, and Unreal Tournament growing up. I had babied my FPS muscles and was suffering from atrophy in the L33t skillz area. With that in mind, I stepped up my game and started being more careful, more precise. I still died a lot, but now I was learning. I still felt supreme satisfaction, but I also gained a newfound respect in the balance. The game was trying to train me, and get me used to playing a shooter where I don't just respawn 2 seconds away, automatically regenarate all my health, or kill enemies in a few hits.\n\nAll that being said, Hard Reset is not perfect. The story could not really hold my attention, though the art was kind of nice. The load times can be a longer than comfortable. I despise the autosave system: I could have a perfect run all the way up to one point, only to be killed out of nowhere and have to try to recover my balance in the next load. I also feel like I should point out that it is not the hardest game ever made. I make it sound extremely tough, but I do not consider myself really great at shooters. Challenge is very subjective: I found Hotline MIami to be moderately diffiuclt on my old trackpad, but I cannot play War of the Roses or Megaman to save my life.\n\nHard Reset feels extremely refreshing and satisfying, while familiar at the same time. It has been bundled and been on sale frequently, so this is a solid, engaging experience worth checking out.","January 25, 2015","true","33.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

There were a lot of complaints about its length, but if you play through the base game and the DLC, you're in for probably 10 or more hours of shooting good times.\n\nThe weapons are interesting and the difficulty is high enough that I found I needed to use the crowd control mechanics extensively in order to get by.\n\nI played the game on Hard, which is the default setting I use when playing shooters, and this one was by far the hardest one I've played in recent memory. There was one boss fight in the original chapters I died 49 times on!\n\nOne cool thing about the level design is that there are a lot of secrets tucked away in the levels which is something a lot of corridor shooters have lost over the years since the Doom II days. Some of the secrets are pretty easy to find, but some required really studying the options available in the room to figure out how to get to them.\n\nI highly recommend advancing to the Rail Gun or the RPG as fast as possible (accomplish this by checking the pre-reqs on it and focusing on them as high priority upgrades). The rest of the weapons do not do enough damage to really chip through the harder enemies fast enough. Again, this was on Hard. Maybe Normal is a cakewalk, I dunno.\n\nOverall, good game, probably didn't get the acknowledgement it deserved.\n\nOne final note - the story is nigh incomprehensible, the VO often cringeworthy, the cutscenes okay, but the Cyberpunk setting is cool and you don't need to understand the story to enjoy blowing up endless waves of robots with a creatively versatile arsenal.","February 15","true","15.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Hard Reset is a great looker, boasting both an amazing artstyle and great graphical fidelity. Nothing bad can also be said about the technical aspect either, since gunplay is solid and the weapon animations smooth. The soundtrack is okay and fits the game, albeit is nothing to write home about.\n\nThat being said, Hard Reset suffers from repetitiveness, especially in the later stages. Fighting bullet sponge enemies in similar, dark rooms can be fun for only so long. The game follows the Serious Sam formula of locking you in an arena with hordes of enemies, and that inevitably gets boring during long sessions. The game shines when you treat as a time killer you boot up every once and again, not when you marathon it from start to finish.\nIt should also be noted that Hard Reset gets really difficult at times. It is a challenging FPS for the veterans of the genre, not a game for newcomers.\n\nWhile Hard Reset might not be worth the full price of 13,99€, don't hesitate to grab it when it's on at least -50% sale. It has flaws, but it's certainly not a bad game.","November 10, 2015","true","11.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Well, just imagine that stretched out to an entire game and you have a pretty clear image of what Hard Reset is.\n\nYou fight your way through waves of enemies from point a to point b, and occasionally push a button or two. Now, this formula is fine, as long as the shooting is solid. However, in Hard Reset the shooting is far from solid. The combat in this game is dull, irritating, cheap and unenjoyable. There are a few levels of ♥♥♥♥ i have to get through to properly describe just how broken the combat of the game is, and that is what this review is gonna focus on, the combat.\n\n1: WEAPONS\n\nThere are two weapons in the game, one standard bullet and expolsive rifle and one energy rifle. The twist with that though is that these two weapons can become five different weapons each, wich is a cool concept. The problem with this is that there is barely a difference between the different firing modes, especially with the energy rifle. Expect to accidentally blow yourself up, alot. All and all they feel alright to use, nothing special though.\n\n2: ENEMIES\n\nNow this is where the ♥♥♥♥ truly starts to thicken. The enemies and the placement of those enemies is so cheap that you'll want to throw your keyboard out the window. Almost all enemies are extremely damaging, and can take you down in a few seconds. Now combine this with tight arenas, constant flanking without any warning, fast and unpredictable movement, slow player movement and you are set up to have a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time.\n\nThere are a few different enemy types that you'll encounter on your "journey", and they all share the same tributes. They are all annoying as sh*t to fight, they dont feel fair, the designs are repetetive and uninspired, the color pallets are bland and boring and you'll have more fun smashing your face with a hammer while masturbating with sandpaper. You have a generic fast little bloke with two legs and some sort of melee weapon, a generic ranged humanoid robot, flying turrets and, you guessed it, a generic ♥♥♥♥ing large robot that runs at you. Those are 90% of the enemies you'll face. Im only going to go in depth about one though, the common large ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo, you'll face some big robots that just run at you like a ♥♥♥♥ing bull, and there is nothing wrong with those types of enemies. Serious sam had those enemies, and they were great fun to fight! You could dodge them pretty easily if you knew where they were coming from, and it was the player's fault if they died. In Hard Reset, you have barely enough space to dodge these guys! The arenas are filled with tonnes of dead ends wich the robots can easily trap you in. And if you even manage to dodge them, you'll still magically take damage as the w*nker passes you (poor hitboxes). And as an added slap to the face, there are probably billions of little small, fast sh*theads waiting behind you, because some fuc*ing sadistic developer REALLY enjoyed placing enemies in the most annoying, autistic locations. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ HAPPENED HERE? DID ANYONE ACTUALLY PLAYTEST THESE AREAS?  The combat is just a ♥♥♥♥ing chore, and I really had to force myself to complete this game.\n\n3: LEVEL DESIGN\n\nYour level design should compliment your gameplay, wich in Hard Reset it does not. Levels are usually semi large areas with a bunch of clutter and dead ends purely to annoy the player. It's also repetetive as balls, you just shoot some guys, push a button, shoot some more guys repeat. Basically, it ♥♥♥♥in' sucks.\n\nOther notes:\n\n-The optimization is absolute sh*t\n-The comicbooks are poorly made, downright laughable at times\n-The story is a joke, it tries to tell this serious story about ai and robots, but just falls flat on it's face. It makes litterally no sense and you'll find yourself skipping all the cutscenes before long\n-Really short, however, I consider that kind of a good thing considering the quality of the game\n-Poor english localization, typos and strange pronounciations are common\n-The visual effects are everywhere, don't look good and make it hard to see\n\n\nConclusion: Don't buy it. Flying wild hog improved significantly with their second game, "Shadow Warrior", and is a much better game. 4/10","November 26, 2015","false","6.1"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","23","41","0","1"

For example, the "secrets" most of the time aren't secrets at all but rather .... "oh, theres a staicase that leads both up-and downstairs. I'm supposed to get upstairs. Let's get downstairs... oh, there's a secret." Also, prepare for some pain dodging enemy fire, since every freakin' ranged weapon in this game seems to have AoE abilities, so dodging/hiding behind cover is nearly impossible - and most enemies are melee anyway. And while the Idea of only having 2 weapons, but both with 5 different mods and each mod having two modes is an interesting thought, in reality it makes things unnecessary complicated.\n\nI can still recommend it, as the low-priced game that it is, but if you are willing to pay a bit more to get a better game, get Shadow Warrior (2013) instead. Also by Flying Wild Hog, but superior in every regard. However, I can't deny that, as flawed as Hard Reset is, it is still a nice FPS to kill a few hours with.

I suggest reading a short guide before getting started maybe, unless of course you like diving in totally unprepared.\n\nAnyhow, it's important to make the right weapon and character upgrades right from the start. The weapons you are given at the beginning are crap, and I almost never used them. Try to upgrade to the Electric Mortar and/or Grenade Launcher as quickly as you can because they are able to keep your enemies at a distance, able to contain them. When you let them surround you and get close, you will die! Especially the Mortar saved my ♥♥♥ on more than one occasion. Also using environmental damage is key in this game because even with better weapons those damn robots, large large amounts of them, won't go down easily.\n\nHard Reset was not what I expected it to be, but when you start having control it's really fun.

This is a mixed review, there are many things I love and hate about this game.\n\nIt's hard on hard.\nBullet sponges everywhere.\nCool weapons; you only get two, but then you upgrade them to get many different weapons, although they share ammo.\nMovement is slow and clunky. There is a sprint, but it locks you out of shooting and jumping. Platforming sections though rare and only for secrets are a pain since your character weighs a ton. Can't jump over knee-high walls, no crouching; so there are many places where it looks like you should be able to go and you can't.\n\nThe setting is super cool, interactable ads, and little kiosks that talk to you and try to sell you ♥♥♥♥ as if you were a consumer, I only wish I could actually buy their hair-cream. There are big tv-screens that activate and show the news when you look at them, really neat.\n\nThe ingame menus for upgrades and pretty much anything are really cool; a holographic screen pops up in front of your character and your crosshair turns into a little hand cursor which you can use to interact. Kinda neat, get the demo to test it out.\n\nMy game stutters even though I get a constant +100fps on a 144hz monitor, gives me a headache, v-sync on or off, doesn't matter. Because of this I can only play for short periods, and I have less patience with this game than others because it physically hurts. Maybe I should stop playing altogether. The problems are present in the demo aswell, try that and if you have problems there, don't bother with the full version.\n\nFov slider is measured in vertical, prepare to use a calculator.\n\nI'm getting frustrated with the bullet sponges, so I'm just going to lower the difficulty. Maybe then I'll like the game. There's a demo so try that, though be aware that the upgrades work differently in the demo than in the full game, they also come slower.\n\nI want to like this game, the setting and the awesome guns, though there are some points that just drive me nuts. I would strongly suggest you try the demo, it throws two bullet sponges at you at the same time to give you a feel for what you're going to be dealing with depending on the difficulty.\n\nI am not going to give up on this game, I paid for it, and so I want my enjoyment out of it, I just have to figure out if I like my cookies gooey or crunchy (gooey btw)","May 25","true","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

An interesting attempt to redefine the first person shooter but I think it fails as the system is needlessly clunky.  With the energy weapon in hand, selecting the rocket launcher requires a key press for the host weapon and another for the launcher mode.  Why?  In the heat of battle I felt like a circus performer.  What's worse is that I found the controls to be somewhat unresponsive, no doubt a purposeful design decision to negate any type of weapon mode key press while sprinting.\n\nDespite the flaws, the well realized world reminded me of Blade Runner infused with a bit of Rapture.   The level design, graphics and solid shooting mechanics are enough reasons to play.  Oh did I mention the Quake like rail-gun.  My favorite weapon in the game, though like some of the other weapon modes there is a cool down so spamming anything but the base weapon modes is prohibited.\n\nWeapon upgrades are acquired through upgrade terminals.  This mechanic does enhance the standard fps as the expenditure of the in game currency, called nano, allows for complete customization of your play-through.\n\nThe story I thought was well penned but is presented like a comic book.  There are multiple modes once your done with the game though I had little desire to partake.  One mode, called EX allows you to play the game with all weapon and defense upgrades in place.  Another mode, called Heroic allows for one save point at the beginning of the level.  The last is standard Survivor mode where the game throws waves of enemies at you.\n\nI've read that the development team has roots in both BulletStorm and Painkiller.  The quality with which Hard Reset was constructed bears the fruit of that lineage.  It's a great shooter and worthy of your time and slot in your library.","April 13, 2013","true","21.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoktorHaus/recommended/98400/","DoktorHaus","Doktor haus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoktorHaus/","232 products in account","Summary:\nAn old-school shooter to the core with beautiful cyberpunk environments, challenging combat, waves of enemies and a unique weapon system. Held back by awful voice acting, awful music, cheap cutscenes and a half-hearted story that explains little. Unfortunately, you often feel powerless against the chaos because there are no effective ways of dodging, it's easy to get trapped in a corner or have one of the countless explosive hazards set off a deadly chain reaction. Defeating certain enemies is very difficult without specific weapons which you may not have bought earlier. But if you're here purely for the vintage shooter action, you won't be disappointed, as it offers plenty of challenge.\n\nThe full story:\nHard Reset is a real mixed bag, and certainly not for everyone. It's an old-school shooter to the core, featuring only minimal controls and no extra bells and whistles, just you and waves of robotic enemies. The enemies, even on normal difficulty, can be quite challenging and are good at dodging attacks. They love to ambush you at every turn, flank you, and can quickly whittle down your health if you don't keep moving; you must always be ready for a battle and think on your feet to survive. There are different types, some which explode in your face, others which charge at you, and some that stay at a safe distance and snipe away... with rockets. The few boss fights are challenging and old-school as well, involving glowing weak points and waves of minions, but when you learn their pattern you feel unstoppable. For the most part, combat is challenging, but fair; if you fail, you know it's your fault. On the other hand, the little guys are a lot more troublesome because they love to hide and ambush you, get right in your face and when they die, they cause damage if you're that close. Every single room in the game is filled with destructible objects which either explode or cause electrical damage, so you can imagine that one stray bullet, even from the enemy, often sets off a chain reaction of things exploding in your face. At times like these, the game feels unfair. Dodging or jumping doesn't always save you, enemies sneak up behind you with ease and it's easy to get trapped in a corner, so many situations turn into trial-and-error. Some enemies love to hang out at a distance behind cover and are difficult to destroy with anything but one or two weapon types which you can't even buy until later on. Rockets and mortar shells constantly fly at you and FPS logic tells you that if you're behind cover or sprint several feet away from its impact, you'll be safe... but not always. Enemy projectiles' splash damage has a ridiculous reach.\n\nYour own weapons are still formidable, however. You get only two (with separate ammo types), but a whopping five firemodes apiece, each of which is designed for certain situations. You have the minigun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, railgun, shotgun, proximity mines and my favorite, the smartgun which detects enemies and shoots through walls. You can also upgrade your weapons, health and armor through seamless first-person terminals, using experience you collect from combat and finding secret areas. But even if you fully upgrade your health and shield, it's not by much; Hard Reset doesn't hold your hand and the only assurance you have is frequent checkpoints and no game over. The only guidance you have is a vague objective and the occasional voiceover communication.\n\nSpeaking of which... the voice acting is awful. With the exception of one guy, it's just ingenuine and unenthusiastic. The music is also total crap, consisting of the occasional ambient pad and a bunch of random futuristic drilling noises, like a robot dentist's equipment. Apparently, the composer didn't care either, but at least it lets you know when you're entering a fight. There is actual music when action begins, but it's your average, generic attempt at sounding futuristic: lots of synths, breakbeats and the occasional guitar. Completely forgettable at best, grating at its worst.\nThe sound on the other hand, is great. Every little object you bump into sounds real, the sound of robots exploding into piles of scrap is satisfying and the weapons sound appropriately futuristic and cool.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous. That should be obvious considering it's on the Unreal 3 engine, but the environments look amazing. The dystopian city of Bezoar stretches out around and above you, massive and intricate, triggering memories of Blade Runner or Hong Kong from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. So many scenes in this game deserve that you stop and just take a  look around. It's such a shame then, that this game is fast-moving and direct by its very nature. The models and textures are beautiful; things that anyone would be proud to put on their resume. Most props fully utilize the Havok physics engine and behave realistically, never once glitching for me. The layout of certain objects in certain places doesn't always make sense, but it's still cool to see things fly everywhere in the heat of battle.\n\nI'll mention the story last because it's not important. In fact, it's barely there at all. In between levels, what little plot there is is expounded through cutscenes which look suspiciously like rough draft cinematics; you know, a comic book of moving sketches designed to give an idea of what the finished, pre-rendered cutscene will look like. But there's a difference between stylish, comic book cutscenes (see: Beneath a Steel Sky, Max Payne 2) and a rough draft someone never finished. Anyway, the story has something to do with a network of digital personalities, the big, faceless, evil corporation that controls it and robots that want it. Very little is ever explained, leading to more confusion. But again, it's not that important because when you're playing, you only get a vague objective to strive for and the occasional voiceover telling you what to do next, very little context or exposition. And that's another thing: The environments, visuals and sound design make me want to explore this world, understand it, spend some time in it, but that just ain't gonna happen.\n\nIt's a very short game too; if you spend no time collecting secrets and are better at staying alive than me (which is likely), you'll blaze through it in no time and wonder what the Hell just happened. The Exile DLC is included, although it's more like "almost half the game the developers didn't have time to finish before release". Seriously, it's a continuation of the main game, and if you don't have the DLC, it ends abruptly after a boss fight with no explanation. Still, it's free, so you can't complain too much. It also takes you outside the city, into outdoor environments like a machine scrapyard full of encroaching greenery, introducing a few new pesky and challenging foes in the process. Still, it's quite short and (at least for me) becomes a grind, repetitively blasting away, clicking a panel, walking forward, rinse and repeat. Once you complete normal, more difficulties open up along with a survival mode.\n\nBut like I said, this game isn't for everyone. If you love old-school shooters but want a modern presentation, if you want a good challenge and can stomach some unforgiving mechanics and if you love cyberpunk settings but can deal with a minimal story, this should be right up your alley.","January 1, 2014","true","20.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

WASD controls with mouse targeting.\n\nThere are two weapon types: a physical-based weapon for bullets, grenades and an RPG, and an energy-based weapon for plasma, electricity and laser railgun. Various alternate-weapon modes for scopes, stun and seeking rockets. Left-mouse for firing; right-mouse for alternate mode. You can also target objects in the environment to create explosions or electricity discharges that will destroy the enemies for you, but if you're too close, you'll take damage as well.\n\nAmmo is plentiful as are healing power-ups, and the machines drop them as well. Lastly, there is a 'nano' resource that you need in order to unlock and upgrade weapons, and you can improve health, shield and recovery rates as well.\n\nThe enemies, of course, are the machines. They range from small anti-personnel devices with blades, saws and explosives, through human-sized robots using energy-blasts, rockets or brute-force ramming, up to huge, towering bosses with multiple, active weak-spots that need to be destroyed in order to take the thing down.\n\nThe saving is automatic at checkpoints and the zones between those checkpoints are pretty small, so reloading after defeat may cost you maybe five minutes of gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are good with decent explosions, discharges and flying pieces but not top-notch and no particle effects. Maxed-out, everything runs smoothly on Windows 7 with 16GB, a 990X CPU and SLI-coupled Nvidia 970's. There were no glitches, crashes, lock-ups or slow-downs.\n\nThe story that underlies the game is only partially present and things go on that don't make a lot of sense, nor does the ending resolve anything presented throughout the game, but it's enough of a shell to make the activities coherent and move the game forward.\n\nIt is a solid FPS, and mostly you'll be mowing waves of enemies down. You have to keep moving and using the environment for protection or you can easily be overwhelmed. Overall, it takes maybe 10 hours to complete a run-though, so it's a distraction for a single day, and there is some replayability though different weapon choices, as well as improving performance and finding all the scattered nano and secret areas. Nothing beyond nano is found in the secret areas, though.\n\nRecommended.\n","April 16","true","28.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You can only get so many downright unfair deaths before you have to throw in the towel.\n\nThankfully, FWH learned their mistakes with Shadow Warrior.  You can dodge enemies, they'll stagger if you hit them hard enough, you have moves that can knock them over or stun them, and overall SW was a similar game that just worked properly.  With FWH going back to apply their Shadow Warrior successes to rebalance this game in the Redux version, I'd say you should just skip to there.  The original game just isn't worth your time, and for anyone who owns either this version or Shadow Warrior, you can buy the Redux of Hard Reset for a mere $3.  This version has more reasonable combat, dodging, and a laser katana, an easy recommendation as it's exactly what this game needed to work.","June 3","false","2.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

It's very pretty and the weapon system is interesting, but its major flaw is that it tries to emulate old-school shooters but then instead of making you as mobile as you were in those games, movement feels like it's copied from gears of war. The slow and clunky movement works in GoW because the game is designed around it and you're supposed to use cover, but that's not the case here. Imagine playing Doom with your knees (well, the protagonist's knees) taped together... not fun.","May 29","false","2.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","3"

Shadow Warrior remake (by the same studio) is essentially the same game but polished. Consider that game instead; this one I cannot recommend.\n\nPROS:\n-Cool voice acting\n\nNEUTRALS:\n-The "all in one" weapon is functionally the same as multiple weapons that simply share ammo.\n-There are 2 weapon types (ammo and energy) which each have 5 subtypes to them. Unfortunately, the 5 subtypes are literally identical between the two weapons....major missed opportunity and lazy design.\n\nCONS:\n-Some enemies simply stand there trading damage with you regardless of what weapon you hit them with or where you shoot them. This becomes especially problematic in areas against several waves of enemies as you may end up in a situation where you simply don't have enough health to kill the next wave of enemies no matter how you play it.\n-AWFUL level design. Far too many enemies in almost every area; areas lead to constant dead ends; areas too small for types of enemies being fought.\n-Most enemies take a frustratingly large number of shots to kill.\n-Your shots will go right through enemies quite often (I'm talking about your rockets going straight through their stomach kind of thing).","May 10","false","10.6"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","0"

I don't like the so called "retro" or "old school" shooters, which this game seems to pay homage to. Despite it all, I somehow loved "Hard Reset".\n\nYou're Major Fletcher, a human badass with bionics who fights all kinds of robots who want to take over the world. You've got only two weapon types - one that fires hard ammo, another with energy charges. Each of the two weapon-types can morph into different weapons. For example, the hard ammo type can become a rifle, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, an RPG, and a mine launcher. Each weapon-mode can further be enhanced to feature alternate fire modes. In short, there's actually a lot of weapons to choose from, and to survive you'll have to switch between them a lot.\n\nThe enemies are BRUTAL. Even the weakest ones can kill you with little to no effort if you're not careful. The enemies come in mini waves, and each wave is very much lethal. You can get blasted to pieces in a second, if you don't dodge, run, and shoot appropriate targets with appropriate arms. There's an amount of strategy involved here, too, although the game does at rare times feel cheap due to the sheer amount of enemies it throws at you. The few boss fights are pretty damn impressive, too. "Hard Reset" will challenge you a lot; it took me 17 hours to beat it on my first run ever (on Hard), because I died a whole lot. Yet I never truly felt like quitting, because the game always made it obvious WHY you died and WHY it was entirely your fault: you backed yourself into a corner, you ignored the little enemies, you chose your weapons poorly... every time I died, it just motivated me to try once again and turn those damn machines into scrap.\n\nThe game also seems to be nicely optimized, since it ran at 55+ FPS with medium-high settings on my rather weak HP laptop.\n\nCriticism goes towards kinda samey level design, and the "Secret Area" mechanic, which often felt more like an in-game glitch. One example is walking on very tiny ledges - otherwise it's not possible, but on a specific level suddenly you CAN walk those ledges, but only on this exactly pre-defined spot in the level because a secret is hidden at the end of it. That kind of thing.\n\nBut overall, "Hard Reset" turned out to be a hidden gem, and a true surprise. So yeah, recommended!","January 29","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is supposed to be fast and dynamic, but movement is sloppy as hell and levels are too tight to allow some brutal action in vein of Painkiller or Sam. This is really annoying issue that seriously crippled Hard Reset for me. Another problem is that you can't change difficulty after you started game. This, coupled with checkpoint save system will lead you to quite a lot of frustration moments.\n\nYet I still advice trying it on Normal difficulty due to game's grim cyberpunk atmosphere, which is great, awesome weapon upgrade system and fun gameplay.

And by "modern features" I mean the good ones, like upgrade system and not the bad ones, like regenerating health or QTE.\nThis game works like this: you got two guns, C.L.N. and N.R.G.. First one shoots bullets, the other one shoots plasma. However, you got upgrade stations scattered everywhere. You buy upgrades from them for nanites, which you either find in secret places (yeah, this game has secrets, another good feature) or get from shooting robot baddies. Those upgrades are mostly different modes for your guns. C.L.N. gets usual stuff like shotgun and rocket launcher, N.R.G. has more exotic things, like close-range lighting gun or sniper gun that shoots through walls. For nanites you can also purchase alternative modes for those gun modes: shotgun can get paralyzing darts, lighting gun can have EMP blast.\nGame itself is pretty intense, you have to move a lot to avoid getting shot, blown up, rammed, stabbed etc. Game has  an impressive amount of enemy types and loves to mix them up to keep it fresh. Graphics-wise, game looks gorgerous and system requirements aren't demanding, but I did experienced some slow-downs, especially when lots of things exploded on the screen. Level design is good but some mind find it repetitive because levels take place only in a city, or (after free DLC arrived) in a junkyard. Soundtrack is pretty good, too.\nThis game does have story... but it's main feature is being skippable and is there only to explain why you are shooting robots. Also this game has an annoying feature of posting huge waypoints with giant text that says "GO THERE". You can turn it of, through. The main problem with the game, in my opinion, is low shot length, you can beat it in 3 hours. 3 enjoyable hours, that is, but still! This problem was somewhat solved by afromentioned free DLC, which adds 3 more hours of gameplay. Interestingly enough, this game came out in 2011, way before Early Access on Steam, when it's became the norm for unfinished games to come out for full price and leave gamers waiting for eventual full release.\nDue to all this, I would recommend getting this game on low price (the price without discount is 15 USD, if I am not mistaken) to all classic shooter fans.","December 23, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(its a mix between painkiller and shadow warrior reboot i would say as gameplay goes, and i liked HR better over those 2 games) So its rare these days to find anything like this with quality in it.\nThe early game is not that interesting.\nIts a nice low budget game.The basics of the are alright, its just not AAA experience.\nThe main problem i find with the game outside the "poor engine" is the upgrade system that u cant respec.This will cause some balance problems in the game, its either too hard or too easy, and u need to restart the game if u want to change ur upgrades.\nU need to use tactics,weapon combos and dodge enemies in general.Game is more about learning the game and patience over twitch shooting.\n\n\n\n\n+good art style and detailed cyberpunk world, cant wait to see for the dx11 version of the game.\n+cutscenes are only played during loading screens,and the story doest its job well enough,missions are voice acted during gameplay,nothing breaks the action/immersion.\n+good map design,its corridor shooter, but it feels big living world and its not easy linear like cod,need to explore and think sometimes.\n+interesting boss battles\n+destruction level is high, but not the best i have ever seen, the robots can even lose parts of their body armor, its pretty fun (robots also have oil as "blood")\n+hipfire and crosshair (lol)\n+less bullet sponge enemies like it is in SW (low difficulties arent bullet sponge at all however)\n+good story telling: never interrupts gameplay\n+replay value: if u liked the game u can go with different upgrades/weapons with next fresh game or in NG+ as well\n\n-no crouch (well this isnt a problem rly, just immersion breaking)\n-bad shotgun design: bullets autofollowing the enemy...\n-weird sprint mechanic and slow moving speed by default ( but not unbalanced,its fits to the gameplay actually).Default moving speed is same as running speed in doom 4, but HR has also a sprint feature which makes u faster for short time.(just for reference)\n-weird feel of collison and gravity sometimes (the dx11 version might fix this)\n-didnt liked the "traps" to kill enemy:it looks bad and the game doesnt rly try to justify for these things,it was not fun to use for me in this game.\n-only auto save at checkpoints\n-2 weapon models only: which is customizable for unlocking further weapons (which looks very similar)\n-screenshake,chromatic abberation and blood effects on screen are annoying\n-huge cliffhanger ending\n-on some areas enemy placement is very stupid/lazy and makes the gameplay stupid (mostly in the added dlc content)\n\nI hope there will be HR 2, with some changes and improvements.","June 3","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The neon-lit cyberpunk aesthetic really gave me a 'Blade Runner' vibe, and on ultra settings, it just looks stunning. The sound design is also good. The bullet guns sound meaty, whilst the plasma weapons just sound right. The music always fits the scene and helps get the blood pumping, whilst the voice acting is average, but doesn't distract from the game\n\nThe actual gameplay is good, although towards the end, the game does degenerate into an arena-style shooter with waves after waves of enemies running towards you. However, the gunplay is fun and I never found myself getting bored. I just wish there was some more variety in the levels.\n\nLength wise, it took me around 10 hours on hard.

You have to manage plowing through waves of little bad guys in each area, while keeping your ammo and heal counts up, especially for when the big guys come out.  It's like those other modern shooters in terms of the level design being very linear and corridor-like, except that the combat is actually fun thanks to some clever weapon design.  There's also loads of completely inexcusable invisible walls that you will never get used to, both in secret hunting, and in trying to deftly maneuver in combat.\n\nThe visuals are reminiscent of a shooter that's several years older, but they get the job done in terms of providing an appropriate and unique atmosphere.  I find the comic-book style cutscenes to be both moderately well executed and out of place.  The writing is bad, the story is pointless, but killing things in a cyberpunk city is fun.\n\nHonestly, I prefer Hard Reset to Painkiller and Serious Sam.  I prefer the level-up choices that the game offers me and it provides some choice-driven context to a genre (corridor shooter) that generally  has none.","December 24, 2013","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Every single upgrade have an important proposite in battle. It has destructive environments with explosive barrels or cars and obviously you can used to your advantage.\nYou have the classic combat from the old school games so it will be comun deal with a lot of enemies at the same time, running side to side without losing your orientation. Is not only about run and shoting.. you have to think how you are going to perform your next move, if you ♥♥♥♥ed up then you have to know how escape before get killed.\n\n[Enemies]\nLike in painkiller or doom, every enemy fight in an unique way but there is a lot of ways to defeat him, however, you can't kill them as faster as you can do in doom for example. You have to deal with them, hiting them when you are dodging proyectiles or melee attacks\n\n[Map Design]\nAll the levels are designed to play in a "convenient" style. However map are very linear, yes it have some secrets here and there but overall is linear, still fun though\n\n[Checkpoints]\nYes this game doesn't have the option for quicksaves every time you want\ncheckpoints can be friendly or just awful\nIn this case.. are fine so its ok having them\n\n[History] 10.4 hrs long for me\nGameplay with cutscenes comic style. I honestly don't want to spoil anything, in my experience all I have to say\nIt is awesome and keep you interested to see what happens next\n\nProblems:\nSometimes the balance between challenging, fun and map design is not always there..it only happened once for me\nOn the dlc exile when an ridiculous group of gunships come all at the same time and I didn't have space to dodge or take cover so I instantly died by machineguns and missiles. The only way to pass that is by camping out of the map and use only a specific weapon upgrade\nNot fun at all... just out of place..\n\nOver All 9.5/10 and it just $14.99 USD, if you like the demo you won't regret this buy","May 22","true","10.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's like being right there.\n\nI seriously love the way this game looks. The city graphics are second to none for me, but I haven't played all the most modern games. Combat is great, if a bit tough at times. Combat with robots is extreme sublime. Although slightly short it has become one of my favourite gaming experiences. I played the demo a few times. I have played though on hard difficulty twice. My second play through took 12 hours including DLC levels. My first play through took longer partly because I was gawping at all the graphics.\n\nReally though I feel I am there in the comics, like they came to life, and I am in it. Incredible feeling. Awesome engine and concept.\n\nHardware for max settings;\nA good i5 and GTX650 Ti will keep frames rates above 25fps with settings maxed. It will be well over 25fps in many places. This type of hardware will keep it smooth in the most heated battles.\n\nHint:\nMake the shotgun your first upgrade. It is a game changer.\nTake the railgun and RPG upgrades soon, as again they are game changers. (The railgun is the only long range fast weapon. Other weapon types I did not even try.)\nI used these weapons and all the combat gear upgrades.\n\nMinor bad point:\nOne or two of the checkpoints are a bit far apart.\nMy fight with the first boss nearly stopped me playing, but youtube showed me I had to use different weapons.\nOne particular secret I can not work out. I could look it up online.\nShame it is slightly short, even with the free DLC. I just haven't had enough for such a superb concept game.

Even small enemies take way too much hits to die and that kinda makes the action scenes a bit stale and frustrating, the bigger enemies take even waaaaay too much hits to die, and the variety of enemies it's really not that great, the 2 or 3 types of smaller robots kinda look the same with small variances. There are many enviromental aids you can use to create explosions and electrical shocks but most of the time you end up screwing yourself up because when the enemies make one thing explode, the other ones near it explode too, so you end up having a quick death without knowing why.\n\nThe story is kind of blend, I still have no idea what I'm doing there, all I know it's about some machines that entered in the city.

Hard Reset offers a half-decent story, sharp graphics, plus a great mix of different weapons and upgrades. On the downside there isn't a large variety of enemies so you end up killing the same machines repeatedly, and the length can be considered short, although I thought it was reasonable.

The game looks, feels, sounds, and plays like something straight out of the Unreal franchise, especially Unreal Tournament 3, despite using a propriety engine (not UE3). In terms of gameplay, it's more along the lines of a Serious Sam game, eschewing cover, weapon reloading, and regenerating health for a more classic corridor shooter style. The gameplay can get extremely hectic once the waves of enemies start flowing -- this fun and frantic gamplay is Hard Reset's strong point, and is executed well.","December 27, 2011","true","25.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While this isn't entirely accurate, it mostly is. There are some modern FPS trappings like invisible walls and the checkpoint save system. Challenge-wise it is definitely more like the older games. There is no arrow pointing you in the correct direction, or lengthy tutorial. It more or less throws you right into the action. There is a storyline along the way, which plays out in some very nice comic book-style cutscenes between levels and in-game dialogue via your radio. The cut scenes play while the game is loading, and you can skip them once the next level is done loading. You aren't forced to sit through them every time you play. One other thing about this is that the voice acting is pretty awful, even cringe-worthy at times. This is one of my main drawbacks and by far the worst part of the presentation, which, along with the graphic style, is otherwise one of the high points of the game.\n\nThe game is still relatively linear but there are still some things left to figure out on your own. There are numerous secret areas and uncovering some of them can take some time. This is a nice touch that is missing from modern FPS games. One thing that is missing is quality puzzles. There just isn't much to speak of as far as puzzle solving goes. Aside from the secret areas, for the most part it never gets more complex than "find and hit a switch". That's not to say that's a bad thing, but it's missing that element of old school FPS games.\n\nThe combat generally takes place in one of two settings: long narrow corridors with groups of enemies rushing at you from one end, and wider open areas where larger encounters take place. The enemies, which comprise of a variety of robots, tend come at you in waves, kind of like how Serious Sam works. Hard Reset doesn't throw nearly as many enemies at you though. There is a fair amount of enemies and each one tends to come in several varieties. Along with the game's 10 different weapon types, there is enough variety in the enemies and the ways to take them out that combat never becomes boring.\n\nThere are multiple boss encounters along the way and they can be quite challenging. I played through it on the hard difficulty setting and most bosses I had to do multiple times. You can't just focus on the boss, as most of them spawn groups of the smaller enemies that kill you pretty quickly. The bosses typically have a glowing points that you have to blow up, so you have to pay attention and aim carefully (unless you acquire a certain weapon that will lock in and fire homing projectiles).\n\nYou'll unlock multiple new weapons as well as upgrades to your health, armor and other attributes along the way. New weapons and upgrades are purchased spending at upgrade stations you find periodically throughout the levels. The game's currency, known as Nano, is earned by killing enemies and by finding it hidden in secret around the levels. I feel like a couple of the weapons and upgrades aren't very useful, and towards the end of the game you'll probably find yourself upgrading certain weapons or abilities just because you have upgrades to burn rather than because you need them. The new content unfortunately didn't add anything new to your arsenal. I feel like that's a wasted opportunity to add even just a few new upgrades.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with Hard Reset. I actually plan on going back and playing it again at some point down the road. That's rare for an FPS game. There is plenty to do, with multiple game modes and difficulties. There is also an achievement system if that's your thing. This is the best FPS game I've played since FEAR, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better FPS to spend your money on.","January 13, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/98400/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Hard Reset is a cyberpunk FPS that is labelled as "old-school". These days there are a couple of such FPS games out there, notably Shadow Warrior, a remake from the same developer team. Hard Reset really delivers the old school: you have dozens of enemies sent against you at once, countless of objects you can destroy in the surrounding area (the game counts and rewards these environmental kills). What's more, the protagonist has weapons that do not require reloading - you just press and hold the button till all your foes are eliminated.\n\nWeapon-wise Hard Reset follows an interesting concept. You have two weapons and instead of mapping them to the numbers you can switch between them with the use of Q and E which are usually for "previous" or "next" weapons in the genre. As you make progress in the game the more nanocells you can pick up - these allow you to upgrade your two best friends thereby granting them extra firing capability. This is how you turn your rifle into a shotgun, then grenade launcher, RPG etc. The number keys are now unlocked and you can easily switch between these "functions" during a battle. It is an interesting concept, certainly.\n\nGraphics-wise Hard Reset looks stunning. Some of the effects are beautiful and if you look around you can easily notice the inspiration of various sci-fi authors such as Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ (to give you a hint: there are shuttles in the air with huge neon advertisements). The story is somewhat mediocre - there are comic book style cutscenes between the various chapters telling you the story of a major who wages a desperate battle against machines. These "custcenes" could have been better with a more appropriate voice acting.\n\nDo note that the game is very difficult. Many of the bigger enemies can easily kill you; using environmental kills is highly recommended due to the splash damage you can do with them. Running and jumping will be your best asset sometimes and even then you'll perish several times - the creators knew this that is why they included an achievement for not dying on a level.\n\nThe game is short - 5-6 hours is enough to complete it. It is commendable that the developers released a free DLC that continues the story throughout 3 extra levels. You have the usual new-enemies-new-boss-new-environment deal here.\n\nHard Reset is a very good game. If you miss the old school style FPS games you can give this one a try as it offers you top-notch graphics, achievements and replayability in case you want to try the higher difficulty levels, too.\n\nPS: Wow! I did not know Philip K. D.I.C.K's surname would be censored! :D","March 17, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Said DLC also prolongs the story and on a difficulty mode other than easy, the game can be very challenging. Given its a PC-only title, graphics options are aplenty, and you should be able to tailor it to your computer specs well.\nMy concerns with HR originally was only the fact that its checkpoint-based, but you can now quicksave (with a .ini file edit, yes, but at least you can).","March 7, 2013","true","26.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hard Reset offers a half-decent story, sharp graphics, plus a great mix of different weapons and upgrades. On the downside there isn't a large variety of enemies so you end up killing the same machines repeatedly, and the length can be considered short, although I thought it was reasonable.

This was their first published title and you can tell that some aspects of the game were experimental or not fleshed out as well as it could be.\n\nGameplay : The primary focus of the game is its gunplay. The game revolves around a kinetic weapon and a energy weapon with each having five separate forms and each form having an alternate fire function. The kinetic weapon functions as a rifle, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a proximity mine deployer. The energy weapon functions as a rapid-fire pulse rifle, a close-range lightning arc, an EMP grenade launcher, a sniper rifle, and a homing weapon. The weapon models look great, but it can get confusing in-game knowing which weapon is in what mode which can lead to some unwanted splash damage. Enemy variety is sub-par up until the later levels, where it upgrades to servicable. Another problem is that the enemy models, all of them robots, don't stand out against the environment often enough. The health system involves a non-regenerating health bar which can be replenished with medkits (some enemies can drop small medkits upon their defeat) and a shield system that regenerates when you're not under fire. The game also boasts a light RPG element where you spend currency to upgrade your armaments as well as your combat suit. There are also environmental hazards littered throughout the levels which you can employ to take out enemies. The few bosses in the game are a delightful distraction from the masses of robots you destroy as you progress through the stages. On a sidenote, the in-game interface is cleverly done since everything in the game is mouse-driven. Overall, the gameplay can keep you engaged through completion.\n\nThe story is easily the weakest part of the game, with voice actors phoning it in and the plot convulutes itself to a lackluster ending. The level design is cyberpunkish buildings through two-thirds of the game until it changes it up with a more varied environment at the final third. However, the design is also very linear with "secrets" that can be found by turning the other corner before going down the beaten path. Technically, the game runs smoothly with a benchmark inside the extras menu of the game.\n\nI would recommend picking this one up if you want a shooter that doesn't adhere to the modern military standard. At time of writing, the developers have made plans to release a Hard Reset Redux Edition which would upgrade the game engine to its latest version, add a melee weapon, spruce up enemy variety, and change the overall pace and balance. It's up to you if you want to plomp down some spare change to play this game now or wait it out until they release the Redux Edition.","January 28","true","14.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But the weapons are really fun.\n\nTo be a bit more honest, that game suffers from 4 very bad problems :\n- the enemies are all faster than you. You can sprint to bypass that peculiar issue, but given that you can only sprint forward, that the levels are quite small, and that you can't shoot while sprinting, it's basically useless,\n- the levels are very beautiful, but sadly, they are filled with invisible walls. Graphically, you're moving in a futuristic town, but in fact, the game could just be a bunch of rooms and corridors,\n- I do not know how explosions are programmed, but a wall will never protect you from an explosion. I did the test of hiding myself in a container (three walls and a roofs) and yet I still took damage from explosions,\n- and the most annoying problem : that blur each time you get hit. No matter if that missile took 75HP or one, your screen will get blurred, making it impossible to see how your health is. And if you're ganged up on by enemies, you're done for. They'll constantly knockback you and kill you extremely quickly.\n\nOtherwise, enemies are fairly challenging, with a very decent tracking (that's a nice way to say "you'll fail almost every evade and get charged by that giant angry robot"), but your weapons are diverse and powerful enough to not turn the fights into a chore.","May 1, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It tries to do something interesting with the weapon system.  That's about all the good I can say about it.\nThe game mistakes "challenge" for "swarming you with several hundred tiny enemies".  Imagine HALO if The Archive had been the only part in the game.  Every single area area has tiny holes that are very obviously meant for the two tiny enemy types (walking tiny screwdriver, walking tiny chainsaw).  Attempts to create tension by having something run by just out of sight fall flat on its face and just make you groan, "goddammit not this ♥♥♥♥ again."  Literally every room has this happen.\n\nThe offering of choice in weapon upgrades is purely illusory; if you don't take the specific upgrade paths intended by the designers, you are hilariously incapable of dealing with anything.  -EVERYTHING- is a bullet sponge.  There is very little variety in either location or enemies, and any rare moment of uniqueness is immediately spoiled by yet another uninspired slog through a sea of tiny screwdrivers and micro-chainsaws.  Many of the enemies are supposedly maintenence/industrial robots gone haywire, but the designs for the most part make no sense for their setting.  What in the world are all these bipedal chainsaws supposed to be used for?!\n\nSpeaking of things with no use, apparently everything in the future explodes in horriffically dangerous ways with the slightest provocation.  Not only that, you are expected to make use of all these wacky exploding background bits despite initially working for the city.\n\nThe game tries desperately to invoke the difficulty of "old school" shooters almost as a badge of honor.  It fails miserably.  I can, to this day, pick up and play Doom 1 & 2 and other old shooters that Hard Reset claims to strive to be.  I really tried to give this game a chance, but it just falls flat.","May 3","false","4.8"," 28 of 56 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","28","56","3","1"

I enjoyed it a lot but overall it fell short in my opinion. The weapons, even though there are only two base units, are very varied and enjoyable to use. The gameplay was not bad, but it was not outstanding either. It is fairly monotonous and very repetitive. The enemies are so so, they are all the same and do the same things.\n\nThat being said the true enjoyment in the title is that it is a real challenge, like not even fair sometimes challenging. If you do not like games that kick you when you are down and steal your lunch money you will not like this.\n\nThe world is very interesting; I loved the design of everything. I would have liked more enemy varieties but that is personal preference. But where this fell flat for me was in the story… there is none. Where there was any it didn’t make too much sense and the ending has an “Ok where is the rest of it” feel.\n\nI can’t recommend this at full price as in my opinion it has too many flaws, but the beauty of the  aesthetics and the joy of overcoming the challenge may well be worth it to some people. Either that or the unbelievable frustration will make you want to set something on fire.\n\nWell worth a play but don’t feel the need to finish it, seriously it's not worth it. It left me feeling hollow.\n\nHave fun? ^_^","May 5, 2014","false","9.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Maybe I spent my nano on the wrong upgrades, maybe I'm just too old for frantic action, but it's just not working for me. I'd probably kick major butt fifteen years ago, but y'know, middle age and FPS don't go so well together.\n\nThe main weapon - the assault rifle - might as well be shooting paper bullets, even upgraded with faster RoF. The shotgun seemed quite useless, and I stopped using the grenade launcher the moment I realized the grenade actually takes several seconds to explode. What I was aiming at was no longer there. The reload time is huge, so you can't even spam grenades for some carnage.\n\nI went for the mortar on the energy weapon, and while that did work on swarms of tiny robots, I have no idea if it's capable of doing ANY damage to bigger robots. It sure doesn't feel like it. I probably damaged myself more with it than I damaged them.\n\nThere's probably a combination of weapons needed for certain enemy types. Like, shoot this with that weapon, use the other one upgraded to something to kill that thing, and then use a different upgrade for other weapon to do this and then finish the enemy off with that. This and that, here and there, it just didn't click with me. The weapons in general seem to lack "oomph". Note that I haven't played the game for a long amount of time, so maybe it gets better later.\n\nAs far as level design is concerned, this is a linear corridor shooter, which isn't a bad thing by itself, but since there's lots of environmental debris and objects, I found myself getting stuck on things and quickly cornered. Since the enemies are very powerful even at the start, that means immediate death and then reloading from the checkpoint.\n\nSome things are very much rigged, and not in a good way; for example, you go down to a small room to pick up some nano, and then you get a swarm of robots spawning behind you. If you don't know they're coming, you're dead. When you reload from checkpoint, you're dead again, and maybe once more, until you realize that you need to use the energy mortar to shoot 2-3 points on the floor so it kills the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s before they get to you.\n\nThen you go out and you're swarmed by more robots. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThen you enter a parking garage and die to another swarm of tiny robots.\n\nYou reload, do the same thing again and again, kill everything, and suddenly you're swarmed by MEDIUM robots which the energy mortar won't do anything to, and everywhere you turn, you get stuck on a parked car and can't escape. Therefore, you die again, quit the game, go to Steam to write this review, uninstall the game and move it to a "Done" category in your Steam library.","March 15, 2014","false","1.7"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","18","37","2","0"

God awful maneuvering, you can't quick jump/dash away from a charging enemy.  All you have is a sprint, so if you want to strafe quickly you need to turn and sprint to the left or right.\n\n2. The scenarios are generally garbage....There are tons of explosives everywhere you'd think at some point they would say "Hey, maybe we should give our player some room to move around?",  Nope...you are always finding yourself in crowded environments full of boxes, crates, pipes, indestructible fences, etc.\n\nI got to one boss fight so far....was the most cringeworthy thing I've seen. At no point in time do you EVER have never ending enemies spawning in an FPS.  Thats absolutely lazy design.\n\n3. Every battle scenario is accompanied by cutting off your escape route....no running back, pacing yourself, etc.\n\n4. At no point in the time does the game teach you what or how the guns are used. I still don't understand and I'm just guessing that you work off their armor with one gun, then plasma blast them...but consistency isn't easy to find.\n\n5. No crouch....seriously....they added jumping but no crouch.\n\n6. Invisible walls everywhere to the point where the enviroment is very misleading and causes you to waste tons of time trying to jump around on things.\n\n7. Minor complaint, but the story is awkward.  You are not properly introduced to anyone or anything, its like literally jumping into the middle of a book.\n\n8. Terrible hit and collision detection.  Those gorrilabot things will still hit you with their charge despite them never physcially colliding with you.\n\nI'll commend them on the cutscenes, the compromise on a regenerating shield instead of health, decent voice acting, graphics, and destructible environment, and even cool combat when the game isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you...but the general battle scenarios suck.\n\nIt gets very tiresome constantly being stuck in a crowded environment, with enemies swarming you because they seemingly pop out of nowhere.

Old-school in the sense of Painkiller and Serious Sam, rather than DOOM and DukeNukem.\n\nThe level design isn't as interesting as the latter, but the game still has room for a few secrets for you to uncover. Each weapon is unique, with various uses, although the slow upgrade system doesn't encourage experimentation with the weapons (it's balanced for you to have 80-85% of the upgrades by the end of the game).\nStill, even though it may take a while, each weapon is pretty satisfying.\n\nWave uponh wave of enemies. The big problem is how resilient they are to damage. Even a rocket launcher is rather inneffective... Then again, I played on Hard mode. It's... really hard. Sometimes frustrating, putting high damage enemies with you into very small spaces.\n\nBut, despite that big flaw, the game is still a hell of a lot of fun!\n\nVisually, it's nothing short of impressive, with a huge, cyberpunk city. The lighting system is pretty good as well.\n\nThen, there's the physic's system. It's a big part of what makes this game awesome to play! Everything explodes and breaks apart, and you can basically shoot everything long after they're dead. It gets a bit too resource intensive, but it's worth it.\n\nThe levels are a bit too long to my taste (usually 40minutes +), seeing how much you die. Checkpoints are really unforgiving as well, with the game lacking a "quicksave" feature.\n\nBut hey, if you're looking for a game that is purely about the shooting, with little other distractions, definitely check this out!","July 2, 2015","true","20.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I picked it up for 2 euros, so I can recommend it at the pricetag, but honestly, compared to Shadow Warrior (2013) this game is not very good for the most part.\n\nEspecially if you get the wrong upgrades. Some weapons are useless even after you get the upgrades (looking at you, assault rifle). It wasn't until I painfully played through half the game when I realized, that the way to go here is to permastun enemies. Get all the CC upgrades, use RPG and railgun for dealing big damage, shotgun for wave clearing.\n\nThere's not a lot of enemy variety either. You got the little annoying ones, you've got the big charging ones, the rocket spammers and the scarabs. They do have a varied look based on how much armor they are packing, but at the end of the day they have the same abilities with a different paintjob.\n\nThe enemies are bullet sponges as well. UNLESS, you use the red barrels to kill them. The game puts a lot of emphasis on that, rather than the gunplay, which is a shame. 1-2 red barrels can kill the bigges enemies, but if you try to do the same with your guns, it will take a long while. There are plenty of red barrels in the first few chapters, but later they get more scarce and therefore the fights are needlessly prolonged, because you are waiting for the day the spongy enemies will finally die.\n\nI also noticed a lot of inconsistency in this game. Sometimes the little sawblade enemies deal only like 20 damage, sometimes up to 80. I have no idea wtf going on whatsoever. Is it because of my shield? But even if my shield are full, I still lose HP when I'm hit. Is it proportional? Is the damage only halved? Are shields only protecting from ranged attacks? I have no idea what's going on.\n\nThis game does one thing pretty damn well though, and that's the boss fights. The boss fights with Atlas and the Overseer from the Exile DLC are particularly well done. I really liked how I had to get the Overseer to suck in the barrels. That was a bit creative and unusual. Really good boss fight, that one. The parts of the game between the boss fights are really not enjoyable though.\n\nIn conclusion you can very much tell that this is the studios 1st game. It was an experiment. I'd say play Shadow Warrior instead, if you haven't played already. That's a much much more polished version of all the ideas this game experimented with and therefore a thoroughly enjoyable game. Get this game only at a huge discount and only if you are very bored.","November 21, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serioussimon/recommended/98400/","serioussimon","Si-Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serioussimon/","269 products in account","Originally, i didn't like Hard Reset, and stopped after less than an hour.\nI didn't understand why there were only two weapons, nor why there was a separate command to select each. I didn't understand why i was moving from area to area, killing hordes of robots and i didn't understand why i was so bad at it...\n\nFor the next few months, Hard Reset sat in my games list, with just 1 achievement, mocking me.\n\nRecently, I’ve been aiming for perfect games (a 100% achievement score), trying to increase my average completion rate. So with only one achievement, the time came back around to re-install Hard Reset, and try to bump my rating back up.\n\nAfter it was re-installed, i had the option to continue my last save, so i clicked the resume button, and in i went. Still on the first level, i continued my desperate struggle against the machines, and again, trying to make sense of the area to area robot horde killing gameplay.\n\nThis is probably the point that changed the game for me. My next challenge was to fight one of the bigger robots (the kind that charges at you), and i hadn’t realised that i was being awarded points for destroying the enemies, as well as collecting the orange pickups. “A new upgrade is available” flashed on the screen, and having already found an upgrade terminal, i quickly found the next one. I took a grenade launcher on the CLG Firearm.\n\nThe controls need explaining. It’s Q to select the CLG Firearm and E to select the NRG Weapon, after you add a new function to each one, you’ll be able to select that function with a number, so for example, i would have the CLG firearm selected with Q, then to select the normal machine gun mode, you would press 1, the shotgun function would be 2, and for my newly acquired grenade launcher, i would have to press 3.\n\nNow i had an incentive to carry on. To become more powerful, i would have to continue, and the achievements had already started popping up in the corner. Then, i think i started to like Hard Reset, i was looking forward to getting past the next section, getting my next upgrade, and finding all of those delicious secrets.\n\n\nCurrently, i’m playing it through on hard mode, which involves many re-tries. Every section is a case of trial and error. You go in, get horded, die, then retry, positioning yourself in a better place, to get past the first spawn. The second and third hordes of the area, will no doubt kill you again and again. Forcing you to retry, each time, remembering where the enemies come from, and to be ready, bottlenecking them with the scenery, and using the environment to your advantage.\n\nHard Reset would probably describe itself as an environmental shooter, as half of the scenery is either explosive, or has electronics wired so badly that a light kick would force it to short out and electrocute everything in a 2 metre radius.\n\nSo, my advice would be, to sit it out, play the first level to the end, try not to give up immediately. I understand now, why there are only two weapons, and generally how the game is compiled together giving the player individual challenges, and i understand why i struggled at first.\n\nThe only thing i don’t understand, is why i like this game so much, now.","May 8","true","13.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But for casual players looking to dabble in everything or just plain like shooters, there's so much wrong with it. There are no truly innovative ways to kill AI, some just soak up more bullets than others. I don't quite understand it. The story in itself is warped and beyond fixing. The characters are bland extrapolations of stereotypes in the countless games you've played before or movies you've seen. Objectives can be mundane and keep you confused as to what you're all really playing this game for aside from its stellar level and weapon upgrade design. It also relies on the gimmick of red barrels, which wears off after the first 2 levels.\n\nThey fixed some of the issues (a CQC weapon & dodge mechanics) in the redux, and I would recommend that if you haven't gotten the Redux yet.\n\nIs it worth it after you upgrade it? No. The core gameplay and mechanics will be just as boring the first time you played it. You just get to dodge charges and get a sword that's only useful on Easy difficulty. It doesn't have a skill tree, so it feels like they just threw it in there. That, and the graphics look identical to its 2011 counterpark.

Combat is quick and based around movement and lots of guns rather than cover and patience.\n\nUnfortunately it feels a bit clunky, you have a jump but it's basically useless and there is no crouch. Sprinting is fairly limited and the screen distorts so much you can't really see anything, leading you to often rush headlong into enemies. As expected you can unlock a plethora of weapons to help you along the way. There are 10 guns in total, each with an alternate fire. The weapons are split into two classes, one firing physical ammo the other firing energy. While I didn't use a number of the weapons or firing modes it was enjoyable to work out the best gun/mode combos for each enemy type. The weapons feel decent and some are pretty fun to use, but the swap time is agonizingly slow.\n\nThe level design is that of a corridor shooter but the fact that it is essentially linear is a bit of departure from the days of yore. There are plenty of secrets tucked into corners or behind destructible walls but it's not like you'll be exploring vast open levels to find them. The world is heavily cyberpunk and takes place almost entirely at night in the rain. It looks pretty good for what I suspect is a pretty minimal budget. It's an interesting world that is severely undersold by the story. Mostly told between levels by clunky animated, poorly voice acted "cut scenes" done in a graphic novel style, the story is underdeveloped and poorly explained. I wanted to to care about the story and the world but I just couldn't get drawn in. It just feels like there was supposed to be so much more.\n\nThe included DLC, Exile (previously Path to Exile or Extended Edition) is essentially more if the same. There are a couple new enemy types but one of the guns completely removes them as a threat. Partly through Exile I realized I was just grinding and going through the paces.\n\nIn the end Hard Reset is just a bit shallow. The potential is there for a much more engaging experience but it just doesn't deliver. If you're a fan of circle strafing this is probably a must have but for generalists or people looking for a deeper cyberpunk world this is a bargain bin/bundle pick up.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/rv-AzLNeX6U","September 17, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I only used the energy gun twice when the bullet gun ran out of ammo, so I can't say how it works fully.\nThe bullet gun has a machine gun mode (alternate zoom), shotgun mode (alternate EMG mini-grenades that stun whatever they hit), grenade launcher (alternate gravity well that sucks enemies in and traps them in a small space), RPG (alternate laser guided), and proximity mine (alternate manual detonation).\n\nThe ammo system is a shared pool, in that all of the bullet gun modes use bullet ammo, just in varying quantities based on the strength of the mode. RPG using the most and machine gun using the least. So no running around for machine gun ammo when you have 40 grenades lying around.\n\nYou start with just the machine gun mode on the bullet gun mode, and the default energy gun mode, and collect orange upgrade packs lying around called 'N.A.N.O.' which come in large or small sizes. Once you have enough of them, you can upgrade your gun for an additional mode, add an alternate fire, or pimp the primary fire out more.\nSmall N.A.N.O. packs are all over the place and are like a trail of breadcrumbs in some otherwise hard to navigate areas. The larger N.A.N.O. packs are usually hidden behind crates, breakable walls, or areas you have to parkour to.\n\nThere are some really OP combinations with the guns, like using the gravity grenade to hold trash mobs together in a bottleneck, then kill all of them with one grenade. Because the explosion from the grenade breaks the gravity well, for a larger charging mob, you hold them with the gravity grenade, then hit them with an RPG for a one-hit-kill.\n\nI would recommend getting the shotgun, grenade launcher, grenade alternate fire, RPG, then the laser guided alternate. Towards the end of the game you will pretty much need the RPG to take out some really annoying flying mobs. Proximity mines are fairly lackluster and use ~40 of your maximum 240 ammo for one proximity mine.\n\n\nAs for the story, it uses a graphic novel format between levels, with basically no story told during gunplay. The ending doesn't really feel like one. Kinda like the ending to Half-Life 2: Episode 2, the devs called it an ending, but they player is left wanting more.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game if you just wanna shoot a bunch of robots in a future dystopia setting.","December 2, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I REALLY liked the rail gun! The difficulty is high, even on normal.

This is primarily due to the fact that your enemies, (machines) don't usually react to being hit.\n\nFinally, the storyline is nonsensical crap.

Why did I buy it anyway ? I don't know why, I guess it's because of my love for games. Anyway, the game didn't disappoint. Not entirely, that is. First the good stuff; the graphics are of extremely high quality, especially for a downloadable game. I'm sorry to say, though, that there are the occasional framedrops during hectic firefights and explosions. The shooting works like a shooter should (see what I did there ?). Enemies come from all directions so you have to be careful at all times. The weapons and the upgrades are cool as well. The energy weapon I haven't used during the entire game, which is, by the way, about 3,5 hours long, so in my opinion they should've removed it. The controls are fine and the sounds are excellent, but the voice acting and story were weak. And the game ended when I actually thought I was about halfway, which is a shame. Worth the full price ? Nope. Wait for a 50% price drop.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","September 17, 2011","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Too much 5 minute bullet time events present in game these days and 12 quick-time events for the devs to take you by the hand and finish the game for you while you duck behind chest-high walls 90% of the time...\n\n\nCons\n- SOundtrack could have been better. It's quite poor actually. Jesper Kyd should have been hired for this (he also did MDK2 soundtrack, HItman, Assassin's Creed) ; heck , even I am into music production and I have some unreleased ♥♥♥♥ better than what's in this one's soundtrack.\n- enemies need more variety - 90% of them come towards you for melee; few ranged ones.\n- too much motion blur (i hate it) when sprinting + FOV to +200 while doing so is ridiculous.... I'm not running with 200mph FFS!!\n\nIf you know ANACHRONOX , this game will give you a taste of the 2000's ;\nIF you miss MDK2, this will remind you of it a bit.

That  said it shows. this game is really uninspired. The enviroment is the only thing that gives this game a plus. the Story is decent but its extremely shortand feels half done. the Script and VO work is awful but represents the cut scenes perfectly, like a bad  action comic from the eraly 90's if youve watched any animations from hte early 90's you know what im talking about. The action is alright but seems a bit forced, in each wave you have a single chance of getting things right or else you're dead. the weapons feel underpowered in some situations and adequate in others. I bought this soley on the demo and the relation to PK, PCF, but this is not worth the 30$ I spent. It falls short in so many areas, almost like Painkiller if it had been half as long and released today as is.\n\n5.0/10 its meh.","September 17, 2011","true","14.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your arsenal of weapons is woefully underpowered (even, with upgrades too) and the opposing enemies are super-accurate - even over distance.\n\nFPS Gods will no doubt blitz through level after level without dying 4 or 5 times like I usually do.

Were it not for the updated graphics and more responsive controls, you'd swear this direct was kin to Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake. Coat it in a lusciously dystopian cyberpunk coat of paint and you've got me by the sensitive bits; just be aware that Hard Reset is liable to kick you in those bits just as readily.\n\nPulling no punches, Hard Reset puts you in the shoes of Fletcher, hands you a strange energy weapon full of upgrade potential, and then starts lobbing wave after wave of robotic foes at you with little time to breathe in between. Action becomes stick-and-move most of the time as you work your way around each level, avoiding fire more than taking cover from it and taking as much advantage as you can of the environment. That environmental element was probably my favorite aspect of the game, as traditional exploding barrels are joined by things such as electrical boxes that can short out your opponents, and just natural-feeling static elements like barriers and columns that can, to some degree, help control enemy direction and flow.\n\nUnless you've been maintaining your twitch reflexes since FPS' toddler days or you're gifted with ungodly reaction time, Hard Reset is likely to kick you around quite a bit at first. Stick with it, though, and explore your upgrade options for your weapon. Once you've gotten the feel for the game's flow and found a setup that suits your needs, things start thrumming like, well, machinery.","January 13","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game deserves all the praise it gets and rightfully so.\n10/10","March 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Abeloroz/recommended/98400/","Abeloroz","Abelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Abeloroz/","652 products in account","Hard Reset is a laudable independent attempt at capturing the feel of classic-inspired "horde" first person shooters like Painkiller and Serious Sam. The early sensations are great, with a lush-looking Blade-Runner inspired aesthetic and a combat based on detonating strategically placed environmental hazards that will help you stop the hordes of robots running in your direction.\n\nUnfortunately, that initial interest doesn´t last much longer. The gameplay turns up extremely shallow and repetitive by the third level, with the same hazards, enemies and pacing (get stuck in arena, kill all enemies, walk until next arena) over and over until the end of the game. The storytelling is dull, the extremely noisy and constrasty visuals full of flashing lights make almost impossible to realize what's happening on screen during the chaotic battles, so you just shoot randomly at moving things. There is barely anything during the game that will surprise you, so whereas the controls are comfortable and the game feels quite polished, the experience will be the exact same from the first to the last minute. "Hard Reset" is a clear example of a one-trick-pony of a game.\n\nI'd recommend you to play the demo, but I wouldn't spend any money on the full game, since the game deflates almost since the beginning. A somewhat short game that will feel like takes too long to end out of the sheer repetition you'll feel along the journey.","March 14, 2015","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The process of unlocking upgrades leaves you with something new and interesting to try until the very end. The proximity grenades that you can detonate whenever you want with the second mouse button was a personal favorite. Flinging a proximity mine over a group of enemies then detonating it just as it sailed above their heads (sending them flying in all directions) never got old.\n\nOn the negative side the levels are quite linear. Throughout the game you find yourself either in a narrow corridor, a wide corridor, or a big box with scattered obstacles. The environments look nice, but I feel like a big opportunity was lost by keeping it so linear. It's pretty evident what gun works best where, so a lot of the time you feel quite railroaded in tactics.\n\nThat said the enemies have been well designed with the linear levels in mind and certainly keep you on your toes without ever feeling unfair. They do tend to the "charging straight at you" variety, which again, reduces your tactics quite a bit. To somewhat make up for that there's a great deal of destructible objects in the environment which can hinder your enemies in different ways.\n\nThe game prides itself on its 'old-school' style. But though the weapons feel right the player control doesn't. Compared to the classics the movement speed is slow, and jumping feels like you're wearing lead boots. Oh and I found too may places which the player should be able to reach via jumping but are blocked by invisible walls.\n\nAnd the less said about the plot the better.\n\nSo If you're in the mood for a short, fun & mindless shooter and this is on sale, sure, give it a whirl. Otherwise I can't recommend Hard Reset. It's simply to limited.","December 28, 2015","false","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Granted, I was playing at hard difficulty, but that's the way I prefer. Now, the game has an old skool approach, you are given two customizable weapons, fairly linear maps, and aggressive enemies to kill. The graphics are nice, using a lot of effects. The game runs at max 144 Hz, which is always a bonus for fps games.\n\nCan I recommend the game? Sadly, no. I feel the game has a habit of putting you into certain puzzle-like situations. You enter a hall, an area, or drop down from a container. The next moment you might be facing waves of enemies, in a fairly small space to move around in. In this game movement is vital, most of the time you can't just stand still and destroy everything in your path. I grew frustrated over time with these waves of enemies that usually take some amounts of punishment and the small spaces the game forces you into. It is difficult but sometimes I feel in an unfair manner. I don't mind lots of enemies, but restricting your movement is a bit cheap imo.\n\nStill, if you can get it at a discount, and enjoy challenging fps-games, this might be for you. I personally feel it to be a bit of a chore.","June 5","false","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Very much inspired by Blade Runner clearly. It's nice that the game runs quite good on bit older machines also.\n\nGameplay. Gameplay is typical console gameplay where you have to sprint to move fast. Sprint disables your ability to fire just like in those console shooters. Jumping is basically useless as there ain't any special places where you only get with some skilled jumping. There is only some kneehigh boxes that you always notice instantly that those were meant for jumping. This game is very linear, feels modern and that is not a good thing.\n\nHard Reset has also regenerating shield which in my opinnion is not a good idea if you try to make a "PC shooter", as we all know PC is all about fast action without handholding.

But the opened does not promise much in that regard.\n* Destructible walls seem over-done. Nothing new, but I still like it. But having destroyed a little bit short of 10 walls in the few minues I play seems excessive.\n* Restrictive pathing! This is the biggest annoyance for me. You can't jump over certain objects because the game decides you shouldn't. Even if you character could physically make the jump. This is really annoying.\n* Motion blur while running is overdone and annoying. You seem to be able to switch it off in the settings. I will do so when I lauch the game for the next time.\n* I've been running around quite a lot, but so far have only seen 3 variants of enemies... in increasing numbers. I hope this will improve soon.\n* Moving objects around seems to only take into account the distance you moved before bumping into it. So you cannot push objects an indefinite distance and you and up bumping into it, stepping back, bumping into it again, stepping back again, and so on...\n\n\nSo far for my first impression...","June 29, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It looks great, sounds good, has a great atmosphere, and it's fun to blow up robots.\n\nBut I don't recommend it, because it's hampered by a bunch of bad design decisions. There are lots of "Gotcha!" moments where enemies will spawn behind you, or you'll get locked into a closed space with a bunch of buzzsaw-bots. The checkpoints are way too far apart in places, and the game won't let you save without them.\n\nAt first glance, this seems like a classic-style twitch shooter, but it's actually more about cycling through the cooldowns on your weapons efficiently and keeping dangerous enemies stun-locked while you whittle down their huge health pools. Your character doesn't dodge very quickly, and the environments have a ton of junk to get caught up on, which is frustrating.\n\nIf you have a high tolerance for frustration, this game is worth your time.","January 12, 2014","false","28.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

For that price, it's a decent enough game, but there are a few things holding it back. Some of the times I died, I wasn't sure what killed me, or you could get jammed into the corner by enemies and then meleed quickly to death. In some places you're deliberately shoved into tiny areas with large monsters... which I tend to find irritating rather than a fair challenge.\n\nThe upgrade system was kinda fun, though I'm not sure what the point of having two guns was - in this game 1 gun can have 5 functions, which are all the different weapon types you need. Seems a better prospect to use just one of the gun types rather than both... I stuck with the mechanical gun throughout. Played through on Normal mode... though if the harder modes requrie more ammo, you may want to have rocket launcher/shotgun/machinegun combo on both. The enemy HUD upgrade I think should've been a default feature rather than an upgrade tbh.\n\nThe game is pretty short, but if you're buying this in a sale, the length doesn't matter as much... but the ending is definitely cliffhanger'd, which was disapponting for me. I think they could have written a bit more on it, even if they left a challenge open at the end of it, just to add to the sense of completion. In general, the plot could do with a little more beefing up, just to get a better sense of the world and what the heck is going on. You're not going to find a groundbreaking plot here, but I don't think it's the kind of game that needs a unique plot.\n\nAs far as technical problems go, I didn't experience any bugs ingame that I noticed, but I did have the game crash twice, and unsure why. Did knock my progress back a bit, but not too far. Played the game on ultra, got the odd bit of slowdown when things were really busy (2-3 times), but definitely playable on my rig... so I regard it as a decently performing game.\n\nIn general, I wouldn't recommend this game to people, but if you're a big fan of shooters, you may have some fun with it.","December 23, 2013","false","7.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's like the enviornment is playing with itself, but you can watch too, lucky you! It also has a half-baked RPG system that really doesn't need to be there, since all it determines is weapon unlocks and forces you to track down every bit of bonus upgrade points you can find, which you can get a upgrade that puts them on the minimap which means finding secrets is more about tolerating your patience for platforming in first person in a game that touted itself for its old school shooting mechanics. And hey, if you're going to use the same exact sounds as the Charge Beam in Metroid Prime, maybe you could have your version of the charge beam NOT hurt me when I use it anywhere close to my person? A final gripe about the game- there was one point I could've jumped onto a beam, then onto a large gas tank to get to an upgrade bonus thing. Except I couldn't, because the game is FILLED with invisible walls. Instead I had to take a longer path where I jumped along six inch wide ledges to get to it.\n\nIn short: Thinks it's smarter and better than it is, and thinks it's smarter and better than you.

It does have several good points - i like the setting, it provides a decent challenge at higher difficulty levels, and it actually doesn't look too bad.  Also, the environmental kill system is pretty fun - the game actually encourages the player to go more for these kind of kills, rather than going for accurate, individual kills.\n\nIn saying that, there are many things I am not fond of: not least of which is the movement - the feedback from movement makes Hard Reset seem like a mid-90s game. In fact, the basic structure of the game feels like that. After every level (there's not a huge number of them) you are given stats of how many of the enemies in the level you killed, how many of the secrets you found in the level, and such.  To me, it felt slightly lazy, as if there was no real interest in providing something new.  The other thing that bothered me, being a player hugely interested in narrative, was that the story was largely forgettable - in fact I'm still not sure what went on!\n\nOne final word - the addition of the extra content makes this a slightly better package than it would have been, but still, in my opinion, it remains largely mediocre, and that is something I cannot recommend","March 5, 2014","false","11.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It seems more like the outset of a butterfly. Looks wonderous on the outside, extremely vague and odd on the inside. Starting off, the game tells me the controls of the game. I don't mind that at all. Does that well so far. I also thought it was pretty innovative how if you hover your cursor over a nearby screen it starts up the little video for you so if you want to watch it you don't have to wait for it to start all over again, just move your cursor away if you are not interested.\n\nThen I get to what appears to be a larger robot than all the other little ones that come in clusters. These appear to be bullet sponges but I thought I had to have a special way of taking them down with the alternate plasma weapon I had. Of course not knowing this I tried everything but the bullet spongey method and frustrated myself unnecessarily. Finally, it worked sinking mass amounts of bullets into it and got it killed. It told me how to do everything else but not how to handle the big boys? I was so confused I thought I broke the game.\n\nAlso the game has a VERY obscure way of explaining things. Some things it will show you directly, others it will just say figure it out yourself. It seems like this game wants to be too many things for a 3000ish MB type game and I am actually quite disappointed. To be fair I did not expect much from a game this size its just that if you plan to make a tutorial for your game, explain things properly. Certain actions like jumping are clearly explained. Other very vague things like pickups and even when you first visit the upgrading station. It's incredible how much work was put into this but not enough work to explain what all this is. I was stunned. Not to mention that you don't have enough to DO anything when you get there. You figure at least they would give you enough currency to start off with to demonstrate how the buying process works but that never came into play.\n\nLong story short: I do not recommend buying this game. A lot of things are bullet spongey, other things are very obscure and you have no idea what to do, a lot of things are just blindly there being picked up and you don't know if you should pick it up or not. If you cannot make a decent tutorial, how are you gonna pull in your playerbase? If I am offput on how a tutorial explains things, there's a problem with your game.\nA more fleshed out tutorial needs to be made for the customers. If you are planning to innovate the FPS genre, might wanna flesh out how your game works first so people aren't wandering around blindly, asking themselves "What is this? What's this? What's that thing? What do I do? I'm so confused!"\n\nSorry guys I do not recommend this as a purchase.

The checkpoint system is garbage, this is a PC game not a console game. Twice I've had to re-load the game because I've been stuck in the scenery hunting for upgrades only to be forced to clear out an area of enemies again.\n\nWhich brings up another issue, if you do decide to get this game avoid the shotgun. I saved up upgrades and upgraded it all the way, then hit a check point, sealing my fate. The shotgun in this game has no impact on enemies, so you wait for them to get close to use it, shoot them, and even the 2 foot tall enemies will walk right through the blast and hit you anyway. And it does little to no damage on enemies.\n\nThe only way you can survive the higher difficulties on here as far as I can tell is to constantly kite enemies around near things that can explode (which is nearly everything, strangely enough) because none of the weapons seem to do an acceptable amount of damage to enemies.\n\nAnother problem slightly related to getting stuck in the scenery I've encountered is the fact that you're always dodging things flying around and being pushed into a corner because an enemy is pushing a 10 foot by 10 foot crate around in front of it. It makes for a very annoying experience.\n\nWith a little more polish this game has the potential to be great, but in its current state I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","June 12, 2015","false","2.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fideeranab/recommended/98400/","fideeranab","Fideera Nab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fideeranab/","249 products in account","I tried to like this game.  I really did.  I booted this game up on three seperate occasions in an attempt to get through it, but why bother if it's not fun?  The whole ordeal was a slog through slow paced shooting sections.  There is obviously an attention to to detail here, but the core elements of the game are just fundamentally broken.  The story is delivered through minimal character voice overs during gameplay and short comic strip-like segments between loading screens.  The voice is acting is...decent, and the comic style of the cutscenes is interesting.  But beyond an interesting comic style and a neo-future cyberpunk setting, this game falls flat.\n\nThere is an attempt at interest, but the cyberpunk setting is washed out by a spew of browns and grays in a variety of dark and blue-tinted areas.  The setting never really feels different between two locations: street level and underground.  The enemies are all bulletsponges and their design are both from an aesthetic standpoint, and a gameplay standpoint, uninspired.  Every enemy is a one trick pony, repeatedly attempting to kill with it's one attack mechanism.  For most enemies, you simply dodge while holding down the trigger until either they blow up, or you run out of ammo.  The topic of dodging leads me to my next point that the level design is awful.  I would expect this kind of design from a student project, not a full release game.  The areas are excessively linear with obvious tells for every single ambush of enemy robots.  Environmental hazards play a large role in the combat, but everything is incredibly played out.  If there is going to be a wave of enemies to ambush you, there will also be a series of explosive barrels or electrical spouting conduits to fry them up.  Most enemy encounters are simply there to pad the experience.  Many times enemies seemed to just appear in an area because the game said so.  Most combat was either myself against a large charging enemy in an open area, or myself against many small enemies in a closed area.  When you are required to dodge many small enemies in a closed off corridor like area with minimal movement, it's not fun, it's not a challenge, it's frustrating.  In one instance, an ambush blew through a wall, but upon inspection of their entrance point, it was a closed concrete block in a hole.\n\nYou only get two weapons in the game.  Each one has it's own twist, and the weapon variety is accomplished through allowing upgrades for each of these two weapons.  Through the usage of upgrades, your bullet based weapon and your plasma based weapon can each turn into 4 other weapons, totalling 10 different guns.  However, these guns feels the same.  None of your attacks seem to have presence.  Accuracy is abyssmal, and when combined with the fact that all enemies have massive amounts of health (or you simply don't deal any damage) any combat interacting is simply tedious.\n\nThe movement is a joke too.  For a game that so heavily relies on dodging telegraphed enemy attacks, movement is stagnant and stale feeling.  Your characters jaunts around at a slightly sluggish speed.  You have the ability to sprint - if I could even call it that - but it really just makes your character move slightly faster for only a few seconds and makes your screen and HUD shake a lot.  The jump is floaty, as if your character lacks weight, and you also can't jump while sprinting.  There was a speed puzzle where a lift needed to be activated by a button across the room.  You then had to run down a staircase and across the room before it went back up.  With the sluggish controls, it was tedious and took multiple attempts before realizing that to get there faster, I should not sprint, so that I could jump into the lift as it was going up.\n\nThere are definitely some cool concepts here.  Floating UIs for upgrade panels and actual interaction screens for devices in the game are interesting and function very well.  The visuals themselves are very good.  Everything is for the most part impressively rendered and the visual effects are nice to look at.  But the art style, the sluggish controls, unvaried weapons, and completely uninteresting and uninspired combat really sink this game.  I tried to like it, but I can't and shouldn't have to force myself to clear a game out of my backlog.","October 16, 2015","false","3.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It isn't fun, but you won't be bored.  The gun-play is bland, though you've likely never seen a gun like the one in this game.\n\nI'd say it's safe to avoid, even if you are looking for an old-school shooter (like I was).  It's not the worst 4-5 hours you could use, but you'll walk away scratching your head at the ending.

It wants you to shoot 50K enemies per level, but all of the fights/encounters lack the fun element thats been replaced by the annyoing element. Once the fighting starts, you dont really understand much thats going on on the screen, as it immediatelly fills up with a gazillion effects that would normaly add to a game, but in this case, its WAY too much and that is causing the exact opposite effect. It also almost forces you to use the environment to kill off the hordes of enemies, but because of a lack of imagination, its counter- productive and intuitive.\n\nThey tried to fill it up with everything that was good in other shooters, but ended up with a bad stew. You cant just take all the good things from other shooters (or whatever other genre) and throw them together into your game, thinking its gonna be perfect. All those elements need to have a certain sinergy and that sinergy is influenced by the creative mind of the developer where he uses various bridges to link those elements together.\n\nI could go on for another half an hour about why this game is bad, but its one of those things that no matter how many of the flaws you mention, they are just to many to overlook or to fix thru patches or DLCs.\n\nThe only nice thing about the game is the graphics... but as Indie games have proven time and time again, you dont need Crysis/Battlefield/CoD/etc type of graphics to build an encredibly fun game.","January 17, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I hated FPS's for the longest time; mostly this was due to me being a console gamer by whole life and I never understood the draw. But, Far Cry 3 changed all that for me and now its my favorite catergory. Hard Reset has only helped strengthen my opinion of the genre. The gameplay is so smooth that it is virtually flawless. If every FPS used Hard Reset's formula there would never be another bad FPS again. It also sets a very high bar for the game's developers. They now have to always make soemthing a little better than this. And I have to say that I wouldn't be surprised if they found that extremely challenging. I purchased the game on sale for 4.99 and I played it immediately (as opposed to the 5-6 games on Steam I have not yet played that I owned before this). I was blown away from the start. The only part of this game that is just ok are the cut-scenes' voice acting. The cutscenes animation is nice and stays true to the abstractness  and sci-fi feel of the story, but the writing and the voices could be better. However, you can skip the cutscenes after a sceond or two; the next levels/scenes load very fast!","February 3, 2014","true","6.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Aside from robots, there are no other NPCs in the game.\nInvisible walls are everywhere - you cannot jump your way to the secret area, cannot even jump on the stair railing.

These things kept me from abandoning the game, but as I kept nearing the final boss, the flaws were seen clearer and clearer.

The game is also incredibly short, barely 5 hours even with the expansion, and rather than going the smart route of "Here's an opening cutscene briefly setting up a premise, now go shoot things.", there's a story that barely makes any sense scattered across cutscenes throughout the game that only serves to unnecessarily break the action.","January 31, 2014","false","5.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","The good news is that I really like the art style and visual design of the game (it looks great, with lots of little details hidden in the levels on posters and signs and so on, and the cyberpunk theme is a lot of fun), and it mostly feels good to play, like an old school shooter. If that's all there were to it, it would be great, but there were a few things that added up to stop me from finishing the game.\n\nIt's a "hard" game, which in itself can be a good thing, except it's not really hard because it's challenging but because there are situations where you can quickly end up dying for what almost seems to be no reason your first time through because you don't know where the enemies are going to spawn or where the environmental hazards are until you've already seen them. Once you know where everything is, it's suddenly very easy to avoid them all and lead the enemies into traps instead (because they're quite dumb), but it leads to more trial and error than I'd like. Yeah, it's true to the old school spirit of the game, I guess, but I suppose that's not really what I'm feeling up for right now.\n\nCombined with that, it doesn't help that you can kind of paint yourself into a corner with the weapon upgrades if you don't choose well. Hint: AoE/splash damage is your friend.\n\nSomething else I haven't heard other people mention, so it may just be me, is that a couple times I got stuck going in circles for maybe ten minutes, completely unable to tell where I was supposed to go next. I wasn't lost or anything; I just couldn't find any door to go through or button to push or anything because it didn't stand out from the rest of the environment enough, which I haven't really had happen with other games much. I will chalk it up to either my partial color blindness or possibly just me being a dumbass.\n\nAnyway, I really wanted to like it, and there were some things about it that I genuinely did think were rather well done, but I had enough frustrating moments that I think I'm going to go back to playing Tower of Guns for my 90s-style FPS needs for the time being.","December 11, 2013","false","2.8"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","12","27","0","0"

This game is sold as Old School but it is not, I grew up playing Wolfenstine, Doom, Doom 2, Quake and so on those were old school, this game is simply a pretender that is unable to put forth even the most BASIC of FPS action and gameplay.  If you hear or read anyone speak of this title and Doom/Wolfenstine in the same breath immediately ignore them as they clearly have never played any of the true older titles as they are nothing alike and that is not a good thing.  Flying Wild Hog used the “old school” phrase as a marketing tool, it is an excuse to use that phrase to get people like me who've grown up playing the real old school shooters into thinking that this game will be ANYWHERE close to the caliber that those titles were and continue to be. Everything in those games was always paced properly, always fair; you never felt like you consistently hit a wall and it didn’t feel like luck to get to the next point. This game, regardless of these “upgrades” feels nothing but a shallow shell of what it tired to do and attempts to hype itself up in order to get unsuspecting buyers. Within 20 minutes, I knew that this game had none of what I found enjoyable in Shadow Warrior, clearly the developers learned many of their lessons from this title, as it is beyond inferior or substandard even for a basic FPS game.\n\nSo far I have gotten zero enjoyment out of the experience, the weapons, much like the ballistic weapons in SW, are liken to a toy and do almost nothing to enemies. Enemies that this game's universe has KNOWN about so therefore they should actually do more then just oh annoy them a little which would make you think that humans would have developed weapons to fight beings that are basically computers. With regards to weapon damage and how they work, there appears so far to be no real way to determine if a one weapon is favored for a particular enemy over the other. Part of this is because every single enemy in this title is a damage sponge making combat experience difficult at best let alone figuring out this game’s mechanics, if one can say that it has any. The smallest of enemies do 50 times more damage then they should to the player and take 100 times more damage then they should given how frequently they put the player into the closest of close quarters with these mostly melee driven enemies and their size. I do still see some of this game’s poisonous form spilling out into their work on SW, as the enemies hit you when you clearly put some distance between you and their attack impact point or enemies that have some kind of city sized hitbox for their attack that will hit you not matter where you are in relation to the unit. In this day and age it is absolutely inexcusable that this kind of programming and blatantly unfair gameplay would be tolerated in ANY development studio.\n\nThe character you play as seems to be made of paper, thus making enemy attacks even more deadly, dare I say you could right off the bat buy all of starting medical upgrades and STILL not have enough HP to take these unending waves and low amounts of health given. Speaking of your character, he has the lung capacity of a sick new born, he can sprint for exactly 1 meter then becomes haggard, yet we are lead to believe that he is some kind of PMC solder so one would think that he would have some kind of psychical training on top of whatever cybernetics or whatever he may have in him. This lack of stamina will constantly get you killed as enemies will swarm you almost instantly unless you sprint, even though the sprint is rather slow and it barely counts, adding to that the horrible visual effect that portrays the visual of sprinting. Unlike Shadow Warrior, you do not have the ability to dodge, which in this game’s case is a seriously negative omission because it is made by the same people the enemy types or attack types are roughly the same and need to be dodged. Your character however moves as such a slow pace on top of having almost zero stamina makes for even WALKING out of the way or trying to side step an enemy’s attack nearly impossible if not inconsistent.\n\nYou my notice that I have yet to talk about the “story line” I have chosen to omit that because as MANY others have talked about that aspect of the game I have really nothing more to add.  The only thing that I will add is that I agree with their sentiment, the story is miniscule it would seem as if someone saw a bunch of science fiction movies and told their 10 year old to write a script while keeping those scenes in mind.  It is confusing only because it does so little to explain anything, this includes the game’s universe, this means the characters and their interactions, this means the locations and their significance, and this means the protagonist and his goals.  All the items that are essential to a proper story and the game provide none of that.  The sad part is that there is a lot of atmosphere within this universe which is obviously taken almost directly from Blade Runner.\n\nThe checkpoint system is absolute garbage and the developers felt it necessary to steal away the game’s quick save feature which is in almost Every PC game.  Especially given this game’s insane difficulty this is a crime and there are zero reasons as to why the developers choose to take out the quick save/quick load function or why they made the checkpoints so spread out other then to give the game yet another layer of fake, artificial difficulty. I really do not know how the developers slept at night knowing they made such horrible game design choices and then had the gall to market it as an old school shooter.\n\nI honestly should have just listened to the negative reviews of this game and just stayed playing or liking Flying Wild Hogs for making SW because now my opinion of them is soured by this experience. I wanted to support them by buying their other title but now I really am unsure if I will ever bother subjecting myself to this…Experience. Which is a damn shame because visually it’s a nice universe and a semi-possible interesting story, but it is all hampered by overly punishing gameplay mechanics, claustrophobic level design and bad mechanics, I was really hoping that the other reviewers were wrong, but I see that that was not the case. This title is not a game, or what I would consider a game, a game is supposed to be fun, an enjoyable experience that keeps you coming back, this game has failed to carry with it any of the most basic FPS ideas and put them to use, for that it fails as a game and a title.\n\nI wanted so much to like this game, or at the very least like more then 50% of it so that I could come away with at least some fond memories of my time in game.  I even pressed forward and beat the game in order to satisfy my completionist side and to confirm for myself that there was nothing positive about this game worth remembering or noting.  Beating the entire title with its added extra content DLC (which confuses the “story” even more) I feel that I have seen all that there is to see about this title and that no amount of extra time within this title’s universe will change my mind.","September 2, 2014","false","11.2"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","0"

I would recommend it for killing some time if it wasn't for the following issues:\n\n- Low variety of enemies and attack patterns\n- Dumb AI. Enemies only follow you horizontally and don't try to cut your escape, just keep following.\n- Weird HitBoxes: Your HitBox appears to be bigger than it should. Dodging is dodgy. Hitting too.\n- Invisible walls everywhere, probaby to make up for the enemy AI.\n- Cliché story, characters and weapons. I don't mind a bit of cliché, but this much.... some creativity wouldn't hurt.\n- The jump mechanic doesn't really help at all.\n- Linear, boring, not compelling, repetitive to kingdom come.\n- The skill system, or whatever that thing is.... doesn't add anything to the game, doesn't allow you to "biuld your own character" or "play your own way" at all. It's more like a way to not to give you everything at the beginning. Doesn't add up anything to the game.\n- The music is generic and uninspired, just like the rest of the game\n\nOn the good side:\n-Graphics are nice\n- Cyberpunk sci-fi setting\n- You get to blow stuff up\n- Main character curses way more than the dialogue requires.\n- You get to blow a lot of stuff up\n- Secrets often show up right under your nose. You can cheat yourself into thinking you're really good at finding them.\n- You'll appreciate much more the next game you pick up.\n- You get to.... yeah, right.\n\nSo, if you feel like killing some time with some mindless (really mindless) straight-forwarded shooter, get it, it's your money after all, just try to wait for a sale if you're not in a rush.\nOh, and get a rpg with laser tracking device before you end the main story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avex_13/recommended/98400/","avex_13","Alex_SM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avex_13/","434 products in account","I hate to say this....\n\n...but I cannot recommend this game. I would love to do it, because the game tries to do everything in the right way, but I simply can't, because this time it just doesn't work. It's a shame, because Flying Wild Hog did a bunch of things right. Hell, they nearly headed the perfect direction, but there are a few bad development decisions that have a significant impact in the final result.\n\nAs I don't want to give the impression that this is an awful game or anything like that, I will start telling what does this game do right, because it does a couple of things right.\n\nThis game is an amazingly beautiful game. It invites to just stop and look at everything. Graphical fidelity is great (really impressive for an Indie tittle), artistic design is UNBELIEVABLE, and it runs like charm (at least on my HD7970). The hand drawn cinematic, similar to those in Mirror's Edge, are really cool and hide the loading times pretty well. This is maybe the strongest feature of the game, it's technical side is amazing. Way better than expected.\n\nThe game then wants you to run. Its action it's extremely fast paced, demanding you to aim fast, shoot fast and think fast. It also demands you to search for health, to use objects in the map to cover from fire (sometimes there are so many enemies shooting at you that otherwise is impossible) while enemies moving to get you out of your cover without the regular magical mechanics of AAA shooters which regenerate health and let you stay there for ages. In 2013 all I can say is Hooray for Flying Wild Hog! Even AI is better than usual. It isn't smart, but it's very very aggressive. Even the weapons, which seem to be a bit lackluster at the beginning, are pretty good once you start upgrading them. And there's a huge difference between every weapon, making each of them good or bad depending on the situation. Again, well done.\n\nSo, if the game does so much things right, why does it fail? Because there are two important things that it does wrong. First one is the level design. Even if I love all the chances it gives to use map elements to kill the enemies, every level ends up being a corridor with some arenas in between and some secrets here and there. It's very Serious Sam-esque, but the design of every zone (specially in big arenas) is much worse. Sometimes really dull. It's not enough to leave me in an empty place with some objects and throw a bunch of enemies at me. To do that right you need a place that is awesome. For example, the town fight in one of the last levels of Serious Sam 3, or the different fights in the Egyptian ruins, are leagues beyond anything this game achieve.\n\nBut is not only the level design what is flawed, but the enemy design. I'm not only talking about aesthetics, but behavior. Some robots are cool (the one that charges on you), but some other are just dull and the game relies too much in throwing lots of them at you. Again, this works in Serious Sam because every enemy presents a different and well balanced threat. Here it doesn't. Also doesn't help that some of them, if they are a bit far from you, look a lot like the environment, making them difficult to be seen.\n\nThis two things lead to some very uninteresting fights, which considering this is a shooter is like a capital flaw.\n\nTalking about the story... well, there's not too much to say. It doesn't help the game, neither kills it. Just an average one which is never very important for the enjoyment of the game.\n\nConsidering all of this, I cannot recommend it. And it's a shame, because it's a game I wanted to like, but I just don't enjoy it too much. That doesn't mean some other people won't enjoy it, because it still gets many things right, but here the scale is just a binary yes/no, so this one gets a no.\n\nAnyway, Flying Wild Hog looks like a very promising studio. I'll take a look sooner or later at their Shadow Warrior, and I'll definitely wait for their next projects.","November 28, 2013","false","2.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pagetotallynotfound/recommended/98400/","pagetotallynotfound","File A Complaint | Leviatus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pagetotallynotfound/","1466 products in account","SHORT REVIEW:\nThe developers have no idea how to make a videogame.\n\n\nLONG REVIEW:\nI have no idea where to begin on how bad this game is. As a fan of mindless shooter, I can't fathom how flawed the game is in its core.\n\nThe character's movement does not feel the player is in control entirely to compensate the chaotic situations that the game constantly puts the player in, as sprinting and jumping are not very fluid. You cannot jump freely while sprinting, you lose a bit of handling while at it, and sprinting lasts for a very short period of time.\nAll of the enemies (and I mean all of them), have faster movement speed, usually 2 to 3 times faster than the character so the player is forced to be constantly moving with the game's awful controls.\n\nThe game seriously lacks variety of enemy types, but it also suffers from their flawed designs. Enemies should be very exciting to fight, but they are incredibly annoying to deal with.\nThere are self-destructive bots that move in an incredible speed whose explosion radius is massive, shockwave emitting crawlers which lock on you (for the most of the time you cannot avoid them easily) when charging at an accelerated speed, ranged gunners whose projectiles travel as fast as bullets, fast-moving rollers who charge at you to saw your limbs off, and other varieties of the said enemy types.\n\nWhat's worse is that the game tends to put all of these annoying enemies in a single wave at once in which the player has to rely on variety of lucks or stupid AIs doing funky things to beat.\nThe game features about 3 different enemy types with different armor levels and different weapons on them. Some of these types have no weaknesses on how to kill them without almost dying. The game still gives you enough regen after a wave to restore back to perfect health, but it is no excuse to design a game where the player is meant to be hurt to almost death situations after every wave. This is the most frustrating part of the game. I died the average of 3 times per chapter, and  after those deaths I didn’t bother changing a strategy and was still able to beat the level I had trouble with, because the enemy AIs were so unpredictable and had no counter-strategy to work with. It was all just luck for the most part. Explosion radius is bigger than the usual player’s predictions in the game’s FOV (and the game basically feeds on explosions), most of projectiles are semi-homing and they also explode dealing damage to the player around even though it misses, small enemies charge at you while you are dealing with bigger enemies and vice versa, and most of them don’t have any counter-strategies to work with. One of my favorite mindless shooter is the Serious Sam series, and the game had enemies that were simply very fun to play against, so I can tell you that mindless shooter does not mean mindless design.\n\nThe level design is nothing of stellar, and sometimes makes no sense at all. The game has a hint system telling the player what to do, only when they reach a point. Here's why the hint system is completely useless:\nThere are points that emit green lights where the player has to go and interact with to advance in the level and it's ALWAYS just as simple as clicking on the button when they reach the point. However, the developers think the players lack brain so it tells them to “click on the button to ... (insert any unnecessary information)”. The problem is that the levels aren’t designed well enough to sometimes let player know where to go in the dark environment, and the game does nothing to assist the player with. It tells the player to click on the button once they reach the only green-lit interactive interfaces which is completely useless. Later in the game, the levels have so many map decorations that are lit green with interfaces that cannot be interacted with. The players are accustomed to click on whatever that has an interface screen and green-lit, and the final levels of the game break this one rule that they’ve been training their players with. Often there will be times where it damages the player for absolutely no reason with some pre-scripted moving objects. There is no way to avoid them, and the game gives you a regen shortly after. Why were these put in the sequence in the first place?\n\nThe game looks pretty nice, but it is nothing of amazing. If the game was released on the consoles I doubt it would look as decent as any other average titles. I was playing this on my 780 Ti and I still experienced frame drops on chaotic situations, which the most of the game is in except when the player is walking to point A from point B. I can only assume the game is terribly optimized at best.\n\nThe game is the definition of frustration. There were so many flawed designs with no sense of innovation being found from the game, so I had to look up who in the world developed this terrible game. Flying Wild hog, as stupid as their name sounds, had no experience as it was their first game in the market. I will make sure to avoid any games from them in the future and so should anyone who wants to have fun with videogames.","August 6, 2014","false","8.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The environment is kind of Bladerunner meets Borderlands with the "old skool" play style of Doom. The game has two weapons, each of which has a series of modes.. nice but too complicated to switch between in the heat of battle. When you are taking hits, you have no real feel for how badly you are being hit and the difficulty curve is well, more rollercoaster than curve. The game also teases you with openings beneath fences etc, but the lack of a crouch or pick up ability serve to frustrate. Similarly, jumping is flawed... you cannot jump over balustrades or ledges that you might otherwise expect to, instead our action hero has to walk to the stairs.... You spend a lot of time fighting multiple enemies at once, but their surprise appearances are entirely predictable. The art style is quite nice and the engine smooth, but the levels are all pretty samey and it gets tired quickly. There also seem to be a lot of fork lift trucks blocking the way, hardly puzzling, and the game quite frequently tells you where to go with a hint system before you even have a chance to figure it out (if indeed you could). So in summary, it's an ok game, but not really recommended.  It tries to be old skool but doesn't quite pull it off and fire fights tend to be a case of holding down the fire button whilst strafing around for health and pickups.\nIf you can manage to persevere and grind through the monotony of the first 2 hours or so, there are some epic boss battles to be had but the surprise spam attacks continue throughout. There ain't no sneaking up on enemies in this game, they prefer the magician's approach.","January 9, 2014","false","10.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

Not ideal for a game such as this.\n\nThe level design is attrocious, invisible walls everywhere, random elevators and doors everywhere that can't be opened till you eliminate the enemies (this can be grounded into the game in a much better way, the new Shadow warrior does exactly that).\n\nOn the plus side, the approach to physics and destruction is nice to see and the computer interfaces are pretty cool tech that isn't in enough games.\n\nHow this has a positive rating is beyond me, if you want to play a game like this that is actually good, go get Shadow Warrior (on further viewing, Shadow Waarrior is by the same developer, so definately skip this and just get Shadow Warrior)","November 27, 2015","false","6.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

It's just another gritty, brown shooter like Call of Duty or Gears of War. The levels are simplistic, walk from A to B, destroying enemies as you go in the grey background. The guns are weak, the standard, stock machine gun and the blue flame gun? I haven't got a clue what it is but that doesn't matter right? As long as it kills things, which is a bit of a laugh because the enemies are either incredibly weak or incredibly strong. I was playing on easy because I was tired and I was quite surprised by how much damage some of the enemies did. I finished the first mission and could handle no more, I got tired of doing the same thing over and over. Kill enemies, blow up fuse box, kill enemies etc. It was a grind.

The story makes basically no sense, the plot hardly advances at all except in one or two places, and the main character uses "the f-word" and "the s-word" and other expletives so often that they lose all meaning.\n\nThe game looks great, and the combat is actually quite well done, but after the 3rd or 4th variation of the same npc coming at you, and the predictability of enemy enounters, it all gets old very fast. There's also only one "combat music" track that you hear throughout the entire game. It smacks of being the first game of a new crew, written by someone without a firm grasp of English or experience in how to tell a story.\n\nPROTIP: When writing dialogue, "the f-word" is not an acceptable replacement for "very", "damn", "ouch", "huh", or "oh look, that's an interesting thing on the horizon."\n\nBy the mid-point of the game I was utterly bored, and just grabbed a trainer from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so I could blow through the rest of it, which I did. The ending sucked. I've heard FWH's Shadow Warrior remake is quite good, but after playing this, I find those reports dubious. I'll still play it, though.

You have only two guns, a gun that uses bullets and one that uses energy. However, the base guns (basicly rifles) have additional shotgun, gernade, mine-throwing, and various single power-shot modes that can be unlocked with points earned from kills and from scavenging yellow-glowing-box-things scattered throughout the levels. The varitions between similier modes for each gun are minor (the bullet-gun shotgun is slow and single-shot, the energy version is a wide spray of electricity for as long as you hold down the trigger), but the differences do add up.\nYour only enemies are machines, which is good and bad. It's good if you like watching your target's armored body fall apart, but bad if you don't like bullet-spongy enemy. Several large foes take forever to kill. However, the degree of bullet sponge was acceptable to me, as per the enemies. The enemies themselves are limited for the first part of the game, which I liked because it made it easier to learn patterns, especially for large groups of enemies (there are several). The Enhanced content adds some new foes, however, and a flying version is both very deadly (it shoots back) and extremely annoying.\nThe combat in Hard Reset is the meat of the game, and is intense and demanding (many enemies focus on melee, meaning they throw themselves at you in large masses). Impediments to progess are all extremely basic keypad interacts that are thankfully less annoying than keycards. There is an extensive story, but I got sick of it early, and when the extended content shows up I'm pretty sure the whole thing stops making much sense, anyway.\nIf you like the momentum and skill required by games that utilize healthpacks over regenerating health, you will probably like this game.\nVideo! http://youtu.be/w7RIzAeSZes","March 15, 2014","true","7.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Seemed like a cookie cutter shooter, which is what I was looking for.\n\nIn today's age of "gittin' gud", I just can't be bothered with this one.  People yelled and spat about Bioshock Infinite having bullet sponge enemies, and yet, 1,600+ positive reviews for this game??  Gamers today are ♥♥♥♥ed in the head.  But I digress.\n\nLook up any Negative review, and I pretty much agree with all.  Only positive thing to come out of this is the futuristic setting if you like that sort of thing -- which is another reason I wanted to try my hand at it.\n\n-Weapons AND upgrades are practically useless.\n-Enemies never stun until they're half or 3/4 dead, and in which case you're still getting swarmed.\n-The weapon switch is HORRIBLY slow.  If you want to sell your typical fast-paced FPS, MAKE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SWITCH FASTER.  My god, you're almost forced to constantly switch in dire situations, and yet the developers thought it'd be a good idea to make the rifle/energy switch slow as ♥♥♥♥.  Doesn't add challenge, just adds annoyance.\n-Closed environments with enemies meant to be blown up by the cars/tanks/etc?  BAD IDEA.\n\nBut what do I know.  Gamers today will cut their wrists open just to say they beat somthing hard.  I just don't have the time or patience for games like this anymore where the developers purposely make one aspect good, but another point doubly, and glaringly, worse just to make the NEET MLG kids gloat about it on forums.","July 10, 2015","false","2.2"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","8","20","2","0"

Corporation run lifestyle with robots sabotaging things? Sweet, right up my alley. After the first few kills I was still having fun. Upgrades for weaponry with a slick UI that was built into the game so it felt extremely fluid. The world felt, albeit deserted, lived in in a way.\n\nSeconds later I started to notice the glaring flaws with the game. While attempting to sprint away from a horde of enemies, I found out that sprint only lasts for maybe a second or two, quickly giving me false hope of getting out of the situation unharmed while I sought better cover. I noticed that the two guns, an EMP rifle and a standard assault rifle, had no real difference other than looks. I upgraded said weapons to allow one to give me an area effect and one with a grenade. The area effect was useful, but still allowed enemies far too close for comfort, and the grenades were just...useless. "Oh well, maybe they need more upgrades." I lied to myself as I pressed on. Soon I found myself becoming irritated by the obvious pickups just out of reach in a crouch-able area. I tried every button then went into my key bindings, low and behold there was no crouch button.\n\nSoon after these flaws arose, thinking I was lucky, I attempted to jump on a few crates to hurdle a barrier to get a secret pickup. Right as I reached the top, I was met with an invisible wall. I groaned and moved on, and within a few short moments I was met with the irritation that caused me to quit the game: "This barrier is self-powered, you've got to find a way around it." I walked up to the barrier, and just to the right was a tunnel through some scaffolding. I moved towards it quickly as the robots surrounded me. It was about a foot too short, and here I am, a cybernetic soldier with permanently fixed knees and apparently a spine as well. I couldn't duck under to get through, and the robot army behind me quickly ripped me to pieces.\n\ntl;dr: If you are a sadist with games that give you plenty of false hope, buy it now, don't even wait for a sale. If you are anything else, please let my experience be enough for you.","January 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","0"

The advertisements in particular are great: an original take that preserves a very cyberpunk feel.  But that's the end of what's good about Hard Reset.\n\nThere is little variety in enemies; what variety exists is largely about the size of their hitbox and what kind of weapon they use.  Every combat area is a predictably-sized arena with artificial sawtooths to prevent retreat, and doors that prevent continuing until all the bad guys are dead.  Many of the enemies have a lot more health than I personally find enjoyable.\n\nThe protagonist's weapons lack a certain oomph, maybe because all ten(?) of them are supposed to be flavors of only two transforming weapons-- so for instance, your proximity mine uses effects that look an awful lot like your plasma gun.  An experience point system unlocks new weapons and upgrades, but of course encourages upgrades, which in turn discourages variety; meanwhile, the fact that there's only two kinds of ammunition prevents the authors from meaningfully using ammunition to prompt weapon switching.\n\nA lot of factors conspire to limit engagement with the game.  The voice acting sounds like the friends-and-family-of-the-devs style.  The story isn't the focus, of course, but what little exists doesn't help anything.  Occasional  trace-the-pipe puzzles and poor signposting wreak havoc with the pace.\n\nOverall, this plays like a very very high-quality mod for a game ten or fifteen years old.  Which is a little like, "Excellent cinemetography, considering that it's made for public access cable."  Might be of some interest for its take on cyberpunk, but it's not very engaging as a game.","February 4, 2014","false","6.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

This is an extremely generic first person shooter that lacks many expected features of the genre. You can’t even duck, which should tell you something about how the game is meant to be played. It’s all mindless run and gun action. I wouldn’t mind so much if the game wasn’t so uninteresting. Blowing up wave after wave of the same robots is, simply put, boring. The cyberpunk environments are dull and repetitive, and the weapon loadout is quite limited. There is an upgrade system for the weapons and armor, but it’s a pain to navigate. Some of the upgrades are fun for a while, but they still don’t provide enough variety to hold my interest. The story is expectedly poor and primarily told through comic book style cutscenes. These cutscenes help hide the otherwise lengthy load times, but that means you can’t skip them. With a multitude of quality first person shooters to choose from, there’s no reason to waste any time with a game as simple and predictable as Hard Reset.","February 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","2"

At least it was free in the bundle.\n\nI give them the boss fights though, even on the easy level, that was a lot of shooting and moving around.","January 11, 2015","false","6.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futtbuckin/recommended/98400/","futtbuckin","Charlie McRapekit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futtbuckin/","366 products in account","Hard Reset is an intense first-person shooter that takes place in a futuristic cyberpunk envoirnment and city. To play it, you're going to want at least three things: A desire to shoot countless hordes of robots, patience of iron, and a pretty powerful graphics card. If you don't have one or more of these things, Hard Reset probably isn't for you.\n\nThis game has a really awesome art style, both the beautiful enviornments that you play in, and the cutscenes that play at the beginning of a level. The cutscenes themselves play like a sci-fi comic book, which I think is really neat, though most of the time it doesn't feel like there's much story involved. The gameplay itself is oldschool right down to the bare bones, sort of a hybrid of painkiller, doom and serious sam. You'll engage in plenty of hardcore combat with all sorts of robots that appear throughout the levels and try to kill them by any means necessary, whether it be mowing them down with your weapons, or blowing up enviornmental hazards around them, ranging from barrels, electrical machines, cars...you get the idea.\n\nProbably one of the coolest features of Hard Reset is that, unlike most oldschool shooters, you don't actually collect new guns. Instead, you get to power up the weapons and gear the game starts you out with by collecting Nanos, then going to upgrade machines to select the upgrades you desire. For example, you can upgrade your assault rifle to be things like a shotgun and an rpg, and you can improve the quality of your armor and health, to name a few things. Nanos can be collected by killing enemies, looking throughout the levels, and finding secrets by looking high and low for them and blowing up walls.\n\nEven though I really like Hard Reset, I'll admit it's not for everyone---it can get rather frustrating at times, since enemies often appear in swarms really quickly and can often result in stupid deaths (though to be fair, I AM playing on insane difficulty), and the game does have very little story (mostly just kill machines and complete objectives). Very highly recommended for those who love intense oldschool gameplay and cyberpunk/sci-fi games, though. 3.5/5.0","June 1, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has done wonders  to bring that feeling back, only now with a new coat of paint of todays tech to sweeten the deal. I suppose there is a story but i did not pay to much attention to it, I seemed to pay more attention to the surroundings. There are holo-ad signs( which can be used offensivly by shooting them) which give you a glimps of what might the inhabitants might have filled there days with. You run through city scapes filled with parked( or abandoned) cars ( which can be destroyed hurting you or enemies) , many nooks and crannies to root around in to find secrets, blimps and other air vehicles flying over head, and announcments looped through loud speakers further adding to the meat of the world. You have two weapons , or should i say weapon types; being that either one can be upgraded to have an added mode to it. the types are solid rounds and energy munitions; bothe can be upgraded to fill the rolls of straight shooter( solid : assault rifle with zoom secondary/ energy : pulse rifle with charge blaster secondary) close range crowd control ( solid : shot gun with multy shot burst secondary / energy : multi arc electricity emiter with stun burst for secondary). All can be upgraded at stations that are littered about levels, you must spend an upgrade point( gained by filling an upgrade bar to full by picking up packets from either downing baddies or finding them in secret areas) on either of the 2 gun types to unlock each of their modes and some slight upgrades for each of the modes, or a point on your armor un locking many bonuses like more health , more damage soak, or faster regen of sprint. even the upgrade stations do not take you out of the world, the staton's menu is diplayed as a holographic projection, and your cross hair turns into a curser for making selctions. If you want to back out of the upgrade menu just walk away from the station and continue mayhem. All in all this is some great adreniline pumping action with a very fleshed out world to blow stuff up in.","June 1, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The protagonist played is none other than a secret police type, send on missions to halt and uncover infiltrations and deal with them in a violent manner.\n\nSound great? Sadly, the storyline is a convoluted mess bordering on incomprehensible.  Having finished the game, I'm still not sure what was accomplished and what was going on.  With that major flaw aside, Hard Reset is an absolute blast, and captures the essence of the cyberpunk genre proficiently.\n\nYou're given 2 weapons from the word go, and as you progress through the game, granted fairly frequent upgrade to bolster their capabilities and fire modes, rather than replace them with completely new guns. We're not talking minor changes either. but rather unlocking things like charged blast to electro-mortar to smart-gun style upgrades, which you'll find yourself rapidly switching between mid-fight to use deadly combo's to turn otherwise difficult enemies into scrap.\n\nThe game starts out relatively difficult, almost to the point of being merciless, so if you're struggling, remember that in the future, lots of the cars, terminals and other machinery are highly volatile and explore with the gentlest of encouragement from your arsenal.\n\nWhile the graphics are great, and the holographic style waepon upgrade interface is pretty cool,  I find it hard to overwhelmingly recommend this game due to the poor narrative. But, if you're the type to skip cutscenes, you'll probably find this worth your while.  There's potential here in the setting, so lets hope the developers make the most of it in any sequels.","July 13, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Try getting it on sale, it's not a AAA title but it's an easy to get into game. I would pay up to £7 for this game now.\nTook me about 8 hours to complete. Over the top Cyberpunk theme in this fun little FPS, single player. Run, shoot, upgrade gear, shoot, complete level. I would compare it to Half Life 2, without the big puzzles and story. Also to Duke Nukem for the over the top destruction, hidden secrets, and small waves of enemies to defeat with lots of explosive barrels and such. Nothing amazing for the plot, I watched the cut scenes (which only occur as loading screens) but I didn't care much for it. A rebel is fighting against some company or something.\n\nFairly easy on Normal with a little challenge as you find a new enemy or boss battle. The Boss battles are epic, huge beasts to take down, really feels challenging, however they all follow a rule of "find a weak spot then mash your ammo at the glowing orange bits". As for the last boss, without any spoilers, it felt a bit underwhelming, it didn't feel like a final boss, infact an enemy earlier on in the game called Atlas was much tougher. Very nice looking game too, the art style and graphics quality really give the impression of a well worked into game, maybe with a huge budget. Runs well on my PC compared to other games of similar graphics quality. I must stress though that the story is quite dull and the progression in the game is small, just made by upgrading at a station like you would imagine in Dead Space. But I enjoyed it, got 3 days of play out of it, bought it for probably £1 ages ago and just installed it thinking I should give it a go. It's the poor man's Destiny.","September 11, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked getting back to the game.\n\nI've seen some complaints about the use of weapons in this game. At first it was strange how they have arranged the bullet-type weapons and energy-type weapons separately under Q and E buttons. Each type has many weapon variations under the number buttons. Once you get the hang of it, it works out smoothly and in my opinion the system is actually quite neat.\n\nI played the game and the Exile DLC through on normal difficulty. The game offered a some more challenging areas and some that I could have tried on hard difficulty. The harder parts did not feel unfair though and I was challenged to try again after getting killed. I also like the upgrade system in which by gathering nano-crates gives you options to upgrade weapons armor etc. Also the statistics after each level were interesting and give a reason to play the missions again.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game for fans of sci-fi shooters.","April 7, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This will probably lead to a lot of frustration as you barely have any room to maneuver around dozens of enemies running towards you or shooting at you. It doesn't help much that the main character runs so slow and his running dash is so short and pathetic it doesn't help at all. Therefore dodging enemy attacks becomes a game of sheer luck rather than skill.\nAnother negative thing for me in this game was the weapons system. You have 2 main weapons that can be upgraded to embody more shooting modes for different situations (e.g. your standard assault rifle can be upgraded to also accompany a rocket luncher and a shotgun etc.) The problem arises when you are in the heat of battle and need to switch between different weapons in order to utilize their abilities in combat situations. Since this is a fast and frentic game very similar to older shooters, it becomes really awkward to switch from a weapon to another one and THEN selecting the desired shooting mode with the mouse wheel. Sometimes you barely have time to think because of all the chaos happening on screen and switching guns can lead to untimely deaths.\nThe graphics look gorgeous albeit repetitive. The DLC included extends the base game by a few levels which look different and are a welcome addition to the abruptly ending vanilla game.\nSound and music are very nicely done and fit the action perfectly.\n\nYou should definitely not expect any coherent story in this game. This is a action shooter at heart and doesn't give two pennies about storyline.\n\nMake sure you use environmental explosives and traps as much as you can because they will save your life and help you defeat the baddies with more ease.\n\nAll in all, I can describe this game as Serious sam in the future and with much more cramped, tight levels. It'll take around 10 hours to beat counting the Exile DLC. Base game will take around 6 hours to complete. It got a bit repetitive for me halfway through because all you are basically doing is pushing switches to get to the next area to kill more enemies. there are a couple of boss fights that are amusing if nothing else.\n\nIf you know what you're going in for, then expect your adrenaline glands to pump non stop. This is a very solid shooter that knows what it wants to be and what it wants to do is take you back to the sweet haydays of golden shooters of past while relentlessly challenging you with every encounter. A casual gamer will find passing some of the levels pretty hard.","April 29, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These are the only real problems these reviewers actually have with the title.  To them, I say "Phooey".\n\nHard Reset is a wonderful arcade-y shooter game that's focused on obliterating a lot of robots while moving, shooting and running constantly through a very well designed futuristic city.  It's incredibly linear with the occasional small alleyway or fence that hides some bonus points, but this is perfect for how the game is meant to be.  It keeps you going and shooting, and the enemies get varied at the correct times, and they spawn in the perfect places to make for a challenging and fun experience.  I love the world, I love the feel, I love the art (especially the city), and I love the game.\n\nQuick note:  The story is extremely weak, but the story shouldn't be the focus of a game of this type anyway.\n\nSolid 8 or 9/10.

Then those nice developers let me update my version to Extended. A nice add on. The graphics are high end, very high end that surprisingly doesn't eat your graphic card up alive. But this is also part of the problem with this game... there's so much detail that the screen gets that cluttered feel, granted everything looks great, great but cluttered. This game allows you you tackle enemies the way you want by allowing to upgrade your guy the way you want. Suggestion, go firepower first or this game will punish you for it, but then again you you want that extra challenge... Started this game on easy and beat it. Turned it up a level. Liked the new challenge until 4/5th of the way through and a certain level became impossible. Too many hard hitters at once that can kill yea in a couple hits. Quit and went back to easy being I already died on on that certain spot for hours. Everything in this game screams at you from the developers that we are going over the top for you. Somehow, still this game feels average to me, even wih all the eye candy in here. Some parts shine and others look like a beautiful mish mash. This game gets an A for effort but still falls to average to me. There isn't much wrong here that will disapoint most in buying this game. The developers tried extremely hard but instead of that gold ring, they got brass. The game is fun to play, it just wont blow your socks off. Quality is here but to bring this game up a notch, sometimes less is more when used in preportion- the graphics I mean. But I can't fault them for trying and this isn't a bad game, definitely worth a play and my recommendation.","April 13, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found that playing on normal was very fair and well paced up until the Exile DLC (at which point I got my butt served to me on a silver platter) so I’m sure the replayability into the hard, insane and heroic modes is there.\nIf you’re not a fan of the modern military shooter, join the club.

I started the game and I instantly saw that the engine is one of a kind. They did a really good job, the game looks fantastic. The gameplay struck me as enjoyable, the upgrades that you can put on your character and on your weapons are striking. But once you get deeper and deeper into the game - you start to miss the violence. There are basically 6-7 types of robots (that's it, you need to kill robots), and there is no blood. The environmental kills are cool, but there are only 3-4 types of them. The game turns into a repetitive boredom very fast. So... the music. As good as the main menu track is, the ingame music sucks badly. It's just terrible. And the game's final boss fight is lame. The developers state that this is an old-school FPS. I know what an old-school shooter FPS is. Hard Reset isn't one.","December 12, 2011","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game basically feels like an old school shooter so no running into cover waiting for your shield/health to regen like a little girl.  It feels very old school which is going to either be a good or bad thing depending on your preference in shooters.  How the weapons work is actually pretty well thought out.  You essentially get 2 weapons, BUT those 2 weapons each have 5 different firing modes (so 10 weapons basically...) so switching to one weapon adds the modes to 1,2,3,4,5 on the keyboard and vice versa.  You can upgrade your weapons however you want, so you can make your favorite guns even more powerful and give them new firing modes.  The game also looks extremely pretty since it was developed ONLY for the pc.  No need to worry about the usual console port issues.  The story is pretty bad however, but it is good cheap fun.","February 5, 2012","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Weapon management in particular feels both unique and practical as you have to manage two basic guns/weapon trees. Those guns "branch out" to various others when upgraded in certain stations that are scattered throughout each map. Transition between firing modes/guns is instant (accompanied by a weapon morph animation a-la Vanquish) . Each difficulty lvl feels just right. A check point system is utilized (and well implemented imo as each point is well placed). New Game + mode is available (allowing you to start a new campaign with all your upgrades equiped). 45 upgrades in total. Visuals are incredible and interaction with the environments is encouraged. Short length (3 full progressive playthroughs on nrml,hard, insane approx 17hrs), a weird sprint mechanism (takes some time to get used to) and an out-of-place score (sounds like the Inspector Gadget theme at times) are its main drawbacks.","January 4, 2012","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futtbuckin/recommended/98400/","futtbuckin","Charlie McRapekit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futtbuckin/","366 products in account","Hard Reset is an intense first-person shooter that takes place in a futuristic cyberpunk envoirnment and city. To play it, you're going to want at least three things: A desire to shoot countless hordes of robots, patience of iron, and a pretty powerful graphics card. If you don't have one or more of these things, Hard Reset probably isn't for you.\n\nThis game has a really awesome art style, both the beautiful enviornments that you play in, and the cutscenes that play at the beginning of a level. The cutscenes themselves play like a sci-fi comic book, which I think is really neat, though most of the time it doesn't feel like there's much story involved. The gameplay itself is oldschool right down to the bare bones, sort of a hybrid of painkiller, doom and serious sam. You'll engage in plenty of hardcore combat with all sorts of robots that appear throughout the levels and try to kill them by any means necessary, whether it be mowing them down with your weapons, or blowing up enviornmental hazards around them, ranging from barrels, electrical machines, cars...you get the idea.\n\nProbably one of the coolest features of Hard Reset is that, unlike most oldschool shooters, you don't actually collect new guns. Instead, you get to power up the weapons and gear the game starts you out with by collecting Nanos, then going to upgrade machines to select the upgrades you desire. For example, you can upgrade your assault rifle to be things like a shotgun and an rpg, and you can improve the quality of your armor and health, to name a few things. Nanos can be collected by killing enemies, looking throughout the levels, and finding secrets by looking high and low for them and blowing up walls.\n\nEven though I really like Hard Reset, I'll admit it's not for everyone---it can get rather frustrating at times, since enemies often appear in swarms really quickly and can often result in stupid deaths (though to be fair, I AM playing on insane difficulty), and the game does have very little story (mostly just kill machines and complete objectives). Very highly recommended for those who love intense oldschool gameplay and cyberpunk/sci-fi games, though. 3.5/5.0","June 1, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has done wonders  to bring that feeling back, only now with a new coat of paint of todays tech to sweeten the deal. I suppose there is a story but i did not pay to much attention to it, I seemed to pay more attention to the surroundings. There are holo-ad signs( which can be used offensivly by shooting them) which give you a glimps of what might the inhabitants might have filled there days with. You run through city scapes filled with parked( or abandoned) cars ( which can be destroyed hurting you or enemies) , many nooks and crannies to root around in to find secrets, blimps and other air vehicles flying over head, and announcments looped through loud speakers further adding to the meat of the world. You have two weapons , or should i say weapon types; being that either one can be upgraded to have an added mode to it. the types are solid rounds and energy munitions; bothe can be upgraded to fill the rolls of straight shooter( solid : assault rifle with zoom secondary/ energy : pulse rifle with charge blaster secondary) close range crowd control ( solid : shot gun with multy shot burst secondary / energy : multi arc electricity emiter with stun burst for secondary). All can be upgraded at stations that are littered about levels, you must spend an upgrade point( gained by filling an upgrade bar to full by picking up packets from either downing baddies or finding them in secret areas) on either of the 2 gun types to unlock each of their modes and some slight upgrades for each of the modes, or a point on your armor un locking many bonuses like more health , more damage soak, or faster regen of sprint. even the upgrade stations do not take you out of the world, the staton's menu is diplayed as a holographic projection, and your cross hair turns into a curser for making selctions. If you want to back out of the upgrade menu just walk away from the station and continue mayhem. All in all this is some great adreniline pumping action with a very fleshed out world to blow stuff up in.","June 1, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A sci-fi themed game in an action-oriented/arcade style gameplay. It would have seemed to put together all of the stereotypes but, after sometime from its debut, I decided to try and play it; found on some sale for a very few bucks. The graphic and the art style are sleek and polished; the cyber-filled world quite unique and well made; the sound compartment surprisingly well done. So, you're gonna ask "what about the downsides"? 'cause I can say, they're there.\n\nThe game's self-professed "old school" (and I shall open a discussion topic about that, perhaps) mechanics are just dull and flat as you basically run through a mega-hallway - that is the world it-self - divided into chunks of areas, that I'm gonna call "arenas", where you are flooded by hordes of enemies and you don't have an "escape route": the door/passage/you-say-it that you've just passed through will suddenly close/crumble/whatever and you'll have to figure out how to kill'em all without dying. That's wouldn't be of any concern if played at low-level but, if like me, you play through a hard difficulty level.. prepare to die and suffer a lot: enemies will just take forever to die, literally; even the smaller-cuty ones, will lasts for too much what you'd expect. Boss fights? Repetitive - as every other fights - and frustrating.\n\nLuckily, here comes the last aspect of the game and a positive one. "Customization". Yes, you can upgrade yourself and your arsenal by using exp points you'll earn killing enemies and picking up special bonuses, let's call'em that way, and spending them at some "upgrade-machine vendor" integrated in the world. You basically starts (and finish) with two weapons, one for each kind like "standard" ammo and power energy; each of them can be upgraded into 4 more weapons for a total of 5 per kind. Every weapon has a primary and secondary mode as well an upgrade. So, you'll have plenty of variety to experiment with though you'll end up using the same two model that best suites you. You can also upgrade your armor/health/utilities, like more health, more resistance to damage, and on..\n\nSo, by the end what happens? Well, later on - and not too late - in the game there were times in which I just wanted it to be over; too repetitive in the mechanics and playing it on hard's just too hard: it is not the smart hard, at all, it is the frustrating one that ruin it all. The world itself is well presented; quite varied plus the good points I've already explained.. but the negatives' quite ruined the feast as the game ain't balanced at all. At all. Summing it all up:\n\nGraphic: 8*\nArt: 8\nSound: 8\nMusic: 6**\nGameplay: 6\nUniqueness: 8\n\nPartial: 7.3\n\nF.F.: 75%***\n\n*not latest gen but still very appealing\n**bland, uninspired and repetitive music score\n***Frustration Factor: game's far too unbalanced on higher difficulty levels but some situations give relief upon completion","October 27, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just don't understand it. However, the characters in the game seem to know what's going on, and I'm more than happy to let them handle the major decisions. I'll just shoot the robots, thanks very much.\n\nThe plot is revealed to the player via cutscenes which have a pretty great animated comic-book style to them, bringing back fond memories of games like Max Payne.\n\nGameplay is fun. The environments are impressive and reward player exploration. They have no shortage of things to blow up, and no shortage of things to blow them up with, because instead of picking up guns along the way, you start the game with both of the guns you will ever need, one gun that fires bullets, and one that fires plasma. When you pick up "nano" (the currency), a bar on your HUD will fill. When you reach 100%, it gives you one unlockable slot at an upgrade point, which gives your guns extra functionality. Buy a shotgun slot, and your gun gains the option to fire like a shotgun, etc. Thus you can scroll through each weapon's abilities like you would in any other FPS.\n\nIt's a very neat concept, and one that comes in handy during intense firefights - of which there are plenty - switching between the plasma guns and the bullet guns to gain any advantage against the robot swarms.\n\nThe music is pretty awesome too, and really sets the tone of this cyberpunk futuristic sprawling mega-tropolis. Not being too familiar with this sort of music, some of the tracks that play during combat remind me a bit of Pendulum, which I like.\n\nVisually, the game is a treat. The city looks grungy and run down, with worn paint and chipped metal contrasting nicely with garish neon and arcing electric bolts here and there. There's no problem at all telling what's environment and what's enemy, like in some games I've played, so you won't get your health chipped away by something you just can't see.\n\nThis all sounds pretty great, right? So what's bad about the game?\n\nWell in my first sentence, I said that you play a man with no knees. Well that's pretty accurate, as you CANNOT CROUCH in this game. This is pretty irritating when you feel like taking cover might be helpful, or when there's a chest-high gap in a fence that you can't POSSIBLY get past.\n\nThe most glaring example of this is probably in one of the warehouse levels, when a girder has fallen to approximately face height, blocking off a short path to the level exit. You don't even need to crouch to get past that. Just bend over by like five degrees. But no, you're forced down the other route that has explosions, fire, and angry robots just itching to taste your flesh.\n\nAnother thing that annoys me is that your guy can - and will - get ganked, usually by enemies called Gorillas, that charge-slam you ever few seconds. It becomes very easy to go from full health to dead, trapped in a corner, being beaten by Gorillas, which is where another one of my niggles joins in:\n\nNo quicksave/load. This kind of speaks for itself. Fast, frantic shooters like this NEED quicksave. In games like Alien Isolation, where not being able to save is legitmately part of the game, because the survival thing is supposed to be tense. In games like this, where you play a stompy god of hellfire, slowing down the fast-paced fun is irksome.\n\nWeapons. I really like the weapon system in this game, but it becomes very obvious quite early on that there is a right choice. That choice is the electric mortar. Area of effect attack instantly blows up the generic foot soldier robots, and saps the others. Switch that out with the grenade launcher, and you can very quickly turn the screen into an orgy of exploded robot parts. I've discovered no other combos of guns (as of yet) that can measure up in terms of fast, widespread, heavy damage.\n\n\nTo conclude: Hard Reset is a bloody fun game, that will keep you entertained for as long as you care to play it. It's most assuredly worth the asking price.","December 10, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A person, who's childhood was based in the 90s, will notice that this game is heavily inspired by the old-school classics like Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior - your health is displayed on your lower left corner along with your ammo and shield capacity. If you are not careful those attributes will get depleted and you'll simply die with no ammo or health.\n\n2)Digging a little deeper into the game - the game's story takes a backseat to it's gameplay. You are equipped with two guns which transform into several types and they can be upgraded throughout the game. This is the only modern mechanic implamented into the game. The game is powered by RoadHog Engine - there are impressive lighting effects, physics and decent textures, but the areas that you will visit are not verried. You'll visit the same industrial cyber-punk vistas, but from different angles.\n\n3) Final Verdict - Hard Reset dosen't set out to re-imagine the genre. It is a familiar shooter, that brings back good memories of the fun I used to have while playing the shooters of the 90s! A great nostalgia trip and challenge for the modern gamer! I give Hard Reset a 8/10! :)","May 8, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had to play on an easy level because you cannot save on your own.  You must use auto checkpoint saves which just made it too much to repeat big fights over and over again on a medium difficulty setting because of one mistake too many.  Most fun was accumulating enough NANO to buy upgrades but by the end I was never sure which weapon was best against what, and during an intense fight I wasn't sure half of the time which weapon I was even using or it's capabilities because they began to jell together.  For example, there are basicall 2 types of weapons - the regular kind and then an energy based weapon.  When both have a kind of grenade lobber - in the heat of battle I could not distinguish one from the other.  The story was an OK vehicle to transport you through the game while maintaining an adequate amount of self-awareness(why am I killing these machines again, oh right).  Most of the battle arenas were pretty cool and artfully well done graphics.  Overall, not a bad shooter.  I always keep an FPS current and handy, among other games I'm currently playing, for when I'm in the mood to kill stuff, and this game satisfied adequately.","July 7, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was not disappointed.\n\nI've only played about 6 hours of the game at the time of typing but it would be fair to say that the graphics are very good.  I love the fact that a lot of the environment is desctructible and causes a lot of explosions.  Hell, I can simply spen 5 minutes shooting explodable barrels and gas cannisters just to watch the explosion causing barrels to shoot into the air.  It would be fair to say therefore that the physics are top.\n\nThe storyline is okay.  And that's coming from me who has the attention span of a 5 year old and struggles to follow any story line.  The game is linear but not too restricting.  There are secret areas to find points that allow you to level up your kit.  I'm mainly using the gatling gun type thing.  Add a grenade launcher and mine placer/firer thing and it's a decent weapon.\n\nIt's quite difficult on normal difficulty and some of the end level bosses are difficult.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game, with good graphics and music score (forgot to mention that).","December 25, 2013","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This also suffer of "devs knew level" syndrome (or maybe it was intensional) its easy to play on second run but in first run its hard game, situations in game are hard only because you dont know what will happend but on second run its much more easier = you can prepare right weapon combinations and choose better position in combat. For me its game design and balance fail not a feature, others maybe view it as plus it depends on your choice. if it was on me Serious Sam, original Painkiller even old Quake or Unreal are better choice.\n\nin my opinion would make this game better:\n\n-Faster weapon switching (50% or more)\n-Faster movement and dodging of player\n-more refine weapon mode\n-more polish on game balance / level design to make this game little bit more playable on first run\n\nthis would help to adapt in game situations on the fly and not die so often bacause of wrong weapon upgrades or slow weapon switching.","December 26, 2013","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One is an energy weapon, the other a conventional rifle: the energy weapon is upgraded into a rail gun, &c. while the rifle can be upgraded into an RPG, shotgun &c., with about 10 different weapons in total with most all having an alternate firing mode.

I had dismissed this game many times when it was first released, and I really regret that. I picked it up just after playing the new Shadow Warrior (from the same dev).\n\nThis is an absolute classic, old school FPS. The game is set in a stunningly designed cyberpunk future, that will have you staring at all the intricate details in the buildings... right until the waves of cyborg enemies start. Great weapon design, especially the subtle animations as you upgrade your firepower with new modules and switch between them, and all have a great kick to them.\n\nParticle effects, explosions, fire - every firefight is a visual delight, especially with elements of the environment aiding in the destruction.\n\nIf you are a fan of classic old school FPS, do not ignore this game. It's certainly worth its full asking price.","December 1, 2013","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I loved every minute of it. Honestly, it’s so refreshing to encounter a game that not only refuses to pull punches, but one that doesn’t have a problem with throwing a couple sucker punches to boot. Even the most basic enemies will swarm you with rotor and sawblades galore, and it’s immediately apparent upon entering the game that, protagonist or no, you are still only one big sack of organs ripe for robot destruction. The action is brutal, fast, and constant.\n\n","October 5, 2012","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What is refreshing is that each weapon is unlocked through the use of an upgrade terminal and each weapon is within the two starting weapons you use. They're kind of like multipurpose weapons. They even have transformation animations! It is not as scary as doom or quake, the robots don't give off a "horror" vibe. They look like those robots people strap weapons on in an arena.
