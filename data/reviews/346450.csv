Add a little bit of point & click style puzzle solving and place it all in an alternate film-noir universe, where mobsters fight with katana instead of guns. In the hands of a great developer, this could've been an indie classic. Instead we ended up with samurai_jazz.\n\nThe game takes place over five acts, where you need to collect items and press switches to unlock more sections of the level until you eventually find the key item you need to progress to the next act, fighting any thugs along the way. Enemies die in one hit, but so do you, so combat places emphasis on blocking and countering. All of this sounds fine on paper, problem is, it completely fails in its execution.\n\nThe game is frustratingly difficult. Enemy placement is done in such a sloppy manner. There were many instances where you'll enter a room and be completely surrounded by enemies making for plenty of cheap deaths. What makes this worse is enemies respawn anytime you re-enter a room you just cleared, making levels where you're forced to backtrack a chore to play through. Even worse, there are puzzle rooms where you have to press switches in the correct order or else you die. So, if you make a wrong choice, you’ll have to start all over again, killing the same enemies, and hoping the next switch you press is the correct one. As if the frustratingly tedious gameplay weren't bad enough on its own, the game also suffers from unresponsive controls. There were way too many times I was moving right and when I tried moving left, my character would just stand there and I end up getting killed.\n\nEven bad games are capable of immersing you in their story and setting if they’re interesting enough. Problem is, what little story that’s here is completely nonsensical. It starts with a guy committing seppuku before having you play as your character, who I assume is a detective. What exactly is the mystery here? The NPCs you interact with don't tell you anything other than "get me [key item] and I'll let you pass". The ending doesn't explain anything either. The Jazz soundtrack is decent but the slow tempo doesn't fit with the action on screen at all. Plus the tracks are way too short and get annoying very quickly. Graphically speaking, the character sprites look decent enough, but the backgrounds all look very samey. This is especially bad in the fifth act of the game where it's very easy to get lost in, oh and did I mention enemies respawn every time you re-enter a room?\n\nSamurai_jazz is a game full of great ideas, and not a single one of them works. It fails to take advantage of its unique setting, the gameplay (when it works) is frustrating, but above all else, it's just a bore to sit through. As another review already pointed out, this feels like a poorly made flash game straight out of Newgrounds. This game isn't worth the 99 cents and 2 hours I spent on it.\n\nIf I can end things on a slightly more positive note, developer Blaze Epic made a sequel/reimagining called Shin Samurai Jazz. The gameplay in that one actually looks a little more promising, so that’s something to consider at least.","February 1, 2015","false","2.0"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","38","47","3","3"

It's a sort of noirish action-adventure that would have trouble to impress people owning a famicom / NES back in '87.\n\nsamurai_jazz has this weirdly noir / chilled vibe about it, like reading a graphic novel at night in late summer - the meaning of it all escapes me, I got lost somehwere between [special cigarettes] and slashing samurai mobsters in half, maybe this game has a deeper meaning, a strong message about life and death or it is all a bunch of artsy baloney (my money is on the latter).\n\nWhat I am pretty certain about is the fact that the actual game is a stiff, clunky mess. The controls are annoyingly unresponsive (on a 360 controller), the hitboxes seem to be nonsensical and almost random (clear advantage given to the enemies since their attacks seemingly have a wider arc that connects while you gotta align yourself with the enemies you want to hit) and there is very little feedback to your actions.\n\nWhat's worse is the fact that enemies love to drop into background layers and attack you from there or you getting dropped into rooms with tons of enemies that storm you at once, with little space to navigate, making some rooms pretty tough unless you get lucky and clear a path before getting overwhelmed by unstoppable one-shot odds. Besides lots of combat against ever respawning enemies (if you leave a room, that is) you are doing inane fetch quests and asinine switch-puzzles (Act V was REALLY getting on my nerves towards the end). All for nothing though - there is never any sense of accomplishment, you are geting a few nonsensical lines of text at best or simply are able to venture forth into a new area or act.\n\nHonestly, this game feels like a waste of time to me. The music is pretty chill and might be worth it, but the game is certainly not. Don't.","February 15, 2015","false","2.2"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","32","44","2","2"

In terms of style I love it. The noir theme mix with samurai antics and jazz music in the background really sets the tone for a chill session of gaming...HOWEVER, this game is everything but chill and is pretty hard. Its all retro like so theres nothing to really tell you what to do execpt in the beginning, then comes the death after death after death after death battles where if you ♥♥♥♥ up, even when its not your fault, you die and have to start over in that scene again. Also since theres no saves if you rage quit (which trust me, you will rage quit it several times) you have to start all over from the beginning of an act. And after dying so many times on normal, which felt no different than hard, I put it on easy so I could just beat the game and even then it wasn't really easy. All in all this game was on sale for .24 cents when I got it and its .99 cents right now so even with its extreme amount of potential rage moments, I fell in love with the theme and would say its worth giving a short.

It came cheap, so that much is a plus. But I often found myself dying when I shouldn't have simply because the game didn't respond to my desired actions (such as not turning left when I wished to do so). While the fast pace of the game was nice, it felt very similar screen to screen. At times you had little time to even react before getting attacked. Leading to a "die 10 times to get the timing just right" type of gameplay. There was also the fact that there seems to be an odd bug in the game. Where when you enter a new zone at times the enemies will "slide" to just outside of the map or to a section of the map they shouldn't be able to get to. Which makes dealing with them that much more difficult.\n\nPersonally, there is stuff I like about the game but it's mostly negative for me. I wanted to like this game, it seemed like everything I would enjoy. But after about 1/2 an hour I just had enough of replaying parts over and over again because of silly issues causing my deaths.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/346450/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","3.5/10\nBlaze Epic just can’t learn from his mistakes. This is an action adventure game. Once again, it nails the look and music of retro games. Where it falls apart, just like ninjahtic games, is gameplay. It repeats same mistakes. You mash attack at guys and 1 hit them, but like those games you die in 1 hit. So if you clear a room and last guy kills you have fun restarting it all. Also like ninjahtic mind tricks, every time you re-enter a room all guys respawn. Why does he think that’s a good idea? Having you move in 3d plane but having 2d looking levels are confusing. Guys can attack you at weird angles and you have a huge hitbox. In opposite you can only attack if standing directly in front of them and cant attack in directions, and they have tiny hitboxes to attack. You die all the time. Enemy placement is terrible. 1 room you start in you’re surrounded by 3 guys that just instant kill you. Computer blocks 2/3 attacks but game doesn’t explain how you block and never seems to work. Can’t jump. Lots of backtracking. Controller doesn't work in menus and there is no mouse cursor available. No real story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitwright/recommended/346450/","bitwright","bitwright","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitwright/","1140 products in account","I can't  help but feel disappointed in samurai_jazz. The game starts out strong with an 8-bit film noir meets samurai art style and jazzy soundtrack that work well together to create an atmospheric vibe few games manage to pull off. The game's "tutorial" is comprised of a few of short messages graphitied on the walls and sides of buildings, and after learning the basic moveset I felt as though the combat system, which depends on proper positioning and timing, was both complex and deep.\n\nUnfortunately, player mobility is poorly implemented in this game. Getting the player character into the right position and facing the right direction is no easy task, and since combat relys so heavily on player position and facing - you can only attack or block in the direction you are facing - the hampered mobility lead to a number of deaths that felt more like the game's fault than my own.\n\nTo add insult to injury, not only are samurai_jazz's enemies more mobile than the player, easily able to flank the player when engaging with multiple enemies, but the game's enemy placement seems to be designed around the player's hampered movement. I lost count of the number of times I entered a room only to be immediately ambushed by 3 or more enemies moving in from different directions, often with my character facing away from all of them and open to attack. If I moved to block or attack one of them, the other two would attack from the sides and kill me. More often than not, the solution to one of these ambushes was to run around avoiding the enemies until I could get into a more favorable position.\n\nMany of the reviews here speak of the game's "challenge," but since the game's challenge depends on enemy placement and the player's hampered mobility, samurai_jazz feels less like a skill based game than a luck based one. The afforementioned entryway ambushes comprize most of the game's difficulty, but after they are taken care of, clearing out the remaining enemies in a room is fairly trivial as most of them attack one or two at a time, coming from the same direction, which makes them easy to block or kill.\n\nThe game's story is also lacking. The opening scene shows a samurai comitting harakiri (ritual suicide), after which the player character awakens from sleep. Given the film noir atmosphere, I expected to learn why this samurai decided to kill himself through the course of the game. Instead I was treated to a series of MacGuffin hunts straight out of a point and click adventure game, where I fetched cigarettes and bubble gum for strangers so they could let me pass through to the next alleyway. Why I wanted to get to the next allyway, I don't know. The game never bothers telling you why you're doing what you're doing.\n\nThe "story" culminates in an ending that has me thinking that this entire game was a troll. The ending felt as though the developer was brandishing a middle finger squarly in the face of any players masochistic enough to make their way through to the end of samurai_jazz. After all those BS deaths, hours spent wrestling with the controlls, and having to fetch cigarettes for the umpteenth time, the developers still manage to shout one last "FU" to the play at the very end. I won't spoil it for you, but someone posted a video of it if you're interested and want to save yourself a few hours of playing a bad game.","October 5, 2015","false","4.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But the setting doesn't actually figure into the game, other than...the clothing? When you start a new game, there are a couple of sentences of vague story that I can't even remember. Then you leave the starting room, and each room after that has half a dozen blade-wielding thugs or rokurokubi that attack you. Why do they attack? Who knows! How does the protagonist get away with slicing down dozens of people in broad daylight? Is the city (whatever city this is) that far gone?\n\nThe real problem, though, is the gameplay. You go into a room and try to cut down all the enemies before they cut YOU down. This requires finicky timing and control. When you die (not if, when) you start over from the beginning of the room. This is a good thing, as it means you lose very little time in your attempts to clear the room. It only takes a couple minutes to die 50 times in the same room. Of course, that really just means you rage quit sooner.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but...it's just not fun.\n","July 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/346450/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","This is one of the worst games I've recently played. On almost every level is does something very obviously wrong!\n\nI had my eye on Blaze Epic for a while, seeing that he released quite a lot of games following a similar vibe. I was interested, so I recently bought them all in a bundle. I started from the beginning: samurai_jazz.\n\nThe concept is appealing to me. It reminds of older animes like Cowboy Bebop, marked the its jazz soundtrack and a very distinct "samurai" character. So yeah, I was eager to try it!\n\nUnfortunately, it is very, VERY primitive, and has some issues that just show how amateur the developer was -- and hurts the game a lot.\n\nI didn't finish the game. I pulled my way through the first 3 chapters, but quit at the 4th (out of five) out of principle. I'll get into it later.\n\n\nIt follows many oldschool approaches: respawning enemies when you leave rooms, very basic controls, small levels/rooms, etc.\nThe enemies also have distinct patterns of attack, and they're easily identifiable, which is good.\n\nThe first thing that's awful is how the game controls. Dear God... Everything is so sticky!\nFor example, when you collide with something, you can move. You need to stop pressing everything, and then move only in the opposite direction. You know, in a standard game, if you moved diagonally against a vertical wall, the character should still be able to slide up/down the wall, right? In a way, going around the obstacle. I hope the point is clear. In this game, you're just stuck. It's infuriating, and one of the most basic movement concepts one should learn...\n\nThen, there's the restart. When you die, you usually restart right at the top of the room. The problem is this -- you need to press a button to restart. Then, you need to press whatever button again to start moving. It's a big freakin' deal, since enemies are always very close to you. The game doesn't register is a button is pressed, only if it was pressed at that moment. It would be good, for example, if I pressed the right arrow to restart, and the character moved to the right when the game began. Nope. It's a big annoyance, believe me.\n\nAs I mentioned, enemies start very close to you. They also 1 hit you. And they're also grouped in a very punishing manner, often makign death unavoidable until you managed to get them stuck.\n\n\nI don't want to go in detail into the combat. It is fairly cool, though. It's about having a stance to defend while you're standing still, and attacking when the time is right. Positioning is also important. But, since the controls are awful, I couldn't enjoy it at all.\n\n\nI didn't enjoy the music, and graphically, it isn't anything good either. It's bland and not polished at all.\nThe story could be good, as the game goes for an interestingly cinematic style, especially in its framing. I like what it's trying to do. On the other hand, the whole game consists of getting "bubble gum" and "cigarettes" to random guys for them to let you pass. This, after you slaughter about 50 of them. But these, for some reason, you don't... Not welcome.\n\nFinally, the level design. This is was made me quit. Every level is just a big trap to keep you going. It's the whole "time for money" deal. The levels are designed in the worst way possible. You backtrack constantly, through room after room of respawnable enemies... And the combat is incredibly fragile, leading to immense frustrating.\nThis isn't all, though. The game has some sections reliant on you getting through spike that go up and down. The player has to find the safe place to stand. Cool. Except -- oh, wait, there are invisible traps! Restart...\nWait, wait, one final thing. This is where I quite, this is good. There's a room full of enemies, with 3 switches. After you kill all of the enemies (after several restarts), you press a switch. Oops, spikes come from below you, dead! Restart the room full of enemies. What happened? Oh, yeah, you need to choose the correct switch not to die. They're all identical, so good luck.\n\nIt's pure trial and error in the worst way possible. I didn't find it fun in any way.\n\n\nSo there you go. This is one of the most frustrated reviews I've written, I hope it reflects what kind of game it is.\nHopefully, his other games are better than this! I'm not that eager anymore, though...","August 29, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This game is quite enjoyable, actually, and it's defintely worth a couple of hours, especially for that money. Someone else bought this game for me, so it only made it better XD\n\nLet's go a little in depth here, okay? It might get a little spoilery, but there is not really that much to spoil. In no particular order:\n\nArt style: Lovely 8bit graphics. This could easily have been an NES classic. The characters look nice enough and you can distinguish the villians from the generic faceless NPC's. Most of the evildoers look like generic mobsters, minding their own business, until you come close and they draw their swords. Pretty cool.\n\nMusic: Repetative, but relaxing. The name of this game is Samurai_jazz, and it sure has a nice jazzy soundtrack. It's not something that will get on your nerves soon, mostly because you don't really have time to really listen to it.\n\nObjective: This game consists of 5 stages (and a prologue and an end stage), and you pretty much do the same thing for the first four stages: retrieve some items and bring it to the two guys blocking the end. Pretty straightforward, nothing too difficult about that.\n\nEnemies: This is where the game gets.. Weird.. As seen in the images above, there are the regular swordwielding mobsters, and some random fistfighters. Add to that a couple of firebreathing women with dragon like faces (I blame myself for not knowing this folklore >.>), giant red-colored clubwielders (common Japanese demons) and women with necks that stretch to the ceiling. The swords and clubs kill you instantly, so strike them before they strike you. The other opponents don't kill you instantly, but after a few hits, you're still dead. Somehow, the neckladies always managed to hit me before I hit them...\n\nGameplay: You walk into a room, filled with enemies, you die and then... you start back at the door. This game doesn't use lives or continues, and dying only resets the room. If you have pressed any buttons before dying, they are still pushed after revival, which helps. Your character can take a defensive stance and hop around to parry attacks, strike his sword and even climb small buildings. There are no power-ups, just your skills. You can play with either the arrow-keys or the WASD keys, which helps, I guess, but since you still have to use SHIFT, SPACEBAR and ENTER, you can't be too picky with where to place your hands.\n\nStory: The game starts with a prologue. Here we see a samurai commit suicide, the Harakiri way. Then, the game starts... It took me a while to figure out that you were still part of that samurai, his Yin, trying to conquer his Yang side.\n\nBoss: Stage 6 is the boss. You can swing your sword at him all you like, you won't be able to hit him by just slashing. Found that out after hitting him over 40 times :P He blocks all your attacks, so lunge at him! Be fast and he's as dead as can be. Yin has conquered Yang. And then Yang comes back and defeats Yin.... END... Did I miss something?\n\nWell there you have it. It's fun, but don't play too long or you'll get frustrated. Even on easy, some rooms can be veeery tricky :D Have fun!\n","February 28, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dizzydown/recommended/346450/","dizzydown","Dizzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dizzydown/","118 products in account","Samurai_Jazz is an action/adventure beat 'em up heavily inspired by NES games. Way more so than most retro games, in fact, down to the obtuse game design. The game pegs itself as a hack 'n slash noir, and I do love the idea of a noir samurai, but the story is entirely incomprehensible. I'm not meaning to say that it's convoluted, just that it's impossible to actually see. Your character makes vague references on occasion, and at the end of the game you fight an evil version of yourself. There's no direct statement as to what's going on or what you're doing, and it feels like a game poorly translated from another language. I supposed that adds to the retro, though.\n\nThe game design fairs a lot better than the narrative, setting up each room of enemies as a puzzle. Which enemy needs taken out first, what's the most efficient way to kill them all without getting cut down yourself? The game forces you to ask these questions the more you get into the game. This is only aided with the game's block mechanic, which allows you to strafe and parry at the cost of your movement speed. Combat requires immensely fast reflexes and an analytical mind. You will die, a lot.\n\nThe design also suffers from some noticeable setbacks, however, such as an inconsitent design for the most basic enemy: the samurai. They sometimes block your attacks, and sometimes don't. There's no rhyme or reason as to when they do block, and I've tried relentlessly to find an exploit. The only safe means to attack them appears to be parrying back and forth until they give in, but this isn't ideal when many of the rooms require you to destroy samurai quickly, lest you be destroyed by other enemies. It's also very easy to exploit the AI's field of vision, allowing you to lure out enemies one at a time, when they're meant to be faced as a group.\n\nEven considering all of that, I think Samurai_Jazz is worth a look, especially considering its price. It nails the retro game feel far better than plenty of other games I've played. I definitely felt like I was sitting down and pouring my afternoon into an old, obtuse NES game, for better or worse.","June 12, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really do like the relaxed soundtrack, the graphics and artwork, and most of the mechanics.

This is not even that prominent, so it doesn't really matter. As with sound, no complaints with the ost, but the sfx get burned into your ears the longer you play.
