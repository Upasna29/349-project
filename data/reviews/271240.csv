The complete lack of a combat system revolutionizes the RTS genre and feels alien, yet the core mechanics can be understood within 30-45 minutes of play. The interaction of the game sytems is complex, and mastery and strategy will take a lot of time to develop.\n\nYou play one of four factions, each with different bonuses and penalties. It is vital to play to your factions strengths, because you are severely resource constrained and must make difficult decisions about how to expand.\n\nYou interact with other factions in five ways: the map, auctions, the stock market, the black market, and the market.\n\nOn the map, you compete for resources and tile placement. Taking a key tile from another player can be enormously damaging by preventing adjacency bonuses.\n\nIn auctions, you bid against other players for a special bonus. This is the most "head-to-head" aspect of the game. Depending on game options, you are not constrained to bidding with cash on hand. Instead, you can go into debt to purchase the item. If you arent careful, you might win an auction to your overal detriment.\n\nOn the black market, you purchase attack powers. These seem to suck, though perhaps I just don't understand how to use them effectively yet. You are very rate limited in how quickly you can purchase these powers, they go up in price quickly, and they are usually very weak. Disabling a tile for 60 seconds is painful, but doesnt seem to be enough to cause any long term damage.\n\nOn the stock market, you buy and sell ownership stakes in each player's faction. You win by forcibly buying out the other players.\n\nAnd finally the market. You buy and sell resources, and your actions affect the price of the resource. In my view, a critical weakness of the game is that the market supplies unlimited resources. Resources are not supplied by other players; instead, the market steadily raises prices. One consequence of this is that there is no resource tech race - you can buy any resources at the start of the game, which really break the idea that you are a startup colony on mars. You also get no real benefit from being the first to supply another resource.\n\nThe game also gives you very limited insight into the price elasticity of demand - how much price will change in response to a purchase or sale. This is probably because there isn't a "real" market system. In order to allow you to buy an unlimited amount of resources on the market, the game must model its own price elasticity of demand curve. This is contrived and can fall out of sync with the specifics of each game. You also have no insight into the global supply of a given resource - there is no way to answer the question "Is this resource cheap because no one needs it or because everyone is producing a surplus?" Perhaps if you had some way to view the global aggregate stockpile of each resource, this could be improved.\n\nBecause of the way the market functions and the lack of insight into its details, it doesn't quite feel like you are playing with other players. Again, maybe this is just due to my inexperience.\n\nThere are a couple UI issues:\n* An easy way to see the space market price for goods.\n* An easy way to find your buildings/tiles on the map.\n* Graphics performance is ok, but not good.\n\n\nOverall, I'm still pretty excited about this game. Its a new idea in RTS. It greatly reduces micromanagement compared to other RTS. It needs polish, but I think its going to make for some amazing multiplayer matches.\n\n","February 12, 2015","true","7.2"," 300 of 337 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","300","337","4","6"

A New Kind of RTS.\n\nUh huh. Well, they've certainly succeeded. But does it work ? And is it actually new ?\n\nIn the main it does not work and is not actually new. When you stop and look at what it's doing you realise it's not that far away from any of the Railroad Tycoon games - except there is no railroad building or locomotive managing here.\n\nSo that comparison bears some inspection. In RT you ship goods around to make money, buy stocks, bid on auctioned inventions, buy industries all in a goal to buy out your opponents.\n\nIn OTC you ship goods around to make money, buy stocks, bid on auctioned things all in a goal to buy out your opponents.\n\nSound familiar ?\n\nThe difference here ( apart from one being set on a green playing field and one being set on a red playing field ! ) is that whilst in RT the shipping and management of that shipping forms a large part of the challenge in the game, in OFC its abstracted - build your resource producing building, and you're done. The shipping just "happens".\n\nWith the shipping abstracted the challenge in the game for a player lies elsewhere. But. Uh. Where ? Choosing what building to build next ? That's it ?\n\nWhat's left is a very thin game - one which comes down to cracking the (simple) puzzle of what build order you should build buildings in - whether to skip some, concentrate in others and so on. In fact this is pretty much the economical part of the RT games. There's literally nothing else to do in OTC however - apart from a bit of sabotage, which by and large comes down to paying X dollars to knock out Y building for Z seconds. Call it an EMP blast. Dynamite. An uprising. The upshot is largely the same.\n\nGiven a relatively simple resource / building tree in the game ( it's a short game ) there is no complexity there either in figuring out what sneaky specialisations you can bust out or great economical wizardry you can pull off. This is definitely at the lighter end of the resource manipulation gaming tree.\n\nAlso, because of the target of the game design to make a short economic RTS based game, you are never going to get into an empire building, economic engine developing kind of position that world building and economic building players typically like. This is all about getting in, making your fast bucks, and buying everyone else out in quick order. So for those that *like* those kind of economic world building games,  this game isn't going to float your boat either.\n\nThere is much made of "every game being different" and amazing replayability, which boils down to the map being random, resources being strewn around the map randomly, and depending what small build orders people build, the price of some goods being different. Think random map creation in Railroads. Or Civ. But. It doesn't actually have a huge impact on your gameplay here - because the bit where you interact with the world is largely abstracted - you just choose what to build where. So no matter the world, or the players, you will still be sitting down every time and making a quick decision about which 3 or 4 key buildings to build in which order. Sure others can impact some of those decisions, but really, it's not going to have you in knots of chess like deliberation. It's going to have you reaching to spam the sabotage and buy shares  buttons.\n\nDespite all that I've enjoyed my time with the game, I appreciate the attempted design of the game, I like the martian theme ( which is just fluff ) but it really at this point strategically, tactically, whatever has no legs at all - its an interesting experiment, its largely met its goals, but it doesnt make for a great replayable game.\n\nIf you are into the board game sphere, then this game is like a super light and simple Euro - and probably wouldn't hold your attention for more than a couple of games.\n\nOne last point, the price of this game is wayyyyy too high for what you get. No way is this a premium price game, and I would say unless you either don't care about how you spend your gaming bucks, or have a desperate need to buy this game, I would avoid.","April 17, 2015","false","15.9"," 342 of 411 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","342","411","8","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexspeed/recommended/271240/","alexspeed","Alexspeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexspeed/","6187 products in account","THIS REVIEW IS OUTDATED - It covered the first version of the Early Access Release.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis Review is negative, but judging the potential of further development in, it could be positive for the finished game. It is made shortly after the early access release on steam and it might get updated at a later point.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first thing you need to know is that this game is not an economic strategy build-your-empire game, like the Anno games or Railroad Tycoon, or certain lesser well known games in that niche. This game is not slow, and the building up your empire part is pretty shallow compared to other such games.\n\nBut what is it then?\n\nIts a kinda unique thing, the closest game to compare it to is probably M.U.L.E. from the 80´s, but as i never played that myself, i cant say how much it resembles this old classic. It is a real-time economics strategy game, on the backdrop of Mars.\n\nSo the mechanics are that you build up your base (one of 4 factions) by upgrading it, harvesting different resources and processing them into other products plus eventual doing research and managing the black market, all while competing with several other players for the market and resources. Your aim is to make huge profits and buy out your competitors on the stock market while they try to do the same.\n\n\nWhat state is it in? (15-02-2015)\n\nIt is a well functioning Beta product at the point of writing this i would say. There are issues with the pacing of the game and with the gameplay itself. I also had 2 or 3 crashes within my playtime. I did not try the Multiplayer part yet.\n\nThe most aggravating thing right now is the buyout mechanic, in which the AI just piles up the money and then all of a sudden within a few moments buys up all your stock, which means "Game Over" to you. There are popup warnings about those stock buyouts, but most often they simply happen too fast to prevent them.\n\nOverall the game feels not much fun to me right now. The tutorials are a joke, especially the scientific one which i had to do way too often. They should rename the whole Tutorials section to "Challenge Modes". Because that's what they actually are, there isn't any proper explanation of game mechanics, besides of the tool tips and one entry text for each faction.\n\nYou will have to play a lot of games till you have a proper understanding of the game to be able to compete, the learning curve is high, even tough the mechanics themselves are not that complicated, because the game doesn't explain itself well enough.\n\nThere is a distinctive lack of feedback for the player to guide him. Everything that happens just gets thrown into the small feed in the lower right. You don't have time to really see the important things, or even know which are important. You can change the speed and also pause the game (in single player), but for me the game feels too fast paced to be enjoyable.\n\nThe UI is also a thing that needs work, it takes up way too much space right now, and its a bit laggy with accepting commands. The voice overs are some of the worst i have ever heard in any game, they definitely need to be completely redone. Music is okay tough.\n\nThe graphics are actually good and nice and communicate well with what they represent. Its kinda pretty and has a bit of a Settler vibe watching all the transports flying about delivering their goods. You just have never the time to actually watch and admire it, because the second you're idling and not planning your gameplay you are already at a disadvantage and loosing the game.\n\n\nThoughts on Gameplay:\n\nIn my opinion the building and production chains are too shallow and not deep enough for a proper strategy experience. There are 13 resources and about 20 buildings to manage. There are no real upgrades besides the Patent Lab where you can develop 11 different patents that change how your company operates, and the Engineering Lab which lets you increase the production rate of your buildings.\n\nThere is tactical strategy involved in the way you place your buildings (where and when) and in your decisions what to buy or sell, or when to upgrade your HQ or use the options of the Black Market, but this is not gameplay depth that can keep up with something like Civilization as an example. Overall its unsatisfying to discover that what looked like a giant red strategy planet from afar, is a strategy experience the size of a pea up close.\n\nA typical game session will take about 30 minutes or often less, and its always a frantic rush towards the start for the resources and to the end for the buyout of the competitors. Its clear to me that this was kept simple and fast because the main focus is the multiplayer part, which is of limited interest to me. I speculate with this, but they probably want to keep it simple to port it to mobile or tablets later.\n\nThere are likely people who can appreciate such a game, one that doesn't overwhelm them with options and is over pretty fast. It even is a game that demands a certain skill to make quickly the right decisions, a bit like Starcraft maybe in that regard. When the issues are ironed out it could find a fanbase that likes it for what it is.\n\nBut it isn't a game for me personally, and probably never will be. I expected way more strategy then this game has to offer, even overlooking all the current issues of its early state.\n\n\nIs it worth purchasing right now?\n\nNo, not unless you are an enthusiast and want to take part in balancing the game. Or you really enjoy fast paced multiplayer strategy games. Wait for the game to get some patches and look back later if it has improved. If you can grab it in a sale, go for it.\n\nThe game has potential to be a unique and interesting strategy game, but as of now its just a pretty thing that is frustrating to get into, and over much too soon, without proper depth after you learned the basics.\n\n--------------------------------\nUpdates:\n16-02-2015, Expanded with Gameplay section.\n29-04-2016, Review outdated, Game released out of EA, need to revisit.","February 15, 2015","false","10.3"," 435 of 539 people (81%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","81","435","539","11","22"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/271240/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Offworld Trading Company is an economy building simulator, set in a sci-fi futuristic space setting. The game exited Early Access on April 28th 2016. The game had been in early access for a little over a year, after initially being released in February 2015. With the developers being constantly updating the game over the past year, the game exits the process in a really strong position.\n\nThe game’s introduction tutorial is very in depth but still guides you through the processes within the game in a helpful manner. To begin with I felt a little overwhelmed with all of the numbers, UI functions and other mechanics in the game, but thankfully this tutorial is one of the best I’ve seen in a long while.  The game play itself is essentially make as much money as you can, using trade markets, sabotaging your opponents and espionage.  The game takes place on Mars, there are no combat mechanics or forceful attacks to use on your opponents, and only through economy gain can you wipe them off your planet.  The tutorial consist of 7 missions, each having their own individual objective which differs from a standard skirmish mode, where your ultimate goal is to just beat your opponent by purchasing all of their stock.  The game’s campaign mode also offers a different set of objectives, but you also get to make a few choices which effect in game numbers, such as more jobs, and bonus money.\n\nThis is quite possibly one of the most in-depth games I have ever had the chance of playing. It is certainly a very deep rabbit hole you can get yourself into. Your company’s share price is affected by everything you do on a mission, meaning you always run the risk of a hostile takeover from your opponent.  If you like watching the stock markets and crunching numbers, you may just have met your perfect match already.\n\nVisually, OTC looks really slick and clean.  The game’s hardware requirements are low, given that resolutions higher than 1080 are not supported sadly. The game’s models are all really interestingly designed. Mars itself is perfectly presented, with a real rustic feel to it. A little unknown fact about the game is that the maps you play on are actually based off the real red planet itself.  A smooth animation of units also tips everything off nicely. Honestly it is just a real treat to sit back and watch your economy grow with this aesthetically pleasing game.\n\nGiven the amount of detail that has gone into the game play in OTC, the difficulty levels really depend on how well you get to grips with the system. If you are able to pick up all of the processes, build orders, and able to study the numbers in front of you to a T, then the game will be just about challenging enough. If you are like me and even after the well-designed tutorial you still found yourself struggling to comprehend the amount of information being thrown at you, then you may be in for a bumpy ride. The difficulty ceiling is not a bad thing at all – this is obviously a game for a very specific market of people.\n\nThe tutorial section of the game, as well as the skirmishes afterwards, took me just over three hours to complete. I am about a quarter of the way through the campaign currently but I am starting to hit that virtual brick all, where my opponents are just too clever for me to be able to progress further. The game’s online modes, as well as single player skirmishes allow for an endless amount of replay ability.\n\nOther than the game not allowing any higher resolutions than 1080p, I am pleased to say I had no technical issues. The game runs at a steady 60 FPS, and can even be capped at higher rates if your hardware allows it.\n\nOffworld Trading Company is a fantastic niche title that will happily find a home in anyone’s library that has even a passing interest in any sort of economy. Like I said at the start, you can really find yourself in a deep rabbit hole with this, you can get so in depth with all of the different trade markets and stock prices that you may as well just take up a second job as a market broker afterwards. This is the first game in this genre that I have tried, and I already believe this to be the aiming point for any others wanting to break into the economy genre.  The regular retail price of £29,99 may price a few on the fence buyers, so some may want to find a cheaper re-seller online or wait for the sale season. People who want a game that will more than likely suck hours of time out of their life with an extremely in depth game play, you will find no better game out there at the moment than Offworld Trading Company.  Personally I am going to give this game a recommendation, purely because it isn’t my favourite genre in the world, but I want to give this game merit where it is due.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

But nearly every single game, I get frustrated about the market mechanics. Bear in mind that this review is written based on beta as of Sept 2015.\n\nThe game bills itself as a market simulation, and yet the price mechanics of pretty much everything just seem wonky. As far as I can tell, resource prices are probably influenced by what the other players are buying/selling, but in both cases, they're not using a supply/demand system, but instead some formula that bumps the price up and down with every sale/purchase. The net result is that prices fluctuate dramatically over the course of the game (which is not bad, and could be actually good), but that you never really feel like you understand why.\n\nThe second part of this -- and the far more frustrating part -- is around the (current, as of Sept 2015) mechanics around winning, or "buying out" your opponents. Firstly, the concept of being "bought out" at twice your share price -- and thus "losing" -- is kind of weird, but in some circumstances it's incoherent. In a recent game, I owned 70% of my own company's stock, in addition to 60% of my opponent's stock. In real company terms, this would give me unilateral control over both companies. But no, instead, my opponent has a warning counter that starts at 50% and slowly ticks up to 100%, indicating that they have that percentage of the amount of money needed to "buy me out" and thus win. But at the same time, I'm saving up a hoard of cash to try and buy them out. But that doesn't seem to matter. My hoard of cash that's 50% of the value needed to "buy them out", my 70% stake in my own company, and my 60% stake in my opponent, all don't seem to matter. The stock prices seem to be "faked" much the same as commodities are, and they bear little connection to the actual value of the companies.\n\nThat all said, I do recommend this game, as it's fun, and I love economic sims and there really should be more like this (I was really hoping for something more like Capitalism Plus, but alas). I hope and wish that the game's developers might put some energy into making the systems make sense, though.\n\nUpdate: Here's a screenshot demonstrating the phenomenon above. In this game, I took over two of four opponents and then just hoarded money and resources for a while. The remaining opponent eventually bought me out when their company had less cash on hand than I did, suggesting that the company stock prices are drastically undervalued. https://www.dropbox.com/s/kkosmyvvwd90hjk/Screenshot%202015-10-01%2011.50.43.png","September 6, 2015","true","30.9"," 120 of 134 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","120","134","4","6"

Beta 10 didn't correct all of my original complaints, but an improved tutorial did explain some of the backstory and market dynamics the game uses without necessarily having to delve into the campaign like before.\n\nI will say that this is a game that grows on you. You may not like it at first, but if you slow the game down to snail or even pause it while you are learning, you can get a better feel for the game mechanics. It gives that '5 more minutes' feel, and even though the rounds are short, you can walk away after a round feeling satisfied all the same.\n\nAlso, complacency isn't an option. Alot of RTS games seem to have recommended build trees/queues, that, when combined with overwhelming numbers, virtually gaurantee a victory every round. While this game has some of that, it keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly analyzing the market to determine the most profitable configuration. Someone who thinks they are going to win as long as their structures are profitable will be romped by the person who seeks to constantly *maximize* profits.\n\nMy main complaints are that: 1: An unintelligent 'auto-supply' toggle button that will purchase inputs for your buildings even if the output is unprofitable is illogical,  unusable (the game even warns that this could lead to rapid  bankruptcy), and annoying because not using it requires you to constantly click the 'buy' button yourself upon figuring out whether the output is indeed currently profitable. In short, you will be doing alot of clicking that could easily be avoided given a few improvements in the game's design. 2: A building's read-out displays the cost of power and fuel for the building, but it doesn't include those terms in a calculation of whether the building is profitable, leaving you to do simple but needlessly repetitive mental math to make the final determination. (It is not likely these things will change as it is getting too close to release. I have however had an extensive debate/conversation with Early Access users on the game's - not Steam's - forums regarding these concerns, so we can hope! I will update this review once the game is out of Early Access.)\n\nStill, even with these reservations I have enjoyed my time playing the game. There are seemingly few other games on the market like this, and though I initially felt the game wasn't worth the $39.99 price tag (I bought it for $19.99 on sale - it is worth that much), if you go into it knowing a moderate investment of time might be necessary, it will reward you in ways that both few other games do and that make it well worth the asking price.","February 18","true","41.1"," 107 of 124 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","107","124","7","2"

Simply put, Offworld Trading Company is a RTS without the conventional functions that we're used to seeing in RTSes today, that being a focus on military might and tactfulness. Instead of focusing on countering your enemies unit types and movements, maintaining map awareness and control, etc., you're in a race, so to speak, to survey the land of mars, identify what resources are rich and poor as well as what the best places to found are, figuring out the best way to maximize your profits while stiff-arming your opponents, and ultimately buying out their companies and declaring yourself the sole CEO of corporate mars. This is a lot easier said than done, of course, as there are lots of things that you need to be aware of and work around.\n\nAt the beginning of a match, the only thing you see on the map is the main trading hub and the tiles surrounding it, with the rest of the map covered in fog of war (you can see the terrain, in the fog of war, just not the resources that might be lying within the covered tiles). You start off with 6 "scans" and gain another one every few seconds, You click on a tile that has already been exposed completely and the scan will further reveal tiles in a radius around it. If the border of your scan is near a resource that's hidden a yellow beam will extend from the tile it's in, and if you include the tile within your scan it will show you the tile's yield. As you begin to uncover the location's resources, you need to immediately begin figuring out how you want to start. For example, if you're finding the planet is heavy on iron, it might be wise to try playing as the Robotics or Expansionist division as steel is a major component for their progress and it will be something you will likely not have to deal with, while on the other hand if iron is short you may want to choose Scavenger as they are not dependent on steel like the other divisions, and also try to snatch the iron and refuse to divulge supply so as to drive the price of steel up and make the competition pay through the nose in order to expand. You'll also want to make sure you do not found your colony too far from the resources you plan on claiming, as blimps use fuel to transport their goods, and if you have lots of long routes then your blimps will -absolutely- chew through your fuel reserves (or lack thereof).\n\nOnce you pick your division and landing spot, it's time to start building. Your colony HQ will start at level one, and you will have a handful of claims which are used to...well...claim tiles on the map, which then allow you to build your production buildings. You will learn quickly that in order to thrive, you need to amass claim rights so you can continue building production buildings and the resources which will give you what you need to expand your buildings as well as amass the capital you'll need to trade for goods you may not be able to produce and, ultimately, win. There are three ways to gain claims; upgrading your HQ (which takes resources, such as aluminum, steel, and glass, for example), buying claims from the black market (which become more expensive each time a player buys one - grab em' while they're hot!), and auctions (which often becomes very expensive). Once you've amassed enough capital from the market you've so devilishly cornered, you can proceed to buy out the competition, taking over their buildings and HQ (which you can also upgrade if they haven't and get more claims). There are a handful of other things I haven't touched on: additional black market abilities, special buildings, resources, and patents to name the main ones, but as for the basic gameplay that about covers it.\n\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- Break from the current status-quo of RTSes\n- Moderately in-depth and complex resource and production trees\n- Procedural maps, meaning you'll have to fine tune your strategy game to game\n- Decent AI\n- Promising campaign mode; you get to choose what missions you tackle based on their rewards which will help you upgrade your company for the missions to come.\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Anti-climatic, nonsensical winning condition (You win by buying your competitor out of their own company, which results in the last moments of the game being a frenzied click fest to shotgun your opponents; a mindless-feeling ending for what's supposed to be a strategy game, albeit there is a sort of strategy to when you do commit to the kill.).\n- Sub-par interface. Right now the interface "works," but is somewhat ugly and uninformative, namely the important status reports which pop up in small text off to the side. They are difficult to read and sometimes you can miss out on important tidbits such as resource shortages/surpluses or sabotage events (luckily their are fairly obvious audio ques for more important events that draw your attention to them, such as a crushing soda can for an aluminum shortage). In addition, I found that a couple of the special buildings such as the hacker relay lag out the interface when you bring them up, but that's likely due to a simple bug.\n- First impressions of the pace of the game make me feel like the gameplay is rushed. I'm not going to make a strong point about this as I don't really have an explanation or concrete examples to point to adequately support the point. After watching the trailer I was expecting the game to determined by who thought the smartest, not the fastest, which it is to a degree, but a major part of the game is jumping on map position and resources before anyone else does. This is probably mostly attributed to the nature of the game being it is a RTS. This may well be something that tradition RTS players like (rushing to gain decisive map control).\n- Some strategies can be unbalanced in some circumstances, and can be annoying and feel very gamey at times.\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT\nShould you purchase this game as of the time of this review? Depends, really. I gave this game a recommendation because I, personally, have a fun time with it and I expect it's quality to rise over the next periods of development as I have faith in the credentials of the developers. However, this game is not for everyone, especially at it's price tag. Taking into account what I've experienced as well as what many of my friends have, I would say that for the average consumer ~20$ is a fair price tag for what you're currently getting. Bear in mind, of course, that the game is still in early access and may well be undisputably worthy of it's price tag, but until that day is etched in stone I would simply follow this game and watching where it goes.","February 16, 2015","true","12.2"," 108 of 131 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","108","131","4","2"

A few rounds is all it takes to understand the mechanics of the game, and without a huge amount of complications it becomes very repetitive very quickly.\n\nOn the bright side, the game is absolutely functional. The economy works in a way that is responsive and satisfying. Your opponents actually seem to know what they're doing (at least on harder modes). The sound and visuals are both good.\n\nOn the down side the gameplay is shallow, leaving the player wanting more after a fairly short amount of time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt's been a few months and the game has now come out of early access. I'm afraid that the only difference I see between the current game and the original game is Far better AI, and a nicer UI. The depth of the game hasn't been changed, and basically no new features have been added.\n\nMy review remains very similar to what it was before: The game is solid in what it does, but what it does isn't all that complex, and with so few tradable items and minerals the game becomes a straight race to get Offworld Trading Companies, and flood the market. There is some nuance at the beginning depending on the map, but beyond that every game basically plays out the same.","December 12, 2015","false","9.0"," 143 of 183 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","143","183","6","9"

So if you like strategy like Civ but with the adrenaline and frenzy of an RTS this is your game.\n\nI won't go into the mechanics of the game as you can read plenty of that and there are great tutorials online alread. I do want to address the comment of the game being "too simple" without a lot of depth. People who say this are only thinking in terms of learning all the rules and mechanics, and once they figure that out in a few hours they think there is not much left to the game.\n\nDead wrong!\n\nYou need to think of OTC more like a real-time and complex board game, like chess. Yes, learning the rules and how the different pieces in chess doesn't take long, but the game is infinitely complex. OTC is similar, once the mechanics are down the fun begins! I actually like that the game is 'limited' in some ways - the map is only so big, there are only so many options for attacking your opponent etc. But the variation is infinite and it is all about moves and countermoves and improving your gameplay and skill.\n\nThe best kind of game is one that has elegant rules and gameplay but provides for a lot of imagination. Combined with the fact most games only take 20-40 minutes and it hits a nice sweet spot of a satisfying experience without dragging on for hours like Civ (hey, I like Civ, but it is nice to have a quicker game!)\n\nGive it a chance to really learn the strategy and I think you won't be dissappointed.","April 28","true","51.3"," 77 of 90 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","77","90","2","1"

While the game is still in early access, the foundations of the gameplay itself is well polished. However there are still a lot of room to grow for this game and one may get frustrated or regret his or her purchase. If you are a 4X or Strategy games enthusiast I suggest buying this game, otherwise waiting for a sale may be a wiser choice.\n\nMohawk Games: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCasmHPTajRU9kXWHjJqJD_g","February 22, 2015","true","35.8"," 81 of 96 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","81","96","3","1"

Even with all possible features they could put into this game; it's almost insultingly overpriced.\n\nIt just needs a little more 'something' in the game at its current price point. From what I got from playing, I felt like it should have been priced around $20 max. I'd ceretainly appreciate to hear from the developers as to why they believe the cost of the game is this high. The only reason I purchased it is because I'm usually the person that grabs games of interest in our community and I let them know if it's worth it or not. I can't recommend it at this price point.\n\nThe UI needs some works; it's pretty sluggish. The 'Notification' system is lackluster and need polish. They just pop-up in the lower-right corner 'Chat Window' so you really need to keep an eye on it at all times so you know when things are going to be effecting you.\n\nDon't expect to just jump in this game and know what to do; it has a high learning curve so expect to spend some time figuring a few things out before you get to know what you're doing so you can beat other players.\n\nThe fact that an AI (or a player) can just race to earn a ton of cash, and then buy people out... is a silly win condition. I understand it's a 'Trading Game' and that's sorta the point; but I think there needs to be more to it than just "Stockpile Cash -> Insta Buy-Out Player" - You learn to counter this by buying your own stock of course, when possible.\n\nI expect to see a lot more from this game at this price though; and I just don't see the value yet. I'm going to keep playing over the weekend and I'll update this review after a few more play sessions.\n\n---------- Review Update -------------\n\nI still can't really recommend it yet. Winning doesn't really feel like anything special. Here's why; you spend most of the game just attempting to get a good supply of things going, then in the last 2-3 minutes of the game everyone scrambles to start 'Selling All Their Stuff' so you can just buy everyone else out.\n\nThis seems extremely anti-climatic to me; I feel like they just don't have any other ideas on how you can 'win' at the game. Once someone starts buying the stocks... it's just a silly race to finish buying everyone out in the next minute or two.\n\nSo here's my constructive feedback on 'How To Win' should be done in the game. Since it's about "Saving Humanity" and all that... you shouldn't be buying stock on the other companies; instead players should be 'Offworlding' their goods to "Earth" in order to 'Save Humanity'. The first 'Trade Company' to meet the demands of "Earth" should win. You could have "Earth" have random demands every game, or even shift/change in the middle of it if you want to get crazy.\n\nIt's odd that that isn't how you win? Maybe it is? But all my games always just end up being "Stock Buyout Races". Who can press the minus and plus buttons faster than the other.\n\nTL;DR Version - Winning isn't rewarding; the game builds you up, but just doesn't know how to finish yet.","February 13, 2015","false","3.3"," 207 of 286 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","207","286","6","9"

I had a feeling it will grow well and achieve a good level of greatness by the time it was finihsed. Coming back to it now, over 9 months later, I cannot help but enjoy what the developer (Sören Johnson was the lead designer of Civilization 4) has achieved. Regardless whether in single player or multiplayer, you are treated to a fast-paced, ever-be-on-your-toes gameplay. To me, this is the best fast-paced economic sim I have ever played.\n\nSo, let's take a look at the good and the bad.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n1. Extremely engaging gameplay - that, to me, outweighs everything else. The game is built in such a way that keeps you on your toes all the time. A small slip-up may result in a loss. I can tell you, there are some real sharks out there.\n2. Strategic Thinking + Awareness combo wins the game - you need to know exactly what you want and how to manipulate the situation you have been put in. You need to play a few moves ahead and you need to be ready to adapt and commit to the plan you have in your head.\n3. Great single player - the developers have really programmed the AI well, as I expected of them. Even on lower difficulties (say, Employee or Assistant) the AI may suprise you and even buy you out in a skirmish game. In addition to that there is a great campaign (explained in #11), daily challenges, leaderboards, pretty much everything to satisfy your single player demands.\n4. Multiplayer is damn good - but be aware, there are people out there who have played the game for a long time and will destroy a newcomer in no time. I know I have 26 hours in the game and got trashed. Do not get disheartened and do your best to learn and improve.\n5. You can pick from a number of companies to lead to victory - and each one plays differently to boot! It is quite surprising just how much a dependence on one resource can affect a game, and how huge of a replayability it may provide. You may opt to play the sneaky scavengers, the tech-crazy scientists, the extremely expansive... um... Expansive corporation that gains extra claims on plots, or the Robots, which need no sustenance, but have to replace their parts and chips in a timely fashion.\n6. Many ways to victory - while in skirmish the goal remains the same, to be the last man standing, there are many ways to achieve it. You are given lots of obvious and subtle ways to do so. Do not take your eys off that black market, I can tell you that much... or for the same reason off the resource table... or the shares table... uh, I am quite sure that you get my drift.\n7. Many hours of enjoyment - due to its awesome replayability, you will easily be looking at 20+ hours of enjoyment, more if you want to test every corporation in various situations, and then go ahead and do some skirmishes, play through the campaign, do the daily challenges, and maybe play online vs other people.\n8. An extremely pleasant music - the soundtrack is awesome, very nice and relaxing.\n9. Good tutorial comprising of ways to teach you how to win, a number of practice games vs the AI up to Manager difficulty, and in my opinion, a great design decision to have you actually win a game in skirmish first before diving into the campaign. The campaign can be a bit overwhelming, I can tell you that from experience. The AI won't sit back and let you feel smart, MLG Pro gamer. It will crush you like a maggot if you don't play well.\n10. Post-game statistics - the post-game statistics have been improved and made even more in-depth, much to my delight. I really like taking a long hard look at them and analyze what I did wrong or not.\n11. Great single player campaign -  In its essence, you are given 7 weeks worth of challenges, with your chosen company, vs 3-4 AIs of a difficulty that you choose in the beginning of the campaign. From week 1 to 6, you use the cash you make to improve an AI colony by buying any of the 4 upgrades for it over a 7 day period. The winner with the most purchases gets the best weekly cash bonus. In the final week of the campaign, you enter a skirmish match with the top 4 companies left and to win you must buy them out. Each company starts with a number of upgrades, and you can hire additional staff either for a week or permanently to further boost a building's efficiency (you can boost a windmill's energy output, a metal mine's efficiency so that a single metal mine supports 3 steel mills, etc.). Then you are allowed to select one of the 3 missions given to you. Each one of them carries a different challenge which is clearly explained (example: limited resources, black market items, special conditions, etc.) and satisfies a certain earthbound sponsor (UN, USA, Russia, China), which, gives you another reward (like extra claims, better scans, etc.). Depending on how well you do on the mission, you get to carry more week-based revenue home and use it for further upgrades to your production buildings. And if you think that's not enough - you can even unlock a secondary or even tertiary sponsor and use it on a certain mission! Limited water with a scientific? Play robotic then!\n\nNow, let's take a look at the BAD:\n1. The graphics - call me weird, but I actually preferred the basic Early Access, more blocky and sci-fi-ish graphics. Since then, the game evolved into a more colorful, cartoonish look, which to my taste, was unnecessary. It sure gets the job done, but not for me.\n2. The UI - the UI underwent a number of changes, which in my opinion made it more complex than it needed to be, with way more tabs and sub-tabs than necessary. Coming back to the game 9 months later, I was a bit overwhelmed myself for the first 5 minutes of play. Granted, I managed to make my way easily around it, but for a new player it will be a lot to process.\n3. Punishing AI - yep, that could be a bad thing. If you are not ready to play vs tough AI who can exploit your mistakes, best stick to the lowest difficulties or... stay away from the game.\n4. While a number of changes were made, the game did not change dramatically from the first early access build. But then again, the starter build was already quite good, polished, and enjoyable.\n5. Huge skill difference in online games - many people who play online since alpha have way better understanding, time proven tactics and thus, the upper hand on someone who's just starting.\n6. The price is a huge gripe for many people, and I can understand why. Yesterday, I was looking through my mails to see for just how much did I buy this game, and I was very surprised to find that I got it for 18,50€, which is roughly half of what it costs now. I would argue, that if you watched youtubers play it 9 months ago, that you should have already realized its potential and bought the game. However, on the other side I can totally understand how people like to wait till a game exits early access first, and then buy it. For them, the price tag will be high.\n7. Last, but not least, the game suffers from the snowball effect. Once you get ahead, and if you know what you are doing, you will most likely stay ahead till the end of the game. That is a tad off-putting to some gamers, but I can tell you from experience, you can still turn it around... to a point. Then you just lose :)\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you are willing to forgive the current price tag, this game is an easy buy for gamers who enjoy economic games comprised of a lot of wheeling and dealing, tormenting their opponents by scamming (cook the books for the win), crashing the market, freezing their best production plots for a time, boosting your own effectivenes, destroying their resources (underground nukes, yay!), or even toying with them as they spiral into huge debt. I, personally, find the game a great experience and am looking forward to playing the new and improved campaign, learn the new tricks and quirks of the game, and enjoying myself thoroughly in the process.","May 1","true","48.2"," 64 of 76 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","64","76","0","3"

I finally don't have to worry about memorizing hot-keys to queue up marines or peons or whatever else I may need to reach my keystroke per second quota.  Instead, players will each get a HQ, choose a business model, and attempt to buy out their competition by buying low and selling high.  This game features both raw materials and finished goods, with the price of each being affected by supply and demand.  It reminds me of "Sid Meier's Railroads" a bit, though you are limited in your building placement by "claims"...that is, a resource that allows you to unlock one hex on the map for your personal use.  There's a bit of a learning curve and the AI can be somewhat difficult, but I found myself wanting more with each gameplay session.  The $40 price is a concern for those on a tight budget, but for those who can afford it (and love the idea of an economic RTS) should pick it up.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGXR8SzE3fw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m05pYvDPng8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4dLV0ZrHbc","February 12, 2015","true","8.3"," 103 of 139 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","103","139","3","6"

Can't recommend it enough. Here are just a few of the assorted points as to why I love it so much:\n- The AI had been dramatically improved over the time and is quite, quite competent now. To a point that a newer player might struggle with it quite a bit until he really gets the hang of the game.\n- Getting the hang of the game might seem challenging - the learning curve is quite steep and usually that's a sign of a deep game. And trust me, this game is deep in spite of what some people might say. I can see how playing AI can get repetitve but in a multiplayer every game is different and every game presents you with plenty of important and difficult decisions that you need to make quick.\n- There is no one way to victory. Every game you have to adapt to the ever-changing environment, fluctuating prices, resource spread and geography, shortaging, colony growth etc.\n- I have very little RTS experience. In fact nearly none and I am hardly at all inerested in the genre. Yet somehow when I first saw Offworld I got interested in it and after watching a whole pile of videos I realized that I HAVE to play it.\nNow, I understand it's not a feeling everyone will have, not immediately for sure. But I think that if you like RTS, if you want something new and different, if you like a highly competitive game, you should definitely give it a shot.","April 28","true","569.8"," 53 of 62 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","53","62","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/offworldblues/recommended/271240/","offworldblues","Blues","http://steamcommunity.com/id/offworldblues/","8 products in account","What you get out of Offworld Trading Company depends heavily on what you expect and how much time you're willing to put into it. OTC is based around 25-40 minute skirmishes (or 10-15 if things are very lopsided) rather than being a sprawling epic. As such, there aren't a tremendous amount of different mechanics available, but what is here is very well balanced and allows for deep, varied games. Make no mistake: there is a very steep learning curve here, and a lot of the depth isn't necessarily readily apparent because there's so much going on.\n\nNote on the learning curve: the basic concepts are fairly simple, and getting to the level of competence only requires a few bits of knowledge (that aren't necessarily obvious). Really mastering the game takes a fairly deep understanding of the game, though, and really good players can exploit small advantages to open up large leads (though those can also be countered by black market and other tools if players stay attentive).\n\nOffworld absolutely delivers on the promise of being an RTS without units. In place of the usual micro-heavy unit management, there are myriad map quirks, prices, opponent actions, and random events to pay attention to and try to take advantages off of long-term. Even with over 700 hours put into the game, mostly playing multiplayer with some of the best players in the community, there are still plenty of things in a single game that I will fail to notice. Success at this game, rather than being reliant on high APM, depends on having good awareness and a good understanding of how and why prices will move, how to appropriately react, and especially countering your opponents.\n\nSingle player is somewhat more difficult to evaluate. The AI is relatively well-made and able to put up a fight or pose a serious challenge for newer players. With experience, there are some predictable aspects and flaws to the AI that let you beat them consistently, but until then, skirmishes against the AI should prove somewhat interesting and useful as a learning tool.\n\nIf you're a competitive person, going for the best times on the Daily Challenge can be a way to keep single player fresher. Trying to figure out what strategies work or the exact way to manipulate prices to make the AI do what you want it to do can be interesting, and with the variety of maps and restrictions set for each day's challenge, it's nontrivial to find optimal strategies. Being able to see how other players approached the same challenge (using the in-game replay feature) is useful both for learning new strategies or figuring out how to make small optimizations.\n\nThe campaign is essentially a series of skirmishes where you start with limited production and are able to unlock perks and better production as you advance. All but the final week of the campaign are a bit different from your standard skirmishes; rather than race to buy out your opponents, you are competing at investing in the central colony. You can choose from 9 different executives to play as, and a lot of work has been done to make them play differently. Once you find a working strategy and manage to build a solid foundation from the first few weeks, though, applying the same strategy over and over until the final week is fairly viable, so the campaign can drag a bit. Once you get to the final week, the standard skirmish with a different set of tools than you're used to can be fun.\n\nBasically, if you're willing to put a lot of time into learning how the mechanics of the game interplay and are interested in multiplayer, this game will definitely reward you with a deep, consistently interesting experience. Single player can be played more casually and is enjoyable in its own right, but doesn't necessarily have a great deal of lasting appeal if you reach a point where the AI isn't particularly challenging. If you're not willing to put time into overcoming the steep learning curve, a lot of the game can seem overwhelming and incomprehensible (or else pointlessly simple if you play on very low difficulty levels), and probably isn't worth your time.\n\ntl;dr - Buy the game if you want a rich multiplayer experience and aren't worried about the learning curve. Buy the game on sale if you're mostly interested in single player and the game's concept. Look elsewhere if you're looking for a game with an epic scale or with mechanics that are simple to master.","April 30","true","838.1"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","44","48","0","0"

It has everything that should make it an addictive experience for me... pausable real-time, many divergent strategies for victory, brutally smart AI opponents, some nice tongue-in-cheek atmospherics, different factions with totally differing playstyles, and more.\n\nSo why the thumbs down? Why aren't I playing the game right now?\n\nWhat it comes down to is this: to keep ahead of the game, you need to keep track not only of your own company's development, but ideally that of all your competitors as well. Your AI opponents will try to sabotoge you using dirty black-market tricks, and you have to do the same to them to win. That means you have to know what's really going to hurt them, and what's not. That means you have to understand their strategy. Which means you have to look over their operations on the map, count their buildings, try to work our what they're up to.\n\nI could pause the game and do all that, but even if I did for each of the 3-7 opponents, I'd have to do it all over again a few minutes later, because that's how quickly the game moves.\n\nInfo about your opponents is not easy to find. There's no summary screen of how many building of each type each opponent has, which might allow you to piece together their strengths and weaknesses at a glance. Instead you have to maually count buildings if you want that info. I hate situations where a game makes information available, but very hard to access!\n\nAnother turn-off for me is the difficulty of assessing what investments will generate the best return. I end up making most of my investment choices using a sort of intuition, but I have the feeling that on higher difficulty levels you really need to flawlessly min-max to win. Again, I could pause the game and do a bunch of calculations by hand to min-max... but that's not much fun. Too much like my real job.\n\nSo despite being very drawn to the game in concept, I find in practice it just leaves me feeling frustrated at being unable to keep up with the constant min-max calculating that the AIs are able to do in real time.\n\nI could pause the game every 30 seconds and try to keep up, in my feeble human way, but why bother?","May 8","false","10.4"," 121 of 172 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","121","172","7","6"

But in the campaign itself, you start off with limited equipment, and as you progress through it you will start to unlock what's been locked by purchasing them, until you got everything and finish the the campaign. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm working there.\n\nNotice: This game does not have an offline mode yet.\n\nThe gameplay itself is the same as an RTS Command & Conquer, but with a mix of a hex-based movement / placement like a Civilization game, and sort of a mix of an Anno game with how building and trading is. Combined with the new idea, one that at least I haven't seen, of power management in the market area by gathering resources, buying and sell them, advancing your buildings to produce more materials, try do some shady tactics to over power your competitors. It's new and fun, and what I like about it is that it's simple yet complicated in a way, simple enough for most to learn.\n\nAt first I was skeptical with what the game is facing the price that it has, but after playing the first 3 tutorial levels, I fell in love with it, so my skepticism went away and I was happy with the game and the price, obviously followed with playing outside of the tutorial of course, playing the single player content and multiplayer. I see my self playing this for a while, and I was kind of hungry for this type of game, so win win. Also, while the game is sufficient enough to keep it self going for some time, I wouldn't mind seeing more buildings and units to play around with, just more content.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","February 12, 2015","true","13.2"," 73 of 96 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","73","96","5","2"

What this game is NOT is an economic/city builder simulation where you continually grow (ie a 4X).\n\nWhat it IS is a resource management RTS (others have gone into further detail) - probably the first of its kind (at least the first that I've played). In any case, it is very innovative and very good for what it is, in my opinion.\n\nI read through the other reviews to see if there was anything that I could add to what others have said, because I agree with most of the things that have been said about the game. One thng that I others haven't really talked about is how much strategy is actually involved in the game.\n\nFirst of all, others haven't really talked about how important the stock market actually is. As others have said, the ultimate goal of the game is to buy out your oponents stock; and conversely you must defend your own stock. Your stock price (and I might be a litttle bit wrong here) is based off of your net assets; that is the value of all your resources, buildings (including your home colony), minus any debt that you may have accrued; but more importantly, it also includes the value of any stock you buy in other (your opponent's) companies (also maybe your own?). The part I'm not sure about is how much the actual buying/selling of shares actually influences price. At the beginning everyone's stock price is low but it rises as the game progresses. If you can buy shares early on, not only will it make it easier for you to defeat your opponents in the end, you will make it much harder for them to beat you, since the progress they have made during the game has driven up your own stock price.\n\nSecondly, the fundamental question that the game asks the player is what is the the best/most profitable way for me to use my limited resources. By resources I mean the game's 12? resources (basic like iron or water, or advanced like electronics or chemicals), your cash, and most importantly the number of claims you have. Your claims equal the number of buidlings you can have and so are the limiting factor to your profit; that is you must maximize the profit from your limited number of claims. this raises a number of interesting questions and decisions. It may be profitable to scrap buildings for others if market prices for an output are much higher than the input, if you can buy a stockpile at a low price, or if you already have a stockpile. You may want to turn off a building if the input is more expensive than the output. Another result of this is that you are always (or should be) watching the prices on the market, and be aware of how they relate to the other resources.  Another result is that watching what your opponents are doing is important - they are working in the same market as you so, if they over or underproduce certain resources you can use that to your advantage.\n\nThis is where the black market comes in. I agree with others that some of the sabotages are overpowered - but you need to remember, this game is still in early access so balancing issues should be ironed out. However, what they are not is underpriced; if the price is low, that just means that the players aren't using the market to their full advantage. The prices grows incrementally, so by the late game they should already be expensive. And as I said above, what your opponents produce - or don't, in this case - affects the prices you buy and sell at, so you can use sabotages to help you as well as hinder your opponents.\n\nAnyways, this got much longer than I intended, and I'm not sure how clear it was; but, I just want to say that I'm enjoying the game as it is, and eagerly await any improvements.","February 22, 2015","true","12.6"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","49","58","0","0"

Well let me tell you about Offworld Trading Company.\n\nIn Offworld, you are a company looking to compete with other startups and get rich by mining Mars for as much of the thirteen available resources as possible and drive opponents out of business.  There are NO military units.  Economic victory is the only victory.\n\nThere are four factions, but you don't select one until you've had the chance to survey the map.  Resource availability and diversity is randomly generated, giving you the chance to plant the faction you think is best for the environment. APM will not save you, Starcraft fans. Resource tile claims are very limited.  You will NEVER have all thirteen resources immediately.  Some can be extracted on the spot, and others can only be produced by combining resources.  What you can't collect yourself, you can purchase in an always available market where prices fluctuate on your behavior and the behavior of your opponents.\n\nYour "score" is your Share Price.  It is your net worth minus your debt.  You defet other players by buying up massive amounts of their increasingly expensive shares.  When you purchase all of their shares, you get everything they've been building.  Your goal is to buyout all the other players.\n\nThe "essential" resources are Water, Oxygen, Food, Fuel and Power.  Will your colony starve if you lack them?  NO!  "Starvation" does not exist, unlike Civ.  You will automatically buy what you need from the market passively and accumulate Debt instead.  Scrambling to acquire them all initially to avoid debt is a beginner's (or Civ player's) mistake.  What good is staving off debt if you grab all those things without producing precious Aluminum or Steel to allow you to upgrade your headquarters and edge closer to victory?  At the same time, you can't ignore them forever, because too much debt reduces your Share Price, allowing players to buy you more easily.\n\nAs you upgrade your headquarters, you are provided handfuls of more claims to tiles to help you collect and produce more resources, and build fancier buildings that will help you generate the wealth you need to buyout your opponents.\n\nAnd then Sabatoge comes into play.  Just because there's no militaries doesn't mean you can't take your opponents down a peg.  The Black Market opens at regular intervals, allowing players to buy EMPs to temporarily disable opposing buildings, fake Mutinies to steal buildings, Dynamite to destroy buildings, or devastating, nonlethal Underground Nukes to permanently reduce the yield of an opponent's production tile.  You can also buy precious claims when you want just one more building without having to upgrade, or Goon Squads that defend buildings from attacks (and then throw them back at opponents).\n\nThere are four factions.  Three of them are human and require Water, Oxygen and Food.  The Expansive humans are great if you're hungry for lots of tiles, because they get an extra Claim on a tile every time they upgrade.  They also require less Steel for upgrades.  The Robotic colony doesn't care about Water, Food or Oxygen, but instead require Electronics (the final, most expensive resource) as well as massive amounts of Power.  Scientific colonies have the unique ability to plant production facilities directly on top of a raw resource, therby "skipping" a step.  This is huge if you use it carefully.  My favorite faction, Scavengers, use Carbon instead of Steel and can use the Black Market more frequently.  They are my favorite because while other players are fighting over Iron and spending claims changing that same Iron into Steel, I can just use Carbon for everything (yet they are useless on a map where I can't find Carbon.)  Again, when you play the game, you scan the map for resources FIRST and then choose the faction you think will work best with what you can grab.\n\nAs of March 2015 the game is aesthetically rough.  There are only two songs, simple, loud sound effects, and placeholder robotic voices to announce events in game.  Still, I cannot put this game down.  Its positively brilliant and addictive, and it will only get better as the game develops.","March 15, 2015","true","29.7"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","43","49","0","0"

I'll keep updating this review as updates get released.\n\nDecent game - has tons of potential, but it's just too bland and predictable to recommend right now.  I agree with other reviewers that say that it just needs an extra "something" to be fun (differing AI, more varied games, much better balancing, definitely optimization).\n\nThe part that I dislike the most is the balancing of the black market.  It's way too easy to buy an EMP to use on your opponents (and likewise for your opponents to use on you).  The only games I've won have been games where I constantly buy EMP's and disable my opponent's power plants or water sources.  This definitely needs to be balanced by maybe making them much more expensive and much less powerful.  I'm sure these will be balanced out over time.\n\n*Edit:  As mentioned in the comments, you can disable the black market at the start of the game.  This is actually how I prefer to play since then the AI can't gang up on you and take away any advantages that you were smart enough to get at the beginning of the game.  I know this works both ways, but personally, I enjoy planning out everything without having to worry about the black market.  Maybe I'll come around to it with future updates.*\n\nOverall, currently, I don't think it's worth the price tag unless you want to be a part of the development process, but it may be in the future.  I'm looking forward to updates, as this game could be great!\n\nUpdate:  They've definitely been listening to the players with their updates, and they've updated the game twice since release which is great!

Put's in a 'black market' where you buy things to blow stuff up.\n\nI like the game concept, but I feel as though the black market is detrimental to it. You are meant to outfox the other companies, by speculating on price and going after the resources that will be needed. It's like playing MULE or Settlers of Catan. The problem is it just reverts to any other RTS when the Black Market comes into play. If someone tries to plan ahead, see what is going to be needed, invest, ect. Other players just shut their stuff down. Sure, there are no armies, but is has the same effect. It's just lazy. Imagine Microsoft, instead of competing for market share with Apple based on innovation, could just nuke one of Apple's manufacturing plants. That's not how it works. Should we add a rule to Monopoly where you can obliterate Hotels? This is not in the spirit of this sort of arena.\n\nPlease remove this and replace it with something else. There are auctions, price manipulations, etc. that are better suited for this game. More ideas like those, and less 'sabotage' type things would be MUCH better.

There's no optimising your road layout because there are no roads - your cargo flies where it needs to go.\n\nThe limited number of tile claims you have slows the pace from totally frantic to manageable. The game is bursts of frenetic energy and agression as you seize an available opportunity, then back to waiting. It feels a bit like a turn based boardgame with a chess timer.\n\nI bought this game thinking I was going to have a nice quiet time building up a peaceful economy, as in the games I listed before, and that I wasn't too keen on the competitive aspect.

I waited about 15 minutes and didn't see anyone in multiplayer.\n\nUpdated Review - June 11, 2015:\nI'm still on the fence about whether I actually RECCOMEND this game.  The player inside me says "Heck yeah" but the game developer says "Nay."  The biggest problem I have is really the end condition.  Playing for a while, I have gotten used to it, but the last 25% of each match is still quite simply not fun.  The gameplay turns into either a click-race or a wait to inevitable doom.  Lately, I've also been noticing more glitches, errors, and crashes than in previous builds toward the end of a match when everyone is clicking like crazy and the market is fluctuating out of control... which is terrible.  Spend a half hour playing a match just to be unable to finish... that's worse than losing almost every single time.\n\nThe game can be fun, but even a win is generally anti-climactic.  The game is a modernized MULE, which had better balancing and helped players that were seemingly doomed.  This game does not.  I feel, though cannot prove, that the AI works as a whole system against the player (please note the screenshot I have where 3 AI delibratlely surrounds my base solely to "box me in").  It might as well send me messages after it wins that say "easy."\n\n\nOriginal Review:\nI have tried really, REALY hard to like this game, but overall I cannot.  I play games for enjoyment and do not enjoy this.  The first half of any match some of the best economic-based gameplay you can get.... until you randomly get bought out.  And I really mean random.  I could be in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, last place - it doesnt matter.  I feel like every single match I've played has been a regrettable waste of time.  I'm legitimately mad at myself that I even bothered to play. The endgame is way too sudden and unpronounced.  Buying yourself, which seems like a way to get ahead, out is one of the worst things you could do. Things that seems logical are not.  The market is too heavily influenced by non-commodity-based factors.\n\nPlaying online, you're going to be competeing against people who, like in any RTS, "Zerg Rush," or find whatever is the most viable win strategy and exploit the crap out of it.  If not, they'll be learning how to play and making mistakes or over-using the black market.  People are impatient to join lobbies which there are usually none of.\n\nThis game would be great if there were ever a plausible scenario for playing it in.  Perhaps as a local LAN game this could be fun.  Otherwise, don't bother against the AI or the already toxic online commuinity.","April 21, 2015","false","28.8"," 69 of 97 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","69","97","0","10"

I imagined hours of playing vast, sprawling games across the surface of Mars, replete with complexity and grand strategic depth.\n\nThat's not what this game is.  In fact OTC is a scion of the great RTS's of the late 90s, and it operates on that same tense, refined, match-oriented, competitive level- in which the genre name becomes an anachronism, because the actual gameplay is so tight and focused that it would be best described as tactical rather than strategic.  Matches are fast-paced and relatively short, demanding a combination of quick clicks and quick thinking to stay on top.  Resources, tech, and production are all tied up with each other in a single intertangled "tree" of progression.  You can buy or sell any resource or product at any time if you have the money, and one of the key facets of playing well is using this ever-market to drive up the value of your surplus goods and drive down the value of your opponents', while still making sure you are keeping your levels where they need to be to avoid halts in production or debt accumulation.  There's a moment sometimes in a match where suddenly you see a way that you can make the market perform for you like a puppet- a few minutes and some well-placed clicks later and your stock is way out on top  (assuming, of course, your plans aren't deflected by your opponents' own devious machinations).  Victory in OTC occurs when one player owns all the stock of all the corporations in the match.\n\nDuring the best matches I experience that same sort of premium-grade thrumming that I used to get from a good game of Starcraft in college, complete with peculiar blink of bewilderment at match's end as my brain powers down its High Alert protocols and returns to normal functioning.  I find it interesting that the devs keep emphasizing how not like Starcraft this game is, and yet my gut-level experience has been very similar for the two games.  It's interesting as well that the devs were so worried about multiplayer catching on without any combat outlet for players.  And yet this game shines most brightly in the cutthroat multiplayer arena.  I think they underestimated our creativity when it comes to eradicating our opponents.  The markets of OTC can be just as disruptive and violent (and satisfying) as any zerg-infested terran marine making a bee-line for your base.\n\nOverall 7.5/10\n\nPros:\n+original concept with a classic feel\n+elegant, streamlined gameplay\n+relatively short matches\n+rewards creativity and decisiveness\n+compelling soundtrack\n\nYou decide:\n+/-quick clicking can be a major factor in your success\n+/-limited options in terms of tech and production\n+/-the differences among the corporate classes pose some interesting market problems for players but ultimately gameplay is pretty much the same for everyone\n+/- Early Access...sometimes you find a diamond at the end, sometimes it's a lemon.

You’ll need to manage all of your resources, expand your company’s HQ and maybe there’ll be some corporate sabotage thrown in to the mix.\n\nThe core gameplay all revolves around harvesting resources and then using those resources to produce other resources (for example Silicon is used by the buildings that produce glass) and sell off anything you don’t need to boost your cash-flow. It sounds easy but you only have a certain number of tile claims. If you have five claims available that means you can only build five buildings. However, you can get more claims, mainly by upgrading your company’s HQ (up to the maximum level 5) but there are in-game auctions and you’ll sometimes be able to bid on extra claims or an actual tile as well as other things such as patents (technologies that provide a positive bonus to your business) and black market items (some of which are used for personal gain, others which are used to sabotage the competition).\n\nAs with all strategy games, OTC’s gameplay is split into early-game, mid-game and late-game. The early-game in OTC is all about securing the resources that are essential to your faction (one of four), without these you’ll find yourself in a lot of debt very quickly and you’ll be unable to expand your HQ. For example, Seneca Development is a human faction so they need food, water and oxygen to run their base but Yoshimi Robotics is run by robots so they don’t require these (though you may still want them in order to sell them). It’s also important to secure at least two of the three resources you need for upgrading your HQ in the early game so that you don’t have to spend too much money buying other resources. OTC’s mid-game is essentially about preparing for late-game. By the mid-game you should have secured all the resources you need to run and upgrade your HQ so now you’ll be thinking about increasing your HQ level and starting to look at producing resources which you’ll be able to make huge profits from in the late-game stage. If you have any resources to sell off, mid-game may also be when you start purchasing stocks in other players to prepare for buying them out. The late-game stage is when you’re going to be making most of your money. Prices will be at their highest now as the human colony you’re supporting will be very large now so this is the time to sell off resources you have large stockpiles of (in small amounts so you don’t push the price down too much) but it’s also when you want to be thinking about building two or three Offworld Markets. The Offworld Market building is a rocket which will launch 100 of whatever resource you choose to asteroid mines for insane amounts of money, several times more than simply selling your resources to the colony. Once you’ve sent up a couple of rockets you’ll have enough money to buy out the weakest competitor(s) and soon you’ll have enough to buy out even the strongest of the competition, as long as they’re still behind you.\n\nThe main way to limit your competition is by sabotaging them with black market items as I mentioned earlier. Some of the items which are for your benefit include bribing officials to give you an extra claim or using a M.U.L.E to collect 200 units of a resource. The sabotage items range from EMPs which will temporarily disable a few buildings to Mutiny which will give you any profits from a building for around a minute (particularly effective when used on Offworld Markets). Some of these items did feel unbalanced to me, for example an underground nuke reduces the number of resources you harvest from a tile, if an enemy uses this several times it can be incredibly damaging as you’ll then have to focus on getting more of that resource rather than making money. It also seems that AI are more likely to target human players than other AI players which is of course problematic if you’re playing single-player. While some of the individual items feel unbalanced, the black markets presence in the game is handled very well. Once you’ve purchased an item from the market you’ll have to wait one minute before you can purchase anything else and every time a player (human or AI) purchases an item its price increases for everyone so you can’t just spam a load of EMPs. Furthermore, there’s a pool of items and you only get a random selection of them for each game (the number of items also depends on the size of the map/number of players) which adds a little bit of variety to the game.\n\nAlthough I’ve really enjoyed playing OTC (especially multiplayer skirmishes with friends) it does have two major issues: a lack of depth and a high price for what’s on offer. The former feeds into the latter so I’ll talk about it first. The problem I have is there’s not really any variation in gameplay or strategies. I’ve played quite a few matches in my ten hours with the game so far (they usually last between twenty to thirty minutes) and I’ve used the same strategy every time, winning all but two or three matches. Even when I played as a different faction I only had to make small tweaks to my strategy in order to win the game. Sure, if you play on the higher difficulties it’s more of a challenge but I still didn’t feel as though I needed to do anything differently to what I did in my previous games. Obviously I don’t expect it to be so varied that it feels like I’m playing a different game every time I play but I shouldn’t feel like I’m playing the same match when I play. It’s this lack of depth that makes the £30 asking price way too high, I feel that a price point of around £20 would be much better value.\n\nA couple more things to tie up. OTC is a really good looking game, the style of the game fits it perfectly and, though it’s only a small feature, I enjoyed watching the little transport ships fly from my resource collection buildings back to the HQ. While Skirmish is probably playing most of the time, there is also a campaign mode. It’s well designed and offers slightly different gameplay to Skirmish mode, giving you seven days on a map to be the player who buys the most modules for the nearby colony. Personally I didn’t enjoy it anywhere near as much as skirmish/multiplayer but that’s not to say it’s bad. The tutorials are very good and explain everything very well though it is possible to screw up in the tutorials (for example if you build an extra building you won’t have enough claims to complete the tutorial) which means that you may have to restart the entire tutorial mission, a bit frustrating considering it’s not explained. Lastly, the game’s soundtrack is absolutely fantastic!\n\nVerdict\nAn enjoyable economic strategy game that’s good for a few hours of fun despite being overpriced and lacking depth. If you’re a fan of strategy games and you’re looking for something different I’d highly recommend picking it up on sale.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","May 31","true","10.3"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","3"

Whilst the interface, the gameplay and the graphics are all on a scale between good and outstanding the games pacing feels all off.  It's like watching (the original) Total Recall at twenty times the normal speed; you know that there are some great moments in there that you would love to savour but it's gone before you've noticed you're enjoying yourself.  If you're victorious then it doesn't feel like you've worked for it, if you lose it dosn't feel you've had a chance to put up a fight.  A game lasts around a half an hour to an hour and moves at a pace that would give Usain Bolt jet lag...\n\nAnd this is worries me because I don't know how it can be changed without removing all that makes the game stand-out from the crowd.  The Unique Selling Point of this game is "realtime" competitive economics - but that's not strictly true; REALTIME economics is slow, careful, managed.  Sure, there is shouting and screaming on the trading floor, but the wider economic world around it moves at a more measured pace.  RTS is a format that suits combat orientated games - it's frantic "WHO IS SHOOTING ME/WHEN DID THAT BLOW-UP!!" quality is appropriate to its content - war is (I imagine) chaotic and frantic - it's central gameplay is built around event's that can be drawn over realtime - namely gunfights.  But if we had a TRUE RTS economics game you would need to pass it down several generations to win - Neither nation nor global corporation gained market dominance over thirty muinets, it takes hundereds of yeears.... something thats nicely communicated and simulated in the format of a turn-based game.  The question is "who want's this game", or perhaps rather "When do I want this game"?  If I'm in the mood for something fast-paced but stratigic it makes sense to look for gunplay, if its long lasting and stratigic economic is better.  This has the flaw of being neither and both.\n\nIn the end, for all of Offworld Trading Company's good points (and it has many), its format seems irreconcilably at odds with its content; it ain't realtime economics at all, its economics so fast it feels like you can't breath - think Arnie in the red dust with eyes about to pop.","February 17, 2015","false","7.5"," 98 of 146 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","98","146","5","4"

Real Time Strategy but like a Boardgame\nObjectives : Make money, buy stocks and M&A opponents to win\nMaps : Randomly generated maps each game with some kind of tile sets\nOptimization : Pretty good\nDisplay : Not bad but also not good\nSounds : Unmemorable music with awful voice on black market\nDifficulty : Pretty difficult to beginners\n\nFirst impression of this game, when I heard and saw the concepts about OTC, it looks very interesting. But While watching the developer’s youtube tutorial videos, it looks a little boring because of there was no actual controllable units, and graphics and interface was looked too much simple. And today, after release as Early Access, while played first tutorial, it was looked really simple. But after play 5+ games? This game appeared ‘complex’ and ‘painstaking’.\nCompete auction to take high resource depots, regulate funds and debt, buy, sell and control the value of resources, bother opponents by black market... Above all, despite the difficulty was only employee level, AI players are not stupid :)\nThis isn’t a perfect AAA game, but I think it’s worth of $40. It’ll be advance better and better until official release in 2016.","February 13, 2015","true","16.0"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","0"

Think of it like Civilization, you should keep everything attached to your Base unless it is something that absolutely must be shipped across the map.\n\nBut before you build, you must claim land.  And land claims aren't handed out like candy, there's a ton of land, but you'll only get your hands on a precious few pieces, which cannot be exchanged.\n\nIt's an enjoyable experience, and can be a fairly laidback, relatively brief, competition between other players.\n\nI hope you'll join me, and I'll try to share some of what I've learned so far as we compete.","November 28, 2015","true","18.3"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","36","45","5","0"

I told him it was Offworld Trading Company, an RTS about building a corporation on Mars, expanding your base, and specializing in the production of a whole host of materials to earn enough money to buy out your opponents. He told me it looked pretty interesting, but mentioned that I was losing... And I was, BADLY. The match was down to myself and one other company, but that enemy had bought out two other players. They were an unstoppable behemoth with 10x the iron mines, steel mills, glass factories, electronic depots, and every other profitable thing you can imagine. It was this sort of scenerio I might have just given up and quit in any other strategy game. But, I couldn't embaress myself, here. I had an offworld market, capable of launching rockets filled with my most precious materials to the skies and bringing back buckets of cash and my opponent didn't. I coud see the flashing, red percentage next to my enemy's name, noting how close they were to buying me out. I managed to buy a bit of my enemy's stock. But, it was still going to cost 2 million to win. I sold EVERYTHING, making a little bit here, a little bit there. I looked to the right: 70%, 80%, 90%... 99%. That's it! 2 million!!! Buy, buy, buy. I won. What.\n\nI've read some reviews where people don't seem to understand why prices go up or down and don't understand some of the core mechanics of the game, so I just wanted to clear a few things up.\nThere are 2-8 companies in each match, with a colony at the center. All goods start at a certain price. If players buy more of one resource, it goes up in price. If they sell a lot, it goes down. The colony also expands as the game goes on and each building they create has specific demands that also affect the market prices.\nEach player chooses one of four types of headquarters, each with their own abilities. The game is based on isometric tiles and when you start the game, you'll only have a few claims to own the tiles you choose. By leveling up your base from level 1 to level 5, you get more claims to diversify and increase production. At max level, you can build an offworld market that launches rockets into space. This secondary market isn't affected by supply and demand, it just has permanatly high prices. This makes it a very lucridive end game to reach and pile up enough money to buy out your opponents.\n\nThe game is a tense, corporate competition that has so many ways to play, allowing you to build a vast mining corporation, an electronic manufacturing titan, or a chemical lab empire. You can upgrade everything, specialize or diversify, build quick and unstable, or slow and steady; the game offers a ton of ways to replay. This is a fantastic strategy game that isn't much like any major game out there and is tons of fun with friends. The AI is pretty tough, though.","September 25, 2015","true","50.4"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","33","40","2","3"

Every game is race to that end. Look at my hours in the game 1.8, I played several games and that is how long it took to win in each game. So there is no depth here, its a short sweet economic race game, with the finishing post being he who owns everything wins. It also runs rather hot too even on my well cooled system.\n\nI have not seen anything to suggest the game is getting more depth added prior to release. So I think this game will ultimately disappoint users who find them selves paying close to £30 for a game thats barely worth £4. There is going to be backlash over the price, just wait and see.","April 23, 2015","false","1.8"," 70 of 103 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","70","103","0","5"

Matches will take around 15-30 minutes depending on how many people you are playing with. This is not a epic-scale game like Civilization!  So you, the player can choose between 4 different factions. The 4 different factions are: Expansive, Robotic, Scientific and Scavenger. Every factions has there ups and downs and you want to use the best faction that you think is good on set random map.\n\nGameplay:\n-Ingame you will have a market window on the left for all the market prices and all the rescource units you might have. This is where all the buying and selling will be taken place.\n-In the middle of the screen is where most of the action takes plays. On the map you build buildings that produce rescources which cost claims where you have limited number of. Because of this you need to plan your way through\n-On the right top side is where you and other players companies stocks are. The goal to win a game is very simple. Buy every other company out by buying there stock. Each company has 10 stocks. You can buy someone out by having a majority of there stock (6 stocks=60%) or if they bought there own 5 stocks already, you can buy those 5 stocks, double the price, in 1 go.\n-To combat the company that is leading a match there is something called the blackmarket. The blackmarket is on the right bottom side of the screen and will have a set of different items. Some items are there for to shutdown the production of your opponents or to boost your own production.\n\nWhat has the game to Offer?:\n-9 Tutorials which are very well done and explain you the game. after every tutorial you pass it will be a bit harder for you which is nice.\n-Campaign which consist of 9 different leaders which have there own set of different buildings. You play 6 different matches where you buy into the colony and not a Company. After that there is a final match where you need to buyout the remaining 3 companies. Note: prices are going to be crazy in this mode. Campaign takes about 4-5 hours.\n-Skirmish mode up to 8 Players.\n-Daily Challenge. Everyone gets the same map and restrictions and you will be competing to get the best time. There is also a leaderboard for that and you can watch replays from other players to see what they did differently.\n-Ranking System(online). 1vs1 is available on Monday through Thursday and 4 FFA Friday through Sunday.\n-Custom Lobby games(online). Just skirmish matches with your own rules against real people or with/against AI.\n-Well balanced AI\n-Different types of game modes.","May 2","true","785.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","1"

There are options that allow for longer games but the design is based on short cutthroat matches over long empire building.\n\nThat being said the game is fantastic!\n\nThe single player enviroment is rich is choices.  You can play a campaign at a difficulty of your choosing that goes through 7 matches each with carry over conditions and abilities.  This forces you to mix up your playing style and adjust to different situations.  You will be restricted in building choices as well, so learning to make do with what you have is important.  The game ends after a final showdown where you are allowed to buy out your rivals.  This mode is very fun and less stressfull then the other match types.\n\nSkirmish and multiplayer allow you to buy out your rivals from the start (this is how you win the game).  With a dynamic market then the game is all about spotting oppertunities and taking advantage or knee capping your opponents with targeted special abilites on their structures.\n\nThe game has a setting that allows you to hide the real identity of each player to prevent grudge matches from getting out of hand for a reason!!\n\n\nThe game is fast, but very deep, you tend to get time to think about your decisions despite the time pressure.  Production chains are rather simple, but the overall interaction of the market and the 13 resources allows for immense possibilities.  No two matches are ever alike.\n\nThe game is pretty unique and I really do not have anything else that scratches the same kind of itch (Anno series comes the closest, but the markets are pretty stale in comparision).\n\nIf you like schemes like shutting down your rivals water production shortly after causing a spike in water prices with the ultimate goal of making their food production too expensive to compete with yours, then well, you have found your dream game.\n\nTo me this game is a 10/10 for this type of game, but it is not for everyone, expecially people who do not like competitive games.","May 3","true","20.0"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

The initial game is relatively simplistic. Build a base on mars with the resource nodes available on the map while trying to make money by selling those same resources for money. You can only hold so many plots of land at a time so you have to build your economy in a narrow frame of what you want to do with the space you have. Resources gain more and more value over time but every time a player, or the ai sells something it lowers the value of the resource. The game is a modicum of a real world stock market and economy but simpler and faster.\n\nThe game has a lot of interesting depth and complexity to these simple mechanics. There is the push/pull of using your resources more quickly to advance your base vs selling them to have cash on hand. You can prioritize basic resources for your base in the early game that have less value later or prioritize the pricier resources for cash. Playing on maps with restricted resources forces you to change how you approach making money. Off world shipping is worth bank late game when selling basics like foods but requires advance components and resources to make. It requires a good timing on when to have what resources in production in order to maximize profit. One corporation only uses robots which requires no food to operate and less water but it means a higher requirement for advance resources. This means dedicating less land plots to cheaper basic resources but a higher cash cost early game.\n\nIf aggresively manipulating economies to your benefit, moving resources for money, or aggressively selling your own stock in order to gain quick cash to make deals and then buying it back and throwing cash at your opponents in hostile takeover does not sound interesting then this game is not for you. Otherwise go nuts. Also the game has beautifully simple graphics.","February 17","true","26.0"," 43 of 60 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","43","60","2","1"

And I will admit, I took that with a grain of salt but holy cow is every game the definition of linear.  Get to HQ5, build 2 rocket pads and sell stuff till you can buy someone out.  After you buy someone out it is literally an easy win if not outright impossible (if the player is good) to lose the game.  Very little room for play/counter-play is basically a big issue.\n\nThe game is so under developed that there isnt many Pros to the Cons for this game.  I find it annoying that a developer wants to crowdsource their development.\n\nOne big thing this game is lacking is an actual supply and demand.  I can debt materials out of thin air.  At least they could make all resources actually match the surpluss (or shortage) of stuff in the game.  For example.  If no one built power, stuff should just go unpowered, instead of debting power from some magical source that produces it.  This thought can be carried over into every other resource.  If I want to buy iron, the market better have a surplus of it, such as another play sold 200 iron "to the market" so that now any other player can now buy that 200 iron at some market price and if it is gone, welp its gone (till someone else sells some).  THIS IS THE KEY PART OF THE GAME PLAY THAT I EXPECTED WHEN I STARTED PLAYING.  Sadly this game is more about "get the most money" from selling ♥♥♥♥ to the aether instead of economic warfare.\n\nDebt is really meh in the game, especially if you dont have TIGHTER DEBT rule on.  My friend -- when he played with me -- had to get over 300k debt from an auction (that apparently can go onto infinity) before it started to seriously effect his stockprice.\n\nStocks dont do anything other than protect (delay) you from losing or to take control of another player.  There is no reason to really do anything with Stocks till later in the game.  Realistically it should yield dividends (if you owned other people's stock) for example.  It should be a risk/reward factor -- do I keep my stock in this player to yield dividends and I black market this other player to keep them down while I build up or do I sell now from this guy so I can outright buy this other guy.  This thought process never happens the way stocks are used in this game.  It is always "I will just wait to get more money (from selling stuff) and buy this guy outright".\n\nWhile the developers have some odd understanding that a minimap and/or player distinction (EVERYONE LOOKS THE SAME) is not imporant, I am left clueless at to this Warcraft 3, Starcraft 2 and Age of Empires "RTS" they have played without a minimap or such distinguishing features between players.

While other games in the genre require constant study of builds as the meta shifts, here the randomized maps and varied strategies from opponents force players to play each round differently. Whereas one match might see the price of food skyrocket you to victory, the next match might find food barely worth the cost of the building. The player most able to see and take advantage of gaps in the market wins.\n\nThe result is a game that still makes me sweat after 200 matches played, yet even when I lose I still enjoy myself.

A game that dares to break the rules, it's not quite a 4x and it's not quite an RTS, and yet it's got elements of both, as well as a very brutal and brilliant introduction into capitalism in it's most true sense.\n\nThe creator of this was the lead designer of Civ IV, still widely regarded as the pinnacle of the series and still very much fondly remembered by many to this day (and often still played by many, it's got a dedicated following, mods and glorious goodies, it's still fantastic, if you don't have Civ IV, please get it). He's brought a very unique approach to this game and has effectively talen the spirit of M.U.L.E. and brought it back, shaken it up and presented us with a entirely new set of concepts to learn and re-learn.\n\nThe game plays out over a martian map, randomly generated from various landscapes made up of craters, dried riverbeds and valleys that do a fairly solid impression of conveying the martian scene, as well as various terrain that can be covered in ice, certain areas will be marked with resource node icons indicating they are of potential exploitative value for various minerals.  Arranged on a hex grid, you'll immediately be put in mind of old strategy games, but the comparison ends there. There are no units to control, at all. You only build things.\n\nA non combat 4X, is this even possible? Say whaaaaaaaaaat?\nYes. I'll repeat that. You only build things. In this game, your structures are your units in effect. Your mines, your colony buildings, and your economy represents your "arsenal" and "weaponry". This makes for a frenetic early game as everyone jumps into the map blind, all arriving at the starport with nary but a blank map and the ability to scan in a limited range and for a limited number of times (these recharge over time, but you're effectively capped to a number of 'hops'), you'll see tantalising highlights on the horizon suggesting possible mineral nodes, but you won't KNOW what they are unless you scan right over them.\n\nThis presents the first risk/reward mechanic, because the very early stages are a gold rush, do you take your time and map out the area, performing a thorough survey and pick the best spot (and risk losing it by accident to a lucky colonist) or do you jump at the first spot that "looks good" and risk sacrificing a better opportunity later on?\n\nDuring the early game, you'll be moving fairly quickly to make the optimal use of your initial claims, working out the best places to put down mines, whether you're best off setting up colony infrastructure or buying in the resources you need whilst you export minerals, again, these are all choices you have to balance, and the economics are very fluid. The game operates an exceptionally liquid supply and demand based market that fluctuates very quickly based on what is sold and what is required by the people off planet, so taking advantage of peaks in the market, and stocking up when there's a glut can make for excellent trading strategies on top of the usual manufacturing gigs.\n\nAs the game progresses you'll be offered auctions on patents, black market goods, pirates will offer their services, and the game settles into a reasonable pace, it's not too brisk that you'll be panicking over keypresses, and you'll usually have more than enough time to plan your moves, but it's juuuust fast enough that you'll not start feeling bored or that there's a lull in the action. The pace even now feels just right, and the game even at this Early Access stage feels amazingly well refined. The AI is also brutal, which makes for some excellent and tense singleplayer matches (and if you're not careful, amazingly short ones, the AI knows when to strike and buy you out, with scary precision).\n\nThe economy has a solid enough set of gears that you can work through as you expand, moving up through basic goods at first, and then you can decide to diversify, thus preventing your company from becoming exposed to the fluctuations or even possible manipulations of the market, or you can specialise in luxury goods, with the aim of striking it rich when demand is at it's highest. If, and it's a big if, you do this well, the rewards are huge, and in an RTS, would be the equivalent of nuking the base, here you win with money. Earn more than your opponent, buy them out and crush them.\n\nThis is where the true nature of the game comes to the fore, as a lesson in future capitalism, it's bold, and even at times cruel, but perhaps a very good mirror to hold up and show what can happen if the only guiding force is the market, as a game, this makes it a brilliant and unique concept, and as an Early Access product, well, it's far from "Early" in my eyes. This game feels very much close to completion, they're more talking about fleshing out the multiplayer, getting the pacing and balancing just right and layering on the polish (this game needs polish?!?! WHERE?). Truth be told, it feels very polished as it is, there's a few graphical glitches but these are -minor-.\n\nYes, the cost of entry is high, but for once, this is a game that actually justifies the entry fee.\n\nClosing thoughts\nThis is a rare case where Early Access actually is a literal application of the term, you're paying to get Early Access to the almost complete product, and to provide feedback that helps shape it before it goes to the final version. Balancing, tweaking, and providing strategic insight to the developers, who have been listening and responding, and watching in kind.\n\nIt's a very good example of how Early Access in a "shortform" approach should work (there's plenty of longer form SEA games that have done well such as Prison Architect, but that's a seperate discussion). As a result I really have little hesitation putting the paws up for this one, it's a genuinely brilliant game and it brings something different to the table, which it should be commended for.\n\nCurrent verdict : Highly recommended, and ignore the Early Access sticker, there's nothing Early about this game, it's very much in an end-to-end playable state","February 12, 2015","true","5.0"," 46 of 66 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","46","66","0","6"

We want to know how players are going to break the game, suss out any degenerate strategies, and make sure we polish every rough edge off of the gameplay. Offworld Trading Company is fully funded; we are not relying on Early Access sales to finish the game.” This statement is key.\n\n***\nFor those of you who have been burned by early access games before please take the note from the Devs seriously. This is a very playable and stable game right now and they already have the resources to put the finishing touches on it. So you are not really paying to make the game, you are getting an early shot at the game and a chance to drive further balance into the system. The final quality of this game will depend heavily on balancing the PVP aspects of the game so the more feedback they have now the better.\nAs far as this being a RTS; while it might be the closest term we have to define it, that will give many people the wrong idea. There are no units to move, no combat, and no chokepoints. You establish a base and build buildings to harvest resources (much like the Warhammer:Dawn of War series) and use those resources to develope higher teir commdities to eventually sell for cash and buy out your opponents. It is fast paced and at times will feel like a RTS, but traditional RTS tactics will fail for the most part.\nThe key is that the prices that determine which resource is the 'win' resource will depend on the strat adapted by the players in the game and will change from game to game. There are no Ultimate Resources that win the game each time. The higher teir products will usually have a higher price, but if everyone in that game chases them then the price will plummet and the player sitting on a pile of low teir resources can dominate. Basically the L33T strat that everyone wants to use will neuter itself before it can win.\n\nMy current concerns:\nThe pace of the game is very aggressive for a strategy game. The pace can be adjusted and I have only played against the AI with their GHz brains, but knowing PVP types this could quickly devolve into a 'who can spam out the first 3 correct buildings' contest.\nThe interface needs to do a better job of letting the player know whats going on. There are some pretty nasty things lurking on the Black Market and all you get is a chat box type readout to announce them and maybe an onscreen animation if you happen to be looking at that part of the map at the time. The trick is to find the balance where we get the info we need without getting our screen spammed out by alerts.

This is not a game for everyone and the price point isn't for everyone, either.\n\nThe description reads that the game is complete and only looking to do polish and balancing.  In my eyes, the game is not complete, and shouldn't be deemed complete.  For $40 CAD, Offworld Trading Company will make your chequebook scream.  The sheer lack of content in this game at present doesn't make this feel like a $40 game; however, this may be the "spoiled adult" in me talking - It cost more to buy M.U.L.E. for the C64 back in the day, and it has far less.\n\nFor starters, everyone fights for the same resources, to produce the same few marketable goods.  This is, of course, the entire premise of the game, but I don't feel it's done correctly.  The game really boils down to "Who clicks faster."  You have the same relative strategy among all the other players, no matter the race you play: Build necessary starting materials to upgrade your HQ, buy materials that are dirt cheap and sell materials that are pricey.  The lack of materials and race specializations may be the downfall here, because once you fall behind the competition, winning becomes unattainable.  Since everyone is fighting for the same resources, whoever dominated the market first, wins; you may as well just resign.\n\nYou are given dirty underhanded tricks to try and slow down the competition, with ever increasing cost as they are used.  That, in itself, is another problem.  The profiteer gets to use these features to their hearts content - they're making the money, after all.  As they use these features against you to continue pushing themselves ahead, the underhanded tricks end up costing more - something you obviously cannot afford - putting the balance in the hands of the first place position.\n\nYou may be wondering, "Wow, he's whining a lot about losing a game!" and no, I've won my fair share, both against the A.I. and humans; I write this from both perspectives.  If you get ahead of someone, you literally can continue to open the gap between yourself and second place, just because I landed on that Iron first.  I truly did not find the game enjoyable when I was trouncing my competition; it was far more fun when we were on equal footing, needing to make quick decisions to outwit each other.\n\nI still give this game a positive recommendation.  After all is said and done, I very much enjoyed myself playing Offworld Trading Company in its current state.  I cannot say I will ever play it again though, which is why the $40 price tag seems extremely steep.  This is one of those games that you will love to play a lot and never play again.  As much as I would love to launch it in future, after having figured out "how to win," the game has lost all flavour due to its extreme lack of content.\n\nShould the developers revisit the economy and add an abundance more resources, giving all players a chance to compete, then I feel this would be an exceptional real-time strategy game.  Until then however, this is a game of it's own genre: Real-time clicking competition.","February 14, 2015","true","13.4"," 39 of 56 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","39","56","0","0"

This is not an economic game, this is not a simulation game, this is not a trading game, and this is not a base building game.  This is a very fast paced, micro-intensive RTS.\n\nIts an interesting take on the RTS genre, because you don't have any units to control.  But make no mistake, this game plays very similarly to one of the micro practice maps for SC2, and uses essentially the same skillset.  Its just that instead of microing units around a map, you're constantly scanning the map, spamming abilities, and hitting the buy/sell button.

The Black Market items just make the game stressful as, if you're the highest ranked player for the mission, you will inevitably be targeted repeatedly by the other three AI players, making it nearly impossible to manage your resources. Even if you are doing really well and own all the stock in your own company in a skirmish, another player can still somehow buy stock in your company that shouldn't even be for sale and win the game. The claim system is completely hampering the ability to play the game as it is portrayed in the videos. There's just too small of a map and too limited of resources to enjoy the act of building up a company or colony. The missions are over so quickly I feel no satisfaction even if I win.\nYes, most RTS's are military games, but there is an econmic angle to them as well. The strongest economies are usually the winners. This game substitutes the lack of tanks and turrets for Black Market items that blow up buildings, temporarily disable them or capture them for other players. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT. There is no difference between this game and a military RTS except that this game is not fun, not realistic in the aspects of building up a company or the ability to focus on a single resource chain / manufacturing process, and it is over so quickly it leaves you wondering why you just spent 30-45 minutes playing a "week" mission in a compaign that makes you start all over again the next week with some "upgraded" capabilities.\nI spent one skirmish (because I wanted to play with all available buildings) only to find that by the time that I could start launching items into space for selling offworld (the best way to make money in the game by far) that the other computer player had already bought out the other two companies (which I had bought stock in, but could no longer as they were now 'subsidiaries' of the main company) and proceeded to blow up my only launchpad (because, again, limited building claims) with the black market dynomite option even though it was protected with the Goon Squad (the only defensive measure in the game that you have to continually and immediately purchase after each attack [which is an extremely ridiculous option considering the computer can repeatedly attack you faster than you can click to purchase and place your defense against this).\nMaybe I haven't given this game enough time to understand it completely, but, as an experienced gamer of RTS's. I found this game difficult to understand, unintuitive in controls and concepts, not fun (for previously mentioned reasons), and regretted buying it immediately.\nHopefully this game has a major overhaul by the time it goes into full version, but I will not be playing it again and hope that I get my refund.","March 18","false","1.5"," 70 of 111 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","70","111","6","5"

I don't shy away from early access games and I've had more than a few that never really progressed as I hoped/expected, but most I feel I at least get my money's worth out of them, but at $35, this is one of the few I definitely regret picking up.\n\nIt's not really a bad game and it is an interesting concept, but the sacrifices the developers have made to make matches fit into 20-30 minutes have made the gameplay chaotic and often times inconsistent... not things that are typically appreciated in an economic game, competitive real-time or not. It also lacks any decent mechanisms to defend yourself from sabatoge or simply being bought out once the bulk cash transactions start coming in in the late game, so winning or losing a match can be both frustrating and unsatisfying. You can carefully manuever yourself into an advantageous position to corner a market on a resource or disrupt an opponent's supply chain but then you get 75k from one offworld shipment of a base resource like oxygen, dump all your resources on the market, and hit a + button a couple times and win without any of it mattering.\n\nThe game definitely lacks depth and each match usually hinges completely on the base materials like glass or power. Regardless of which resources are the focus on any given match, the gameplay is mostly the same every time. It can be fun and it does have potential if the developers are open to some design changes, but it is simply not worth $35 or more right now and I seriously doubt it ever will be.\n\nI would love to be wrong and see great things happen for this game as development continues, but right now, I can not recomment it.","February 14, 2015","false","5.7"," 62 of 97 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","62","97","2","1"

Use your cash buy shares in completing companies eventually taking them over and reigning supreme as the only corporation left standing.\nThere is no combat system as such, no need to furiously click your way to victory, however there is a Black Market function where you can buy various items to either slow you opponents down, like an EMP to freeze his/her factories for a short time or mutiny their power plant glassworks, taking those tasty profits for yourself.  Other items will give you a boost, increasing your production or a goon squad to catch those stinking saboteurs.

This is like a solid £15 indie title currently, Its just a nice concept that could get boring after maybe 10 hours play at a push,it is fun with some friends which can extend its play value to a point but I'd wait for some content updates, if theyll be any...\n\nPros:\n\nNice art style\nFun crashing the markets\nFun teaming up with friends to price fix\nConcept\n\nCons:\n\nContent (lack of)\nCampaign\nVariety\nMaps (samey really even with the map pack)\nUI\nPrice","April 29","false","6.2"," 49 of 75 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","49","75","2","6"

They definitely have a lot of work to do before the game releases. I wouldn't term this is an economy game. This is an attack your opponent RTS, but the attacks are different than your standard RTS. I was expecting a laid back economic builder in the sim city fashion that was a real-time game. This is more of a fast paced eliminate your opponent game like your regular combat RTS.\n\nPlaying on the easiest difficulty and the game on slow speed I feel rushed. If I do not start buying out my opponents quickly they will buy me out. My games typically last 30 minutes to an hour because the AI pushes the game so fast. If I go any slower I will lose.\n\nI find it difficult to beat the computer. I feel like I have to use exploits to even have a chance. The way I am able to beat the computer is to find the least populated resource and build my base on it to reduce the amount even more. Then I claim all that I can of the remaining. This slows the computer down a little bit and will allow me to prolong the game. I have never played on anything except the lowest difficulty because of how challenging it is.\n\nIf you are looking for a casual economic game then this is probably not what you are looking for. If you are looking for a fast paced RTS that the first 5 minutes of game play can make or break you then this might be it for you. There are a lot of much better RTS' out there. As an economic builder I don't think this games is going to appeal to the type of casual player that would be interested in economic builders.\n\nGame stability? The game has crashed on me about 5 times while I was playing tonight over the course of about 5 hours.\n\nThis game is supposedly in Alpha. If it is truly in alpha then they are still planning to add more content to the game. If they are just fine tuning, bug testing, and performance optimizing then this is not in alpha. If it's alpha then I look forward to the complete game. If this is beta then I'm disappointed.\n\nIf you have $40 to spare and would like something to do for a day or two then I would pick this up. If you have high expectations for this purchase then I would suggest waiting to buy.","February 25, 2015","false","16.3"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","1"

As of yet the game is very short in content. One can spend roughly 3 hours in it before one has seen everything and a feeling of "this needs more time in development" settles in. The only reason I personally spent more time on this was from coming back for matches between patches to see what they added (and it wasn't much, mostly balance adjustments and bug fixes). The developers consider the game "feature complete" and in doing so crush any hope of new game mechanics to broaden gameplay.\nWould rate the experience 4 out of 10, in particularly in hindsight of the the high price for the small game one gets in return.\n\n\n\nLong version:\nOffworld Trading Company has the complexity of a typical smartphone or board game with a tedious buy/sell minigame in the form of juggling various goods around. Player influence on total econonmy or pricing is negligible - you can not corner a market or establish a strategic monopoly as it's always possible to buy resources from the market, even if nobody supplies them. A single match is roughly 30 minutes in duration but can take up to 40 in rare cases. Gameplay is heavily streamlined to remain within tight confines.\n\nTo illustrate a few mechanics:\nUpon starting a match one has to scan the map to uncover its limited resource fields, quickly slam down a base building and then build extractors on resource deposits. Automated NPC ships haul the harvested resource back to the HQ once the extractor building is full. Those units can not be interacted with directly (except for a very rare piracy action card one can win in a random auction to steal enemy supplies for a short duration) and merely exist as a visual way to see when the next resource-"tick" happens. They are the only units on the map, everything else is just buildings.\n\nThere is a limit over how many tiles of the map you can build on as building on a tile consumes "claims" - you start with a handfull of those and only get a handful more for upgrading your HQ, which in return only has 4 steps and stops at level 5. A few screenshots on the Store page show how small the fully upgraded "base" will get. As buildings give an output adjaciency bonus one just builds a cluster of similar buildings and spreads out the other clusters of different types to avoid getting targeted by expensive sabotage actions players can buy (with a cooldown), such as EMP strikes.\n\nThe match itself is won by buying out the competition. This starts by acquiring "shares" of the enemy company - the total amount of shares each company has can be adjusted with difficulty settings but is typically 10. The more shares one owns the cheaper will be the final takeover - that option simply becomes unlocked once all shares have been bought by someone (no matter if a company bought its own shares or someone else did) - there is no way to prevent takeover, even if the company is doing well financially, as long as the enemy has enough cash on hand to buy one out. This means one could lose if an enemy simply stops spending cash very early to rush a buyout while one would rather upgrade and then have the stronger income/economy to win in the long run. This sounds more complex than it is but at its core feels unrefined and gets boring rather quickly.\n\nIn technical regards the game is very simple and seems to be made in the Unity Engine 4 - as such it only supports single threading, has greatly limited scale of maps and environments, medicore visual fidelity and tacked-on UI. At this stage the UI seems extremely clunky - I'd have hoped it's a placeholder but as they are adjusting and updating it while adding new buttons I somehow get the feeling they'll keep it this way.\nThe current voice files are text-to-speech placeholders with awkward pronounciation but are the most memorable feature of the game - sentences like "Just look at all the money." from a creepy robot voice are simply hilarious.\n\nAll in all it feels like the designers behind this project had a nifity idea but no great vision with merely a few simple game systems in spirit of a board game in their heads - the blanks have been filled with convoluted mechanics. I do not believe the developers will give it a complete overhaul between now and release and as such can not recommend a purchase.","July 8, 2015","false","28.5"," 37 of 56 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","37","56","0","3"

I know it is still in Early Access but it doesn't look like it will change much more until the final release. After all it appears pretty much finished so far.\n\nFirst of all, this game is fun. Actually I like the game style. It is reminds pretty much on playing Civ.\nThe problem is, where Civ offers a very wide variety of gameplay elements (from war, over diplomacy, economy, religion etc.) this game only took the economic part of if.\nThis unfortunately offers very little replay value. You basically start every game somewhere on the map, building all type of "farms" for resources and hope for the best.\nMy biggest problem however is that the interaction with the other companies (e.g. players) is very limited and comes only to light when they are buying a spot of good resources you were looking after.\nSo then, you end up in a skirmish of selling recources when you can in order to make money and buy the other company shares in order to win.\nThis looks every game more or less the same because all the elements that made Civ so great are missing.\nThe only interaction are a few "illegal" actions like sabotage you might do. But even this has limited effect (e.g. the opponent's mines are blocked for a minute).\nThe game offers no diplomacy (not even on an economic way like making a syndicate, negotiation or trading agreements like I offer you electricity in order to get better offers for your steel producion) or corporate espionage (like stealing other players inventions). After all the game goes very quick (a game might take 30 - 90 minutes. So there is no grand strategy like investing in late-game infrastructure / units etc. Just a bit of research can be done which basically leads to improved production (e.g. instead of 10 electricity, the power plant offers 15).\nThis leads after all to the strategy of building your own variety of buildings in order to be best prepared for changing prices (if you sell stuff, the price drops) so you might sell what ever looks best at the moment.\n\nTo come to a conclusion, this game looks promising. I really like the style, it is easy to start with - no real need for many tutorials but even if you need some, it is done quickly. Still it lacks of gameplay.\nSo for the time being, I can only reccomend the game for fans of economic realtime strategy gamers (even though there are no units to control).\nFor people who are looking for another Civ-like game with grand strategy, long term multiplayer sessions with different victory conditions, this game is unfortunately not what you are looking for.\n","December 9, 2015","false","3.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","1"

This is not really a tycoon game because it's not about gradually building your business over time. Instead each game is a short (30 to 60 minute) race against your competitors to see who can buy out each other's companies first, by setting up an effective and efficient organisation.\n\nYou do this by producing, buying and selling resources in such a way that ensures profits in the short and long term. Everything you do has a benefit and a cost, using resources but producing them at the same time. You need to ensure that you read and predict market trends so that you are producing the right goods at the right time. It's all about supply and demand. If electricity is scarce and you're not producing your own, you'll end up spending a fortune buying it. If the market is flooded with food you might as well buy it rather than waste land and resources to make it yourself. Likewise, if there is a fuel shortage and you are producing a lot of fuel, you can make a lot of money selling it at high prices.\n\nDon't let the simple (thought nice) graphics and animations fool you, there is a lot to this game. The depth and complexity makes it both fun and intelectually stimulating. The best part is that no two games are the same, and there are several strategies that you can successfully use to win. Also, what worked for you last time might not work for you in the next game. This is emergent gameplay at it's best.\n\nThere isn't much to dislike about this game, as an economic simulation it is unique and well balanced. It will take you about an hour or two to really get into the game and to appreciate why it is so good. That said, for the average player the full price (40 USD) is definitely a bit steep. It is still early access though so it might be a different story once the full release is out.","March 18","true","12.3"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","29","42","3","0"

Why do I mention this first? Because the best RTSs I've played have loosely defined stages that allow for depth of strategy at each step. Available funds  are precious early in a match and there are several outlets to utilize these funds. You can upgrade early to try and get a lead in resource gathering, you can use the black market to shut down your opponent's income, or you can manipulate the market to make it more costly for other players to catch up to you. As the game progresses, the options available to you also expand, and strategies abound.\n\nThe mid-game in Offworld Trading Company is where the most important blows start being traded. In order to ensure your company is not bought, you must purchase and hold onto at least 5 of your own stock (which then have to be bought out all at the same time in order for another player to remove you from the game); however, the money available to you to buy your own stock could also be used to take out another player by beating them to 6 of their stock. This makes decisions on who to buy stock in, whether to purchase your own stock, or whether to continue to upgrade to get a lead in the late game potentially deadly. If the wrong choice is made, other players will take advantage of your mistakes.\n\nLate game, if the game hasn't already been decided by the mid-game brawl, comes down to endurance. Each remaining player's goal is to get enough money to buy out the others before being bought themselves. There are several advanced buildings in Offworld Trading Company that allow for varying strategies to accomplish this task and, depending on the state of the market, each strategy has a place and can allow for you to outspend your opponents.\n\nAn economic RTS is a fairly unexplored idea, so be prepared to endure a fairly high learning curve before becoming competent in the gameplay. I'm sure most of what I've mentioned in the paragraphs above means very little to someone who hasn't played Offworld Trading Company , but the point is to show the depth of gameplay Offworld Trading Company allows for.\n\nSo, let's break this game into its parts:\n\nContent: 5/10\nMultiplayer is where this game shines. There is a campaign mode, but it is currently very limited.\nAnimations: 9/10\nThere is little animation in the game, but what has been done is done well.\nGraphics/Artwork/Illustrations: 9/10\nOnce again, there are few graphical elements required for this style of game, but the graphics are this gen. and well done.\nGameplay: 10/10\nLoads of depth to multiplayer games, and a good pacing built in to the gameplay.\nControls:10/10\nI would only give less than a 10 in this category if there was no ability to change hotkeys or the controls were unresponsive/glitchy. Although I do not like the layout of the default hotkeys, I don't consider that a reason to downgrade this category.\nReliability: 8/10\nThe game is still early access and some bugs are being worked out. There are some issues with making lobbies and changing hosts mid-game that are being worked out, as well as a few smaller glitches.\nUser Interface (UI): 9/10\nVery well put together to give an overview of how the game is progressing as well as easy access to your options. I took away a point because I think that the notification system could use some work when you are targeted by the black market or a shortage/surplus occurs.\nMusic and Sounds: 10/10\nSome sounds are still being created, but the recently added new music and the completed sounds are very well done.\nOriginality: 10/10\nI can only imagine how difficult it must be to enter a new sub-genre into the books. Soren Johnson and his team have done a great job in developing this original idea.\nCommunity Vibe: 10/10\nThe developers listen closely to player feedback and are very active on the forums. The game is updated on a regular basis and has improved with each iteration.\n\nTotal Score: 90/100\n\nIf you're a fan of RTSs or enjoy market manipulation, I can highly recommend this game to you. If you enjoy a challenge, Offworld Trading Company will provide it to you.

Apparently, Black Tuesday has been a hot, recent scholastic topic.  After a quick discussion, we agreed that we’d give Offworld a go.  I've owned this game for about a year, having bought two copies right before it came into alpha, and played it with friends and my kids.  I enjoyed my initial experiences, but I only put about six hours into the game then.  Like Civ4, I didn't play this game too much at first, probably because I didn't really know what I was doing, and it was so new.  Now, like Civ4 (BTS especially), I'm hooked.  This game is accessible for anyone who can read and comprehend math, and has 20-50 minutes to spend.  The map and black market randomizations, plus the different faction choices and patent auctions insure that no game is ever like a previous one, and if you are playing against friends or family, be prepared for them to not speak to you for a while if it’s you doing the backstabbing.  In short, this is a great game designed and inspired by great game designers, and I highly recommend it.  Offworld Trading Company is the first game that got my kids to stop playing CS GO, and start plotting against each other through intrigue and economic espionage.  In my world, that means something.","October 25, 2015","true","47.6"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","24","35","8","1"

You build your "city" over terrain that offers various resources with the goal of growing your access to valuable ones while also being able to afford the industry.  A nice big patch of Iron, just ripe for mining?  Do you have the water, power, and electricity that you'll need to run that mine?  Can you buy those needs with the profits from that mine?  Up to you to figure it out.  Throw in competitors who will attempt to get there first, or sabotage you if you get there first, and you have a challenging economic game.\n\nThe interface and general gameplay information is simple enough to use (it is NOT a spreadsheet simulator at all!), very similar to the Civilization series, and you can get into the game very quickly.\n\nA couple of things on the downside, however.  There is very, very little explanation for what you'll need to do or why you need to do it.  The first few games had me box myself into a corner because there was no explanation covering what you'll need to start a basic successful colony/company.  I still don't know how to hire specialists (required in order to build certain buildings) because the game tells me I need them, but not how to get them.   It's also very difficult to visually see what your opponents are doing; there's a scrolling bar of text that gives you updates, but it's not particularly useful while you're trying to manage 100 other things just to stay afloat.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, so I cannot speak to that.\n\nOverall, definitely recommended if this is your cup of tea.","February 12, 2015","true","4.1"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

Dispels the notion that strategy=violence."\n\nLonger Form: I am an economics student in graduate school and a sci-fi fan, so as far as I'm concerned OTC was designed specifically for me. The economics & finance in the game is not only fun, but educational and facsinating if you have an interest in those subjects.\nI love the strategy genre, and have for years, but having a genre so closely tied to violence: Total War, Company of Heroes, Starcraft, Age of Empires, etc. has always bugged me a little bit. Not because I'm a pacifist, but because it takes away from strategic depth to have such a simple zero-sum mechanic at the core of gameplay. With OTC there are not such clear and basic decisions. In a war game: produce units, more is almost always better. In contrast, OTC can't be won, even on the easiest difficulties, by spamming one type of production. You'll inevitably over-supply that commodity and shrink your profits on each sale down to next to nothing while paying through the nose on whatever inputs are associated with that commodity. Simply put, there's more strategic depth.\nThe art style is nice, it is simple as of right now and realistically rendered, I wonder whether there is room to convey information more through the art than is currently done. For instance if the ships transporting resources could convey more about their cargo to lessen the emphasis on the ever-present charts.\n\nNote on Early Access: As always, monitor reviews and update logs to note that devs are making progress, but as of the time of writing this review, they are very active and seem to be constantly tweaking and making improvements.\n\nA few minor gripes: 1.) My computer is not a world-beater, but can handle most any games on medium or high, however OTC gives me a little trouble with frame-rate so I've had to go down to low settings, which is a shame for such a pretty game.\n2.) In-game UI could use some poish, main menus and what not are gorgeous so I have faith that these will get better.\n\n\nRecommendation: If you like strategy games you should do one of two things: 1.) Buy it 2.) Wait until it comes out of Early Access, then buy it.","March 20, 2015","true","15.4"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

As a whole, this game feels more like a fantastic foundatation for a spectacularly complex trading sim versus what it actually offers.  Do not be fooled, you will devour this game in its entirety in a matter of hours.  It does not hold a candle to the complexity and depth that the Civ titles (and other leading titles) have to offer.\n\nI purchased the deluxe edition of this game (on sale) for 39.59.  Within a matter of 2 days had not only beaten the campaign, but had exhausted (unless I missed something) every aspect of playability and replay value that the game has to offer.  A more reasonable price for what this game actually has to offer, at least in single player mode, is more like $10-15.\n\nI found that I had lost the desire to keep playing after a very small amount of time.  I even stuck with it for a bit longer just to see if there was more that I perhaps had missed...turns out I found no reason to keep playing beyond the couple days I devoted to mastering it.  As a fan of the genre, I had high hopes of progress, strategy, and replay value that the best RTS/stragegy/sim/farming/economic games have to offer.\n\nThis review is not meant to ONLY bash the game.  With more content, resources, campaign options, and other things of this nature, this game could be epic.  In reality it's nothing more than a foundation for what could be an absolutely fantastic game of depth and strategy.  I would recommend this game only when the price is reduced to something more befitting of a game that lacks everything that was mentioned above.\n\nIn summary, this game is great and certainly worth playing, but only if the price is right for what the consumer can get out of it.  As of right now however, it feels incomplete and very limited as far as play choices, resources, strategy, economy, variability, and overall complexity,  Kind of sad that its almost over before it begins...\n\nI am recommending this game because of its uniqueness and potential but on a scale of 1-10 this game is a 4, at least for the price.","May 9","true","24.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It is right up my alley and I thought it would be a blast. Unfortunately not.  There is no joy in building an economic engine or a profitable company. There is no satisfaction in making good strategies. There is no logic in the buy-out end-game.\nThere will be games in which you are hit three four times a minute by sabotage. Every company will attack you and you can't execute a strategy for the spam.\nThere will be games in which you are the strongest company and suddenly find yourself bought out by a company worth half of your value. And I mean sudden. One moment you are thinking "wow, I am actually generating a profitable company here and then WHAM! Game over!.\nIt's a total WTF moment because there is no clue it's coming.\nIn Railroad Tycoon you could buy up your shares to keep from getting taken over.\nNot in this game.\nIt's simply not fun.\nIt could be, and should be. But I think the developers have gone down the path of playing so many games with each other that they see the fun in it, but forgot that the fun they are having is only because they know each other and designed the game themselves. I'm sure if I played several hundred hours I would start to get into the nuances of play. But why spend that much time on something that isn't enjoyable just to get to where it might be enjoyable?\nThis is a real shame and the first time in a long time I really feel my money was wasted on a steam purchase.\nMaybe they will stop and reassess their design.

The vast openness of the barren planet Mars calls to explorers and investors alike. Once the colonies have been established, the entrepreneurs see the potential for profit. Businesses start popping up on the Red Planet – this is where you come in.\n\nOffworld Trading Company is a fast-paced strategy game all about manipulating the Martian market, producing goods and buying out other businesses. Natural resources are limited and competition is brutal for control of the richest veins. Placement of mines, extractors, and other resource-producing buildings is critical to amassing enough materials to purchase new structures, upgrade your headquarters and get more claims. Each claim allows you to place one structure – use them wisely.\n\nPrice values of the thirteen types of resources fluctuates with market activity. Is someone selling off their entire aluminum stash? Expect to see prices nosedive. You can also buy stock in your opponents’ companies. If all stock gets purchased and you have enough money, you can buy them out, causing all their buildings to come under your control. The goal of the game is to be the last man standing by buying out all your opponents.\n\nThe only bad points this game has so far are its high retail price ($40) and the black market feature. The black market in this game makes investing in buildings risky. Found a high (level 3) water deposit? Someone can purchase an Underground Nuke for a paltry $1000 - $3000 to knock that deposit down to low (level 1) permanently. It seems an unnecessary element in an already risky business environment.\n\nI haven’t explored deep into this game, still in Early Access at this point, but it’s been both challenging and rewarding. You may ask “Is it really worth $40 in Early Access?” No. Wait for at least 25% off, preferably 50% or more. If you’re a dedicated economy gamer (Railroad Tycoon, Capitalism series), this might trip your trigger. Pick it up if it goes on sale.\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended with Caution\n- Recommended\nHighly Recommended\nRecommended as Essential","June 22, 2015","true","9.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Gametime is arround 15 to 20 min for a 1v1, sadly the playerbase is not yet big enough to regularily play more than a 1v1 match. On the plus side, Quick match will find you opponents in short time pretty regularly now.\nFazit: I enjoy playing it now, and it looks to be moving in a good direction, so i look forward to an even better game at full release.

If you don't know what M.U.L.E. is play it free on planetmule or alternatively buy this game. If you hate M.U.L.E. I respect your bizarre life choices, but do examine this game to see if your complaints were addressed.\n\nOffworld trading company is in my opinion the best non-combat RTS on the market. It's not M.U.L.E. but it takes that core concept and give it's a fresh modern spin. It is a well balanced blend of risk vs reward which is simple to learn but challenging to master. A lot of attention and love has been poured into the game and it shows.\n\nConsiderations:\n* Game is fast paced.\nIt's a not a case who ever issues orders the fastest wins like most RTS but the game is about balancing you income and the market environment which influences that income is in constant flux and you must be constantly on your game to adjust your strategy and make choices as the climate shifts if you wish to stay on top of your competitors. It eases you into it buy things get more frantic as things go on as you are juggling more and more avenues open up for players to sabotage each other. Point being there isn't time to relax in a match like their would be in a turn based strategy. Most people think a quick game is a good but this is a preference you have to weigh up for yourself.\n\n* The extra campaign features are just for single player.\nIt is a constant gripe of mine that competitive games that offer mechanics for campaign map don't accommodate multiplayer. Sometimes you want spend to an afternoon with a couple of friends competing for a long game of back and forth struggle. As usual that's not an option. The campaign mode offer a fun and in depth expansion to gameplay experience by incentivising you to continue playing successive matches and thus is makes a good introductory experience to the game and augments your single player experience so it's more then just death match skirmishes with AI bots. Just a shame death match skirmishes is the only experience you can share with your friends.\n\n* Competitive play will take practice.\nThe downside of simple to learn difficult to master means that without putting the time in you simply will not be able to compete with experienced players. The AI is very well developed at this point as a training tool but you are still going to take a beating before you can compete with regular players.\n\n* Replayability.\nThe game has a solid core mechanic with a good deal of depth but that's the extent of it. The different factions all follow the same core rules they just each get to break specific rules, meaning learning to play one means you can play them all, you just have different ways to apply their advantages to different strategies. There isn't a lengthy/branching tech tree and if you've played one 30 minute match you've seen all the game has to offer. It's not that it lacks content (it's packed with it) it's just that the content is focused on a specific experience. It's fair to equate it to a game of speed chess. How many matches can you play before you get bored? For some people it depends on the opponents, others just love and can't get enough of the game while other just enjoy a single match every now and then. When you buy the game you a buying a quality board to play with. It's up to you to assess how much playtime you'll get out of the board.\n\nIf these considerations do not concern you then I can heartily recommend this title. It is solidly built, well polished and has benefited from rigorous balance testing. Also it's fun, which is what matters most. If you are unsure if it's a fit for you or not remember you can always buy the game, play a few matches to see what it's like and then refund it. 2 hours playtime is plenty of time to get a feel for the core mechanics. For many of us it's exactly the revival of this niche genre we have been waiting for.","May 5","true","4.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

It seemed an interesting and different take on an RTS and it looked like a harsh business trading simulator. I bought it on sale at 35% off and that came with a free key for a buddy. Called my go to buddy to give it to him and he said "Oh man, I already have it and you are not going to like it. It's fun for a couple of hours but that's it. It's too simplistic to enjoy much longer".\n\nSadly, he was dead on. The game is extremely simplistic. So if you are looking for the varied and intersting types of games you could get from Civ, you won't find it here.\n\nI literally enjoyed it for about 4 hours and that was pretty much it. You have four factions who are largely identical. They all make a variation of mines and factories which make exactly the same core components. You take those core components and build one or more of 5 different buildings that can give you an edge like help you produce resource X a bit faster, or get a monopoly on a tech like teleportation, which eleminates the need to transport your goods to your home base.\n\nYou can then begin to sell your goods to try and make money to buy out your competitor faster than they can buy you out.\n\nIn the meantime there are a handful of repetitive, boring, dirty tricks you can use to slow them down or speed you up in your pursuit of the one goal, which is buy your competitors out.\n\nThat's it. That's the whole game. Their variety pitch is that there is an infinite number of ways to play each match because you won't always use the same dirty tricks, but there are only a handful of dirty tricks.\n\nIf you are interested in a repetitive experience of skirmish matches which last 15 - 60 minutes, and you like fine tuning your ability to deliver the same strategy over and over, then this game is for you.\n\nIf you are looking for a deep, strategic, intereting RTS with a variety of playstyle and paths to victory, then absolutely not.\n\nAs polished as the game is, one can see that there is very little depth or substance. My go to gaming friend nailed it when he called it "simplistic". Wish I had called him before I bought the game. I'm going to have to bust it out once a month or so to get in some skirmishes and still have it feel fresh and get my money's worth out of it.","May 9","false","12.2"," 35 of 59 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","35","59","2","7"

It's definitely unconventional as RTSes go, but what's wrong with that? We're all looking for something new and exciting to try, right? If you are reading this you probably know basically how this game works, so I'll spare you that.\n\nThe game is challenging. And to do well even against the non-cheating AI you have to think and react fast. After a while you get to understand the "personality" of the AI and you can get to a point of being able to beat the Manger AI (standard) regularly. At 45 hours I'm not there yet. Once you can do that you can bump up the AI so that it cheats (or maybe you're just handicaped...or both...I actually don't know yet). Better yet, hop into multiplayer and play against people who really know what they're doing. There is ranked 1v1, ranked 4-player free-for-all, and custom games up to 8 players, in free-for-all, teams, and comp stomp.\n\nI've watched some live multiplayer on the MohawkGames twitch channel where they are essentially game casting as they play. Soren (the creator) is pretty good at this, but Zultar is amazing! I have learned from watching them, but the biggest lesson is that there is a huge skill curve to this game. I cannot say whether that skill curve is steep, shallow, or moderate, but there is so much depth to this game that even though I understand all the mechanics I'm not even close to understanding more than 10% of why the top players do what they do. The game has observer and replays, and is pretty well balanced it seems. I've watched some youtube videos of the OTC Tournaments during beta and release, and I personally think this game could make it into the competitive scene, if other top players pick up on this gem.\n\nNow if your major draw to games is graphics, you'll want to pass for now. The graphics don't suck but this game isn't about eye candy. All the factions use the same buildings and "ships", except their starting base. They have some good animations and there is some life to the maps, which is pretty nifty given this is taking place on Mars (cloud shadows, flares, dust storms). I don't spend much time looking at the art...I enjoy the gameplay.\n\nIf your major draw to games is character and story, you'll want to pass for now. The tutorial brings a little bit of life and humor to characters that you'll encounter in the campaign. Incidentally the campaign is designed to be played after you've played through the tutorials and have some experience with skirmishes, not before. The campaign is largely a string of skirmishes where you take the role of one of the characters and try to be the best corporation over the course of seven rounds. "Only seven" you ask? The campaign is designed to be more of a single-player mini tournament that is replayable. You play one of the four factions through the rounds, starting with diminished capability but building up toward the final round. Each round you have the chance to gain some new abilities and after each round you "tech up". The maps available to play during each round are selected randomly, so each play-through is different. There is also some progression between runs of the campaign where you get to unlock other campaign characters to play. A neat system, but again not for one who relies upon story.\n\nIf your major draw to games is replayability, both singleplayer and multiplayer, this is your game. Skirmish, the campaign, and I think multiplayer have a really neat system to enhance replayability. While there are some preset maps that have standard terrain, I think most games are played on procedurally generated maps, made fair by allowing players to plop down wherever they want. Not only is the map terrain procedurally generated, the resource locations are too. In the game there are some random events, like dust storms and solar flares, plus a colony that affects the economy through granting random bonuses and creating random (though predictable and exploitable) demand. In short, no two games will ever be the same. UNLESS...you input a random seed, which will produce the exact same map if you happen to want to. That's a great idea, which I can see it being used in tournaments.\n\nLastly there is the "Daily Challenge". This appears to be a skirmish seed that everyone can play to compete for top spot on the day's leaderboard. So far it seems the top spot is whoever can win the game the fastest. And right there next to their time is an icon which you can click to watch the replay! A great way to see how the top players play.\n\nDoes this game have what it takes to catch the RTS world's eye? I think so. I hope so. It's the most fun RTS I've played in years. I can envision a future of DLC with more factions, resources, buildings, and gameplay mechanics that will make this game's replayability and multiplayer even richer. But first, you have to buy and play this game. What are you waiting for?\n\nPro tip: Don't be afraid to bulldoze buildings and put down more profitable ones. The good players are refocusing constantly based upon the market.","May 12","true","104.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I've been following this game for some time, and I am not disappointed by the results of the hard work of the development team.\n\nThe overall objective of the game is to become the most profitable off-world trading company by becoming the most profitable and efficient corporation around. You'll achieve this by building supply chains of goods, selling them to a local colony, shipping them off the planet, and using your gains to buyout your competitors while avoiding being bought out yourself.\n\nPositives:\n+Amazing soundtrack by Christopher Tin (composer of Baba Yetu, of Civ 4 fame)\n+Quick cutthroat gameplay; the decisions on where to land, and what to start producing are the beginnign of a race to quickly provide goods that meet the demands of a local colony.\n+The gameplay is unique: there isn't any 'militay' component to this game; instead you will be competing with other corporations in the marketplace to become the most efficient and profitable offworld-trading company.\n+Interesting hostile actions - while you can play it straight and just compete on the 'free market', there are a variety of options to sabatoge your competitors through illicit means.\n+Unique factions  - each faction has their own set of strengths, and weaknesses; playing one versus another feels very interesting and different.\n+Great writing (in the tutorial and opening missions, at any rate).\n\nNegatives:\n-It seems like there's not really a comeback mechanic once you start to fall behind; if you make a few mistakes early, you're probably going to have a bad time. I could be wrong, but once I start to lose, I continue to lose.\n-The factions aren't visually all that different.\n-This game is probably overpriced for the content that you're getting; I recommend purchasing this game on at least a 25% sale, probably closer to 50%.\n-I'm unsure about the replayability of the game; so far, the experience has been novel; outside of multiplayer, I don't think the game will provide more than 20 horus of gameplay.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game for RTS players who want a different experience - namely one that focuses on competitive supply chains and economic efficiency.

The AI is incredible, constantly buying and destroying buildings to account for changes in the market. I can only imagine what complex algorithms are driving these decisions. If the AI isn't cheating, then the developers must be geniuses. Thanks for this awesome game, I can't wait to see it finished. Too bad it is a bit under-the-radar.\n\nThe only changes I wish to see made are to the stock market. Currently it is not worth it to sell stocks because the stock is worth more than the sell price. Stock market trading needs to be more strategic rather than just a button you click when you want to beat another player. Players should be encouraged to invest in other players, possibly by removing the penalty for selling a stock and by removing the stock boost when you buy a stock. This way I can invest in a player early on, then sell the stocks and turn a fair profit later.","September 13, 2015","true","77.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

I'm still not terribly happy with the price point (I think for EA something around $20 would be more fair with a possible $30-$35 point when the game is finished) but I don't think I wasted my money.\n\nSome of my negative comments first:\n- The UI can be a bit clunky and laggy at points.\n- If you leave a campaign game in the middle you seem to automatically lose that round (no way to save it and return later unless I'm being oblivious).\n- If you start losing rounds in the campaign it becomes extremely difficult to make up the lost ground.\n- No clear indication of when a campaign is over/ability to have multiple campaigns going at once.\n\nMy biggest takeaway - no problems with the gameplay. The rounds definetly go by quicker then I thought they would as do the campaigns. I do wish there was an option in the campaign to vary the number of starting opponents (simply because once they are all eliminated you win and they can get eliminated fairly quickly) but thats fairly minor. The AI is extremely robust and even the start of the game takes some thought (eg do you drop your base quickly and move to what nodes you can see, do you spend longer scanning hoping to hit the motherload, etc). It does feel like it's really all just a race to the offworld markets (they are so lucrative that whoever gets their first is more or less going to win the game) but the gameplay itself is great. The game takes some forethought as you are limited in what you can do via a limited number of claims (it would be nice if you yourself could give up or auction off a claim). Graphics overall are simple (but clean) and make it extremely easy to see what is going on in-game.\n\nAll in all I still do have a bit of an issue recommending it at this price point but if you think you'd happen to like the genre and aren't tight with cash I would pick the game up. Hopefully this turns into a good example of Early Access but even if we never heard another word from the Devs the game is completely playable now.\n\nEdit: After playing some more I do have to say there are some annoying balance issues (some of the "races" are clearlier to play/win with then others and some of the abilities/techs are way to strong while others are almost useless) but hopefully those will be addressed going forward.","February 13, 2015","true","18.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

So this is more of a "what this game isnt"-Review, so others who look for a complex and "big" economic simulation (like I did) save themselves the hassle.\n\nFor a real economic-simulation the game is way to "small". It will take 15-30 mins at max to reach the maximum possible expansion for your buisness on a map.\n"fighting" the opponents is either done through just throwing acts of sabotage (bought at a black market) at them or by buying them out.\nIf that now sounds intricate and complex, it really isnt you just click a black market mission, then click the target and it happens, buying the other buisnesses out just means making money faster then they do and buy their stocks before they can buy yours.\nI didnt play it long and had it refunded pretty quickly, especially after seeing that really trying to muscle the opponent out of a market isnt really working, because there is basically no need to close down factories as soon as you produce enough energy, fuel and necessities of life so you dont need to buy them to keep your company running (and that is EASY).\nSo basically if you like a rather uncomplicated build-up-stuff game that is about just building and clicking faster then your opponents, well it might be a game for you.

Even on its normal speed, that you could adjust even in multiplayer, things are fast paced enough to finish a match in 30mins but plenty of time to think about your actions.\n\nYou begin by scanning the map for a good starting location.  Each player does the same, but here's the catch, if you are one of the last to found you get bonus tiles (called claims) to build buildings on because you are pretty much forced away from the prime locations that the first founders took, unless your lucky and they didnt spot something.\n\nAfter you found, this is the fastest part of the game, because you want to claim certain tiles first.  Now each game is going to have a different strategy.  Perhaps you want to claim that lone carbon resource so no one else can get it and force them to buy off the market.  Maybe you think that the other players are going to sell water down so the price to purchase it would be $1, so forgo water and go for more prime minerals or power sources.\n\nAs the game progresses, you can buy items off the black market or on auctions.  Some help yourself but most of the time you are buying them to stop production of your enemies or to steal one of their resources for a short time.  Each time a player buys, say a dynamite stick, the price goes up for all players the next time you want one.  There is a lot of choices in a fast matched game to choose.\n\nEnd game is always the same, trying to constantly protect your Offworld Markets with shields (Goon Squads), trying your best to disrupt the enemies Offworld Markets.  It usually ends with the first one to amass a huge amount of cash to buyout the remaining shares of your competitor.  It really is no different than a military RTS how to end a game, always ends the same way with hordes of marines going time and time again.  However looking at stock prices for the end game and scanning over to your enemy base to disrupt stuff is about all there is in the end game, nothing fancy like seeing buildings get destroyed by your units.\n\nAll and all, it is a great game to try out.  They havn't really stated what will be coming in the future except for leagues and ladders like any good RTS game would do.  If they do that, they need to limit the observer mode to a delay or something, and I can see free for all getting out of whack with teams trying to join in and gang up on a player.","February 12, 2015","true","28.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

It's closer to an economic simulator. You build infrastructure that produces resources. Resources can be used to produce new infrastructure. Infrastructure can take resources and created finished products out of them. And with all that you can sell them out to a dynamic market in which the price will fluxuate based on how much each player is selling of that commodity.\n\nThe main part of the game is surviving as a company and buying out other ones. If your company value falls low you become vulnerable to losing shares of your company to competitors. Your company value is your debt and your infrastructure value combined. So paying off debt will make it harder for people to buying you, while having a large sum will allow you to buy an opponent.\n\nOnce you have bought an opponent you gain their stuff in full and gain a significant advantage.\n\nThe game comes with a tutorial for playing the game and playing each of the four factions. Each faction comes with its own unique set of opening boosts and needs. With a few dozen maps to choose from there is tonnes of gameplay value for your dollar.\n\nFans of games like Port Royale, Rise of Venice, Anno 2070, and C.E.O. should definitely give this game a try. For people who are newer to economic simulators and want to give it a try, this might be the game for you.","February 12, 2015","true","7.9"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

I have only played vs. the AI and it feels rewarding and fair when you outplay it or when it outright buys you out. Furthermore, I found it interesting that setting up the difficulty level (whether for the AI or you) means that you are setting up a handycap. The AI with the same handycap as the player still beats the player if s/he does not play "correctly." This means that you should pay attention to what your HQ needs and what other HQ use as resources. You should use your AI games to figure out which strategy you like (or as in my case keep you alive) best. The random resource allocation and the map designs increase the complexities of this game. Say you want to grab the water, fuel, and food markets. If the map only has 3 water tiles and they are located in a very narrow ridge between craters, you may have a problem. Why? Well, if you are rushing stocking early fuel expecting the prices to go up (because everyone will have to grab resources in weird locations and far from their HQs), you may not want to spend fuel to get fuel transported to your HQ. Furthermore, if you place the HQ near the water tile, you may not have the space to properly place the fuel refineries. You see, how you place buildings affect what bonuses you get from the production of the resource!\n\nAs you can see, the game is complex enough that I don't dare venture into the multiplayer ladder without having a clue of what I should do under different conditions to maximize my early game profits (also, I have an unreliable connection sometimes). The mechanics feel solid and balanced. You usually lose because you of some badly managed resource or market or because you failed to ship resources offworld before the competition.\n\nOverall, I love the game! The animation quality is great! I like the voice over and sounds, although the early access text-to-speech (placeholder?) voice over assets had their own personality. Heck, even the menu surprised me. This is the first game I have seen that differentiates and supports three types of color-blindness.\n\nPlease, do not ignore this game and grab it as soon as it becomes affordable to you. Then, play it and join the ranked ladder so we can buy each other's companies some day!\n\nTo the pirates I say, "Pirates, I hate those filthy bandits!" :P","May 10","true","27.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's Starcraft meets Civilization with a stock market. Except, that it is neither Starcraft nor Civilization. It's something totally unique. If you don't like how short the skirmishes are, then play some campaigns (personally, I wish the campaigns were longer than 7 matches. Marathon, anyone?). If the AI is predictable and unchallenging, then turn up the difficulty and watch them pound you in the ground - it will improve your strategic capability, if nothing else. If you don't like keeping tabs on your competitors while you're busy advancing your own goals, then you're in the wrong genre entirely.\n\nThe beauty of this game is there isn't just ONE strategy to win, but dozens or perhaps hundreds. There are many choices that can be made (by you and your competition) that can affect the later part of the match. And then you throw in the variability of the game's stock market based resource pricing. Sure, if everyone is producing and selling iron, then the price of iron will tank, but unforeseen and ultimately random events can change anything. You may need to adapt: if you decide to make your fortune on glass and then the price of glass plummits because of market saturation, you have the option to scrap your facilities and focus on something new.\n\nIt's not a set-it-and-forget-it type of RTS. You have to adjust and adapt to each unique scenario and you may have to do so several times to achieve victory. It's the kind of strategy game that leaves you wanting more.","May 23","true","78.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The first round will be very overwhelming, however the learning curve is easy. It is still in beta, I hope they add a minimap and some hot key functions. navigating is a little odd. An issue I find with all steam games is the hot corners on mac, if you have it enabled, mess up the game. The task bar pops up over the game interface as well as the header bar. It can be irritating when scrolling to the edges is the only way to navigate.\n\nIt's super fun, but fast paced. You'll be done with each round in 30-45 mins each.  It does leave you wanting something more enduring sometimes. I want to play longer, do more, expand. I don't want to own Mars in an hour or less every time.\n\nAgain I know it's a beta but the game seems unbalanced, for example my second time through I had bought out all my competitors but one and owned all the resources. I had lots of money and resources, but I was just sitting and messing around. Unfortunately the AI generated enough over a long period of time and bought me out. I lost even tho I owned 90% of the map. Seemed odd.\n\nOverall, lots of fun, not time consuming. Leaves you wanting more strategy space RTS tho. Great beta! I hope to see some more features in the full release. 100% worth it.","February 13, 2015","true","18.5"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","0"

I do have a few comments and suggestions tho.\n\nI'm a fan of the campaign mode and wish it could extend Much longer. There should be an option for more maps than around the 6-8 currently.\n\nThat aside there is a steeper learning curve than people realise and certain information isn't readily available for those who just jump into playing.\n\n\nThe tutorial doen't explain certain mechanics, like the fledgling colony you're there to support. When it fails (loses all population) some people fail to realize this and think they've been bought out with no notification. This is not the case as they are your local consumers. The larger the independent colony is the more resources they suck off of the market.\n\nHaving a resource monopoly can be your best friend. Just know when to hold, and when to flood the market. The ability to precisely time buy/sell actions is paramount.\n\nThe least powerful faction so far in my opinion is the scientific. Especially in the campaign mode, as they have no indipendent water production to start with.\n\nGeothermal in campaign is near useless so are the ice and dry ice condensors. Half of the time you don't have 2 of the 3 mentioned if not none at all.\n\nMy suggestion to improve scientific is give their buildings slant drilling (except mines and quarries and water pumps) by default instead of the reduced sabatoge innate perk.\n\nAnother thing that should change would be if your debt is higher than some % of  your asset value, any cash made should automatically go to pay off debt, including the automatic selling of stocks that you may have. I know there is an option to have all cash towards debt; however, at a certain point I think lenders would hire collections on your goods. This would allow some negative operational budgets but prevent abuse. As is your stock could be worthless, however maintaing stock in other companies gives a high value well beyond what should be viable.\n\nI was attempting to see how high of a population i could get the independent colony to grow and I managed to get an AI opponent into -10,000,000 in debt with an asset value around 1.5 million.  What was interesting is that he still held high cash reserves , and decent stock value because of an earlier purchase of some of my stock. I got it to almost 70 population when my game crashed due to me spamming up around 30+ offworld trades.\n\nFor the love of God give us a save/load option in Campaign! Also please fix the game lag from opening up any specialized building menus (engineering upgrade, hack net, etc).\n\nOne final thing I'd love added is a "Sell at 'X' value" option similar to the auto sale of electricity but have an option to start/stop selling at a certain value. This would further increase the potential of market manipulations, beyond just start/stop of the power only. An example of this feature would be  locking it to automatically sell water once the price has increased to $30 a unit, and have it auto selling to keep it at that value and no higher.\n\nOffworld trading is very OP, it's pretty much game over when someone builds one. I have managed to survive once by spamming mutiny on an opponents and using the funds to buy them out.  This may lead to a game bug, where a person can have more than 2 markets if one of their two is under mutiny and placing another. I can not remember if the opponent had more than one base, as this is a viable option as to how they ended up with 3.\n\nAll in all a pretty good foundation with just some fleshing out to do with tutorial/help hints, balancing and optimizations.\n\nI think an open mod community could really make this a longstanding foundational game. Turn the campaing into a galaxy of planets to work your way through coquering a planetary network would be amazing. Just using similar bonus system for conqured planets. IE: Upon starting a new planet the first map only carries over your Planet wide bonuses from previous planets. This would allow alternate upgrade/tech advancement strategies for different planets.\n\nWell that's enough for now, I'm going back to play some more.","February 17, 2015","true","250.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This is a recommendation based on the $20 pricetag, I do not feel it's worth $40 quite yet.\n\nPros:+Interesting concept that is (mostly) executed well.\n+Four different faction types that are relatively balanced.\n+Good level of mechanical depth that makes the game more enjoyable as you learn.\n+Multiplayer is fun, particularly co-op\n+Winning is satisfying - there's no other way to put it. When you buyout your last competitor, you feel like you've earned your monopoly.\n\nCons:-Tutorials are bare bones at best, useless at worst. On top of not covering very basic but vital mechanics (using claims without building, the usefulness of upgrade buildings such as the offworld market/patent office, etc) the last three tutorials simply throw you into a standard game and tell you to win with a given faction, with barely a blurb about that faction's unique traits as a guide. You will need to suffer through a lot of trial and error before you feel skilled at the game.\n-The market essentially functions the same way every game. Certain goods (electronics, chemicals, food) are basically always the most expensive on the market, so a strategy of "spam electronics late game" is always viable, and ruins the charm somewhat.\n-The Black Market, as it is currently implemented, is a big drain on the game. It refreshes too fast, and you are constantly being bombarded in all directions by pirates, EMP's, and dynamite. Honestly, for a game that claims to remove the military elements of the RTS to focus on economics, it detracts from your economic game and forces you to focus on what is essentially guerilla military ops.\n-The difficulty settings are such that you can only functionally choose to apply bonuses/handicaps to yourself. The AI always plays at the same (fairly high) level, which makes it difficult to keep up as a newbie.\n\nOverall the game is still very rough around the edges, but what's there can be fun, particularly with some friends to co-op with. However in it's current state it absolutely feels $20 too expensive at it's standard price of $40. If you can get it on sale, it's worth a look.","March 21","true","8.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/271240/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Product received for free\n\nOffworld Trading Company is a space strategy game with many great attributes and with constant support from the developers.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are in control of a colony, based on Mars, and you have to get as rich as possible. You can build mines, factories and farms and then sell them when the price is right. Defend yourself from other companies and try to take them over.\n\nPros:    Trading Aspect | There are a lot of similar strategy games, but this game has something other games rarely have: trading. It adds something new to the game and it makes it different from other games of the similar genre, which is definitely a huge advantage. Trading has a lot of different options since you can have different strategies for higher profits and you can even influence the prices, just as you can in real life (if you're wealthy enough).\nAppearance | This game looks great and it doesn't use a lot of system resources, which is great. Even if there are a lot of things happening on your screen, it is still very easy to track everything. This is sometimes a problem, especially when you get so wealthy that you can afford anything, but your screen gets littered as well. Anyway, this game doesn't have this problem.\nTutorials | This game offers an amazing tutorial which covers all the basics well and prepares you for your journey. There are five tutorial levels and each one covers a few connected topics. When you complete the tutorials, you're mostly good to go as the game itself is not extremely complicated, but I will also mention this later on.\nLearning Curve | You don't need any prior experience with similar games as this game teaches you game mechanics very gently with some funny dialogs, easy-to-understand instructions and helpful explanations. I've never seen something like that and it's really something every game should have. I sometimes feel frustrated when I don't understand what the game wants from me, but no such thing happened with Offworld Trading Company.\nGame Modes | Game modes are definitely another great thing about this game as there are many of them, which means more hours of interesting gameplay. After completing the tutorial, you can play some prepared practice games. Then, you can play the Campaign, Skirmish, Daily Challenge levels and even multiplayer ones!\nAtmosphere | The music in this game is really great and game events also have some influence on what kind of music is played. The sound effects are also pretty great (such as explosions and other things). This is one of rare such games where you don't need to turn on your own music if you don't want to get bored!\nAchievements and Rewarding | When you do something good in this game, it really lets you know that you did something good and that you learned something. There are quite a few achievements, some harder than others, and they are one of the rewards for making progress. This really makes the player to play the game more since it's like getting a cookie each time you do something of value. This developer really knows how to keep its players!\nAlmanac DLC | These kind of things are usually available as paid DLCs, but this DLC comes with the game for free when you purchase it. You get access to many things, such as a 91-page (!!) strategy guide by professional players and designer notes from the developer.\nCons:    Pricing | 40€ for a game is really too much, even though it's a very good game. Games of the same genre are usually priced at least 10€ lower. If you manage to find someone who wants the game as well, you can buy the Deluxe Edition which gives you an extra copy of this game. Otherwise, I just don't find this game to be worth so much. Hopefully, the developer will drop the price at some point or at least put a nice discount on it on every major sale.\nNo SteamOS Support | Linux lovers are sadly excluded from this game's player base as well.  I wonder when developers are going to realize that there are some hardcore Linux fans that only buy games when they support their operating system ...\nThe final verdict:Offworld Trading Company is most certainly an amazing game. Apart from its trading mechanics, there are also great graphics, many game mode, a very helpful tutorial and many other great things. Overall, there is nothing particularly bad about this game apart from its pricing. I still think that 40€ is way too much for such a game. When you do buy it, you should have no problems liking it, but I do recommend waiting for a sale before deciding to buy this game. Hopefully, there will also be a price drop in near future.\n\nWith love,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

No continuation no new threats to ever sprout.

It is also somewhat lacking in variety and substance. That said it is a good game and is still being worked on. But at the moment the most I would want to pay for this game is $15. 40 is faaar too expensive for what the game currently offers. I will keep playing it though and hope for it to improve.

Such a great concept! And it does not disappoint.\n\nThe Good\n* Simple game mechanic that grows to a complex interconnected system\n* Easy to learn, requiring almost no tutorial, but difficult to master\n* Fun and addictive gameplay\n* A lot of the usual grind has been automated, leaving the player almost entirely grind-free to focus on base management (yay). The sole exception is the Saboteur system, which you can find in "The Bad" section below.\n* Challenging AI\n* Very satisfying victories without long drawn-out endgames\n* Decent graphics (if a bit blocky)\n* I am playing this in early-access, and yet the game seems full-featured and stable.\n* Interesting and current topic (mars colonization)\n* Well thought-out in terms of resources, resource usage, and gameplay mechanics\n* Offword mining and its actually about (mostly) peaceful commerce? What an original idea!\n\nThe bad\n* The core game mechanic involves getting resources first, and then combining/upgrading to extract them faster. Other than avoiding pirate raids, no thought is given to logistics. I would have liked some road or train building, or having to run power lines or pipelines, rather than everything being delivered via hover selds\n* The sabotage system is annoying and feels "taped on". Its mostly ineffective, and yet pulls the player away from base management. Especially towards the end of the campaign, this can get kind of grindy... with players always having to repair or re-up their goon-squad, and keep track of attacks all over the place\n* The first colony almost always wins - I suppose that's incentive to drop early, but with a pausable interface, all the level3 resources near the colony are gone by the time the second corporation touches down\n* The game seems weighted towards Expansionist and Saboteur factions, with little real benefit for the robots or scientists\n* Synth voices for the characters are annoying\n\nNot sure if these are good or bad...\n* I feel like there should be more of a sandbox mode, perhaps with some far-future constructions like terraformers?\n* Game is also quite short. It seems like a perfect length for what this game is. However, its a lot of fun, and I kinda hope it gets more features, which (I think) would need a longer campaign\n* Its cliche, but I expected at some point to find alien ruins / fossils / alien tech, but didn't. This could go either way. It adds a bit of mystery and alien-ness, and deepens a story.. but it is very typical and overdone too.\n\nConclusion\nLoved it. I love strategy and simulation games, so this might get a touch of extra appreciation from me that might not be shared by all. Even so, I'd give Offword Trading Company a 9.5 / 10.\n\nThanks for reading!","February 15, 2015","true","7.8"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","0"

Generally I try to get 10 or 12 hours in on a game so that, even if I haven't finished it yet, I have a solid feel for all the merits and flaws of a game.  However, I am having so much fun with this one that I decided to review it already.\n\nNow, the game has flaws.  It does have a tendency to lag out a bit, especially when engaged in the daily challenges.  The graphics are pleasant, but nothing particularly special... of which I approve, since my graphics setup is more for work than gaming, so I have trouble with graphically intensive games.  And you can further turn the graphics down to save on your computer's resources, which is nice, also.\n\nThere is a minimum of combat (although you can do several different kinds of sabotage, including detonate an opponent's property), since the game is primarily market based warfare, and you win by buying out the competition.  Managing to balance your debt, so that your stock price stays up, while still generating the liquid assets to buy out an opponent makes for some interesting and fun strategizing.\n\nThere are points where this game lacks, but it's still in Early Access, so that's no big surprise.  Because of this, further reviews will be coming as the game develops.\n\nInitial Scoring: 8 out of 10","April 22","true","6.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's an RTS-like game but there are no combat units to manage. You win by out thinking your opponents (AI, in my case) by outplaying them in the commodity market. The game's premise is that you and a few other AIs are setting up shop in Mars. You race against each other to see who make the most money out of mining minerals in the planet. The more of certain minerals you sell, the price of the minerals will go down in the stock market. This manipulation of the stock market will enable you to influence the net worth of your company as well as your opponent's. You win buy buying the company shares, having a corporate take over. The action is pretty intense and yet, you can always auto pause to take a breather and think of your next strategy. Having high reflex and able to execute many actions per minutes does not matter here, this is not your usual RTS. And yet, the amount of excitement from creating espionage to influece the stock markets, causing the shares of your competitors to drop is very real. Each game is short, maybe an hour for each sitting, very useful for a quick fix before bed.

It's the only early access game I've played that I would actually recommend buying in its current state. It already feels like a complete game, and a fun one at that.\n\nTo start a match, you and your competitors search mars for a place to start your business ventures. The map is randomly comprised of different resources, used to either support your colony, or turn a profit. There are a couple of different colonies, all of which use the available resources differently, providing a slight variety on play-styles.\n\nThe matches last around 30 minutes or so, which I think is a nice change from the time-investment of the Civ games.\n\nThere is also a blackmarket, where you can purchase goods to sabotage your competitors, or even manipulate the market in your favor.

Hopefully they will make the game good as the price tag feels "little" to high. It should have been between $15 and $20 (max) for what you get (not much). Let me bring up some things I feel about the game:\n\n1. It's to few resources in many games which do so it's highly frustrating when you can not build new stations as most are already taken, you can not build more because you need to upgrade your main base and the only thing you do is more or less waiting, waiting and waiting some more. Huh!\n\n2. It feels really frustrating very often because in the beginning it's very stressful game as you need to take good spots asap before the quick AI who can instantly do it. In the end game it feels the reverse... boring as the only thing you do is more or less are waiting until you have enough cash even when you have sold most of your resources to be able to buy something new. It's a waiting game in the end.\n\n3. It feels also the AI has full control (100% of the time) over your economy. As soon as you get enough money to buy AI out he increases his buyout price. So it feels really frustating and you start to ask yourself if AI is sheating which is not so enjoyable.\n\n4. It looked fun when the devs played it but sadly it wasn't. However I think the game can have potential if they make it more fun in all areas. Was bored of it already after some hours, but forced me to play it just to see if I have missed something which can be fun. The campaign could have been much more fun than it was. But it's hard to see what they can improve to make it more fun. It felt like I bought a shell with no fun content.

Cause the game can still be fun, if not a constant repeative action at end game.  The methods on how you overly strategize towards the end can vary, mostly in how the map generates, how quickly your enemy deploys/expands and the various methods they use against you and vs versa.  But the end becomes nearly the same; sell resources at high prices before the other player/AI - so you have enough dosh to buyout the other player, because they certainly are about to do it to you! (You see an ever increasing % sign next to their name, telling you of your impending doom).\n\nA hair raisingly good timeWhile the game does raise the stakes and cause you to panic, the game is short lived.

I've been playing it now for three days, and overall - I really like this game.  My only issue is that it seems the devs really took a few shortcuts that seem to show, the sort that you might not see in a release from one of the more established publishers.\n\nFirst, typos - you'll see them in the game and referred to in discussions.  Seriously, guys - if you can develop a game you can spell check.  Just lazy IMO.\n\nSecond, balance - the game does not seem balanced between the difffering factions nor with the AI.  So far it seems to be either very easy to win, or impossible to win.  There are a lot of "moving parts" in this game - i.e. a lot of resources, upgrades, and attack options via the "black market" and hacker array to contend with, and no matter what you do the AI will make all the necessary calculations much faster than a human to determine the best strategy to win.  Devs have said this isn't true in discussion, but with respect they understand the game differently than a new user and they should listen to the criticisms.\n\nThird, font/resource icon size - there are many instances when the fonts are honestly nearly too small to read.  Anyone who might need reading glasses (not just middle-aged gamers like me) will find it hard to read numbers, which is pretty important given this is a game of corporate warfare and espionage.  Seriously, make the fonts/resource icons like 10-15% bigger and it's much more playable.\n\nFourth - there seem to be issues with multi-player, but I cannot speak to that specific complaint because I've not yet attempted to get into a MP game, but read the discussions if you want to learn more on MP bugs.\n\nThat said, I'm confident that future relases and patches will address these issues, and one of the best features in my opinion is the lean and effective use of code.  I was THRILLED to see that it only took up a little over 2G on my MacBook AIR.  I'd strongly consider this title if you're a fan of any of the Civ games, as well as C&C or other RTS titles.\n\n","May 9","true","28.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The UI is fine to me, could be refined or polished up later on. The graphics are decent in that they're not childish looking, but colorful and well done without being too detailed and distracting from the real content. Another great added feature is the customization of gameplay options.  Map size, location, resource amounts, black markets and many more options available to pick from.\n\nThe factions are great and seem well balanced on the surface, until technology and research are conducted with some factions  gaining a very strong edge. Some technology can compliment a faction weakness very well or enhance upon current factional strengths.\n\nGameplay can be quick and brutal, once you've mastered the learning curve you can be just as brutal. After 31 hours of gameplay trying different factions, and tactical approaches I won. OTC will eventually unleash your inner mastermind when you learn which Black Market sabotage to use on the leader of the pack to keep them in check and in debt. Low on power? Go steal some. Combination tech and sabotage can render great net returns with the correct amount of timing.\n---\nMy only negatives are not knowing what the sound effects mean and the exact location of my affected colony. I feel like Factional structures should have an easily identified signature look rather than a colored border. It seems there's only one way to win and that's... Offworld Trading. Every game feels like a race to Offworld shipment rockets where other rts have multiple methods for obtaining victory.\n\nIf you're looking for something fun and different with 30 minutes to kill, this game will please. I bought the game even after reading the negative reviews and was able to overlook the smaller details.","February 23, 2015","true","50.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Standard capitalists, Robots, Scavengers and Scientists. They each have a very different play style that works for them, for example Robots don't require food or water to survive, meaning they can focus right away on resource gathering.\n\nYou can't just throw down a load of buildings to gather what you need right away, you have to 'claim' ground and resources to gather them, and you can bid against other corporations or upgrade your head-quarters to get more 'claims'.\n\nTo win a game you have to buyout your opponents corporation, this gets harder as the game goes on, and the surviving corporations get bigger and more effective, but a single campaign could last maybe a couple of hours.\n\nrapid expansion, careful selling and buying of goods, and sometimes abit of espionage can soon become formulaic. For example I've only spent about 4 hours, and I've manage to figure out how to win every time with the Robot faction (haven't won much with the other 3 yet)\n\nIF the dev's add more to the game then I could see a lot of re-playability in this game, but at the moment its limited, and you may wish to wait while the price tag drops a bit, I kinda regret getting this at £26 (that was with a 10% discount).\n\nWait a few months, see what the price is like, see how much its changed, and I'll come back and do a second review of the updated version.","February 14, 2015","true","4.4"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","21","37","0","0"

The idea is interesting and not explored enough, so I felt very tempted to recommend solely on the premise of having a more diverse RTS scene. The decision rested on how they delivered on what they tried to achieve and promised.\n\n[Justification]\nIt's not an interesting RTS (though i might be proven wrong if in a couple of years we see this game played competively, which I doubt). The way it is now, you'll have a difficult time playing on the higher levels until you find exploits that break the game. You won't become good at gaming an interesting rulset against an interesting opponent, you'll try to become good at beating the way the game was designed.\n\nIs not well balanced out and doesn't have an interesting AI, though people who might like '90s "challenging" (punishing) AI might want to give this a go for all times sake.\n\nThe difficulty levels are simple starting penalties, which shows how little good gameplay is "rewarded" the player who makes the least mistakes wins, it should be more than that and I can't see it.\n\nThere are 4 factions you can play as, they're not symetrical, but not well balanced out for asymetrical gameplay either (and they're not all that different). The robotic faction seems to be the obvious choice at the moment, the rest that are introduced later to the player will make your own playthrough more and more difficult, not different. Why would one not choose the faction that offers the easiest win when playing a skirmish match? Disclaimer: I caped at medium difficulty. I don't feel motivated to continue learning the game to beat the game.\n\nThe economics. Aah, this should have been what made the game. Does the game make some interesting commentary about economics in RL, in video games or gives us an interesting mechanic through which the player might learn something useful about how economy works? No, none of these. The game uses very basic supply/demand system to set dynamic prices, which is cool as an idea. But there's no background simulation of why these resources are really needed, the demand is neither believable and allows for fluctuations which are actually based on supply alone and RNG demand. Boooooring.\nThis is one of the objective reasons why one may argue that the game has no depth.\n\n[Others] Many talked about the price. I agree, it's too expensive for what it has to offer. I played the game and don't plan on purchasing content for the game. However, I wanted to avoid this and focus on how well the game delivers what it set out to accomplish. I'm also annoyed with the low res textures, gimmickey animation, almost like in a facebook game (though many liked the style for some reason). The campaign doesn't offer any compelling backstory, it just allows you to experience what the game has to offer a little bit more gradually.\n\n[TL;DR] The game has an interesting idea, but it's not very well delivered. It's worth trying out, but then you have to consider if it has enough value to offer to you.","May 5","false","10.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

I would call it a resource management game or 'an RTS without troops' if that makes any sense.  I like it overall.\n\nThe bad:  I bought this game to play as a co-op experience and that's why I thought it came with a free 2nd copy - to play with a friend!  Turns out that there is no co-op campaign and it's basically just multiplayer skirmishing against AIs or other humans that can be considered cooperative.  I wish games would stop being labeled as co-op if they only have it in the multiplayer mode - that should be called multiplayer co-op or something to differentiate the two.\n\nThe ugly:  The single player mode is well designed and has some very interesting mechanics but it's damn short.  It hardly feels like the mechanics of planning your company and investing your personnel while managing your cash flows have a chance to amount to anything over the few chances you get to make choices.  It feels like they cut the single player down to the shortest allowable length, which is too bad as it has potential.\n\nI recommend this game but be aware of the above.","May 11","true","10.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was excpecting a little bit more even from the alpha release. Winning is not winning as it is a mass scramble to buy up more claims, expand your base and build up your tradebale items.  For the price point I was expecting more options of trading, pipe lines and more detailed process to extract your resources from the ground. everything in between is automatic(bring in and return of resources). Maybe adding ship building may help to add a little more flavour and to add more depth to collection of resources.  To me it seems you need more stuff to do, and less about the capitalist pig system we live in today. Buying out your competion is fun but it should be a little less predictable and more random events.  Sabotage and goons are a nice addition but I find it very lack luster and overall not that interesting.   I was expecting this game to have more options, pipelines, trains, space stations to deliver your items to and be able to ship out from to earth or other planets.\n\nover al I cant really reccomend this game in its current state, Especially at $40.00 price point, feels like 10-20 at most would have been sutiable.  And this is a small game, not a grand strategy I was hoping for. I enjoy no armies in it just, need more things to do to keep my brain in the game.\n\nPros-\n- Great concept\n- Graphics ok\n\ncons\n- lackluster overall gaming experience - lacks in depth realistic  resouce gathering, mining, and processing.\n- Very basic layout and buiuldings.\n\n\n\nOverall\n\n\nroll the dice if you want, I waited for a few months to get this game - I have been following it on the internet - and now what it has been released - slightly dissappointed more then I was happy. But hopefully this game will have new features added and the game will get more in depth - I will update later after a few more hours.\n\n( I WISH THEY HAD A NEUTRAL BUTTON)  not no or yes - But i will go with no !","February 15, 2015","false","7.4"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","23","42","2","4"

You start with an\nunrevealed map\nand you have X scans(you will receive more over the time) to use and scan for resources, after you´re first scans you will definetly find some resources and the call is yours\nShould I place my HQ here or do I keep scannig for(maybe) a better place? Of course that these depends on the type of HQ you will play with. The 4 HQ´s are Expansionists,\nRobotics, Scavengers and Scientifics and each one of these have a distinct way of operating. Once you place your HQ it´s time to put down your buildings, but chose carefully\nbecause you have a limit and you have to place them in a way where you won´t be in a HUGE debt right at the begining of the game. After you spend all the claims you will\nprobably want more and you need to upgrade you HQ. It takes some resources so be careful! After all these steps it´s time to make the "big ones" and try to "buy" your\nopponents, and make sure that you are not bought otherwise its Game Over for you.You can always use some dirty tricks to slow down your opponents or really just wreck them,\nit´s called Black Market and you want to use it for sure!\nThe multiplayer is amazing(no problems until now) and for those who like "tension" this is the perfect game. Always be careful and never try to be the owner of every resource\nor you´re gonna get: (nuke/EMP/dynamite/many others)ed and believe me you do not want to be that guy on the match.\nAnd thats pretty much the concept, of course that it´s not fully explored or working perfectly and that´s why it is an Early Access game.\nGeneral:\nNow:7/10\nWhen released:8.5/10 or (hopefully) 9/10","February 22, 2015","true","16.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

The first few games are tough but after a while you get the hang of it.   But, then after a while you see how basic the public stock ownership is, and the game starts to lose its sparkle.  Especially when you can lose the game so easily by it.  And, then you realize how unrealistic it is.  So, then you try to focus on building, and you start to realize the game is really kind of confining,  The maps are small even when you pick huge.  Then you find yourself competing for the same area with 4 or more competitors that in a very short time build up to the limits and try to take over you and each other.  That gets old quick because you want to build and develop Mars, not just fight in a little plot of land on it.  Finally, you say to yourself, well how is multiplayer.  If your lucky enough to find someone in the lobby and play, i imaging it could be fun.  I've been there 3 times and its been empty.  So, up front it looks fun and interesting, and it is for a while, but the replyabillity is limited.  I think it's overpriced for what you get.  Wait until it drops under $15.

Other than some balance issues and a better multiplayer lobby the game is rock solid. Buying out a company feels great when you finally get enough money, you have to constantly be watching the market and making moves to ensure the resources you have cost more and the ones you want are cheap or accessible.\n\nMy only complaint would be I'd like to see clearer notifications for when sabotage is being done to my colony and it's facilities. Other than small icons and a single line of text in the bottom right, which is very small, you have no way of knowing.

This game is brutally difficult, even on the lowest difficulty settings.  CPU players are far too aggressive (Think Civ 5 Ghandi meets the Red Skull) and do not seem to compete with one another.  There is a bug currently in the game that allows CPU players to purchase stock in your company even when they do not have the funds to do so.  The game also, apparently, gives stipends of cash to the AI player, resulting in an early game juggernaut.  Every game is a zerg rush - there is no long term strategic play in this game whatsoever.\n\nSabottage corporations in particular are incredibly frustrating to play against and their playstyle is one dimensional: to deny others the ability to play.  This is not a very good design for an RTS game, as there is no effective counter to this playstyle that is accessible at all during the early game.\n\nThe CPU text-to-speech announcements get annoying very fast, especially the one voice that is barely understandable - I thought I had selected the wrong localization.\n\nOverall, this is a great concept and the game could be fun, but for now the game is balanced such that it is just a mad rush with no real strategic depth or fun factor.  It needs more Sid Meier.\n\nCould this game be worth the money?  Eventually, maybe.  It isn't right now.

This game is not like Anno xxxx or Planetbase. This game plays like Starcraft or Command and Conquer. This is fast paced strategy, and when it comes right down to it, there's not much difference between matching your attack type to an enemy's defence type and sabotaging your enemy's chemical production right when you notice a lot of players building labs all at once. But the latter for me feels more grounded in plausibility and ends up more fun.\n\nThe only criticism I could have for an economic version of this type of rts gameplay is that when you are defeated, it is with an instant cash buyout. There are many interesting routes to that situation being possible, but when it happens there isn't much warning and then bam- you're out of the game. I don't even really mind that so much, though. When you're about to lose Starcraft you have to preside of the death of all your soldiers. This game rips the bandage off quickly, and your company becomes a subsidiary. I presume most of your workers even get to keep their jobs.\n\nI play the crap out of the daily maps.

I was aware of the bottleneck in my supply chain. Hell, I'm even writing a paper on supply chain management RIGHT NOW! And the a.i. was set on the 3rd of 8 difficulty levels! This should have been a walk in the park.\nWell, I learned from it. After 3 hours of playing I'm pistol-whipping this little ******. I own the a.i. (on level 3 of 8). Now it's time to be a man and face it at 50% of its might. :D\n\nThe price:\nI got it on 50% summer sale. For 19 quid it offers fantastic value. I would go as high as 30. Wouldn't pay 40 though just yet. It's too steep for an early access game. Wait for a decent sale and get it if you enjoy economic games.\n\nThe con:\nThere's only one problem with the game and unfortunately it's a major one: the performance is sub par. The game is rather cpu-heavy. I got a decent system (i5-4660, gtx 960, 8 gb ram) which is way above min reqs. The cpu seems to be the bottleneck and it shouldn't be really. It's just a matter of poor programming (no multi-core support maybe?).\n\n-----------------------------------------\nUpdate: As of beta 4 the performance has improved significantly and is actually pretty good now.\n\nUpdate: The game is in beta 5 by now. Many improvements again. Farther zoom level, balance, more campaign features etc.\nHaving played it for 45 hours now in total, I can easily recommend it. Still not burned out on it in any way.\n\nrating: 9/10","June 19, 2015","true","47.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Solo is ok against the AI, but play it multiplayer and you will be hooked\n\nit's nice as the games aren't civilization length and the gameplay is pretty straightfoward and bug free. it is pricy at 35.00 + but when you figure games like dayz that are in the same cost neighborhood and are bug ridden and have horrible game play. this is a slam dunk. it shows that they did the right thing and developed it to a good point before releasing it on EA.

It keeps you on your toes as players react to changing prices, trying to make profits. You need to be constantly asking yourself, "what resources are the other players neglecting?"\n\nIt can become quite frenzied in the end game as you buy up a couple other players and suddenly you need to manage ~60 structures, trying to gain cash faster than your rivals, who are trying to buy out your company. Trash those Glass Furnaces, drop down Reactors, research Oxygen production because it's selling for 60k offworld. Your rival has more Offworld Markets; better sabotage his shipments or oxygen production...\n\nEvery game is different with randomized maps and resource distributions. Black Market (aggressive abilities and other utilities) is also switched up. There isn't really a build order; need to look at the map and the other colonies to figure out the best overall plan, which will definitely change several times during the 20 min game.\n\nIt's fun.","June 30, 2015","true","35.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The balance is practically non-existent, the AI seems to make horrifyingly bad choices and at times it seems like the game is straight up cheating as ridiculous as that may sound. A particular example of this happened in one game when the bot, finding itself roughly $80,000 in debt, suddenly and inexplicably, had it's stock-price nearly quadruple while it's debt only increased.\n\nIt then proceeded to use it's newfound debt to buy me out in all of twenty seconds.\n\nDeciding that perhaps operating so far in the red that you're in the black must be how you do things on Mars, I tried a similar strategy only to be met with the bot making the same miraculous turn-around only a few days in.\n\nSetting aside the questionable balance for a moment, I'd also like to point out that the audio is almost impossible to understand at times. But I guess that's kind of a moot point considering the probables you're going to have to go through to play this miserable game.\n\nAll in all? Save your money for a better game.

While this game is pretty fun in single player it really shines in multiplayer. As someone who plays a lot of 4x and strategy games with friends, this game is a blast. It's something completely different which I'm always on the hunt for.\n\nThe game is you play a company on mars and you are trying to snag the resources you can and make money, all while buying out the other players. But it goes deeper than that. You only have so many claims for resources, and distance from your base makes a serious difference. Sabatoge adds a whole other layer to the game as well and is probably my favorite part! Nothing like completely shutting down another players supply chain and listening to them curse.\n\nIt still needs some balancing, for example, the off world trade center seems almost too powerful, and a save function and maybe a minimap would be nice.

The fact that it is non violent is a clear plus. The economic twist to it is a plus too. But considering its current state it is overpriced and the 10% discount is a joke. I would recomment buying at 15-20€ even for an early access (shouldn't early access games be cheaper than finished ones ?)\n\nThe main con I find to it that the graphics are really slow (or it requires a graphic card too powerful) especialy when one considers the quality of the graphics of the buildings.\n\nOh, sorry, the first con is actually the fact that you cannot scroll on the map and there is no minimap. You use the keyboard to move. Or maybe I missed something which could be included in the absent documentation.\n\nThe second/third con is the lack of diversity for the decor. The maps are diverse with regards to the resources, but the red mars tend to be a bit boring on the long run.\n\nIf you can overcome these issues, the game actually turns out to be... ok (I din't say great or anything similar). It really is about trading so you can afford to loose money on cheap resources that you don't produce as long as you earn more on expensive resources that you produce.\n\nThe number of tiles (aka buildings) that you can build is very limited so you should be careful about how you use them and how you place them. You can scrap a building to build another but only at the same place.\n\nFinally, once you've built the offworld market you've more or less won. This is how I won the scientific scenario that some others claim to be unfeasible. By the way, I won all the tutorials without using the engineering. I still don't know what it does but it does not seem very useful so far.\n\nOne should also note that this a rather fast paced game especially at the beginning (or maybe it is just the game lagging that prevents you from playing fast enough).\n\nI haven't done the multiplayer part yet.

Someone wrote, it compares best to the classic M.U.L.E.\n\nThe basic idea is, that you found a venture on mars to grab ressources, manufacture goods, and sell them for a profit.\nThere is a dynamic price mechanism based on supply and demand. This is nothing new. But it plays out in real time and feels like an RTS. (Sidenote: One of the designers mentioned Company of Heroes when talking about OTC! The game is totally different, but it "feels" as action packed as CoH while being all about economics).\n\nSo you have to make decisions all the time - and since it is real time, there is a cost for not deciding: Do I claim a nice tile of land on mars to put a new factory there? Or do I make my existing stuff more efficient? Do I buy up someone elses stock? Or do I pay back my debt to prevent someone else from buying me out? Do I want to produce something that will guarantee small profits, or do I take a risk and switch to a potentially more profitable strategy? And .... WHO THE HELL has sabotaged my power supply again?!?\n\nThe content and scope of this game is limited, but beautiful. Thats why I think, this game should set for a price of about 25 USD. The mechanic is fresh, the presentation is nice and the playstyle is rather unique.\n\nAnd I love the music. It will probably change a lot of times... I hope they include most of it in the final soundtrack.\n\nMy impression:\n- Single Player: Skirmish and Daily challenge are nice play modes. The campaign mode feels like an addon - but it will need a lot of polish if it wants to compete with games like Anno 1401.\n- Multiplayer: Intense! Currently you might have to wait a few minutes to get a game going. This will get much more popular the closer OTC gets to release date.\n\nGood points:\n- Fresh playstyle and interesting scenario.\n- Nice and fluent visual presentation and music.\n- Cutthroat multiplayer robberbaron capitalism.\n- Music and sound.\n\nNot so good points (yet!):\n- Statistics will need more work. (I assume it gets it)\n- Almost no storytelling. (I don't expect too much changes here)\n- You win by clicking a button. This isn't the most exciting way of a finale (yet!)\n\nI would not expect a huge package that offers anything near the variety of a Civ V.

It feels like a spiritual successor to MULE, though with quite a bit of added complexity that I welcome; in MULE you had just three (technically four) resources:\n- Food, which gives you time to work during your turn\n- Energy, which is required to operate your MULEs so they can produce resources\n- Smithore, which is required to build your MULEs in the first place\n- There was also a fourth (rare) resource, Crystite, which was purely valuable as a commodity to sell when the price randomly fluctuated to a high level.\n\nDespite being very simple system, the three main resources worked well together and a shrewd player could, at great risk to themselves, potentially corner the market in one resource and leave all the other players out to dry.  Offworld Trading Company allows similar risky maneuvers, such as cornering the silicon market and preventing other players from producing glass and electronics, or cornering the water market and preventing other players from producing food, fuel, and oxygen.  While MULE was a local multiplayer game (it was the 1980s, online wasn't a thing), Offworld Trading Company is online, which allows for large player counts and real-time play instead of turn-based.  There are a lot of other differences, many of them positive, a few of them negative.\n\nThere are still a few things I think need to be worked on; the ability to collude with other players to cooperate against another player by directly trading resources instead of putting them on the stock market would make a tremendous improvement and is one of the few vital game mechanics I really miss from MULE.  I'd suggest adding a new building which gives the ability for players to directly trade resources with each other with the caveat that like in the original MULE, the other players in the game should be made aware that these players are colluding.  It wouldn't necessarily say what specific transations took place, just that they made a transaction.  Transactions could range from a constant pooling of a certain resource or transferring resources in specific amounts, to temporarly lending ownership of a structure to another player.  Another thing I'd like to see is the ability to license patents to another player in exchange for a lump sum of money or a percentage of their profits.","June 29, 2015","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whereas worker placement games tend to fall under the Eurogame umbrella (i.e. boring abstract pieces of uninteractive garbage) Offworld Trading Company thankfully doesn't fall into that trap.\n\nYou're on Mars to make mad dosh and prevent your fellow corporations from doing the same. The black market exists for you to fry their steel industry at key points with EMPs, to hire pirates to prey upon their shipping lines, and to cause energy blackouts.\n\nEvery decision has heavy weight, especially the decision to spend claims, which is the game's territory system. You can't endlessly expand your borders like Civilization. Every time you upgrade your HQ you gain 4-5 tiles' worth of claims which you can then spend to create facilities on land. The level of long-term strategy is high here because you can't refund those claims; the most you can do is destroy the building, which may not even help you if you need a building with a different resource.\n\nI would recommend this to any strategy gamer who has grown bored of traditional manifestations of the genre.

I'm the kind of player who prefers to spend time investing in one persistent game (as in Cities:Skylines, Dark Souls or an MMO), rather than a match-based game like this one.\n\nThat said and given the premise of the match RTS subgenre, I have to say it's a very refreshing IP. No combat whatsoever, but instead an all-out trading system where you manipulate the market and make sure you produce, buy and sell the right kinds of resources for maximum profit and the detriment of your opponents (who share your market).\n\nAs for resources, they do feel a bit few and "slapped onto" the game. There's no explicit tree structure or overall design that makes me feel like I should care (possibly because of the said match-based gameplay, which makes everything feel rushed).\n\nI guess I just wish that this kind of trade-focused game would be more fleshed out, with greater array of goods, upgrades, services, alternatives and just general depth. The game feels like a one-man indie game project.\n\nOverall, I have to say that the idea is pretty good and, for its premise and its price, the game plays decently (but not excellently). I can recommend this game, although just barely (I wish there was a third choice haha). The game does have major potential, and I do think the devs may deliver on some of that. I also haven't seen any major bugs with this game yet, but I haven't played it too much either so idk. But I do wish the game was just a few notches better than it is.","March 28","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is incredibly hard to figure out on your own so I highly recommend watching a Twitch tutorial. You also want to learn with the pause button (space bar) pretty much constantly on. Good players can crush it in a couple of minutes so consider yourself warned.\n\nI love that every choice can hurt you or help you in a logical way. If you build a dozen farms it will drive up the price on water to keep them going. If you sell goods cheaply they only get cheaper, so it is time to make something else. If you can see the impact of your actions you can manipulate the market in cool ways (e.g. using a robotics company that requires no water to create a water shortage can cripple your fleshy foes).\n\nThe AI is pretty good and it rarely makes outright terrible errors. This means that even the tutorials can be punishingly hard if you are not paying attention.

I am glad that I broke my own rule and took the plunge with Offworld Trading Company.  For a game that isn't even touted as a Final Release version, it is amazingly well along.  I have played many games so far and have enjoyed them, even when I lost to the AI.  I have yet to try the multi-player, but this game has given me faith.\n\nI tried to make a list of Pros & Cons but found it difficult.  The only Con I can really give this game is that it isn't done yet!  :P\n\nBig thumbs up to the team behind this game.  I can't wait for the finished version and to the DLC I know is coming!  (hint hint, DLC in the future please!)\n\nI would advise investing in this game despite the Early Access tag.  Even if they stopped right now, its still WAY better than Race to Mars ever will be I fear.\n\nAs a side note...I did wait until it was going for $20 USD instead of $40.\n\nAs another side note:  I read some of the negative reviews (about 10% of them) and found that alot of people complained about 'shallowness', the Black Market and the AI's tendency to pile up money and buy you out.  I was perplexed by all of that.\n\nThe supposed shallowness allows for games that don't take an entire day of my life while allowing for a pace that kept me busy until the end.  If I want on 'in-depth' experience, I'll play Civ or something like that.\n\nThe Black Market...nope, no problems with that either.  I like the fact that not only can I sabotage the competition, they can also do the same to me.  The costs increase not only when you use it, but when the AI uses it.  So if you can catch it, you can get an idea of the general plans of the competition.  Couple that with keeping an eye on Share Prices, it's not hard to figure out who just bought what.\n\nAnd as for the AI buying you out...that's what it's supposed to do.  And if you have played correctly, you have made it hard for them to do so...which drives the tactic of storing up the $1 Million+ it will take.  The best business deals are the ones that surprise everyone else.  Why would that be any different here.","June 18, 2015","true","29.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But don't be fooled by the lack of military units, the game won't be easy. There's a lot to manage, other players to worry about and futures to predict (or create). Those of you who've played M.U.L.E. will find this extremely familiar, but in real-time rather than the turn-based style of the original.\n\nThe game itself is relatively simple to pick up, but there's a lot of depth and interacting complexity to master. You'll be deciding which resources to focus on, which buildings are cost inefficient, picking between the two research options, deciding whether to double short the or just to rush into Off World Markets, not to mention who to wreck with blackmarket tech and when.\n\nOf course, it's not perfect being that it's in Early Access, the UI needs polish, and I find the game can be sluggish at times, especially in the end game (though, that's likely my fault for running it at 1440p), but overall the game is ridiculously fun, and the core mechanics are extremely solid, and the multiplayer community is really strong and friendly (though, they may still wreck you at first, no hard feelings, of course).

I'm not sure its remotely worth 40$. In todays day and age I understand inflation and general quality of life insists we pay more for our games but I simply don't understand why we pay 40$ for what should be, in its current state, a 20$ game.  I am all for early access even being burnt by df9 like others, I'm very inpatient but why not pay 20$ to have access to the alpha and a buy in of 10$ for the full game when your done and 35 for the person who didn't try it before release? games like planetary anhilation that set that alpha price to rediculous ammounts really dont want your feedback just your money.\n\n-rant over-\n\nThe gameplay at this point is really unique , I liked it alot. I, like always, jumped right into the game campaign without doing the tutorial and got obliterated. repeatedly, something about the reasource grab in the begining can be very unforgiving. its definately more of an rts than those turnbased lovers of civ. That said I'd like to point out all 'popular' rts's tend to have a decent chunk of campaign to play through. I lowered the difficulty after a few losses and found myself beating it too easily but I was really intrigued by the sofar bare bone campaign so I figured I'd see what it was all about. Much to my disappointment that was it. after a few missions with no real plot or explanation of your conquests on mars you easily finish the campaign ina couple hours... praise the lord they arnt done developing. after a few missions you generaly get the idea of how to take the reigns, you quickly learn all the buildings and how to place them well; there doesnt seem to be quiet enough... even with 16 resources or w.e there was specialization was never really an option even on rare resource missions supply always exceeded demand  far to easily and demand never rose fast enough... I think there are some resource balancing tweeks to be done and alot to desire game wise but in its current state its VERY playable with only a few little bugs.\n\n\nI want more; I will be watching this one.","February 13, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So far as I can see from the negative reviews, they're mostly there because they expected a long strategy game like Civ, which it is not. This is quite a fast game comparitively and it notes in the trailer that most games are expected to be 30 minutes.\nI have mixed thoughts on the AI, as sometimes they make very stupid decisions, but to be fair most of the time they get it right. A lot of people are complaining that they quickly get bought out by the AI, but this is merely a strategy that is available in the game due to it's fast pace, and if you cannot deal with it then you should not be playing 30-40 minute RTS games, but rather something like Civ (Which is personally one of my favorite game series).\nThe tutorials in this game are quite lacking, and they are basically just throwing you into the deep end, so some people may find it hard to pick up.

It's basically that game, except you win by selling enough resources to buy out your opponents. There isn't any reason to build an economy beyond that goal. As a free-market capitalism tutorial I guess it's educational, but it probably would have made a better board game than a videogame.\n\nAs for the state of the alpha right now, balance is pretty wonky, such as lower-valued companies can easily and unpreventably buy out more valuable competitors off the back of a single off-world shipment plus a little commodity selling, and the framerate is both unlocked and badly optimized enough that my computer tries to melt a hole in the floor just on the main menu.\n\nThe game has ran stably for me but I don't know how they're going to bulk out the gameplay to make this an interesting thing to play. It is tuned so the commodity production and everything else can be done very quickly, so twitch plays a factor and you can't play this with anything but undivided attention, which is unfortunate since I find it quite boring. If it were slower paced and less hectic I could at least listen to a podcast or something while I played.","February 16, 2015","false","5.8"," 30 of 59 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","30","59","2","1"

It still needs work but great so far. I love the economic RTS so far my complaints are that the tutorials isn’t all that good and doesn’t touch at all on the black market or the special buildings witch is a very key factor in the game. I also wish there would be a tutorial on how to set up the colonies. After the trial and error when first playing the game and figure out the game and how it works it is great and I love it. The first hours is frustrating trying to figure out what’s going on in the game but after a few YouTube tutorials it’s worth it and is my new favorite RTS.

One of my favorite things is the ability to jump into a game with friends and it only takes 30 minutes or less to finish up a match. As far as betas go, this is a pretty well developed game. Bugs seem minimal so far (though I have had some friends have more issues on Mac platforms). All around, it is a fun, quick game.

Right now I do find it enjoyable and I look forward to the addition of leagues and ladders.\n\nGameplay is already quite polished and it looks nice. It's an interesting take on the RTS genre and I would love to see more games like this.\n\nIf I could select one change off the bat, it would be more market information and more dynamic markets. Right now the only truly dynamic resources is energy. Global prices are, it seems, driven by either player stockpile purchases or running deficits, which someone else could capitalize on. I'd like to see the markets function by net contribution and less stockpile driven, so rather than attempting to accumulate valuable goods and selling them off in bulk to buyout opponents have running market contribution. There seems to be a bit too much "random invisible supply and demand we dont know" driving market function. Giving us some idea of ambient demand and supply balance or even "global stockpile" that determines pricing would be nice, and then introducing exogenous price shocks to randomly shift market prices would be cool too. Something to give the pricing a bit more depth.\n\nSimilarly, the share ownership function could also gain more depth, giving extra utility to ownership would be quite interesting. Defensive ownership blocks provide no real benefit if you're behind, and spending that cash on buying yourself only means you can't spend it on further expansion which I could see leading to increasingly snowbally gameplay. It seems like it would always be better to build ownership blocks in other companies.\n\nFinally adding more depth to the debt system would be quite cool. Right now debt seems like it works primarily as a death spiral - if you don't get your basic resources up and running you just enter a fixed debt growth and unless market prices (which we dont know enough about) swing your way you won't be able to get yourself out of it. Allowing players to manually take on debt in order to boost their economy would be a nice idea.\n\nNone-the-less its an interesting and enjoyable game on to play on early access release which is a rare find, and with additional work it could become a genuinely deep and interesting competitive game.","February 13, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Is worth it?" Well, the short answer to this is: "YES". I'll review some of the game features here and, if you're in a hurry, there is a tl;dr section at the end.\n\nWhat's the game?\n\nYou're in charge of a trading colony on Mars and you compete with other companies to gain monopoly on the planet. It fits really nice with all the talks going on about an actual manned expedition to Mars.\n\nHow to win?\n\nYou have to buy stocks of the other players and gain control of their company. You win the game when you have bought all the other companies. If your own company gets bought, you instantly loose the game.\n\nWhat's the gameplay?\n\nYou start off with a little cash and ressources (or none, there are options to set it before starting a game). You'll then have to build some buildings (like a mine or a steel mill) to harvest some ressources, be it iron or steel, etc. You can then transform these ressources into building materials or goods which you use or sell on a global market. All the players affect that market; if someone sells a lot of a product, its price is going to go down and, on the contrary, if someone buys a lot of a ressource, its price is going up for everybody.\n\nWith the money and the ressources, you can expand your colony, buy some stocks or use the black market (i'll get back to it later). In order to build more, you'll need to spend some claims. Claims that allow you, and only you, to use a tile in the game. So, especially at the beggining of a game, the fastest to find and lay claims on ressources is most likely to have the better spots. Those claims are obtained by expending your HQ or bought on the black market. So, the twist of the game is, you'll be struggling with few claims and you'll have to prioritise what building you need. Are you going to try and be self-sufficient? Or maybe invest in a pricey ressource gathering infrastructure? That's the kind of questions you'll be dealing with most of the game.\n\nYou HQ and your ressource transforming building will need some base ressources that you can mine yourself, or buy on the market (thus making it pricier). When you're lacking a ressource it increases your debt, which affect the value of your stocks. If your stocks are cheap, it's easier for other players to buy and you might loose the game. So watch that debt carefully.\n\nIs that it? A ressource harvesting/transforming game?\n\nMostly, yes. There are some researches and upgrading you can do in the game, but you'll spend those hard-earned claims mostly on harvest/producing more.\n\nWhat's the blackmarket?\n\nYou can't directly attack other players, at least in a classic RTS way. There are no soldiers and you can't steal a nice spot claimed, but you can affect their production with the help of some saboteurs available on the blackmarket. For some money, you can dynamite one of their building or launch an EMP that will freeze their buildings for sometime. Of course, you can also be the target of such attacks and, if you're not defended (with goons also from the blackmarket), you won't know who hit you.\n\nOf course, as it is the goal of the game, you can buy other players stocks and then win the game.\n\nIs it a good early access?\n\nYes. I haven't add issues with the game crashing. It's working really well on my end and all the features are there. Of course, some elements are still to be updated. As an exemple, there are no dedicated servers provided for multiplayer games, making the game quit if the host leaves the game. Like in the good old days.\n\nBut, for the rest, everything is there and you'll be able to enjoy all the mechanics.\n\nAny other notable feautres?\n\nA few. This game has a lot replayability, every map is random generated so no game is going to be like the previous one. A complete game lasts around 30-45 minutes, providing that you're the winner. A few options available before starting the game like a tighter debt or masquerade can add a little something to a game.\n\n\nThere must be some downsides, no?\n\nSure, but I would insist that they do not compromise the quality of the game mechanics. Except for the dedicated servers I spoke about earlier, the voiceover is actually horrible. You can't understand half and there is no clear logic in them (like, one faction gets a robotic male voice, then there is a female voice that speaks for them, no apparent reason why). Also, th UI might get a little more responsive, the buttons especially. Events are shown in a small text log on the right, but they should appear bigger since they can greatly affect your game (a shortage or surplus on a ressource can be a random event that will influence the price of said ressources, for exemple).\n\nAnd the price, for about 500mo of game, not that nice graphics and all, is a bit high. But, in my opinion, it is worth it.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\nGreat gameplay mechanics\nActual subject\nExcellent replayability\nFun multiplayer\nIndirect attacks with blackmarket\nOut of the box strategy game\nCons:\nVoiceover\nNo dedicated servers\nPrice\nIn the end: really great game that will get you an alternative RTS we don't see much these days. If you like strategy games, wargames and ressource management games: this is for you. I recommend it without any doubt.\n\n9,5/10","February 16, 2015","true","48.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It reminds me a bit of a resource based board game (Power Grid, etc.) but done in real time. A really nice blend of chin stroking strategy and frantic moment to moment tactics, all without guns and combat! There is dynamite though..\n\nThere are some problems. The biggest issue by far is the abruptness that games end, at least in the default game mode. It's very possible to be humming along, building your successful empire, and then all of the sudden an opponent completely buys you out and bam, you lose. Uhh, ok.. gg?\n\nThis comes down partially to the stock purchasing mechanic and partially to the UI being somewhat rudimentary. If the fact an opponent was about to buy you out was somehow *much* more visible maybe everything would be fine. As it stands there is no late game tension unless you know where to look for it. Compare this to combat based RTS games where its obvious your base is under attack and you are about to lose.\n\nThis game /is/ in early access so I do have hope that the above problem can be addressed in some fashion.

You balance managing resources and growing your company with nuking your opponents mines, tampering with their water supply, and buying shares in their company with the ultimate goal of acquiring all of your competitors businesses. You buy and sell resources on the open market, and the price of goods is reflected by the supply from you and your competitors, their demand, the distribution of resources on the map, and the demands of the Martian colony.\n\nIt's a very tense "economic RTS" from the designer of Civ IV. This is an RTS more about timings, resource management, and awareness than micromanagement.

And if someone else has a building you don't want them to have, it may accidentally explode.. or you 'borrow' it for some time to win the race to one of the juicy patents (buffs only one player can have). In the end, you want to make money more quickly than the other people (and avoid debt!), in order to buyout their companies. And .. sometimes you may have to manipulate the market prices a tiny bit..\n\nSo how does the strategy layer of OTC look it? Well, one important aspect is that space is limited. Every time you upgrade your HQ, you can claim some more (4-5) tiles on the map. These normally are tiles either next to your HQ or tiles with resources on it.\n\nSince (good) resources tiles are limited, you can create the situation where you nearly have a monopoly on a raw resource. And if everyone has to buy from you (via the market), you can make quite a profit by actively generating this situation. Doing so is tricky though, since at the start of the match, the map is covered with fog of war - and only when your HQ position is selected, the whole map is revealed. Might turn out that whole map is covered with silicon.. but there barely is any carbon! Time to change long term plans!\n\nOnce you own a tile, its yours for the rest of the match. This is where good positioning and foresight comes into play, because whatever buildings you are going to use, those have to be on these limited tiles. Got those now-useless mines on the other end of the map? Well, just put factories there instead. However, transporting goods costs fuel, which requires water to make, which drives up prices and reduces profit.\n\nAll producing buildings get adjacency bonuses (each +50% for 2 buildings, +75% for 3). So your first idea might be "well, get some mines in the middle of nowhere and a big cluster of tiles at my HQ to maximize adjacency". However, this leaves your production very vulnerable to area of effect sabotage by that dude that doesn't like you. Ouch.\n\nThe market prices rise and drop depending on what all players do. This requires you to switch up production on the fly. You produced food? Well, turns out over the last minutes prices for the required water skyrocketed, so you don't make a profit anymore. Better replace those farms with something better.\nA classic example is that no one cares to produce energy in the early game (not profitable; not helping to upgrade HQ). This causes the energy prices to rise in the midgame, which you can actively abuse by then dumping energy on the market (while sabotaging everyone else who tries that).\n\nThe game has four factions, each with a spin on how they work. -Expansionists get more claims and cheaper buildings, allowing them to be more flexible\n-Robots don't need life support supplies - and get adjacency not only for same type of buildings, but also if a supplier is next to a factory.\n-By the power of science, factories can use the resource tiles below them!\n-Real Scavengers don't use steel like everyone else, but use carbon - which allows them to pull off above play with energy production very effectively. Also they love sabotaging.\n\n\n\nSo would I recommend the game? Like I said, I think it's a very interesting take on the RTS genre. It has a lovely soundtrack (Christopher Tin, aka Baba Yetu/Civ 4 Main Theme). I'm personally not sure about the 40 Eur price tag though.. ouch.. When it's on sale for 20, I would say pick it up. Since I can't comment on the multiplayer and its longevity and dynamic yet, I'm not sure whether I personally would give 30 for it. Then again, I'm a very conservative buyer.\nI honestly fear that the maximum strategic depth may be much shallower than say Starcraft (1!) or the Wargame series - but I think that can be expected, since market mechanics and its potential generally probably aren't fully explored yet. SC and WG are in their 4th+ iteration, in the more classic multiplayer RTS style and thus strategically much more refined. I'm very curious how they'll expand on this mechanic, though.","April 30","true","29.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It feels very different from the conventional RTS (examples: StarCraft, CnC), but it still plays very solidly as a game in the genre. While it may feel bland at first to know that there is no martial combat aspect in the game, it compensates for that empty space very quickly by bringing pressures in macro decisions.\n\nAs the name of the game suggests, this game puts you in the position of a decision maker for a trading company on Mars, with range of actions from claiming different plots of land on Mars and trading the goods, to tampering the markets to your advantage (or your opponent's disadvantage). Your goal is to buy out all of your opponents and become the monopoly on Mars's resources.\n\nThe game is fully focused on macromanagement, which may make the game feel a bit slow. However, that does not mean that it is not exciting. Game gives you a lot of options with very limited number that you can actually choose, so you have to really plan a bit ahead on how you are going to work things out. As time progresses, your choices grow, but you will see that you will constantly be hassled by your opponents and may start facing the danger of being bought out. Your only friends will be your wits and your guts, as you make your own moves to press down your opponents and take control of what they own once and for all.\n\nWhile the game is enjoyable in many aspect, I feel that the snowballing effect may become an issue as people become more familiar to the game mechanics. I guess that will be another thing that will be countered, either by evolution of player strategy or developer intervention. I am just bringing out the possibility.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 9.5/10.

The only RTS I'm playing now (so I finally abandon AoE and Rise of Nation). So i think the idea worth the price (I've bought it on sale, though). The realisation as well is expensive (good AI, stable code). So I was surprised to see just "mostly positive" as a summary of user reviews. I really want this game to be fully published.\n\nPoint by point:\n1. No blood. You do not have to rise and command an army. Still, you are able to be offensive and there are plenty of things you do have to command.\n2. True fast-paced RTS - you can limit your gaming time to one round - to 30-50 minutes. You do not have to do low-level micromanagment, you have to be fast as well as smart. However, there are meditating moments as well.\n3. Very original. I had to spend an hour just to learn what are the rules. And these are very interesting rules. There are simularities with Civilization (and Catan as well). Still, this is something new for me. Basically, you have to buy opponents' companies. There are different strategic decisions you have to do - which type of base to build, whether to invest or not into intellectual property (patents), wich materials you have to mine, which you are able to buy in the market, which type of energy to choose, do you want to use lending or not. There is a lot of tactics here as well. So.. The rules are balanced and there is a lot to master here. However, they still tune the balance so you might find one day that the game had changed and you have to adopt.\n4. The rules are tunebale. So you can turn off some of the things people are complaining about in other comments and make the game more balanced and make the "rush" stratagy more hard to implement.\n5. The AI is strong. So offline is challenging as well. Looks like there is online option - never tried that.\n6. Nice GUI, music and animations. No crashes - high level of coding for early access.\n\nSo if you enjoy economic part in RTS games or if you enjoy both RTS and Civilization-like games, you defenitely should try this one. This is a new kind of experience.","November 29, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Shockingly, they pulled it off.\n\nThis is an economic RTS, which means no direct combat. You win by buying all the stocks of your opponents. Don't think this means no conflict. The games sabotage system is rather brutal and you will have ample opportunity to harass your opponents as well as get bent over by the AI.\n\nThis brings us to the computer controlled players. They will completely kick your ♥♥♥ on higher difficulties. According to the developers, the AI does not cheat, they are just that good. Although this might sound like a bad point it is in fact a positive. You can lower your handicap enough that you can learn to play without getting insta-killed to learn and then ramp up the difficulty later.\n\nThere are a wide variety of resources to collect and even more production items you can make with those resources. Many of them are required to progress and anything you do not make yourself must be purchased. Although there is a limitless supply of resources to purchase, the more an item is bought the higher the price becomes. Likewise the more you sell resources the cheaper they become. It is a constant balancing act that becomes quite enjoyable.\n\nMultiplayer is fantastic. You can easily partner with a buddy and share resources. This means you can each focus on specific raw resources and manufacturing. When you build two of the same types of buildings next to each other, they gain an adjacency bonus of 50%. With three touching the adjacency bonus is 75%. This means that building two of the same building next to each other does not double production, it triples it. This is a huge advantage in co-op play.\n\nAt this time the game is listed as early access. I would disagree and say it is release quality. We have played probably 50 games with no glitches ot crashes of any kind. The game is solid, balanced, challenging and fun. Completely worth a buy.","October 19, 2015","true","33.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Of course it's the only market RTS I've every played, but that just makes it unique. The best I can describe it is a mix between Civilization and Starcraft.

The extreme competition of trying to buyout the other players has all the thrills of a Star Craft match, without the need for twitch reflexes. This provides a very different experience from other games. Scratching an itch I didn't know I had. I would suggest getting it for the multiplayer alone.

But if you do, it does.  I really, really wanted to like this game for its appearance.\n\nI think OTC has most of the strenghs of the Civ series with more replayability, due in large part to real-time pacing.  Beginners fear not!  The single-player version defaults with a pause button and save-or-bail options!  Advanced players fear much!  Multi-player doesn't!  But I digress.  Real time pacing enhances replayability by deemphasizing the start and playing a perfect strategy, and emphasizing making the fewest mistakes.  And who doesn't want to make fewer mistakes the next time.\n\nI wanted to like OTC.  I liked it.  Still do.  Got some hours under my belt and still nowhere near ready for prime time.

Given lots of resources and Employee difficulty, map options, I was able to get experience with interface, the upgrade options and sequence, and the financial system, and win consistently against the AI.  Always a good thing.  The financial system is the key to winning the game.  The AI is pretty good at finding local optima, better than I am anyway.  I'm better at global optima and was glad of the head start Employee difficulty gave.  And lots of resources ment the build script for my Robotic Colony was relatively simple so I could concentrate on the financial system.  And finding a nice big fat organic colony to buy out, er, ally with.  (Look, I know we don't have a lot in common, but . . .  What, that gyser of molten high-test steel behind me?  We meteored into a huge pile of iron ore.  By design.  3% over expectations, actually.

It's fun, and I think that's a fair price. Still getting to grips with the game, but first impressions are good. Graphics are neat, it has original economic gameplay, and the content is quite streamlined. I don't think there's enough to justify much more than £15 cost though. The game is enough for quickfire competitive games to kill time, but completely lacks the depth and complexity of many games out there with a £30-40 price tag.\n\nMultiplayer is the biggest problem it seems. I've found it very hard to find other players to play with.

You can max out all your buildings in about ten minutes and after that it's a game of fine tuning what you are producing and manipulating the market to drive prices up.  It's almost impossible to lose money so there's never any worry about that.  The only real point is to make money faster then your competitors so you can buy them out.  Offworld Trading Company is a good idea that just didn't work out.","May 30","false","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It plays different than i thought. (even after watching videos)\n\n2. It's ALOT of fun if you dig into it.\n\nIt doesnt play like i "thought" it would play after watching the videos... yes you have to stare at numbers and if you're not into trading games maybe you should just keep walking and give this one a pass. But the game is just so much fun nevertheless, i had teethgrinding moments against the CPU in the very original campaign (which isn't really a campaign, it's more a series of skirmish maps to see who's coming out on top). Which is everytime different so the replay value is already immense.\n\nI also thought it's going to be a bit on the dull side since it's a peacefull game. But the oposite is true, you can sabotage your enemy in many ways that you only start to understand a couple of hours into the game and you're constantly on the verge of an economic breakdown. If you understand what's going on on the market and understand the enemies base you can cripple him where it hurts the most.\n\nYour enemy just bought patents so all his energy comes from waterpower ? Let's have pirates camping his watersupplyroutes, or even better nuke away his shiny Waterdepot...\n\nThere's alot to do constantly and the game revolves in a very fun way. If you play aggressive as in sabotaging your enemy constantly you will be on the map alot to find out what your enemy is planning to do before you can do it to him.\n\nI have not found any bugs yet and it's hardly noticable that this is an early access title at all.\n\nThe game is obviously in early access but it works already really good, so if you like economic games with a little twist you should give this one a go and stick to it. It's surprisingly good.","February 24, 2015","true","30.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Offworld Trading Company scratches my itch, gets me addicted, and then all of a sudden it's 1am and I have work in the morning.\n\nTHE GOOD\nThis is very polished for an early access game. Very polished.\nGames last between 30-45 minutes, which is perfect.\nThe UI is very intuitive and I was able to figure it out quickly.\nA game with market, economic, and game theory. Yum.\nFrequent updates from the devs.\nTHE BAD\nThere are still a couple of bugs and balancing issues floating around. The devs are tackling these through the aforementioned frequent updates so it's really not a dealbreaker. And, after all, it IS early access.\nThe AI can be very frustrating sometimes, buying you out in the space of 20 seconds and leaving you scratching your head as to where you went wrong. As with the previous point, this is something that the devs are aware of and they've already taken steps to resolve the problem.\nTHE UGLY\nThis list is empty, because the game really is very pretty.\nWould wholeheartedly recommend.

This is not Civilization or Anno 2070.\n- The tutorials are weak, with merely a popup explaining each faction at the start of each game.\n- I have not completed the campaign, so no comment there yet.\n- The interface is currently dominated by a lot of fast-changing numbers. You will spend more time looking at the numbers than you will at the playing field\n- The useful charts (stock price over time, resource price over time) are hidden in another menu that you have to switch out of the game view to get to.\n- Learderboards and leagues are not implemented yet\n- The game menus and buttons are not totally polished yet\n- Fonts were sometimes difficult to read on my laptop screen (1366x780)\n- Games tend to be one-sided as soon as a player begins to dominate. Last minute upsets are possible, but require skill and timing.\n-Late-game becomes entirely unnecessary once you get the hang of the mechanics (after playing a few skirmishes), this game desperately needs balancing.\n\nThe overall game is very fun and fast-paced, much like Monopoly. This game essentially purifies the economic victory modes (domination) common to other RTSs, elevating resource gethering and market tactics to its own strategy genre.","March 8, 2015","true","32.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Quick thinking and good knowledge of what is effecting the prices are the keys to winning each round.\nYou can produce aluminium and steel to upgrade for free or take advantage of cheap prices from other players selling off their excesses, however you won't know which is the better move until the game has started and you see what resources are available.\nResources are on a first claim basis meaning that you can miss out quickly or shoot yourself in the foot by claiming them too early.\n\nThe only thing I hated was that you could be bought out too unexpectantly. If you have 5 shares in your own company you start to feel safe, however someone can buy you out all at once and you wouldn't see it coming.\nThis is already being addressed by means of a warning when an oponent is close to having the funds to finish you off however it's not implemented flawlessly at the time of my writing this.\n\nIt shows its signs of being an early access but for the most part playes like a full release.","March 6, 2015","true","21.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is interesting how it deals with financial takeover of your opponents (through buying out their stock) as the win condition. I'm not sure I've played another game that used a mechanic quite like that. As I've learned how to play, I've slowly been increasing the AI difficulty and the game has remained fun and addicting. I haven't tried online multiplayer yet, but will probably play against some friends once I've got the strategies down a little better.\n\nAt the time of my review, the game was early access, and it feels like a finished experience. I'd say the most work could still be needed in the tutorials as they were not the most friendly to learn what to do. I had to checkout some developer video tutorials online to really get the hang of the later (and harder) tutorial levels.\n\nI definitely recommend this game though if you are looking for an interesting twist on the old real time strategy / resource management game type.

You can try collecting a resource that you know several other people will need, or monopolizing a single resource so that you can raise or lower the price of it at will. The goal is to buy out the other companies, and the depth of gameplay is deceptively larger than you may imagine.\n\nYou build an HQ that has colonists that need to survive, and you must provide for them. They need food, water, and air, among other things. But there are 4 different types of HQ's, all with different benefits. For instance the Robotic HQ has robotic colonists, so they obviously don't need food, water, and air, but they do need electronics.\n\nA typical game involves grabbing the best resource nodes that you can reach (before others take them), and then deciding your strategy. You could make some quick money to buy out another company before they can raise their stock price, or expand your development to all market resources so that you can capitalize on any high prices. Every game is different, and no one strategy will work every time.\n\nCompanies are not isolated from each other. You can hire hackers to artificially raise/lower any stock price temporarily, hire pirates to hijack shipments from your strongest competitor and bring them to you, or start building rockets to send shipments offworld if the prices for an item that you have a surplus of are not high enough.\n\nIt's easy to see why someone not interested in an Economic RTS would want to pass on this game. But if this type of game interests you, then this game is a must play. The AI is very tough, but fair. I can say with 100% confidence that the negative reviews on here about the game being "bland" were people that didn't understand just how much depth there is to the gameplay. As a fully completed game, I would call this a "must buy", as an early access, this is a "no brainer".","February 17, 2015","true","36.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Suddenly everyone takes our your ability to make power and you go into huge debt.

TL;DR - it's fun, but has some definite flaws, and is probably overpriced.  Giving it a 'like' because I still enjoy it, warts and all, but it's definitely not for everyone, particularly at the current price point.\n\nThis is not a grand strategy game; this is a short and simple "economic RTS" that's probably closer to M.U.L.E. than anything else (but not nearly as fun).  Games are played on a small, randomized map, and finish in anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or so.  The core gameplay is simple: claiming a limited number of resources, game the market and hobble your competition enough to buy out their stock before they buy out yours.  Some resources get consumed as upkeep, many of the rest are required for upgrades or advanced buldings, but at some point you reach a point of self-sufficiency, at which point everything surplus is for sale.\n\nWhat makes it interesting is the various ways in which you can try to kneecap them by limiting resources, either by throwing one of a very small set of 'black market' attacks at them to disable buildings or resources, or by manipulating the market somehow.  Cut off their oxygen supply; don't sell surplus power; sabotage their mines; flood the market with the commodity that they rely on as a cash source.  The supply chains are long enough that there's usually a weak point in everyone's, and finding and attacking your opponents' while adapting to attacks on your own is the main challenge of the game.\n\nWhat makes it not interesting is that there's a strong self-reinforcing going on; if you start out ahead, you have the resources to keep your competitors under your heel.  If you start out behind, it can be almost impossible to get ahead.  By the time you've hit the mid-game (base upgrade level 3-4 where you start becoming self-sufficient) you usually know who the winner is going to be.  The bulk of the interaction between players happens in the market at one remove, so it's sometimes hard to tell that you're competing against other players rather than an arbitrary resource cost.  It feels like more of a race than a fight.\n\nThere's also some interface issues; it's very sluggish, particularly towards the end of a game, the text is too small, and the graphics are perhaps best described as 'functional'.\n\nSo all that said, it's entertaining, but perhaps not at the price point.","February 15, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I try to find nice places to harvest resources, I expand and try my best to gather the most points.\nUnlike Settlers, there is more to this game that only resource gathering and expansion, aspects I haven't understood or learnt yet. So I lose...\nBut losing doesn't feel like failure, it feels like learning. And that I think is because of the game. It beats you but only to make you learn. Me, I like that.\n\nIt is a mechanical game, it's mostly about making the right decisions long term vs short term. When I link my only two sources of power I get bonuses but become vulnerable to sabotage. I gamble that I can make it. Afterwards, I get sabotaged and lose some time later, I'm bought out and lose. I play on "employee" level (low difficulty) and still I get my ♥♥♥ wooped.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that this is a challenging game with no easy path to victory, even on a low difficulty and after three playthroughs. Hopefully multiplayer will be equally enjoyable or more.\n\nSo far I'm very satisfied with my purchase! =)","February 15, 2015","true","22.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its an rts game with an economic focus. Unlike other rts games where destruction is the end goal, yours is to amass enough wealth to eventually buy out your foes.\n\nFirst impressions: Its quite appealing to the eye, Its nothing incredibly realistic looking but it seems to work for it. Interface is brilliant, really. I was confused as to how to play the game for maybe the first play through, after that it seemed straight forward. The A.I. are competent and tricky at times which is nice considering the multiplayer is very buggy right now. As an economic focus rts, It seems a little silly that they enabled things like emp's and dynamite and such.\n\nFinal remarks: Its a good game, definately worth playing if you love economic domination games. however 43 seems a little out of the price range but if  you have the cash go for it, its fun.\n\nMessage to the developers: I take issue with the black market tactics. I mean, a lawsuit could easily just give the money back. What I'm trying to get at is that if you want to blow stuff up but want to collect tonnes of resources, Anno 2070 is a great place to go. This game seems more oriented towards production and cash flow but to attract a larger volume of players, such as those who prefer kick ♥♥♥ explosions, you added dynamitesabotage.\n\nCorrective action on that issue is easy, either make it another rts game with armies, or you focus on actual economic strategies that take place in actuality. Lobbying, public affairs and propoganda, lawsuits, banning of certain things (types of mines or means of production) or both in game or enabling certain things within the game lobby (no army, no sabotage, no economic victory etc.) Besides the aformentioned issue, this game seems to be headed in a very interesting and refreshing direction, I eagerly await the new developments\n","February 28, 2015","true","40.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The prices grow  the more its used to the point where it costs you more than it could make profits.\nAlso increasing number of players diminishes the effect of EMPs. When you knock out a player you may gain some advantage on him but what about other 6 players?\nOverall i think black market is well balanced. The only think I dislike is starting mutini prices.

There is a small and manageable set of well-defined mechanics which can be combined in endless combinations.\n\nIt's hard though.

Watch what happens when you have the only good silicon resource and use the hacker array to drive up the price of glass. Suddenly everyone takes our your ability to make power and you go into huge debt.

I do need to disclose that I have yet to win a game! I am however still enjoying the journey. Also becouse I couldn't easliy find it, YOU DO NOT NEED TO PLAY AGAINST AI, I saw so many coments where the AI was broke no one mentioned the multiplayer so I was just kinda hoping when I bought the game. Sure enopugh you can jump into Multi-player right away, again though I would go through the tuts. A little confusing at first, make sure you read what you are trying to do and you will get the hang of it pretty quick. For those board game geeks out there this is ALOT like Suburbia!!!

I managed to get 3 hrs of gameplay out of just the tutorials, without doing any multiplayer or campaign mode. So that to me is a great start. The graphics are pretty and the interface is really easy to use. For an Early Access game its suprisingly complete and polished.\n\nUnfortunately I did encounter some graphical issues, but I feel that is more because my computer is at the low end of the (mac) system requirements, and not because of the game. The whole game just slowed to a lag fest by the end of tutorial 4 and 5 (so much is going on, onscreen), and the text was fairly unreadable in some areas from the start. Changing the settings didn't help much and made it worse at one point. So if you are reading this for opinions on tech specs, note that game is pretty resource intensive (pun not intended) so you might want to check your system requirements are closer to the recommended than the minimum.\n\nThat said, I still recommend the game!

So heres the crazy thing: Its shockingly complex\n\nFirst; the AI.\nthe AI knows what its doing but it doesn't seem to want to over-saturate the economy as I'm so keen on doing.\nDunno if that was intentional but if you can make a product not at all worth the actual product; it makes it harder for them to earn the money needed to buy your stocks.\n\nSecond; the black market\nIt would be hilarious to blow up someone's mine on a skype call; but otherwise you can basically shake it off. They never really get you to a choking point. Pirates kept stealing really pathetic amounts of water from me, for example (about 30-50 water a minute or so) and it didn't even matter because my production supported beyond that. The worst ones are the magnet storm and emp. The rest (save for nukes which I always buy just to get it out of the game if its being auctioned) doesn't even matter. If you are producing and you're staying afloat; go ahead and laugh. Otherwise its a minor inconvenince.\n\nThird; the economy itself\nIt's a simple Supply/Demand type thing and is constantly checking itself and I love that. Things feel as if they have value despite being totally meaningless just like in real life.\n\nForth; gameplay\nThe game is smoothish on my laptop and is graphically pleasing. Its in early access but that's not going to excuse anything. A mine looks a mine and a transport looks like a transport. Each faction looks very different from each other.\n\nFifth; the 'realisim'\nEach faction has its own voice; but is as well quite robotic. Think Hal 9000 but just slightly less human sounding. Its a bit hard to put into words. the Robotic faction sounds like a male GPS voice, the scavenger faction sounds like a british robot, expansive sounds like a female GPS voice, and so on. Each mine reproduces whatever item its tile says and each tiles material stacks (0-3 but 0 is just a blank tile) and the amount of stuff that exists keeps it interesting\n\nMy biggest issue is the games one limiting factor; claim titles. all tiles on the game are fair game but you can only grab x amount of until you level up your hq (up to level 5 and that comes quickly; trust me) And, if you place something down by mistkae; and so you go to destroy whatever you placed on it; well you just wasted material. That tile is yours son. Congrats. Didn't need that carbon? Too bad.  The only way to get rid of a tile is to auction it and the game never actually tells you how to auction things. It just introduces it maybe 10 mins into one of the tutorial missions. Never tells you how; just lets you particpate.\n\nMy other issue is how the game handles debt. You got two big numbers; the current money you have, and a possible accurued debt. The idea, of course, is to not need to buy things, and if you need to, rather than subtracting it from your current cash; it just created debt that you can pay off whenever you feel like. While that's nice it doesn't feel like a negative. Its not pressing.\n\nThe game doesn't remind you of the hole you're digging for yourself; it just points it out with a red number and that's it. Each new day it'll go up by x percentage but what does it matter? The only real negative is you don't make any profits (all profits made through like, selling power is funneled to your debt rather than your cash pool) but you can still make money by selling materials; and you can then pay the debt back 1k per click.\n\nBut why when I don't feel the need to because nothing bad happens.\n\nI don't feel punished by the growing red number and I feel that might be an issue.\n\n7/10","January 10","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

The UI was a little puzzling at first, but eventually with the help of the tutorials I figured it out and went on to play campaign games. The game sessions themselves last 20-25 minutes, and 8 of them strung together make a campaign, so you can finish a campaign in a couple of hours.\n\nIf there's a downside to the game, it's that once you're done with Mars, you're done. The game model cries out for an asteroid campaign, a europa campaign, and so on. I also think a longer campaign model with more objectives would make good use of the persistant personnel you can buy in campaign mode and help you make a more custom faction.\n\nI'd say this game is worth $10-15 US dollars.\n","January 2","true","28.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Against the AI you don't have to deal with many hiccups, but unlike what the negative reviews have said about 0 depth, when you get in to multiplayer skirmishes you've now got to build efficiently, and take in to account what they might do to you.\n\nFor instance, there are 4 factions, each different than the other, if you can keep in mind the resources that each needs, you can punish your opponents my stealing them, or stealing their building, but this may leave you open to similar attacks. Then further from that you have to manage your debt, you might have a short term victory, but if they cripple you at the right time, they can send you spiraling in to debt which will stop you from further attacks or defense tactics.\n\nSo, to those who wrote "0 depth", try winning some multiplayer matches.\n\nThe pros:\n- One of the most intelligent queueing systems I've seen, you can practice against the AI while waiting for a 1v1 skirmish, and it saves your game, so next time you're in queue, you can pick up against the AI where you left off.!!\n- Varied gameplay because resources change and other players playstyles and decisions change per match.\n- A unique (afaik) game style that focuses more on the resource management side of RTS rather than militaristic side.\n\nThe cons:\n- Fewer than I'd like number of players online at any given time, this can make finding matches a headache, and yes playing against the AI becomes less and less satisfying.\n- If you want to play a match unveiled like a normal multiplayer 1v1 against the AI, you have to start it outside the queueing system, but  from the tooltip it looks like this will change, so it could be an Early Access temporary con.\n- No queues other than 1v1, (Missing 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or FFA queues)\n\nCompared to many early access games this game is quite polished, I feel like this is how early access SHOULD work, you've got the solid core game, but the blemishes are showing.\n\nNeutral things I attribute to early access:-\n- Lack of player base (Steam Early Access has burned a lot of people)\n- Voices are mostly Google reader sounding things, except the director who says "Uhhh, your stock is being sold" :)\n- Other maps\n\nTL:DR\nIt's a solid game, great gameplay, replayability if you're in to multiplayer. It's early access, and behaves like one. Implemented the gameplay first, now it puts on the polish.","January 4","true","34.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

How polished the game is in beta has more to do with the company you're dealing with rather than a universally-accepted standard of development.  For example, Blizzard games in beta are already polished to the level of release.  EA, on the other hand, had no problem with Battlefield 4 being unplayable for several months after release; BF4 would crash constantly on both new and old computers alike.\n\nOffworld Trading Company has all the graphics and core gameplay complete.  At the moment, the developers are finalizing the balance among the types of companies and completing alternative modes/winning conditions.  The only main feature that is missing is central hosting by dedicated servers, which is scheduled to be completed by release.","April 13, 2015","true","117.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, I think allowing the player to set a starting price for their own sale of goods might lead to a more competitive edge in terms of pricing, because the value of goods are not worth exactly what the seller says they are, its up to the buyer. So in a way the market in the game is not a truly free market where the price mechanism reflects the condition of the market because often times you are encouraged to instead sell things that might lend a good profit instead of selling things that ARE returning a good profit. The price of a good refects the entirey of its condition meaning the availability of the materials and the ease of production, and of course, its demand.\n\nOther than that minor thing I think the game is solid, however I dont think its worth $35.99. Maybe $29.99.","February 16, 2015","true","26.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is interesting how it deals with financial takeover of your opponents (through buying out their stock) as the win condition. I'm not sure I've played another game that used a mechanic quite like that. As I've learned how to play, I've slowly been increasing the AI difficulty and the game has remained fun and addicting. I haven't tried online multiplayer yet, but will probably play against some friends once I've got the strategies down a little better.\n\nAt the time of my review, the game was early access, and it feels like a finished experience. I'd say the most work could still be needed in the tutorials as they were not the most friendly to learn what to do. I had to checkout some developer video tutorials online to really get the hang of the later (and harder) tutorial levels.\n\nI definitely recommend this game though if you are looking for an interesting twist on the old real time strategy / resource management game type. They are doing a lot of cool things with this!","September 12, 2015","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So heres the crazy thing: Its shockingly complex\n\nFirst; the AI.\nthe AI knows what its doing but it doesn't seem to want to over-saturate the economy as I'm so keen on doing.\nDunno if that was intentional but if you can make a product not at all worth the actual product; it makes it harder for them to earn the money needed to buy your stocks.\n\nSecond; the black market\nIt would be hilarious to blow up someone's mine on a skype call; but otherwise you can basically shake it off. They never really get you to a choking point. Pirates kept stealing really pathetic amounts of water from me, for example (about 30-50 water a minute or so) and it didn't even matter because my production supported beyond that. The worst ones are the magnet storm and emp. The rest (save for nukes which I always buy just to get it out of the game if its being auctioned) doesn't even matter. If you are producing and you're staying afloat; go ahead and laugh. Otherwise its a minor inconvenince.\n\nThird; the economy itself\nIt's a simple Supply/Demand type thing and is constantly checking itself and I love that. Things feel as if they have value despite being totally meaningless just like in real life.\n\nForth; gameplay\nThe game is smoothish on my laptop and is graphically pleasing. Its in early access but that's not going to excuse anything. A mine looks a mine and a transport looks like a transport. Each faction looks very different from each other.\n\nFifth; the 'realisim'\nEach faction has its own voice; but is as well quite robotic. Think Hal 9000 but just slightly less human sounding. Its a bit hard to put into words. the Robotic faction sounds like a male GPS voice, the scavenger faction sounds like a british robot, expansive sounds like a female GPS voice, and so on. Each mine reproduces whatever item its tile says and each tiles material stacks (0-3 but 0 is just a blank tile) and the amount of stuff that exists keeps it interesting\n\nMy biggest issue is the games one limiting factor; claim titles. all tiles on the game are fair game but you can only grab x amount of until you level up your hq (up to level 5 and that comes quickly; trust me) And, if you place something down by mistkae; and so you go to destroy whatever you placed on it; well you just wasted material. That tile is yours son. Congrats. Didn't need that carbon? Too bad.  The only way to get rid of a tile is to auction it and the game never actually tells you how to auction things. It just introduces it maybe 10 mins into one of the tutorial missions. Never tells you how; just lets you particpate.\n\nMy other issue is how the game handles debt. You got two big numbers; the current money you have, and a possible accurued debt. The idea, of course, is to not need to buy things, and if you need to, rather than subtracting it from your current cash; it just created debt that you can pay off whenever you feel like. While that's nice it doesn't feel like a negative. Its not pressing.\n\nThe game doesn't remind you of the hole you're digging for yourself; it just points it out with a red number and that's it. Each new day it'll go up by x percentage but what does it matter? The only real negative is you don't make any profits (all profits made through like, selling power is funneled to your debt rather than your cash pool) but you can still make money by selling materials; and you can then pay the debt back 1k per click.\n\nBut why when I don't feel the need to because nothing bad happens.\n\nI don't feel punished by the growing red number and I feel that might be an issue.\n\n7/10","January 10","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

The UI was a little puzzling at first, but eventually with the help of the tutorials I figured it out and went on to play campaign games. The game sessions themselves last 20-25 minutes, and 8 of them strung together make a campaign, so you can finish a campaign in a couple of hours.\n\nIf there's a downside to the game, it's that once you're done with Mars, you're done. The game model cries out for an asteroid campaign, a europa campaign, and so on. I also think a longer campaign model with more objectives would make good use of the persistant personnel you can buy in campaign mode and help you make a more custom faction.\n\nI'd say this game is worth $10-15 US dollars.\n","January 2","true","28.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Against the AI you don't have to deal with many hiccups, but unlike what the negative reviews have said about 0 depth, when you get in to multiplayer skirmishes you've now got to build efficiently, and take in to account what they might do to you.\n\nFor instance, there are 4 factions, each different than the other, if you can keep in mind the resources that each needs, you can punish your opponents my stealing them, or stealing their building, but this may leave you open to similar attacks. Then further from that you have to manage your debt, you might have a short term victory, but if they cripple you at the right time, they can send you spiraling in to debt which will stop you from further attacks or defense tactics.\n\nSo, to those who wrote "0 depth", try winning some multiplayer matches.\n\nThe pros:\n- One of the most intelligent queueing systems I've seen, you can practice against the AI while waiting for a 1v1 skirmish, and it saves your game, so next time you're in queue, you can pick up against the AI where you left off.!!\n- Varied gameplay because resources change and other players playstyles and decisions change per match.\n- A unique (afaik) game style that focuses more on the resource management side of RTS rather than militaristic side.\n\nThe cons:\n- Fewer than I'd like number of players online at any given time, this can make finding matches a headache, and yes playing against the AI becomes less and less satisfying.\n- If you want to play a match unveiled like a normal multiplayer 1v1 against the AI, you have to start it outside the queueing system, but  from the tooltip it looks like this will change, so it could be an Early Access temporary con.\n- No queues other than 1v1, (Missing 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or FFA queues)\n\nCompared to many early access games this game is quite polished, I feel like this is how early access SHOULD work, you've got the solid core game, but the blemishes are showing.\n\nNeutral things I attribute to early access:-\n- Lack of player base (Steam Early Access has burned a lot of people)\n- Voices are mostly Google reader sounding things, except the director who says "Uhhh, your stock is being sold" :)\n- Other maps\n\nTL:DR\nIt's a solid game, great gameplay, replayability if you're in to multiplayer. It's early access, and behaves like one. Implemented the gameplay first, now it puts on the polish.","January 4","true","34.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong it has a unique game style, and it is pretty fun for a few to a couple of hours, but not more than that.\n\nGAME INFO-\nUnlike other RTS games, where the player builds and gather resources to buy armies. Offworld Trading Company is mostly about economic RTS. The player has to claim certain lands, which consist of natural resources, and manage those resources by buying and selling on the market. Each player has a share in the stock market and the prices for the stocks will range on how well the players are doing (The better income the higher the stock price will be). There are special abilities that the players can buy from the Black Market and interfere the progress of other players (I will not give the details but players need to buy this abilities to help win the game). Whoever buys all the stocks wins the game.. and that's, that is how to win the game.\n\nIt Sounds complicated but it is not. You get the hang of it when playing the game for a couple of hour, but that's the problem. When you start to understand the mechanics of the game it gets boring because the game itself feels very... linear unlike other RTS games. Most RTS you have to strategize your moves and attacks to win the game, and there are so many ways and routes to plan and play which makes you hooked to it for days, months, even years. However, Offworld trading company has limited strategic gameplay... you just manage your resources in the best way to make you profit.\n\nMY OPINION-\n+Fun game :D for couple of hours.\n-After that not fun :(\n+If you are into this type of game go for it.\n-If you are not into this game don't buy it because you will regret it when the game is sitting in your library for years and realize that you had only 20 hrs+ or less of in-game.\n+Why did I buy the game? Because of Quill18.\n+Why did I thumbs up? I had fun even though it was for a couple of hours, and I recommend this game for those who are into Economic RTS.\n-But it is too expensive...

But in some ways it is too well balanced in that while there are 4 different styles of play based on the base you choose, those 4 different styles of play have very little opportunity for variation within themselves.\n\nEven on the mid-range difficulty levels I found that you had to play a particular way determined by your base type and too much variation was usually a quick way to lose.\n\nOn the upper difficulty levels forget about trying something new, either you play a flawless game with a very specific and particular build order (and hope you don't get disproportionally screwed over by the black market) or you might as well not have bothered starting the level.\n\nNow none of the above makes it a bad game, but unless you are the sort who has a hard-on for the multiplayer experience or grinding out every "Do X 100 times" achievements OTC has limited replayability.

The Economic RTS is really a big change as ♥♥♥♥ moves and market forces can really change a game around.   I really like how maps start unexplored and it is slowly releaved.  You can choose and deploy your colony at any time but waiting till later also has its advantages, if you deploy too early and spend a lot of resources trying to corner the aluminum market you might miss the massive deposit on the edge of the map.\n\nOTC is really about picking the best tradeoffs to get you where you want to go, which is fitting as it's an economic game.   Each colony type has different advantages and needs. expansionists are good at the early game land grab, Scavengers don't need steel and get early warning for random events.  Robots don't need food, but take power instead; and scientists can skip some of the early steps of the production chain by putting factories right over resources.\n\nThe early access parts show in that some units don't have detailed textures yet, and they use text to speech instead of voice acting.  There were also a few minor issues I had like not getting an opponents patents after buying out his company.  Overall the game is stable and looks better than most early acess games on steam.","February 20, 2015","true","35.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I love the idea of running a business, but it isn't worth $40. The gameplay is rather boring and hard, but not hard in a good way.

It is a reasonably good game, and definately has potential, but it isn't worth $40 to play what is basically the same gamemode over and over again, with a really confusing campaign mode.

Its tutorial is...not the best. Very very simplified, and doesn't even explain the mechanics. You buy the game, and it throws it at you and says "here, understand it. Now play." The economy market is one of the only good things in this game. It's not resource management. It's not even management. It's just dumb luck. No skill is involved. Not much variety is shown between rounds. This thing happens. Next round, this thing happens. The AI is not hard to beat, on any type of difficulty. As I've said, this game is just full of dumb luck. You can find a good spot to start, or someone else can find a good spot and you will be left with nothing. You don't know where everything is. The game just starts off, putting you in a place where you know nothing. The actual gameplay is also a bit quirky. I find it that half the time I'm just waiting for the prices to change. Now, I'm not the best of gamers, so don't take my opinion as too serious. I just find that this game is not exactly worth $40. Maybe it's worth $15, or even $20, but not $40. So, that's my opinion.\n\nOverall ratings:\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nNo Lag: 10/10\n\nThe game runs very well even for a well designed game like this.

I have played one game so far, and decided to refund it. To be honest, this game has some very good ideas and also it's very nice to see something not combat related in the market. But during the gameplay, I cant shake the feeling that this is more like a visual representation of a spread sheet mechanic. At this stage, it needs to get a longer gameplay (too short at the moment) to be fun and a less simplistic approach (main stream will never play these type of games, you do not need to dumb down your ideas or the mechanics.). Also the end game is mostly decided by what you do at the very early, almost impossible to overcome the mistakes done at the beginning. Regarding depth, the game needs more strategic elements, less mobile-game like mechanics, more things to manage in both macro and micro, and the espionage/sobatage needs to have better visual representations, including some strategic ways to counter.  Environment being mars or somewhere else would have no effect in this game at all.  At this stage, this game is just like an iOS/Android game to have some quick fun but nothing more. It has a lot of potential, but seeing that it has been released on February and mechanics not chaning so far, I am not much optimistic about its future. More or less, in the core, this looks like what you will be getting when the early access ends.","September 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I mean, you basically rush to buy each other out each game. There's almost no point. You get all the way to the end, finally pay off your debt, and finally start making profit, and then the AI buys you out - even though you own majority share of the company. Because the game is fairly retawddeed. I mean, you can't just outright buy a company if you don't own enough shares. So why does that happen man? Frustrating? You're damn right it is. It's not even fair warned, it's just out of nowhere a popup window that says you we're bought, and gained 3 trillion dollars that you'll never spend because the game is over, the end, period.\n\nAnd on that note, why is it that we have to buy shares of our own company. I own it right? Or am I just leasing the property... Thought I was the CEO.\n\nI like the fun of it, it has potential, it really does. But right now I can barely sit and play more than 2 matches. The buy out feature really kills it.\nAnd it needs combat, direly. Lawsuits and disgrunteled employees with guns, at the least.\nBecause by the end of the match you wish you could just run through their company office with a tank and smoke a cigarette afterwards. Virtually, and literally.\nThe "underground nukes" are only as rewarding as the sound effect, and that fades, quickly.\n\nI'm only upvoting/recommending the game, because I think one day it will be better.\nAnd the first 10 matches are really invigorating, until you realize the above mentioned things.\n\nAlso, be aware that the UI lags. I have a core i7 3930k and a gtx 670, all overclocked, running on an SSD, and it still lags pretty hard - still in beta, to be expected. Just an fyi.\nIt's a bit funny, as a programmer, because they just need to run the UI in a separate thread. It's a simple fix, they just haven't figured out how do it right yet. I personally would never, ever, put UI loops in the frame or frame buffer loop, it's just bad design. If one lags, both lag.\nMan I wish I had my degree already, so I could get hired by companies like this to fix their games for them. I'm not arrogant, but damn like how hard is it to make a game like this correctly. It's barely 3d, no combat, just numbers and sprites.\nThe AI is probably one massive set of If..Else statements, IN A LOOP. gawd.\nGreat concept, terrible deployment. So far.

Yes, I know it's just early access, but the problems with it are already starting to show off and they aren't just bugs & like but rather core things.\n\nThe game feels extremely shallow - frustratingly fast paced matches, total lack of content: the amount of resources and production chains is 3 times smaller than in Anno 2070 and you have several factions that are almost completely the same save for some little differences in resource needs and HQ model. Graphics is almost non-existent, but so is sound acting which is far worse in my opinion. I don't care much about gphx but replacing sound acting with synthetic voice generation is not just goofy, it's outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nPlay a couple of matches - and you've seen it all! But wait, there's also a 'campaign mode' with multiple rounds for same companies. None of your technologies or patents researched during a campaign round will matter because in every new round you will have to start over. Instead between rounds you hire specific engineers to increase corresponding building efficiency and get a bonus perk if you won in the round - this is the only thing persistent through rounds, as well as your stock value. I'm totally unimpressed by this 'campaign', it just doesn't feel even a little bit like managing a company but rather feels like being tortured by bad and exhausted game design. Generally the idea behind this game has good potential, but the way it's done here - just meh.\n\nSo far I don't recommend spending money on this game. You can always download it from torrents or wait for steam free play weekend and try it before buying to see that I'm probably right about it. If you want some good economic play - better go for Anno 2070 (but don't BUY Anno 2070 if you know what I mean, haha) or upcoming Anno 2205 (if it will be OK).","October 29, 2015","false","22.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I played through the training missions which had their own learning curve and difficulty and was beaten several times but its all part of the learning to play this game.  However after i finished the training and went into the campaign the problems started.\n\nFirstly you choose your team and any purchases you would like to make before the mission begins, things like extra engineers and stuff and then its all go you and up to 3 NPC players battle it out.  You can imagine my complete surprise and shock when i was 10 seconds into the first mission and i get a heads up telling me that the enemy HQ has been upgraded to stage 2 already, ALREADY, they have the exact same buildings i have built so far yet they have aqquired the neccesary 80 aliminium, 80 steel and 40 glass in a matter of seconds, but it does not stop there.\n\nThe NPC has an unlimited supply of money on hand always buying up stuff from the black market that costs thousands of credits and giving the starting conditions they could never amass in such a short time, as i am writing this the game is minimised in the background still going and all i can hear is scientific colony expanded, and all this banging and crashing as their launching emp after emp after dynamite attack after pirate attack on me again and again and these are again thosands of credits and the cost goes up with each use.\n\nEverything you build puts you in debt you buld one thing to cover one debt and another starts draining your resources so you build to cover that and another will start so you build to cover that and the first ♥♥♥♥ing thing you were trying to control is drainging you again, its just a viscious circle of shear repition and failings but your opponents are buying this and that and upgrading at a blinding rate and then like i mentioned earlier attack after attack after attack, your left with not much enjoyment at all.\n\nThen theres the heads up you have lost this amount of whatever to piracy.... piracy? when in the hell did the game mention piracy? Oh thats right it didnt, you sit there and watch these messages appear every second one after the other in the HUD you have lost this to piracy, you have lost that to piracy again and again and all your resource rates are firmly in the negative forcing you into this bottleneck of no recovery.  This game could be fun but when your being steam rolled every match due to an overwhelming NPC and its never ending trust fund, fun is then a very hard thing to find and the game becomes stressful and a complete horror to play.\n\nI want to like this game i really do but its broken, very badly broken and unoptomised i feel as if im just hosting an arena everytime i play so that a group of NPC's can battle it out and im just observing, hopefully future patching will sort things out but thats the problem with early access games you end up getting such a bad taste in your mouth from the game in question and alot of the time like myself, you never play it again.","June 19, 2015","false","6.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

In Offworld trading company your objective is to buy out all of your opponents. There can be only one man left standing. You start and scan a planet for resources, and then select one of 4 factions: Expansive, Robotic, Scavanger, or Scientific. Each of these factions has several unique traits. Expansive has extra claims so they can build more, Robotic only needs power and electonics, scavanger gets early access to black market items and uses carbon instead of steel, and Scientific can put buildings that need resources on hexes that have that resource thus reducing the amount of claims they need to use: EX you can put a steel mill on iron without any iron mines and produce steel. My oppinions of the 4 factions are below. The game also has a black market where you can buy things to better your faction like extra claims/protection from enemies or undermine other factions with things like underground nukes. It also adds random auctions that go to your debt, which can really help if you need to save a geothermal vent for later in the game or are in desperate need of another claim.\n\n-Expansive: (Best)(1) This is in my oppinion the best faction. The extra claims they recieve make it much easier to be the first to get a HQ lv5. This faction will generally be the easiest to get the offworld trading export rocket, which is almost always a sure win.\n-Robotic: (Good)(2 Tie) No need for water, fuel, food or oxygen. Rush for electronics early and have some power and your society will almost never be in debt.\n-Scavanger: (Worst)(4) Inless the map has high carbon contents and low iron, this faction is a no-go. See what I said in cons about the black market issues.\n-Scientific: (Good)(2 Tie) Great faction for maps with a large amount of water or low iron. You can keep costs way down if you build your food supply and fuel/oxygen supply on this water. A great strategy is to build two steel mills at the beginning of the game on iron since you dont need an iron mine.\n\nPROS:\n\n-This is the most original game I have early access played since Minecraft. I think it has a ton of potential.\n-The game is pretty fun, and I think it will be much more fun when multiplayer isn't just player hosted.\n-To play a round takes generally around 30-40 minutes, meaning it won't take all day.\n\nCONS:\n\n-$35-$40 is just flat out too expensive for an early access game like this. This game should be in the $20 dollar range. I mean you could buy Skyrim for $40!\n-Big issues with the black market: No matter what faction you choose or how early you settle, the AI will always get the first action in the black market, meaning that by the time you get to it, additional land claims will be more expensive. This in my oppinion, defeats the point of going with the scavanger faction.\n-Random events are too extreme. In the real world an oversupply of a resource will not have it go from $100 to $1. I would like to see these events toned down. Perhaps a oversupply would lead a $100 dollar resource to become $40.\n-Offworld Export Rockets are ABSURDLY overpowered. The first person to build one will generally win the game. Generally this will be the expansive faction.\n-The game ends too suddenly. All of a sudden someone will get rich from the offworld exports and in litterally 2 minutes after this is built the game is over.\n","February 19, 2015","true","40.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However, I took a chance with this game as it is the first early access game that I have ever purchased.  I am shocked at the stability of the game and how much fun this game is given the fact that it is early access and within two days of release.  This game is worth the cash, especially with more on the way in regards to content.  I have only crashed once in my 14+ hours of gameplay.  Yes, there are things that could be balanced or added to increase the length of each map.  Also, I believe that the maps could be bigger, but they are nearly the perfect size for the current content.  The tutorials could use some work with directing you, but I learned quickly outside of the tutorials in the actual single-player after the AI beat me a couple of times.  Regardless, this game is extremely enjoyable, especially the single-player campaign.\n\nThe single-player campaign adds a new dynamic that I find intriguing.  You are against a number of AI opponents going for different locations on a planet.  You do not face the same combination of AI opponents, usually, on the different locations.  If you win the map, then you (or the winning AI) own the map and the perks/income associated with the map are the winners to use for the next location.  Also, the remaining AI battle for some of the other locations while you are playing your map, but never more than the remaining opponents can fill up.  For instance, if there are 8 players including you, then you choose the location that you want to play.  The location can have one-three AI players (2-4, including you, of the 8 total).  This leaves 4-6 AI to battle for 2-3 of the other locations.  After every match, new locations open up.  Depending on the victory conditions (how well you win), you increase in the leaderboard of that campaign.  As you move through the campaign, you use your income to buy new engineers to enhance or unlock buildings, same for the AI winners of other maps.  Each map is different in size, terrain, rules, and some have events such as “dust storm,” which lowers the efficiency of any solar plants built on the map.\n\nThis game is definitely worth buying as is and even more so knowing that the game will have more content added due to how early in the "early access" we are.  I highly recommend this.\n\nFor those interested, I am running on:\n\ni7-4790k\nGTX 780 Ti\n16 Gigs Ram\nWindows 8.1 Pro","February 15, 2015","true","36.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But the simulation, particularly (for myself) with having to balance getting the resources you need to keep yourself afloat opposed to selling off resources to crush your opponents... most exhilarating mental exercise I've had in some time.

The enjoyment of this game comes from using your awareness of the overall availability of resources on the map to predict which will become more valuable as the game progresses.

I played through the training missions which had their own learning curve and difficulty and was beaten several times but its all part of the learning to play this game.  However after i finished the training and went into the campaign the problems started.\n\nFirstly you choose your team and any purchases you would like to make before the mission begins, things like extra engineers and stuff and then its all go you and up to 3 NPC players battle it out.  You can imagine my complete surprise and shock when i was 10 seconds into the first mission and i get a heads up telling me that the enemy HQ has been upgraded to stage 2 already, ALREADY, they have the exact same buildings i have built so far yet they have aqquired the neccesary 80 aliminium, 80 steel and 40 glass in a matter of seconds, but it does not stop there.\n\nThe NPC has an unlimited supply of money on hand always buying up stuff from the black market that costs thousands of credits and giving the starting conditions they could never amass in such a short time, as i am writing this the game is minimised in the background still going and all i can hear is scientific colony expanded, and all this banging and crashing as their launching emp after emp after dynamite attack after pirate attack on me again and again and these are again thosands of credits and the cost goes up with each use.\n\nEverything you build puts you in debt you buld one thing to cover one debt and another starts draining your resources so you build to cover that and another will start so you build to cover that and the first ♥♥♥♥ing thing you were trying to control is drainging you again, its just a viscious circle of shear repition and failings but your opponents are buying this and that and upgrading at a blinding rate and then like i mentioned earlier attack after attack after attack, your left with not much enjoyment at all.\n\nThen theres the heads up you have lost this amount of whatever to piracy.... piracy? when in the hell did the game mention piracy? Oh thats right it didnt, you sit there and watch these messages appear every second one after the other in the HUD you have lost this to piracy, you have lost that to piracy again and again and all your resource rates are firmly in the negative forcing you into this bottleneck of no recovery.  This game could be fun but when your being steam rolled every match due to an overwhelming NPC and its never ending trust fund, fun is then a very hard thing to find and the game becomes stressful and a complete horror to play.\n\nI want to like this game i really do but its broken, very badly broken and unoptomised i feel as if im just hosting an arena everytime i play so that a group of NPC's can battle it out and im just observing, hopefully future patching will sort things out but thats the problem with early access games you end up getting such a bad taste in your mouth from the game in question and alot of the time like myself, you never play it again.","June 19, 2015","false","6.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That sounded like a good sales pitch to me- I've played a bunch of Starcraft and Starcraft 2 and enjoyed them thoroughly.\n\nThe problem with this is that if you analyze a Starcraft game, the first few minutes are always the most boring ones- you (usually) just execute some well-rehearsed build order before you get to the more interesting and exciting parts where your units interact with your opponents'- and Offworld Trading Company never gets to that part, by design. There are no units, no army compositions, no micro-management. The entire game is like those boring first few minutes of every Starcraft match, but there's no payoff afterwards.\n\nThe Free-for-All nature of the game's standard game mode is problematic. The optimal move is to invest in raising your income and buying as much stock for your own company as possible and not waste any money buying your opponents' stock until endgame where the Offworld Market gives you (or your opponents) enough money to win the game. The extremely passive gameplay that the game rewards makes getting to the lategame feel like a chore, and victory does not feel very exciting. You can mess with your foes via industrial sabotage, but it doesn't feel very satisfying when you use it (whereas it does feel annoying when it gets used against you).\n\nThere is a frustrating lack of clarity as to the game's systems. Last game I played, I had bought out 2 of my 3 opponents, had the most improvements to my production buildings and the most patents, plus the most total land claims... and yet my remaining opponent's stock value was somehow 50% higher than mine. Why was it higher? I have no idea. But his higher stock value meant that he managed to buy me out first, so I lost- and I have no idea what it was that I did wrong, or how to do better next game.\n\nI'll end my review by saying that Offworld Trading Company is a very innovative game. I haven't seen another game quite like it and I'm glad to see new concepts like this one take form. That said, for all its innovation, Offworld Trading Company is not a good game.

(this all mostly about MP, it fairs slightly better in SP)\n\n1) there is NO need for this to be RTS... in any way, shape or form.  it has ALL the problems every other RTS game has... as far as MP is concerned, it just comes down to who clicks a little faster...\n\n2) repetitive - you can not enjoy the mechanics of the game or take them in, AGAIN, because it is an RTS.  You spend the entire game furiously putting down buildings withut being able to take a step back and make strategic decisions or view your opponents moves... this is ALL you do...\n\n3) a horrific tutorial that tells you all of nothing...\n\n4) MP games last like 30 minutes... dont know ONE gamer who wants their strategy game, whether it be RTS or TB, to be that short.... not one.\n\n5) Feature-wise, it is a $14.99 - $19.99 games, tops.\n\nFor me, a massive let down.  What bothers me the most, is that all of this could have been avoided with intelligent design decisions.  It is a GREAT premise and eventually someone else will clone this game and do it right... and it will be a massive success.  I suggest waiting for that to happen.

On the positive side, that makes matches not as long drawn out and the mechanics easy to learn. The campaign is more a set of challenges the game generates, e.g. you can't build this building or that particular resource is very expensive.\n\nFair enough. Brownie points for originality.\n\nBut what really turns me off this game is the lack of traceability of why you lose a match.. Suddenly the AI just buys you out and that's it for you, while you stare at your ever growing debt, and wonder how the hell the AI keeps spamming out buildings and upgrades so fast even at the medium difficulty levels. It's very hard to recover from a bad start, no real gradient of improvement because once you optimised your base, the match is already over\n\nIt really feels like "Super Meat Boy" became a tycoon game.

Perhaps some other colony types along with a wider array of black market trickery and an expanded array of structure types?\n\nOverall, I like the concept and would definitely like to see more updates for the idea. Unfortunately, at the present I can't recommend purchasing the game for $40 until it leaves early access.

It takes the consept of 4X gameplay and strip it to the absolute bare bones of the consept. You search for resourses, you claim the land, wait, repeat. The honestly is not a great deal more than that. Yes there are "upgrade" options and "special ability" options but the actions feel quite hollow. What also makes for a very big drawback for the game is that its tempo is very high and rounds could easily go by very quickly. I really do not see much hope for players in a multiplay enviroment who fall behind early (this part I did not experience, this is merely my impression). Essentially, from my perspective in any case, a player who falls behind by a step or two, they will be on a perminant treadmill until their demise with little hope of recovery unless the opponent makes a mistake or a ♥♥♥♥-break.\n\nAgain to book-end a previous comment I made, this game is very hollow and a waste of money.","March 9","false","1.0"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","5"

You can bomb your competitors' train stations, railroads and related structures;\n\n2. You can hire bandits to rob the opponents' train cargoes;\n\n3. You can use EMP to shut down the competitors' train systems; and\n\n4, You can sabotage the power supply of your opponents.\n\nI'm a fan of business / economic simulators and I don't think the above military / criminal / terrorist means of competing should be the gaming mechanics in a business sim. When I play a business sim, I want to use business / economic strategies to outsmart my competitors. I have no interest at all in using any military or criminal ways to win. Honestly, no matter how much AMD dislikes Intel and Nvidia, AMD wouldn't hire criminals to bomb or sabotage the opponents' fabrication plants, right?\n\nWhen I played Railroad Tycoon, I had the feeling of being the CEO of a growing railroad company. However, when I played Offworld Trading Company, I just felt like being the boss of a mafia business using criminal and military means to hurt my competitors. I don't like this feeling at all.\n\nThe game description says there's "no military" in OTC but I think this's completely wrong and misleading. The in-game black market offers all the "dirty tricks" mentioned above to sabotage your competitors' businesses. I'm not sure whether this black market will change later, but, for now, I don't recommend this game to fans of business / economic sims.","February 17, 2015","false","5.1"," 18 of 44 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","18","44","2","0"

But, it does add 30+ maps which can only be used during skirmish and MP. So the campaign wont be given a boost anytime soon(if ever).\n\nThere really isnt much of a story unless you make one up in your own head pretty much I.E: "I just got promoted to CEO and the Investors want to see positive returns on their investments". or some nonesence. All you do is start small become big buy out everyone during rounds of mashed up skirmishes against the AI.\n\nA.I... well that is a joke actually the A.I. would rather fight itself till theres only 2 left plus your company dring each of the "campaign" missions then tries to buy you out but, cant because since you were left alone you accumalated the funds to buy out the other CPU's and bought stock in your own as a defensive measure.\n\n\nSo, if you were looking for a Tactical rts or an RTT with combat and what not, well you wont get it here Off World Trade Co. takes the RTS genre and flips it over to peaceful times. Where you must expand your company on different parts of mars and take over your competitors one at a time till you own their claims on the map.\n\nThere isnt a big difference between how the game is played from skirmish or MP or campaign (with campaign being a tiny bit different with upgrades you can buy before each round in the campaign) then end goal is still the same make money buy people out. Think of it as a futuristic version of the Family Board Game Monopoly on Mars. With the added benefit of a Black Market. This is where you can very very loosely say is the combat mechanic (if you want to call it that, i don't) you can buy extra claims to blowing up a mine of an enemy or just cause a riot and gain all the materials for yourself for a period of time. There are others, like pirates, and so forth but there really isnt anything there to keep you wanting to come back and play more. I got severely bored with OWTC around 5 hours thats me playing campaign skirm and MP.\n\nIt feels as if they gave you an appetizer, burnt the dinner portion and was out of desert, which makes you unsure if you should even keep it installed onto your computer. As for myself i will because i got during EA. Also, if you dont care about the free key for a friend Don't buy the deluxe just buy standard and dlc and save yourself 5 bucks.\n\nAs for a recommend or not i don't the game shows all of its cards too quickly and becomes rather dull after the ooos and ahhs pf shinynes, and there isnt much complexity once you complete the tutorials, you do exactly the same as tuts, just a little bit faster and you win everytime. MP just feels like a sped up version of tutorials make as much as you can, black market people, buy them out without being bought out yourself and boom thats it.\n","April 28","false","5.6"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

This is one of them. RTS fans will love this game. Strategy and long term planning is a must. There are no tanks, no soldiers and no real weapons in this game. Everyone plays right on top of eachother in a mad battle for resources and stock. The objective is to Buy Out the other companies stocks. You will first chose a class, there aare 4. Each one is unique in what resources they require the most. You will build buildings and mine resources and sell them and balance your money. You will set yourself up to buy out all of the other players stock. While this may not sound like much fun, the game is extremely fun in my opinion. It is a different type of RTS that you will come to love. The first day I got it I played for 6 hours straight. Addictive personality aside, it is that much fun. Please buy this game and support the growing community as well as the dev's. They have released a bug free polished game which is a huge task for any dev. The game is easy at its core to learn, but deep enough to keep you wondering for a while. There is MP, SP & Skirmish. They have thought of everything. Give it a go and you will not be sorry.

I do so with a bit of reluctance.  I purchased it on sale, and for the price I paid, I think I got a good deal.  I personally believe every game is priced at what people are willing to pay, and those who whine about "not a top tier game" or "the devs should lower the price" are idiots.  Still, I think it is fair to say a game should be recommended if it gives value for the buck, and at the price I paid it did.  At the nominal price, I would be so happy.\n\nPros:\n* It takes a bit to learn, and the tutorials are not that great at teaching.  But I could figure it out at the easiest setting, and then I read a user guide to understand the underlying strategy.  With just 8 hours of play, I can handle a moderate level of difficulty and have a decent challenge while using nearly all the available game strategies.\n* A single round can be played in 20 minutes.\n* The pace is interesting.  It is kinda of slow at fast, and then at some point you'll get the clear upper hand (or not) and the end game comes fast.\n* The pace means you can think about strategy, which is what I wanted from the game, but then you don't need to wait long to learn if you made the right decisions.\n* The graphics are decent.\n* The game has a good amount of complexity.\n\nCons:\n* For such a complex strategy game, the pace is almost too fast.\n* Some aspects seem important, but I have yet to find them critical.  Without providing spoilers, I'll just say the transport of goods, the offworld market, and the patent system don't seem balanced correctly.\n* It is a work in progress, this is both good and bad, but for the price,  think it needs more progress.  I don't think it is as close as the devs suggest, but if they clean up the degenerate strategies, then this will become a pro.\n* The stock concept is a bit too simplified, and other than its role in the endgame, it is rather pointless.  This could be resolved if the parameters for the price were explained thus opening up strategies to manipulate shares.  One guide gives some suggestions of strategies, but if that's all it is, then stock system is a con.\n* What's the point of the town?  Is it only for the pleasure dome?  Because I can make nearly as much money putting the pleasure dome near my own base.  Is the town what is buying the goods?  If so, why only have transports to go to my base?   I have rockets to get goods to market off planet; what gets goods to the city?\n* I guess I'll have to look up how to start an auction.  At first I found them annoying, because they literally pause the game while you play them out.  I would jsut skp them, to get back to game play.  Then I learned some auctions should be won at almost any price.  And then I wanted to know how to make them start.  But this is a con because the few patent options should never be part of the auction.  I think it ruins the patent model, and it doesn't make sense.\n\n\nIf you like strategy business games, then this is enjoyable.  For the price, you'll have more fun with civilization or colonization, but if you already played those and many other similar games; then buy this.  It is definitely different from those games and is fun.\n\nTip:  While I find little value in the sabotage features of the black market, look over at carefully.  Some black market items are not sabotage items, and they provide key advantages in the game.","December 4, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't simply build a load of factories and sit on them, you have to keep an eye on other players and react to what they and the market in general are doing. There's that horrible moment where the buyout percentage starts appearing next to other player's names (showing that they're more than 50% of the way to buying you) and the scramble for as much cash as you can scrape together in a hurry. That being said if you're more of a casual and methodical player you can freely pause games with the AI to analyse your next move, which has helped me out quite a bit!","August 30, 2015","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a game market dominated by games that use violence as the main driver of story real time economic stratagy games are rare gems. Video games are quickly becoming the major story telling device of the 21st centry and I would like to see Offword Trading Company embrace this. Please develope this game to teach economic and market principles like short selling, supply and demand, ect. The setting, Mars, also is a great pick. It ties into our cultural obsession with the red planet and our longing for a new frontier.\n\nThe game diffently needs some more work and polishing however. For starters the rounds are seem very short and the tutorial is not very good.\n\nThe possibilities for expanding the game seem nearly endless. I would like to see some resources and building types added. Some possible resources to add: white metals (gold, silver, platinum), rare earth minerals (lithium and others). Uranium, medicine, and art just to name a few. I would like to see more power options like nuclear reactors added to the building types.\n\nAlso more random events might make things interesting things like dust storms.\n\nUpdate: This game no longer works and has not worked for many weeks. It crashes when you go to start a mission and even after two updates, an upgrade to windows 10 on my machine, and two re-downloads it still crashes. Do not pay for the beta of this game save yourself the money and aggrivation.\n\nUpdate: After months of this game being offline it is finally fixed.","October 29, 2015","true","266.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is ugly, extremely difficult to use, and borderline unplayable now. Game had a lot of potential but now I would strongly suggest avoiding it unless they restore functionality.\n\nVery unique and enjoyable. Even though there are probably only about 25 buttons in the entire game, it's very different every time and doesn't get stale quickly. The multiplayer community is alive even in early access. This is not a click spamming game, you don't need  300 APM to play, but it is still an RTS so there are areas where a bit of speed helps. Personally I think about 40 APM is the limit beyond which there is very little difference. On the surface it looks like a number crunching game but you never really need to do math beyond "which number is bigger." Games take about 20 minutes start to finish. Considering the graphics, it puts a good deal of strain on my PC, putting my GPU at about the same temp it sits it playing a much more graphically intense CryEngine game like Evolve.\n\nThe endgame can be a bit dull, but I think they realize this and will make it more interesting. Currently you just race to buy each other out, sometimes you can be just a few seconds away from winning, and bam suddenly you lose. Larger games are even wonkier as sometimes you buy someone else out and then immediatly someone buys you.\n\nThe AI is very clever but frankly single player is boring. If people frighten you maybe play something else. There is an automated 1v1 matchmaking system in multiplayer and people do play it.","October 3, 2015","false","102.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

After installing I got to the main screen then it would crash back to steam. Ok I thought, its in beta so maybe its something they are working on to fix. I tried a few times over the weeks and still the same issue....that is until their latest update.\n\nI can now play the game <cheers all round>\n\nI play quite a few stratagy type games so jumped straight into a single player game. It did not go well and was bought out by rival corps pretty quickly as my stock price was low and I amounted a large amount of debt! So I hit up the tutorials which cover very basic gameplay and could do with hints on the way to improve stocks prices or reduce debt/cancel out debt all together.\n\nYes there are diferent classes which have there own benifits/restrictions. For instance Expansive (human) require large amounts of food/water followed by power and oxygen. Robotic eats through Silicon and Power whereas Scavenger eats Carbon like theres no tomorrow!\n\nSo what have I learnt in the past 10hrs of play..?!\n\nPing quick at the start so you can find the best resourse spot on the map.\n\nYou can plant your HQ down ontop of a resourse which adds it to your starting inventory but will not regenerate the resourse like it would if you just planted a mine ontop of the resourse.\n\nTry and keep modules attached to the HQ that way your not charged to transport across the map (Power also = fuel)\n\nSolar panels are good but shutdown at night and thats where debt can mount up quick if your transporting alot! Wind turbines work day and night which give a steady trickle of power. Geo thermal plants work best as they operate day and night and dont require transports but are expense!\n\n|\n\nThe game has a steep learning curve currently which is brought about mainly due to the tutorials included with the game. I found out more through looking in the forums and youtube. Doing so I won my first game last night.\n","March 28","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of them. RTS fans will love this game. Strategy and long term planning is a must. There are no tanks, no soldiers and no real weapons in this game. Everyone plays right on top of eachother in a mad battle for resources and stock. The objective is to Buy Out the other companies stocks. You will first chose a class, there aare 4. Each one is unique in what resources they require the most. You will build buildings and mine resources and sell them and balance your money. You will set yourself up to buy out all of the other players stock. While this may not sound like much fun, the game is extremely fun in my opinion. It is a different type of RTS that you will come to love. The first day I got it I played for 6 hours straight. Addictive personality aside, it is that much fun. Please buy this game and support the growing community as well as the dev's. They have released a bug free polished game which is a huge task for any dev. The game is easy at its core to learn, but deep enough to keep you wondering for a while. There is MP, SP & Skirmish. They have thought of everything. Give it a go and you will not be sorry. Hit me up for a game too!\n\nPeace!","August 4, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Depending on how you start alone could change the entire challenge.\n\nRight now, a game session is a relatively short experience, even on 'snail' pace.  But you're never too long waiting on anything to do, just that it ends quickly once you start steamrolling.  Personally, I do think there need to be some additions to make for a longer, more drawn out game.  Perhaps additions to the 'game market' as it were, such as land taxes, worker pay, and maintenance costs that scale with how much you expand in order to make that money you make more than just something you dump into a bank. (And we mustn't forget making those values something you manipulate that alters production and profit.) And of course, random events that further aggro those values.\n\n\nBut overall, if you're the type that play an RTS in that way where you like to watch your forces build up into a mighty base rather than actually attack and crush the enemy as soon as you can.  Try this game out.  Its current brevity can even be useful if you want to kill time, but not a lot of it.\n\n\nGive it a shot.\n\n\n\nAlso, someone needs to get on the dev team and get some better quality audio for the vocal parts...  Decent quality graphics and gentle music, and then literally the microsoft 'sam' and female equivilent for audio cues.","August 21, 2015","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After installing I got to the main screen then it would crash back to steam. Ok I thought, its in beta so maybe its something they are working on to fix. I tried a few times over the weeks and still the same issue....that is until their latest update.\n\nI can now play the game <cheers all round>\n\nI play quite a few stratagy type games so jumped straight into a single player game. It did not go well and was bought out by rival corps pretty quickly as my stock price was low and I amounted a large amount of debt! So I hit up the tutorials which cover very basic gameplay and could do with hints on the way to improve stocks prices or reduce debt/cancel out debt all together.\n\nYes there are diferent classes which have there own benifits/restrictions. For instance Expansive (human) require large amounts of food/water followed by power and oxygen. Robotic eats through Silicon and Power whereas Scavenger eats Carbon like theres no tomorrow!\n\nSo what have I learnt in the past 10hrs of play..?!\n\nPing quick at the start so you can find the best resourse spot on the map.\n\nYou can plant your HQ down ontop of a resourse which adds it to your starting inventory but will not regenerate the resourse like it would if you just planted a mine ontop of the resourse.\n\nTry and keep modules attached to the HQ that way your not charged to transport across the map (Power also = fuel)\n\nSolar panels are good but shutdown at night and thats where debt can mount up quick if your transporting alot! Wind turbines work day and night which give a steady trickle of power. Geo thermal plants work best as they operate day and night and dont require transports but are expense!\n\n|\n\nThe game has a steep learning curve currently which is brought about mainly due to the tutorials included with the game. I found out more through looking in the forums and youtube. Doing so I won my first game last night.\n","March 28","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As someone that likes management games that make you think rather than click aimlessly I do embrace such games but it does need a lot of work still. The devs seem determined to clear out the issues but as it is right now my recommendation is pretty weak and to a big part hopeful thinking that they will deliver.\n\nThe logic in this game as it is now is flawed. Even being the best with profit and having the most structures you at times actually lose and nothing in the tutorial gives you a basic idea why.\n\nAlso definitely too high priced. 20 € seems fair to me with some mindset to support them but I really wouldn't pay more for this than that.","March 21","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just premade skirmishes.\n- Concept can get boring quite quickly.\n- The objective (have more money than the enemy) or how you do it (sell lots of stuff) is pretty identical no matter what the map-maker dishes out at you\n- The cheap voiceovers were made on a free text-to-speech website are quite annoying and no option to mute voice\n- The price-tag is quite rediculous for what it is, and what it does, and the kind of effort or cost that went into making it.

It is ugly, extremely difficult to use, and borderline unplayable now. Game had a lot of potential but now I would strongly suggest avoiding it unless they restore functionality.\n\nVery unique and enjoyable. Even though there are probably only about 25 buttons in the entire game, it's very different every time and doesn't get stale quickly. The multiplayer community is alive even in early access. This is not a click spamming game, you don't need  300 APM to play, but it is still an RTS so there are areas where a bit of speed helps. Personally I think about 40 APM is the limit beyond which there is very little difference. On the surface it looks like a number crunching game but you never really need to do math beyond "which number is bigger." Games take about 20 minutes start to finish. Considering the graphics, it puts a good deal of strain on my PC, putting my GPU at about the same temp it sits it playing a much more graphically intense CryEngine game like Evolve.\n\nThe endgame can be a bit dull, but I think they realize this and will make it more interesting. Currently you just race to buy each other out, sometimes you can be just a few seconds away from winning, and bam suddenly you lose. Larger games are even wonkier as sometimes you buy someone else out and then immediatly someone buys you.\n\nThe AI is very clever but frankly single player is boring. If people frighten you maybe play something else. There is an automated 1v1 matchmaking system in multiplayer and people do play it.","October 3, 2015","false","102.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
