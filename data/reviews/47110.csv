Problem with the minigames is you start with only 50 as a cap and many games give you far more than that as a reward.\n\nFun little game and great if you're one of those green-skinned casual gamers too.","January 30, 2013","true","2.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

I played this game a REALLY long time ago when I was little, so for me playing it is like going back to my childhood XD! Nontheless i find this game super addictive and I will say you will need some patience for the first couple hours of the game, but once you got probably like 10 - 12 villagers the process in the game speeds up pretty fast!","November 27, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
