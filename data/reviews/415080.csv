I read dev's post "Please read before buy" and i said ok i get it, the game is under development and it is nowhere near complete. But this isn't even playable right now, It is just a white background with some pictures and very very few buttons and full of bugs. I started a new game in 1 January and it said next game 11 January, i pressed the continue button until February and nothing happen, it still says next game 11 January. And apart from that there is nothing you can do right now. This shouldn't be in Steam early access, it is clearly way early for this and the devs say buy this game only if you want to support us, which is against Steam rules.\n\nProof that i dont lie: http://i.imgur.com/6lx5dab.png and i didnt even try to find this bug, it happen at my first time i played it. Imagine how many game breaking bugs there are. Another time i played the game i saved it and next time i pressed load and a loading screen appear, i let it load for 5 minutes and nothing happen.","January 18","false","0.4"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","40","49","4","4"

I'm not going to condemn it as a bad purchase yet since it was $7, but this is the reason I can't stand Early Access.\n\nThe game, in total, has about 10 screens.  The information you have is minimal. The only real options you have to do are to pick up free agents, edit tactics, which are three sliders, and press continue.  Any sort of stats are minimal to nonexistent.  I played for 10 minutes and literally I found and exhausted everything there was in the game.\n\nOn a lighter note, I don't want to completely write off this game.  I think it has a lot of potential, it's just cursed with the evil "early access" label.  The best description for the game is: wildy incomplete.  Give it a few months before there's any sort of substance to the game.  I want to like it and I will certainly try again, but as of the time I'm writing this, there's virtually no game to speak of.","January 18","false","0.5"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","2"

This will definetly be the key.\nGood Luck DEV-s keep it up !\nI will often update my review during the new deploys:\n\nPROS:\n- Good Concept\n\nCONS:\n- The game is on too early stage even to release as early acces.\n(However the devs start with this the Desc. of the game)\n- AT THE MOMENT its definetly not worth it (Thats why its a NO for me)","January 18","false","0.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","3"

Game needs serious work. Also needs a good translator as the grammar is pretty bad.\nThere's no way to tell if the training sliders work.\nAt the beginning, you would think that you pick a league, and then you can pick a team in that league to manage, that is incorrect. You just pick the team, which has the league in a column to the left of it.\nText during a match goes way too fast, and not to mention the fact that there is a slider at the bottom of the match screen that does god knows what?\nDid I mention the very poor english?\nYou just mindlessly click around trying to figure out what to do since there's no tutorial.\nCan't tell if training is based on an individual or the team as a whole, since you can select each person on the team but the sliders for training don't change at all.\nIt also seriously needs more countries. The list there is a joke.\nWish tab worked as well when inputing text into fields.\n\nRefunding and waiting for this game to get out of early access.","March 24","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Rather, support the devolper and offer him up ideas on the game and how he can progress it.\n\nTogether, we can all watch the game progress and develop into something amazing.","January 18","true","0.3"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","7","21","0","1"
