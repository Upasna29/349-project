It has nice cellshade graphics and a relaxing soundtrack. Main purpose is some medical education for CPR (reanimation). There are 4 chapters and many floppy shaped collectibles to find. Pickup tools like screwdriver and crowbar to open vents and extend your PDA with extra battery life to hack into electronic doorlocks. It's rather minor challenging but makes quite fun to solve the puzzles.","December 18, 2015","true","2.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Alone, you have to find your team and bring what they need... but before doing that, you'll have to pass a course about CPR, never realising that you'll be using these skills sooner than later.\n\nFor a free game, I must say that I'm impressed by the quality of it. I'm maybe biased because I test a lot of serious games. Relive is belonging to this category: learning by having fun. It's not like I'll do CPR in real life but I know at least some of the basics.\n\nThe graphics are looking like a Telltale game (The Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead) but contrary to the two I've mentionned, you're not really making any choices (apart when you need to pass the CPR test and when you perform the trick). You have to unlock doors, crawl in vents, move crates, realign antennas.... In other words, the gameplay is varied, which is a good thing, though the CPR focus is less the spotlight. The fact that you can find secrets is also a nice distraction.\n\nHowever, you can have good graphics and suffer from bugs. I've been stuck between a door and a wall and a desk, I've jumped through the wall. Or I fell from the map in the hangar. And when you know that you can't save in the level (your progression is saved at the end of the level), it's kinda annoying.\n\nAlso, while I'm glad that they mapped the arrows to move, I've still a problem with WASD, used in the hacking minigames. You can't change the layout of that. So, instead of having natural movements, W, which is to go up, is under the S which is to go down, like A is on the left but a line above. You understood: I've an AZERTY keyboard. If the devs could map ZQSD or the arrows for the minigame, I'll be much faster to solve them.\n\nTrue, I would have preferred to have it also in French, because not everyone is fluent in English (or in Italian). But I don't mind that: you can see the gesture, which is important.\n\nAlso, you don't need to play the four chapters for learning about CPR and be aware of that, you can launch a training session. And you can also compete if you have a Kinect to practice IRL!\n\nSince they added a voice-over, the game is now less silent: the voice acting is decent - I was disappointed by the AI that is nearly without emotion despite the faces they're doing. However, the rest can pass.\n\nSo, yeah, test it, it's free. But I'm surely recommending it!","October 16, 2015","true","5.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","1"

And amazingly, the game is completely free so they can reach a much larger audience. I believe those facts alone make this game worth a try.\n\nThere's a story mode, training mode and a tournament mode (which needs a Kinect). The story mode includes CPR without being intrusive, and looks like it's good fun to play through while also teaching people how important learning CPR can be. The training mode will show you through hands-only CPR and how it should be correctly performed, as well as with a defibrillator (AED). The tournament mode plays you against friends and family while using a Kinect, to see who can perform the best CPR, and will score each persons attempt.\n\nThe game seems to play smoothly on Windows 10, didn't have any crash issues and I haven't yet seen any bugs/glitches.\nThe only suggestion I could make is that they add some kind of charity link to the description and in-game, that would help fund research for Cardiac Arrests (such as The British Heart Foundation).\n\nIf you'd like to see all this for yourself, check here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zFLObe43PE","October 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","26","38","2","0"

Plus, free to play, so there is that.\n\nSo, how do you design an informal CPR training class in the form of a video game. Easy....have a research station of Mars that suddenly faces disaster, and you have to save your fellow researchers using the CPR skills you learn in the game. Which actually works quite well. While this game is no masterpiece, I felt it did a good job of presenting a CPR lesson in an approachable way.\n\nAs far as the game itself, it is a bit cel shade and a bit Unity engine, with essentially point and click puzzles (and a couple stack stuff to get to other stuff puzzles thrown in ).\n\n...and that is pretty much it. I took my time and probably played for about an hour and a half while also watching sports, lol.\n\nI will leave this unrated but recommend that you at least check it out. It's free, it's somewhat informative, and is a decent attempt at making education fun.\n\nCheers!","October 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","12","17","3","0"

The only real sound in the game is the annoying as ♥♥♥♥ soundtrack that repeats constantly, that literally gave me a headache.\n\nNone of the first person animations you see in the trailer are an actual thing, there is almost no dynamic gameplay in this game at all\n\nControls are clunky - you can press the throw button after picking up and object (crucial to some very tedious stuff in the game) and you will ♥♥♥♥ up because your character decided not to throw it that particular time you pressed the button. Your character moves floaty as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn my opinion the secrets in this game are lame and the puzzles aren't fun either.

Well then this might just be the game for you.\n\nFirst off this game is free. So there is no excuse not to give it a go. It’s not all that long clocking in at around 2 hours and that includes collecting all the secrets. That being said I had a great time with this game.\n\nThe way in which it teaches you CPR is a little contrived but I learned a couple things and had fun doing it. You take the role of a scientist trapped on Mars. Your home is surrounded by a swarm of malevolent AI controlled nanobots hell bent on destroying all that lay in their path. It is up to you to save the day and transport the knowledge mankind needs to defeat the AI whilst saving as many people as you can along the way.\n\nThe controls are pretty good, the game whilst not graphically stunning has a very nice art style to it. I adored the computer mascot designs; they were adorable and added to the charm of the game, especially the medical one. The story is well written for such a short piece and portrays a lot of world building and character depth. I thoroughly enjoyed my jaunt through the base and would gladly return to learn more about everything that went on behind the scenes and how hopefully mankind will retake Mars.\n\nI recommend this to anyone that has a couple hours to spare and just want a nice short adventure whilst simultaneously learning very VERY basic skills that may help you save a life someday. And as I mentioned its free so no reason not to.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","October 29, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The only game where you get to kiss men while they're passed out and grope their boobies while claiming you're giving them CPR.\n\nReal Review:  Well, I thought to give this game a try.   It' not too bad, but it does not live-up to the feeling of panic, survival, horror, and possible combat that the trailer hints at which makes you think it'll be pretty long with a pretty good story....not quite.\n\nYou play the game as ERROR 404 (according to your apartment door) and get a message from your boss.  Lug around a Companion Cube you can't use for anything box of plot device data you cannot access throughout the base.   You are forced to learn CPR to continue through the base before putting it into practice one time.  The game's narrative isn't much and the dialogue seems to be a little wordy for an emergency situation through 4 chapters you'll finish in 1-2 hours.  (My log says 4-5 hours due to replaying to find an achievement)\n\nBreakdown:\n\nChapter 1:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tGL-buZ94Y\nWake up, pack your box, run away.  (Or as the video says... "Get your sh*t together!")\n\nChapter 2:  Mandatory CPR lesson after meticulous running around and puzzle solving.  (This will be your longest chapter, hands-down)\n\nChapter 3:  Cube physics that will make you wonder why they companion cube logic isn't good and why you're falling through boxes you're climbing.  Put your CPR into action.\n\nChapter 4:  Pack the ship, turn on the communications tower, escape.\n\n\n\n\nPros:\nA noble cause for the purpose of CPR.\nRun-around adventure.  (if you like that sort of thing)\nPuzzles here and there along the way.\nDecent usage of 3D models. (They look like they came out of Borderlands)\nFree.\nAchievements.\n\nCons:\nA plot that isn't all that good.\nMisleading trailer.\nAlthough human models are decent, they're mostly ugly.   (Surprised the director is decent)\nGlitchy (Box physics are not on par with Companion Cube physics in Portal)\nOccassional freezes (during the CPR exam.  Do NOT choose "Wait for help", you'll wait forever)\nAlt-tab on boot just to get the screen to display.\n\n\nPersonally, I was peeved about re-running through chapter 2 for an achievement (some of the time, the dialogue causes a freeze), but overall?  I've played worse.   Although I don't know if the usage of CPR is accurate in this game, I can at least say that it's attempt at educating gamers.\n\n\n5/10.  Decent.

This helps everyone who play the game gain the basic knowledge to help someone or to resuscitate until paramedics arrive. Now to the game itself the graphics were good and the story was interesting, however, having audio on the dialogue wouldn't hurt, but thats just a minor thing for me because the focus I believe was to help everyone gain knowledge in the end. Overall, great free game and a great way to learn as well through gaming. I definitely wouldn't mind playing more games like these.

Actually, I am all for combining realistical education and video games story and fun. This game intends on teaching you about CPR, aka what to do when somebody fell onto floor and there is no doctor in the same room.\n\nAnd it also tries not to be way too forceful by giving you more of usual videogame puzzle-solving fun. And levels to explore. It's also short, only 4 levels, and it ain't Burning Rangers either.\n\nThe thing is, it's not too terribly exciting. You spend more of time solving normal puzzles, while from CPR-related category there is like one tutorial, one exam after that and one "real deal", which is no different as you still do it by answering questions. Yep, nothing in final level.\n\nIt would have been better if it concentrated on CPR stuff more, putting you into more varied situations, instead of filling levels with videogame puizzles. Make you feel that you control your character directly instead of answering questions. Or put more medical education too. I mean, could use something like in trailer, dragging somebody into safe enviroment. Actually, yea, what the hell, why it wasn't in the game but in trailer?\n\nOh well. Short, free, not high-budget.

I've never seen a game set out for one, simple, little task and not only divert its focus from that task, but sucks massive balls while doing so.\n\nIt's a game about CPR! So make a game about CPR!\n\nSeriously, the training session is completely unncessary. It's literally a sequence cut out from Chapter 2, where all you do is just get told about the steps for CPR and watch some awkward animations of the character doing CPR. No interaction. Just questions and answers. I remember when I learned CPR, I had to actually perform it on a dummy. Isn't there any way it could've at least made a mini game out of it?\n\nAnd what's up with the story mode? It's awkwardly and slowly paced, with sluggish controls and incredibly pace-lengthening tasks that are so boring I started counting how many character's voices were generated by a computer. Basically, it's all the robots, although I'd guess that a couple of the humans act just as much like the robots in this game.\n\nBasically, there's a big storm in Mars, you have to get out, but before you do you have to calmly walk through different corridors and single-handedly equip and prepare a ship for take off, so some lazy-a** crew can get to safety. Isn't it their job to prepare the ship? I was busy saving their crew's lives in the previous level, and also carried their box with data cores inside for them!\n\nThe sound is awful in this too... well, besides the voice-acting. There's no sound effects. For anything. No footsteps. No Mars-storm sounds. No crowbar-hitting-steel sounds. Just nothing. And it's really... really... boring.\n\nRelive is a unique game. If you like bad games, this is sure to entertain your little masochistic self and for a lovely short 2 hours. But it's not fun. It's an absolute drudgery to complete. I'm giving Relive a 1/10.","March 21","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/decent60/recommended/404580/","decent60","Decent60","http://steamcommunity.com/id/decent60/","55 products in account","While trying to make this game a bit more fun by including puzzles and involving some critical thinking (what little you would need, mostly to find the secrets ), it lacks the basic information about it's main purpose. Since I am from the USA, I do have my guidelines to go by and while researching for what the EU's version was....I wasn't able to find much. However, I believe the standards are the same. With that in mind, I'll break this down into 2 reviews.\n\n\nCPR:\n1) The way the game describes to check to see if they're awake, by shaking them, especially where you had to do it on an a "player" in the game, could have killed them from trauma to the spinal cord. Common practice is to slap hard on the shoulds, not shake them.\n\n2) Head-tilt chin-lift technique doesn't leave the mouth open, because you're literally pressing up on the jaw. Should be a step to open it and see if they just choked (doing CPR on a person who just passed out from isn't harmful but you should be checking to make sure that you're doing the right thing).\n\n3) Many reasons why people don't do CPR is because the "rescue breaths", which aren't necessarily needed and not as important as keeping the blood flowing to the brain and heart. This information should have been included also. As with rescue breaths, you're to keep about 100 beats per minute and then 120 without the breaths.\n\n4) It should have been explained better about the AED, and how you won't ALWAYS shock a person and should continue CPR inbetween the readings. It should also explain what the purpose of the AED is. Movies and games (including this one) make it seem that when a person's heart stops, you just need to shock them to bring them back to life. Which isn't true for most cases. Unless they are in ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) or (in some AEDs) ventricular tachycardia (v-tach), the AED won't shock. It should also explain to follow the vocal instructions of the AED and also the pads for both placement and when to do things. Also, if someone else brought it to you, then you should ask them to set it up while continuing CPR. By this game, once you get an AED, you're supposed to waste time putting it together, taking off the clothes (something else not 100% needed, just access to skin). and applying the pads. One person can do that while another person does compressions. The game itself says 3-5 minutes without oxygen and the brain starts to die. An unskilled person will take 5+ minutes to setup the AED.\n\n\n\nGame itself:\n1)   Ignoring the CPR faults, the game itself is pretty buggy. Tho for a free game it's not that bad. One thing kinda bugged me was during part 2, when you were supposed to get the blank AI card to reprogram using the med bot I was trying to block the door with objects. Instead of pushing them aside, the doors just went through. them. No matter how many I placed infront of them.\n\n2)  While voice acting would have been nice, the diaglog could have been improved, especially when interacting with any of the AIs. Particularly, during stage 2, you could keep asking any of the AIs that had options the same thing over and over again, with no change to 90% of the diaglog.\n\n3)  You found the secrets, but only thing you could do with them is get a brief description of them. Would have been nice to been able to view something about them, especially since some where not that easy to find (but not that difficult either).\n\n4)   The ending puzzle made no sense to be honest.  why would they have 3  controllers with over-lapping controls for the satelites? I know it's a game, but that made no sense were as the rest sorta made sense.\n\n\nI am giving this a "No" on recommendation, not because the game wasn't that enjoyable, but because there isn't a middle options. I did have a bit of fun doing it but over-all game play and bad representation of it's core meaning, didn't really give that great of an impression. You won't really learn proper CPR  due to lack of some key elements (especially the hand placement, which I glossed over because the animation did show it correctly), but for a young kid, this game might give them an idea as to what to do. Also adding more options to the simulator for answers could have helped made it a bit more challenging. I do like that they did take the time to integrate the Windows Kinect into it to add a bit something to it. However, since not that many people have that it, was a bit wasted effort.","January 20","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You learn CPR (I assume. I'm not medically trained, but to my novice self, this seemed like an accurate depiction)\n2. Interesting art style\n3. Cheery AI helpers!\n4. It actually had a plot and gameplay outside the CPR training\n\nCONS\n1. The CPR learning section is kind of dull. It's not as interactive as it should be. I know clicking 30 times in a row might get annoying, but hey, it's more interactive.\n2. "Interesting" art style. Some of the characters looked a tad creepy.\n3. The robots didn't nearly have enough impact as they should have. When faced with the prospect (and related achievement) of losing my AI helper, I was only mildly distraught. I should be bawling at this point. Probably what might help is getting some voice work for this game. If I could hear the tinge of sadness creep in to its normally chipper tone, that'd be more impactful. And while I'm at it, all the humans could stand to gain voices, too. And environment sound effects. And... we'll just call it here before I completely derail this review.\n4. The plot was kind of thin. The robots seem to insinuate that these nanobots were growing or evolving somehow, but that never is really resolved. Also, apparently the doctor just randomly has a crush on Mike that never goes anywhere. I was certain that one of them was going to die to get us off this station, but nothing nearly so dramatic happens. Also, gameplay is pretty slow as a whole. A time element while you're racing to save your buddies (for example) would have been a good addition.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. However, my approval is less about the game itself and more about the concept and the potential it holds. Perhaps we could get a sequel in the future where you learn not only CPR but other medical techniques and apply it in a more combat or action-oriented setting while the gung-ho robots and solemn team members actually speak audibly to you. That, without a doubt, would be a 5-star game.\n","February 11","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game you play as one of the crew members of said station, who needs to reunite with his fellow crew members and escape the station before it's destroyed.\n\nWhat's interesting about this game isn't its depth or complexity; gameplay is quite simple, and follows the structure of traditional point-and-click adventures (where you look for different objects in order to progress and such), only that it's placed in a first person view; what's interesting is that a main point of this game is teaching the player basic CPR techniques, and I'd say it does a good job at that. It might not be the best way to learn it, but it does a good job of increasing awareness on how to act in situations that might require the use of CPR.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty short. It's still a good game, in my opinion, so I recommend it.","March 4","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
