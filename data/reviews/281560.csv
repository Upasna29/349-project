Confusing and very awkward controls. Nothing about it interested me enough to really try and figure them out, and it looked like it was going to take a lot of work to do so. There's not even a lot of story -- none that's clearly expressed, anyway -- and not much instruction or direction. It just kind of hopes you somehow know what to do.","October 17, 2014","false","0.2"," 50 of 62 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","50","62","2","1"

They don't get out of eachother's way.  Its frustrating to try to figure out what stuff you can interact with.  The hand-painted normalmaps haven't caused the graphics to age very well.  The camera jerks around uncontrollably.  You can't queue up commands to other dwarfs while one dwarf slowly walks around.\n\nThe Good:\nThe music is cute.  Its a complete game, its not alpha.  Except for the tutorial, the ability to read is not required to play it.\n\nDon't get this game unless you are a true fan of the adventure genre and love solving simple puzzles very slowly.","February 23, 2015","true","0.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","0"

The game itself felt unfinished with no storyline in place. Awkward controls, with even more awkward camera angles which were fairly hard to change and the dwarfs moving very slowly. The game just felt unfinished, the tutorial was decent though sloppy in some aspects, being quite confusing in the actual objectives. No way to hotkey actions, which made it very tiresome to continuously click the small action buttons.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPositives:☆Decent backstory.\n☆Interesting concept.\n\nNegatives:☆Awkward controls.\n☆Awkward camera angles.\n☆Confusing objectives.\n☆Gameplay slow.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSummary:Overall, it was confusing and awkward. The game has an interesting concept and could be taken further to make the game so much better. The state it's in now, it feels sloppy and unfinished.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════For more reviews on all sorts of games, follow Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews here!","January 22","false","0.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

Seriuosly, what a horrible experience. The whole time is like, what the hell am I supposed to be doing? Their basic moves, fine simple, I even got a few things done, but then you're just stuck wandering around hoping randomly clicking on things will do something. And there's no help out there. Walkthroughs or videos are non-exsistent, even here on steam. Just don't waste your time.","September 30, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
