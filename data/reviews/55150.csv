(don't want to give too much away)\n- The only bad thing for me was the difficulty, hard feels way to easy i've gone through the campaign on hard and only died once (sneeky Bloodletters) other then that it's brilliant.\n\nExterminatus/Co-op\n- A bit like the Campaign as you fight wave after wave of Orks, but now you can do it with friends plus you have full freedom of which class and weapons you want to use (when you unlock them that is)\n- You are best playing this mode with friends as some public players like to show off and get as many kills as they can, this tactic is fine until the waves become harder and they end up dying a lot, then when all lives are gone they leave the game (lives are limited and you need them to respawn)\n\nMultiplayer/VS\n- First thing, if you are a gamer that cares about how many kills/deaths you get multiplayer is not for you, due to the amount of lag and sometimes hackers you will end up dying a lot, but if you game for fun then this is perfect for you even if your not W40K fan.\n- You can pick from 3 class types, Tactical Marine, Devastator Marine or an Assault Marine, each class has different weapons and perks so you can spend a lot of time experimenting to find out what suits you.\n- There is also an awesome customization feature, you can pick from many Chapters/Warbands or even create your own, you can also unlock different armour pieces for your Space Marine and Chaos Space Marine (so you could run into battle as a pink Chaos Marine with spikes)\n\nOverall:\nThis game offers you something new from other shooter games, you can fly around the map as an Assault Marine or overwhelm your enemy with Heavy firepower the choice is yours.\nSingle Player: 10/10\nMultiplayer: 8/10 Host migration is a pain, it can make some matches unplayable.\n\nThank the Emperor without him humanity would of fallen a long time ago\n\nEDIT: 03/05/2015\nBin asked a lot lately if mulitplayer is dead, you should be able to find matches for Seize Ground and Annihilation but Capture the Flag, Capture and Control plus Dreadnought Assault are dead for now, but there is a group called  Red Thirst  that gets players together to play these modes so if your interested in joining, the group is on my profile.","December 21, 2014","true","455.9"," 501 of 511 people (98%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","98","501","511","36","33"

It's not something I can easily describe, but clearly the developers Relic have an understanding of the universe and the factions within. For the most part the characters, the way they are written and the way they reacted to the games plot and situations was very .. "warhmmer"  and it was stronger for that in my mind.\n\nOne thing this game absolutely nailed was the scale. The size of the Space Marines versus normal humans, the power armour was correctly proportioned and detailed in all the rght ways, the weapons are the correct sizes, the vehicles, buildings, aliens... everything was bang on as far as I am concerned when it came to scale.\n\nIn truth I can't really fault the game too much. It had to step away from the lore a bit to fit in game mechanics, for example a Space Marine Captain (leader of a 100 strong Space Marine Company, veteran of centuries of warfare) wouldn't turn up to battle with just 2 fellow Space Marines in tow..  armed with a standard Bolter and Combat knife, but that had to be done for progression of course... by the end of the game I had a personal force field (Iron halo), a selection of around 7 different firearms, and a choice between a chain sword, power axe and a blummin' two handed thunder hammer. Not really correct in the world...  but makes sense in a game.\n\nThe game itself was good fun, melee combat was well done, although an ability to parry would have been nice, and the gun play felt very heavy and dangerous. They got the feel and sound of a Bolter just as I imagine it, bang on the money, and at times I really felt like I was playing a real Space Marine from the stories and board games.\n\nThe main critism has to be the checkpoint system. Some poorly placed checkpoints sapped a little joy from the experience, mainly the one's that were frequently placed before an unskippable in engine cutscene... which generally pre-empted a major engagement  you could easily lose.... only to then repeat the whole scene again when the you're plonked back at the checkpoint. That wasn't good.\n\nHowever that last point aside, an enjoyable game and glad I finally played it!","November 18, 2013","true","10.9"," 122 of 128 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","122","128","0","0"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:We have all seen big men, wearing big armor, wielding big guns and doing manly stuff from previous games (like Gears of War or Star Craft), but have you ever wondered who started it all?\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a Third Person Hack, Slash and Shooter game developed by Relic Entertainment who has constantly delivered quality work when dealing with the Warhammer 40k universe.\n\nSTORY (No Spoilers):You play as Captain Titus of the Ultramarines, along side his friend Sidonus and the newly initiated Leandros, all of whom are sent to the forge world of Gaira with the objective of protecting a Warlord Class Titan from being looted by a full Ork Invasion. Unknown to Captain Titus, however...other forces are at work there.\n\nPROS:+ Visuals (as a whole): -This game boast beautiful cut scenes, epic scenery, massive buildings and intense combat. Model and Animation quality are very well made which is complemented by its superior sound quality. The violence in this game is extreme and oddly very satisfying.\n\n+ Audio: -From the soundtrack to the footsteps and  bolter or lasgun fire, Relic has performed admirably on the sound assets which greatly improves the immersion experience. The voice acting delivered by Mark Strong as Captain Titus is great and complemented by the performance of the supporting cast.\n\n+ Story: -The game offers a linear story progression which contains enough lore to satisfy the old school and long time fans of the Warhammer 40k Universe, but at the same time, is easy enough to comprehend and understand for the new comers. Story is around 8 to 9 hours long, and 6-7 if you have already played it once. The difficulty level of the game does merit a replay.\n\n+ Multiplayer: -I normally don't consider multiplayer because I'm a singleplayer oriented gamer but I was able to substantially play the multiplayer mode of Space Marine and was impressed. Multiple game modes and heavy customization really is a big bonus here.\n\nCONS:- Texture Quality: -Although I said that visuals AS A WHOLE is good, the texture quality of this game is quite inferior. It may have looked good on the console versions but on the PC on 1080p, one can see that the textures used was only low res. The poor lip syncing was also a minor annoyance for me. The Artstyle is great but it does not excuse low resolution textures specially on the PC.\n\n- Terrible PC Settings: -This game should have had a more extensive PC settings instead of the generic preset of “low-medium-high”. I feel that devs who does not put effort on the settings are not fully utilizing the capabilities of the PC as a gaming platform. On the up side, at least gamers with not so powerful systems can still enjoy the game and have fun.\n\n- Disappointing Boss Fight (NO SPOILERS): -A certain boss fight for me was very disappointing since it was more or less a quick time event and mini-game than an actual fight. The fight in itself was still badass and manly as hell with regards to the story though.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME, extremely fun and satisfying to play with a very enjoyable singleplayer and multiplayer experience.\n\nWORTH IT?:The game is well worth its full price for not just the fans of the Warhammer 40,000 universe but fans of 3rd person action games and new comers to the franchise alike.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It's a worthy addition to the RTS video games that the franchise is known for. The gameplay is simple and intuitive with easy to control shooting and sword fighting mechanics. The game is linear but not to it's own detriment. It uses the linearity to create a unique action game that puts you right into the boots of a Warhammer Space Marine fighting against the legions of Orks.\nThe campaign is fairly short, and it has it's quirks some of which can become quite grating as the game progresses. A part from that the game truly delivers in all other fashions that an action game and more importantly a Warhammer game should. Brutal action, satisfying kill animations, and a fairly well developed multi-player experience really makes the game the complete package. It's game that's worth playing, and it's unfortunate that it got overlooked by many people.\nThe multiplayer with its coop wave based game mode titled "Exterminatus" is one hell of fun experience that will give you many hours of fun.","May 4, 2014","true","49.5"," 94 of 99 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","94","99","0","8"

Which planet? No need to know since it matters not. As an Ultramarine you are not supposed to "ask question", let alone "question orders". Not that it would change much to be honest as I couldn't tell you the name of the planet if I wanted. Anyway, soon you learn that scientists have managed to encapsulate the mythical warp energy and all kinds of monsters are now throwing their bodies like blood-filled waterbaloons to secure this for their respective faction.\nA deep, long-standing lore as Warhammer's would surely put many devs in a peril to cram at least the important parts into a game one would think. Unless you don't even try. Which is the case here. You won't hear where you come from, why you fight, who the factions are or the characters. Nothing. But then again, as an Ultramarine you ought to fight for the Machine Gods (whoever them might be). Don't ask questions, there is only WAR.\n\nGameplay:\nIt is a third-person-shooter with a very hefty dose of melee combat thrown in for good measure. It is in no way an afterthought though. In fact many times you will realize that brawling your way out of combat is the better choice. Very good that the variety in melee weapons is formidably well as to classic weaponry. Speaking of, you start with only a pistol and add a rifle shortly to your arsenal. During the ~7 hours you'll play the campaign there will be frequent and steady additions to it. At the half-way point even glorious energy-type guns. These especially feel fittingly powerful against the huge hordes of orcs rushing at you during the constant barrage of firefights. Make no mistake, this game is about shooting things and it does not stop until the credits keep rolling. It is refreshing to feel extremely overpowered at times. Movement shows this too as you feel like a walking tank with humongous armor. A tad slow but it conveys the feel of heaviness nicely to the player.\nOne very clever mechanic about combat is melee as mentioned before. Apart from just being a very powerful type of attack, it also serves as the only way to heal yourself - which might sound weird at first. It works like this. After putting your an enemy into a staggered state you can kill it with a gratuitous finishing move and regain a good portion of your health-points back. It is a refreshing mechanic which leads to an extremely offensive playstyle. Don't come into this when you like planning and cover. It's full frontal combat. Set-pieces and sweet jet-pack sections give you nice amount of variety as well.\n\nVerdict:\nSpace Marines is a good game with very satisfying combat mechanics. To my disappointment did the devs not put any priority whatsoever into showcasing the deep Warhammer lore. A big shame as this lack of knowledge makes you care significantly less about characters and events unfolding. Why would I care about the machine gods, the imperium, the codex when I never get to learn more about them? There is huge potential with the lore but it was wasted here sadly. The story as well looses importance with this. A very rudimentary construct keeping me go from level 1 to level 2 at best. In the end I only wanted to get to the next area to bash some orcs head. While being the weakest link of the game it only emphasizes how well the actual gameplay is to make me enjoy playing until the end. Ultimately I am glad I played this game.","August 26, 2015","true","8.9"," 99 of 107 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","99","107","6","7"

Some were good, others mediocre, and others were so great that I still play them, even several years after their release.\n\nThis is one of them.\n\nThis is one of the best 40k games, period. It nails everything- from what makes a good 3rd person shooter, to what makes a true-to-lore 40k game.\n\nTo start off, This isn't your standard 3rd person-totally-not-gears-of-war game. Whilst most 3PSs focus on a cover system, Space Marine removes that entirely. You ARE the cover. You can wade into a mob of enemies, without dying every 3 seconds. It perfectly encapsulates what makes a space marine a space marine, and lets you experience that firsthand.\n\nThe combat is divided into two parts- ranged and melee. You are given a wide variety of weapons to slaughter your enemies in different and uniquely brutal ways. Each weapon feels (and sounds!) exactly how it should. The shot of a bolter, the hiss of a meltagun, and the roar of a plasma cannon. And although the ranged weapons are cool, the melee weapons are even better. Chainswords (chainsaw-swords) evicerate and rend flesh whenever they strike, turning a large horde of orks into a bloody mess very quickly. Thunder hammers, although slow, deal tremendous damage and completly pulverise your enemies. The combat (especially in single player or the horde-mode) is immensly satisfying and one of the best parts of the game.\n\nThe game has both a single-player and a multiplayer. The single player has a decently lengthy campaign (10-12 hours) with a pretty good story. It does have its faults (unfinished story arcs that will probably never get finished b/c r.i.p THQ), and the last boss fight is pretty lame. The multiplayer, although good and reasonably well balanced, gets repedative with the 4 maps (excluding expansions). You also can't choose which side you are on pre-match, meaning you might not even get to see your shiny new color scheme for a couple matches. The multiplayer also follows the standard 'level up to improve' philosophy, with special perks unlocked by completing challenges (some of which are brutally difficult without help).\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic 40k game that really makes you feel like you are playing a space marine. It has a few issues (mostly with multiplayer), but you can easily get many hours of enjoyment out of this game.\n","September 16, 2015","true","55.2"," 77 of 78 people (99%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","99","77","78","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/55150/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Warhammer 40,000 lore has had a long history and has served as the progenitor for many of our modern interpretations of "Space Marines". Surprisingly Relic Entertainment's Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is our first time actually playing as a Space Marine outside of the strategy genre recently, but this entry certainly makes up for any previous lacking of action games. The gameplay of this third-person shooter perfectly captures the spirit of being a 7-foot armored titan, wading into your foes with sword and axe just as effectively as you bring them down with a hail of gun fire.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine tells the story of Captain Titus of the Ultramarines and it's up to him and his battle brothers to secure key assets on the Ork-invaded forge world before the rest of the fleet arrives to retake the world. Titus is joined by a pair of AI controlled marines, Sidonus the veteran sergeant, complete with scars, and Leandros, only recently elevated from novice, who still fervently clings to the Codex Astartes rulebook.\n\nEventually the forces of Chaos, comprised of traitorous Space Marines, Imperial Guardsmen and Daemons, also jump into the fray to further complicate matters. If all of these terms leave you scratching your head, Space Marine isn't here to drop decades' worth of tabletop backstory on you. For fans of the series it will be enjoyable immersion with lots of little details and call outs, but even if you don't know what the Codex Astartes is, Space Marine does a good job of laying in enough context for you to get the gist.\n\nOverall, the story is enjoyable and will continue to compel you to want to play more, and Mark Strong lends a calm and commanding voice to Captain Titus. There are some great epic moments like jump-packing onto an Ork ship, a massive aerial battle as you race to reach a key location first and fighting down a bridge shoulder to shoulder with squads of space marines. The overall story arc does ring annoyingly similar to previous Warhammer 40,000 videogame narrative structures, i.e. Orks invade, Space Marines are sent in and then Chaos gets involved.\n\nThe fighting is spectacular though as Relic Entertainment nails the feel of being massive armored death dealers that are equally skilled with ranged combat as they are in melee, and the third-person camera transitions seamlessly between the over the shoulder weapon firing and pulling away for melee. The game actually rewards and requires you to mix it up with chainsword and other deadly close combat weapons rather than keeping your distance. While you have a regenerating shield, your health can only be refilled by executing foes. This promotes a style of play that really hasn't been seen in the third person shooter genre, forgoing cover to take the fight to the enemy, but it is an excellent fit for the Space Marines.\n\nAll of the elements of animation, visual cues and sound design come together incredibly well considering this is Relic's first venture in the genre. The game does an excellent job in spacing out gameplay mix-ups as well, just when you think you might have had enough of fighting waves of enemies there might be a section where you fire a turret from a train at a drop ship or the game lets you take the fight vertical with a jump pack. The sections with this rocket jet pack are especially satisfying as you crash into the ranks from above in massive shockwaves just to rocket back into the air to do it all again. There is no fuel to worry about and you'll have the jump pack until you finish with that section, so use it to your hearts content. When Titus inevitably removed the jump pack as the game moved towards the next level, I was always a little sad and wanted it to continue because those sections are way too much fun.\n\nOnce you've gotten a feel for the game in the single player campaign, you can jump into Space Marine's multiplayer mode. With Space Marines being able to take quite a bit of punishment, the overall feel is much weightier than the modern military shooter trend, with sustained accuracy tipping the balance more in importance than pure reflex. As you level up and complete challenges you'll unlock new weapons, armor and perks. Regrettably, the balance does start to feel a little off with some of the unlocked weapons and perks, especially in relation to what you start with, but you always have the option to copy the load out of the person who killed you.\n\nThe coolest aspect, especially for fans of Warhammer 40k fans, has to be the armor customizer. It's certainly the most robust system to date short of breaking out the paint set and miniatures. You can easily get lost in mixing and matching the unlocked individual armor sections, changing symbols and adjusting the paint scheme on each piece. There are also a number of pre-generated Chapters and Warbands, so it's easy to jump in if all you want is it to represent your favorite force.

This game is a must have for any fan of the series and for action fantasy fans a great addition to the Steam Library.  If you have played any of the Warhammer 40K series RTS you owe it to yourself to play this game at get a new angle at the world or W40K.\n\nWarhammer Space Marine features some top noth graphics (for 2011) and rag doll physics that are just awesome to see.  The screen can get overun at times with all the orcs and baddies that the Space Marine must attack - and this he does well - the carnage is gruesome and enjoyable.  I really loved all the unique weapon upgrades you could obtain and Fury Mode kicks some major A$$ for when you need it most.\n\nWarhammer sports a moody soundtrack and audio that seems to come from the depths of hell at times... needless to say that it always seems to fit the mood at the right time.  "Humans to kill" The Orc banter and dialogue I thought was rather good and comical at times.\n\nThe game boasts a sporty/meaty on line package where you can do co-op, on line play & off line single player challenge mode.  The on line that I played was a blast working my way to level 6 and blowing away orcs was adventurous and rewarding.  There are endless customization items and loadouts available for your on line character once you start leveling a bit.  If you plan on doing off line challenge mode it is basically similar to Horde Mode - which everyone knows about now a days.\n\nI just really enjoyed this game & it makes me miss THQ - they released good games - Warhammer, Red Faction, Stalker Saints Row... plenty of others.  This is a game where from what I seen you can pick up a few missions here and there or a little on line play for your fix of Warhammer.   There are collectables scattered around the game world where you can collect these items for further insight to the game and achievements as well.\n\nI truly hope to see a Space Marine 2 as Captain Titus at least deserves another round of Orc Onslaught after this under rated game has captured a place in my top gaming experiences on the PC.\n\nRecommended peeps - pick it up.","January 18, 2014","true","12.1"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","54","58","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MageRanger/recommended/55150/","MageRanger","Mage Ranger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MageRanger/","195 products in account","Space Marine is a spectacular game. The graphics beautiful and they clearly show the the people who moddled this game took a lot of time and effort on this game. In the campaign I liked to spend 5 minutes sometimes just to admire the scene.  THere aren't many games out their that have been given as much time and effort to make the background so inspiring and so real life. Not only it shows the Imperium of man in the 41st millennium have such skilled builders like described in the books, but also shows how much potential moddlers can achieve when creating the game people are going to play.\n\nThe combat system is amazing. When first I heard about a 3rd person shooter for warhammer 40k I first thought it was a mistake and it should of been a first person. But I'm gladly they didn't make it a first person shooter, because if so the game would of been completley different. Not only it allows you to see background the full scale of the war, but also the executions you just can't stop loving. Every close combat weapon have there own executions for different scenarios of combat and for both Orc and Chaos as well as the Chaos deamons.\n\nThe campaign is a thrilling adventure which you can't stop playing until you have to force yourself to take a break. Like some books that have such cliff hangers on every chapter you can't stop reading, for example: Percy Jackson. There are scenes which hold your breath because you don't know where the squids will come from (little Orc kamikaze peach dogs that go up to their enemies and explode in front of their face) as your in a tight spaced sewer that the Orcs use to get into places. You don't know if they'l go up behind you or not and if they do then they can make you jump resulting in you getting killed sometimes, (which happened to me a lot in one of the chapters). There are also very happy ending like you finnaly beating the Orc warcheif and stop having to fight with the orcs.\nThere are two bosses in the game: The Orc Warcheif and The Chaos Prince, who both have their own combat moves which you have to get fiqure out and make a plan how to counter them.\nThere is only one sidequest in the game: to collect all servo sulls. It's not necessarily quest because no-one gives it to you, but there are to achivements if you collect servo skulls. And each servo skull is reward. Hint: It's something to do with Imperial Guard the and the people when the Orc Invasion struck.\n\nAfter you finnish the campaign, you really want to go and start playing online. There are 2 gamemodes: Versus and Exterminatus.\nVersus contains different gamemodes where there 2 teams against each oother: seize ground, annihilation, capture the flag, and a dlc gamemode: Drednought.\nSeize ground is where there are 3-4 control points and both team have to hold and defend control points from the enemy team whilest treing to capture the enemies. Each control point you hold gives you points unless the enemy have captured more control points than your team.\nAnnihilation is where both teams try to be the first to get 41 kills.\nCapture the flag is where both teams have to defend their own flag and capture the enemies flag 3 times.\nDrednought is where both teams battle out to be in control of a drednought. At the start of the game or whenever a drednought is destroyed there will only be on capture point. The team who capture it, one of their players will become a drednought. That team has to captaure as many points as possible until reaching 20 points, whilest the other team try to destroy the drednought and dfending the control points.\nVersus also contains weapon and armor challenges. Whenever you complete enough weapon points for a specific weapon, you get a weapon perk for that weapon. If you complete enough armour challenges, you get different armour parts available to you for you to use.\n\nExterminatus is really fun. There are a max of 4 players in a single game, where they need to work as a team treing to survive waves of Orcs or Imperial guard or Space Marines. There are 2 exterminatus gamemodes and 3 maps. Each map contains 4 arenas and each arena contains 5 waves. The 4th arena however has a bonus round.\nClassic gamemode is where your team are the Space marines and you fight waves of Orcs. On the Bonus round you fight a wave of Chaos marines and Chaos deamons. There are 2 maps for this gamemode.\nThe Chaos Unleashed is a dlc gamemode where your team are the Chaos marines fighting waves of Orcs, Imperial guard and Space Marines. The Bonus round is where you fight massive swarm of Orcs who have the help of Killa Kans.\n\nYou can customise your own character who can achieve you the maximum level of 41. Each level grants you a reward. The character is either Chaos or Space marine depending on the gamemode. You only have one online character who can equip different loadouts you can customise. There are 3 classes for online: Tacticle, Devestator (Heavy), or Assult. Each loadout contains a class you can pick. The options are yours. Use which ever weapons you like best for different classes and their perks.\n\nYou can customise how you Space Marine and Chaos Marine lookes as well. You can choose chapter set, or make your own set. Most armour parts will be locked until you unlock them in Versus mode by completing the armour challenges. But if you want something more Vertren then you can buy some skins, which are very cheap.\n\nThe DLC are worth getting. The Chaos Unleashed unlocks new maps for Versus and a gamemode for Exterminatus.\nThe drednought unleashed gives you extra maps for Versus and a new gamemode for Versus.\nThere are a whole selection of VErtren skins you can buy and customise your character with.\nAnd there are 3 dlc weapons.\nIn my opion the whole game is worth the price and all of the DLC's. Although I recommend you buying only one Vertren Skin set for Space Marine and Chaos Marine since you can only use one at a time. But the choice is yours.","August 29, 2014","true","209.8"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","45","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/55150/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","So I was looking through my list of owned games and realized I don't have anything with a hero or main protagonist as incredibly badass as Captain Titus from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. I then made a ranking: second place is tied between Batman and Strider Hiryu while fourth place goes to the Boss from Saints Row the Third who narrowly edges out The Overlord for possessing better minions. This list isn't up for debate nor is it the topic of this review, though. The topic is how playing such an overpowering character can be an experience in itself.\n\nYou are for all intent and purposes a giant superhuman walking tank whose main weapons are a fully automatic mini-rocket launcher and a chainsaw sword. You fly around on a rocket pack coming down with a hammer that produces an explosion of concussive force. You heal yourself in the blood and guts of your broken opponents. You can literally run through some of your lesser enemies. None of this makes the game a cakewalk: orks will mob you relentlessly with their oversized choppers, chaos forces have access to plasma cannons and there are always monsters greater in size than you. It doesn't matter. Being such a superhuman badass just pushes you to greater acts of heroism.\n\nThe gameplay is basic but enjoyable enough: fire those bolt shells, melee the shooters, dodge roll a lot, throw a grenade into that mess of orks, use the Rage gauge before you die... The difference is that being in control of Captain Titus makes all of this so satisfying. There is weight in your run. The ground thumps as you do your dodge roll. Your bolter feels like the mini-rocket launcher it's supposed to be and not some standard machine gun. The execution scenes are barbaric, gruesome and as bloody as any Mortal Kombat Fatality. It enhances the gameplay, giving every one of your actions greater impact.\n\nAt this point, I should state that no knowledge of the Warhammer 40K lore is required to get into Space Marine. What more, if by some strange circumstance you're a Warhammer enthusiast or a lapsed fan who has not yet bought the game, I can honestly say that THQ have written an Ultramarine Captain better than the current in-house team of writers. Again: the story is basic enough in a "save the empire" kind of manner but it's the glorious yet still humble Captain Titus who draws you in.\n\nThis is actually the main shortcoming of this game. Outside of the main story you have Multiplayer Mode WHERE YOU DO NOT control Captain Titus, playing instead as a bog standard space marine. Instead of orks you face other space marines where you'll find yourself dying in seconds to lascannons, meltaguns and insta-kill thunder hammers; often with no knowledge over how you could've prevented your death. Unlike story mode, you die A LOT and obtaining perks that would increase the effectiveness of your weapons is a frustrating experience. You will lag, you will get stuck in walls and you won't want to play again.\n\nExterminatus is an improvement and basically Co-op mode where you take on wave after wave of orks along with your friends. It's fun in a mindless slaughter sort of way but it's also a shame how the important perks needed to improve your space marine's weaponry cannot be unlocked here. It's the random challenges you'll hate the most, however. Imagine a spontaneous message tasking you to execute five headshots during a lull in the fighting where no orks are present. It just goes to show how far good but limited gameplay can go in keeping a player interested in his carnage when you'd rather play Titus with all his added abilities than chance a game with overall the same controls in a casual pick-up game of Multiplayer.\n\nOverall; the gameplay and the controls are enjoyable enough, Captain Titus pushes all this over the top and the Multiplayer isn't worth it. Therefore, I recommend that you buy the game whenever it is at half price and ignore all of the DLC. Half price for half a product. A Thumbs Up at over 50%.","November 15, 2014","true","34.0"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","55","65","6","0"

In fact I am all three blind mice. I have never bothered to involve myself in the tabletop board game nor the RTS titles that decorate the franchise with the Dawn of War series on PC. Knowing nothing about the lore that surrounds the 40K universe I was hoping that Space Marine would be an accessible entry point into that universe. What I do know is that I absolutely love games set in the third person so Space Marine seemed like a no-brainer. To be honest I shouldn't have really bothered. Perhaps I am coming to the game a little too late (5 years after its launch) but the whole gung-ho ultra space marine subtext feels like ground that has been tread (to death) countless times before with titles that are far more superior in substance and style.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=589525967\nSure the easy thing would be to classify Space Marine as a poor man's Gears of War clone although I would be hesitant to lay it completely upon the shoulders of Epic's Opus. For starters there is no cover system as you hack and slash your way through hordes of Orcs. While the opening sections of the game give the player a feeling of badassery as you zip and zoom around the battlefield getting up close and personal with your enemies as you violently behead and dismember your opponents, Space Marine soon - and I mean very soon as the main games campaign is on the incredibly short side lasting 6-8 hrs -  ends up in a rut of monotony. Levels are incredibly drab with each one bleeding into the next and the colour palette of browns, reds and greens doesn't help stimulate the visual senses.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=589526864\nThings peak a bit when the Chaos Agents are introduced into the storyline when the game suddenly goes all blue and purple on your ♥♥♥. Speaking of storyline -  I lost interest within the first half hour of play. This is generic fantasy fluff at its finest. In fact there was a point where I completely just switched off. Sure you could argue that you don't need a strong narrative in a game like this but I beg to differ. For me narrative forms just as much an integral part as gameplay to make for a cohesive whole and what I found here was something countless generic fantasy writers have been writing about for ages perhaps with the setting slightly tweaked to make it look new and fresh. When it comes to gameplay mechanics there really isn't much to recommend here as it's as barebones simple as combat mechanics can get. There is certainly no visual flare or fluidity to the combat in the way Batman Arkham Asylum, and to a degree Assassin's Creed II, offered its players (games that both came out before Space Marine).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=589526450\nThankfully the game only took me 8 hrs to complete because near the end I was struggling, even with the games short length, to maintain interest. The final boss encounter was a frustrating exercise that devolves into a button mashing QTE exercise. After having played countless hours with third person adventures such as Dark Souls that gives the player complete control over their actions why on God's green earth must I press "Y" or "X" when prompted on screen to dodge or initiate an attack? Surely the player should be able to figure the timings out by him/herself? To be honest I am really glad I picked this up for $5 dollars during a sale because with the mediocre gameplay, generic fantasy booyah storytelling and incredibly short length on offer I would have been mighty miffed with myself had I dropped $60 dollars on this. I didn't bother to try out the multiplayer portion of the game because A) I prefer single -player pursuits with the odd bit of co-op and B) because I was pretty sure it was as dead as a door-nail 5 years later.\n\nIf you are fan of the 40K universe then perhaps you will find something here to enjoy but for the uninitiated - if this is what the 40K universe offers in terms of narrative, lore and third person badassery then thankfully you can count me out. While not a horrible game per say, it is that everything is just so middle-of-the-road that I can only recommend this title during a sale or to the hardcore fans out there who eat this generic cornball stuff up for breakfast. I am giving the game a thumbs up only because Steams review system still refuses to offer me the ability to give a game a mediocre or lukewarm rating which is where Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine sadly comfortably resides.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 21","true","8.5"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","35","39","5","8"

Remember the trailer in which Lance Henriksen says he is a space marine? Gameplay-wise it is a very simple game: Titus, our protagonist, uses melee and ranged weapons alike to eliminate hordes of orcs attacking the marines. You also have a fury meter that is gradually filling up as you get rid of enemies. This allows you to unleash even stronger and deadlier attacks.\n\nThe game has excellent graphics, voice acting and sound effects. While the plot is not something we have not already seen elsewhere, it has its great moments. It is unfortunate that the planned sequels were cancelled as THQ went bankrupt.\n\nI do not think multiplayer is played by anyone these days (after all, this is a 3-year old game), but as it is currently on sale (for 10 bucks) you can easily pick it up and spend some quality time with a squad full of ultramarines.","May 22, 2014","true","16.7"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

Being able to actually control one of those dudes for once is kinda neat, even if I'm not particularly interested in this franchise: it just has some good games made from it.\n\nIt's pretty much your typical 40k Space Marine plot in that you are sent to punch some Orcs, but a much greater threat looms that is unknown to you until you unwittingly assist them. Then it's a more serious fight as you are forced to confront this larger danger and ultimately beat it. Perhaps the most notable art of the plot are the questions asked about your main character, and whether or not they themselves are loyal and not falling into villainy. Sadly the game leaves this question ultimately unanswered. Guess they had to do something to leave the possibility of a sequel open. >_>\n\nGameplay-wise it is fairly mixed. The combat and all the nice weapons to use are fun, but the entire game pretty much consists of going through linear areas and killing hordes of enemies. Also it's not particuarly long, and it has a multiplayer thing that means i'll never 100% this game. Raeg.\n\nIf you are a fan of 40k and you always wanted to run around being a Space Marine instead of just commanding them in a smelly RTS, then I guess this is a game you can play to satisfy that itch. But for people who are not fans of this series, I wouldn't bother. In the end i'll say "yes" because it is, ultimately, a fan game, and those fans probably will enjoy this game to some degree.\n\nBwee.","July 6, 2015","true","6.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","17","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/55150/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","Do you enjoy a nice neon-paletted future where corporations rule and humanity is kept down by an oppressive government? Well then you'll like this, provided you don't want the neon palette. This is the vision of a future where humanity is past its' prime and is trying to fend off the slow decay of time; all while fending off hordes of aliens and daemons. The grimness of this universe is a refreshing twist, even after several decades as a series.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine puts you in the boots and bulky armour of one of the Imperiums' chapters of Space Marines. If you like sitting behind a wall and occasionally firing over the wall, then just stop there. In this game, there ARE no walls (metaphorically speaking of course)! YOU are the wall. You are a shield for the weak and a sword to be swung by the powers that be. As much as the game preaches that life is the Emperors' currency; you are a sturdy block of gold, in a world populated by pennies and pound coins. So what makes you so valuable, apart from the shiny aspect of your nature?\n\nYou are a block of Gold. Let's do a comparison. I want you to drop a penny onto your fingers while they are on a desk. Didn't hurt, did it? Now; drop a big block of Gold. If you actually did, I applaud your delusion of invulnerability, but I'm not going to kiss your boo-boo better. If you didn't; you're smarter than the person asking me to kiss the boo-boo. You see, logical thought dictates that there is a big difference in the damage a penny and a Gold Brick can do. You play the heavier of the two objects; that most delightful bringer of death. You are a big stompy thundering cannon comprised of flesh and muscle, located securely behind an energy shield and a hell of alot of metal. You don't fire a little 9mm pistol as you do in so many other titles. With your bulkier stature, you should be able to wield more mighty weapons and this game will allow you. Ever wondered what happens when a rocket propelled explosive shell (with a diameter of nearly an inch) comes into contact with the face of a 6 foot Ork, armed with naught but a club and a suicidal disregard for the laws of physics and mortality? If you answered "red?" then the klaxons in your room, set to ring with the sounds of victory when you are correct (at least if you're as egocentric as I) should be deafening you in reward for your foresight.\n\nIn a world full of games with lots of brown or orange; this game decides that red is still a viable colour. VERY viable. In fact, so viable that often times you will encounter pools of red where once a green enemy stood. If you are discouraged by blood, this game isn't for you. If you like blood, this game delivers it in such vast amounts that even the least sadomasochistic of us would still require the unbuttoning of the jeans to alleviate the tightness the combat produces. While I recommend this game to women as well, this game has an undeniable reek of man about it. I would be surprised if the word "testosterone" was not included once in every five lines of code written for the engine. While there is a brilliant plot behind the title, it isn't one that I'd recommend you buy the game for. The plot isn't what you want in a game, is it? Plot is a nice addition but gameplay is what differentiates a game from a movie or book and this is a shining example of that ideology. You fire rocket propelled shells from a fully automatic death-cannon; when you aren't lobbing balls of corrosive plasma into the faces of a tiny little green fellow. But range is only a part of the game. To regenerate health, you are not allowed to cower. Your health is tied to your efficiency in combat, as it drops when your shield is depleted and raises when you execute an enemy in close combat. To replenish your red goo, you need to turn your foes into red goo, and presumably the splat perks your character up enough to make him healthy again. Still makes more sense than being eaten by a dog in an open world game and healing up by pulling a bullet out of your left arm. It sounds better too. There is a definite booming sound behind your guns and your mighty melee weapons sound vastly different when they smash into metal in comparison to tearing through flesh. Your chainsword revs pleasurably as you swing it and your heavy bolters sound exactly as the name makes you believe. They sound heavy, as if they were firing bolts.\n\nNow let us discuss multiplayer. Six big stompy fellows clash against six big stompy fellows and there are three types of big stompy fellow you can be. You can be a tactical marine, who lumbers across the battlefield with some medium power ranged weapons. The assault marines jet around the battlefield with jump packs, slamming with a mighty force into the ground before spinning their melee weapons viciously to rend the flesh of all who oppose them. If you are more of a heavy fellow, the Devastators will fit you perfectly. Armed with the biggest weapons of all three, they stomp and wield death at range. They are so heavily equipped that instead of shoulder charging an enemy to interrupt the swing of their sword; they kick them. Even as you walk, the camera shakes to give you the true sense that you are heavy, gifted the power of a ton of metal and muscle. The ground never seems to sit still when you introduce twelve armoured Goliaths upon a map.\n\nThis is a game of David versus Goliath; except this time, you play Goliath and logic wins over storybook morality. Big stompy fellows don't get stopped by a stone, they club the sling wielder into the ground with fist and foot.","May 8","true","84.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","18","20","9","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/citizen_graves/recommended/55150/","citizen_graves","Citizen Graves","http://steamcommunity.com/id/citizen_graves/","425 products in account","WARHAMMER 40.000: SPACE MARINE™ is a Third Person Shooter from Relic Entertainment (the game-development studio responsible for the classic Space-RTS HOMEWORLD, as well as renowned RTS-series' COMPANY OF HEROES and WH40K: DAWN OF WAR) and was published in 2011 by the now-defunct THQ Inc.\nThe game is based on the Table-Top tactical wargame WARHAMMER 40.000 (WH40K) by Games Workshop and features:\n\nA full-fledged SINGLE PLAYER STORY-MODE that will take between 6 - 10 hours to finish (depending on difficulty)\n\nA tacked-on but insanely addictive COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER MODE (with way too few maps or game-modes; also the worst internet-connection system for mp-games ever conceived by humans: Peer-to-Peer connection. Like, seriously, Relic, FFS!!!)\n\nAnd an even more tacked-on but also insanely fun 4 PLAYER CO-OP MODE (which suffers from the fact that it uses options and systems from the competitive mp-mode)\n\n\n\nSTORY & GAMEPLAY:\n\nIt is the grimdark future of space and there is only war, and as you may or may not know, war never changes.\nWhat this means is that everything absolutely sucks for everyone, especially if you are a human worker or a human soldier amongst the billions upon billions of other, unimportant human beings on one of the many planets belonging to the Imperium of Man.\n\nOne such place is the forge-world Graia and it's being attacked by an overwhelming planetary invasion force of the ORKS, one of the many weird, disgusting and/or brutal Xenos-races threatening the Imperium, who like nothing more than to crush your skull and paint their cars red with your blood to make them go faster (obviously).\n\nThere are, however, some people in the future of space who don't think that everything sucks!\n\nThese people are, of course, the Space Marines™, who are the very best of the best in the galaxy and have been genetically modified and outfitted to deal with the absolute worst that the future, space and beyond have to offer.\nSpace Marines™ enjoy nothing more than fighting (and eventually dying) for the God-Emperor of Mankind. And when they are not fighting or dying they are usually found praying to the Emperor for more fighting and the honour of dying a glorious death during fighting.\n\n\nSo now imagine an 8-foot tall, towering half-god encased in mighty, shiny power-armor, equiped with an assault rifle that shoots grenades in one hand, a chainsaw in the shape of a sword in the other, wearing a helmet that looks more badass than that of Darth Vader™ and implanted with, among other things, a second heart to withstand the most brutal of heartbreaks (and I don't mean the kind that you and I go through when Megan Fox or Ryan Gosling never answer our phone calls) and you get an idea of what it is to be one of the Emperor's finest.\n\nActually, stop imagining things and start playing this game because, quite frankly, there is nothing quite like it.\n\nThis isn't Gears of War™, where you cower behind chest-high walls, sucking your thumb until your health regenerates and then sometimes take pot-shots against ugly-looking freaks.\nNo, here you charge into a horde of said freaks and smash their heads in to regenerate your health back (your shield will refill on its own, though, no smashing and bashing required).\n\nUse a variety of ranged weaponry, such as your trusty Bolter, plasma weapons, grenades or sniper rifles and shotguns that shoot flames instead of bullets, as well as various melee weapons, such as the iconic Chainsword, the Power Axe and the epic Thunder-Hammer (long, strong and throbbing with energy) to vanquish countless waves of cartoonishly villanous beasts and demons.\n\nPlease the God-Emperor by bringing death to his enemies and he will refill your FURY, granting you a temporary boost to your awesomeness with more head-smashing power for melee attacks and bullet-time™ for shooty attacks.\n\nEnjoy fluid and seamless combat that allows you to run into a group of enemies, shoulder-barge the lot of them, slap one, stomp another, then grab another one, cut him into pieces and then spray the rest of them with bolter-rounds until they explode into chunky bits, all in the matter of seconds and through the press of a few buttons/keys.\n\n\nThe gameplay is solid, though repetitive; you'll spend hours upon hours fighting against the hordes of the Ork race, which, even though you continuously acquire new gear throughout the course of the campaign, can get tiring after an hour or two of playtime. This is especially true if brown, grey and more brown corridors and levels bore you quickly.\nOn the other hand, to mix things up you get to use a jetpack (or jump-pack) from time to time, allowing you to take to the skies and crush your enemies from above. And we all know that jetpacks make everything better in video-games, don't we?\n\nAnyway, eventually you will get to fight some other enemies later on, but for most of the game it's Orks, Orks, Orks, big Orks, small Orks, bigger Orks, even BIGGER Orks and then more Orks.\n\nThe story is serviceable and nothing ground-breaking (well, this isn't exactly Shakespeare: The Video-Game here), just your typical WH40K-fare. However, the voice-acting is solid enough, with a strong central performance by british actor Mark Strong (which you may or may not remember from films such as "Zero Dark Thirty" or the first "K i c k - A s s").\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nEven though it is repetitive & brown I still I love this game more than any of the other repetitive & brown games that I have played within the last 4 - 5 years, simply for the fact that this game is unique in the way combat works; you feel like a walking tank and unstoppable when you cut through tons of enemies like a hot knife through kittens....er...I mean butter, yes....butter.\n\nThough, the threat of death is always present and you can easily lose yourself in the adreanline rush of power-tripping, only to let your guard down and allow enemies to surround you, swarm you and then kill you in the matter of seconds.\nYou have to be mindful of your attackers, of your surroundings and you have to use everything to your advantage. Use your entire arsenal against your foes, think tactically, be mobile and never forget   to user cover - but without having to sit behind it like a little girl crying for her dead kittens...\n\n..errr...\n\n\nThis is a flawed little gem of a game, but one that is definitely worth the price of admission.\n\nSeriously, if this game happens to be on sale, like, right now then just buy the bloody thing! Why are you even wasting time reading reviews when you could be single-handedly performing awesome bloody grimdark-genocide already?\n\nI would whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action-games, especially players of classic shooters such as DooM, Quake, Blood, etc. or any other game that focuses more on mobility and diverse weaponry rather than staying stationary behind walls with marginaly different assault rifles.\nAnd while some hardcore WH40K-fans may cringe at some of the design choices in the game (because some things in this game do not conform to the established lore of the franchise) everyone should just take this game for what it is:\n\nA carnage-filled and action-packed power-fantasy (from an admittedly brown, bitter and boring-looking future).\n\n\n---\nA NOTICE ON THE DLC-PACKS:\n\nAll of the DLC-packs are for the MULTIPLAYER only! Thus it is not worth having the various (cosmetic!) DLC- armors and weapons if you're not absolutely into the online-portion of the game.\n\nThe gamebreaking bugs on the CHAOS DLC multiplayer-maps prevent them from being enjoyed by what's left of the community. You can still find people playing the Chaos Invasion map for the EXTERMINATUS CO-OP mode but you have to decide if that alone is worth paying full price.\n\nThe DREADNOUGHT DLC, on the other hand, is an additional VERSUS game-mode that, while awesome, generally just isn't being played.","October 15, 2014","true","280.3"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","31","43","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makeweight/recommended/55150/","makeweight","Mantissa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makeweight/","102 products in account","Literally the single best shooter I have ever played. The netcode is horrendous, and the game is Peer2Peer, resulting in a frankly hilarious amount of lag, but the lag compensation usually makes up for the massive lapses in connection that occur. There are also a few unbalanced weapons, which have a tendency to break the game if people use them en masse. The campaign doesn't tell much of a story, which is disappointing, but to be expected from a game where the focus is chainsword enemas. The leveling system is reminiscent (as in, a carbon copy of) the old Call of Duty games, which is aggravating because if you want to use a specific weapon you have to play for a significant period of time before you get it.\n\nBut aside from that the game is beautiful. The game plays like one would expect a Space Marine game to play; EVERYONE is overpowered! Assault/Raptor marines can traverse the entire map in a few short bursts from their jump packs, Tactical marines can level an entire room with some careful thinking and the right weapons, and Devestators can murderize anything that they can see in a matter of seconds. To this end, Space Marine is one of the few "Super Soldier" games that makes you feel like you are an actual Super Soldier. The combat is stellar, tactics and careful thinking pay greater dividends than being able to shoot well; this might be because everyone has a gigantic hitbox and the aim assist is practically palpable, but for me that's a good thing. Sneaking around your enemy and doing hit-and-run attacks are far more effective then just waltzing into a room and using your 10-years honed aiming skills to get 1337 360 headshots on everybody.\n\nOverall, this is a thinking man's shooter. I played it for about a week before I was able to pick that up, and realized that even with the most basic gear and perks (I still use the starting weapons), I could steamroll the entirety of the opposition with a few deft maneuvers. The campaign is more of an after-work/after-school thing, same goes for the Exterminatus gamemode; for those days when you just want to exert your views on religiously justified genocide. The multiplayer is the real gem with this game; a shooter where thinking is more important than skills.","November 29, 2013","true","116.7"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

The coolest thing is that you can customize your character, matching your Space Marine to your tastes.\n\nThe Adeptus Ministorum, the Adepta Sororitas and the Inquisition approve of this marvellous game.","April 14","true","27.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","13","13","3","0"

I can't stop slow-walking, just to listen to that steady clump-clump of my Marines' boots as he walks LOL! The power of the holy Bolter resonates beautifully, with amazing smoke trails off the shell. I do feel like I am firing a Godwin pattern Bolter. As with the proportions; I'd have liked the scale of MArine - Human a little bigger, but I am not disapointed :)\n\nThe background scenery is some of the most beautiful I have seen in a shooter. Grand towers and ornamented architecture that soar high into the Industrial World's air, the sunset and fluffy clouds are very screenshot-worthy. The navigable scenery is very clumpy and I can tell I am playing a console game. No havoc engine destruction, no craters that remain...a PC could handle that, but a console cannot, so I do not like the reminders that I am having to compromise on gameplay yet still pay full price. It does get repetetive. I find myself having to constantly re-try checkpoints for some silly bit that I just can't get past - HOWEVER, after practice, you will find yourself succeeding.\n\nThe main problem I find is the complicated controls. For a start, I cannot re-bind them. Secondly, to perform certain manouvers like simply throwing a grenade, you HAVE to read the rapidly appearing and disapearing prompt FIRST TIME, or else you have to play 'let's hit every key till we get it' game as there is NO controls menu (can you believe that???) for anything other than firing the gun and swinging the smashy smashy.\n\nFurthermore issues I have with the controls is that to perform tekken-style moves in order to regain your health is probably THE most annoying feature of this game. I want to conduct myself as a soldier, on a PC, not a tekken or streetfighter gamer on a console. This does smack of streets of rage in places I'll warn you now. But there is something slightly satisfying about taking down 6 orcs in one slash of my Chain Sword. Mounted weapons do not respond to the 'E' interaction move which I actually class as an in-game bug, (you'll see what I mean). However there is the option to tear the mounted heavy Bolter OFF it's mount! >:D This does not mean that you have acquired a new heavy weapon however, as he drops it after about 60 seconds or so. So make the most of them :) The inventory menu is based on 4 slots ONLY, whereby a more powerful weapon type REPLACES YOUR OLD ONE - which I found very upsetting, I cried.\n\nAgain, with all linear shooters, this game can be completed in an afternoon <sigh> but I think you all have become accustomed to that eh? My advice, buy this in a sale. It is good fun, and if you want your Ultramarines brought to life somewhat beautifully, it's worth it for that alone :)\n\nIf it wasn't for the horrible consolitis that this game suffers from, I'd give it 7/10 but it's gonna have to be a stingy 6/10.","April 6, 2014","true","3.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/55150/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","The Imperial Forge World Graia is under heavy attack by Orks. Since Graia is a place where War Titans are constructed it has to be defended at any cost. Unfortunately there is no army close enough to react in time, so a part of the Ultramarine's 2nd company which happens to be closer to Graia is sent there. The Ultramarine's Captain Titus is the protagonist of the game. He and two other Marines - Leandros and Veteran Sergeant Sidonus - barely make it to the surface of Graia since the Orks are already controlling the planet's airspace. Soon Titus finds out that Graia holds something even more valuable than War Titans and that something even more dangerous than Orks is at work here.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a third person action game. It cannot really be called a third person shooter because melee combat is an integral part of the game. Titus has access to various melee and ranged weapons. He starts out with a knife, a bolt pistol and a bolter. Later, more weapons can be found. The pistol and the bolter are not swap-able, they are however later changed into a plasma pistol and a kraken bolter. Titus can equip two more ranged weapons and one melee weapon at a time. Those can be swapped out for other weapons freely. Additionally Titus can have up to five grenades with him. Space Marine flips turret sections the bird. Yes, there are mounted guns that you can use from time to time. But you can just rip those out and walk around with them. There are also some sections in which Titus uses a jump pack. While using one of those he is restricted to melee weapons, pistol and bolter.\n\nCombat in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is extremely visceral and satisfying. All of the weapons feel powerful. One thing the game gets extremely right is conveying what a Space Marine actually is. He is not just a heavily armored soldier. He is a genetically enhanced super soldier carrying weapons that normal people would not even be able to use effectively. A Space Marine's armor is pretty much the finest one humanity is able to craft and only works because of the servos inside of it. The size difference between the Space Marines and the soldiers of the Imperial Guard is highly noticeable. Also you can kill weaker enemies by simply dashing into them. Titus' armor regenerates after not being hit for a few moments. Health however is replenished by executing stunned enemies. Some weaker enemies can be executed right away without even hitting them first, further conveying the actual power of a Space Marine. This is the single thing the game does best in my opinion: making you actually feel like a Space Marine.\n\nThe single player campaign is fairly enjoyable. It can drag a little in the middle part but it's not that bad. The only real gripe I have with the game is the final boss battle. In my opinion it is quite lazy and uninspired. It is also an unnecessary late difficulty spike since there is only one autosave during the whole fight as opposed to the other boss battle where there were regular autosaves between phases. Other than that the campaign is really fun.\n\nThe multiplayer is surprisingly well done. It features classic modes such as team deathmatch and capture the flag as well as exterminatus that is basically a horde mode. Players play either as Space Marines or Chaos Space Marines and can choose from three classes: Tactical, Devastator (Havoc) and Assault (Raptor). Tactical Marines are the most versatile character and can equip a variety of different weapons. Devastator Marines carry the heaviest ranged weapons but are the least mobile class. Assault Marines are equipped with jump packs and focus heavily on melee weapons. Players unlock more weapons and equipment to choose from as they gain levels. Multiple loadouts can be saved for quick access. Also, every character can have two different perks in his loadout. Actually you unlock the second perk slot at level 15 but it does not take long to get there. Different perks and armor parts are unlocked via challenges that work pretty much like achievements. Armor is just for the looks, so players can pick whatever they like best. There are several armor sets but you can also choose to mix and match parts of them together to your liking. It can take a while to unlock the perks you want but that is partially negated by the ability to copy the loadout of the person who killed you instead of taking your normal loadout on respawn. The only shortcoming of the multiplayer is that it is peer2peer based and therefore can be laggy depending on who is the host.\n\nLong story short, Warhammer 40,000 is a really enjoyable game that is pretty much a must-have for warhammer fans but also worth a look for everybody who likes action games.\n\nMore reviews here","August 19, 2014","true","42.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

The story within the campaign is decent as is the voice acting and soundtrack, and there a lots of nice little touches within the game such as even the random battlefield objects such as ammunition boxes being actual games workshop models in the present - something i thought was a cool little feature.\n\nCharacter development is interesting; which is why we all hate Leandros and love Sidonus/Titus.. and there are some highly unexpected plot twists, ones that you wouldn't normally suspect from warhammer! Even the warboss Grimskull is fricking awesome, likewise with the chaos lord Nemeroth.\n\nThe bolter was done so extremely well that it just has to be mentioned - a doof-cannon of explosive destruction with a realistic rate of fire for such a large shell being loaded automatically and the chainsword is just as satisfying as you "vroom" your way through orks and chaos. In fact the entirety of the sound design is top notch, such as the heavy stomping of casual marine steps and the general atmospheric sounds.\n\nHowever, despite these gems within the game it does possess some things i found to be issues...\n\n- Now, while the combat in this game is rather highly acclaimed, it does not have a parry button; the only way to stop your opponent's spamfest of attacks is to stun them. This is rather...weird... as in multiplayer it's basically just two marines constantly shanking eachother and then throwing in the odd backhand to knock them back for a moment. This results in no skill needed to effectively melee..at all. It's just spam the attack button.\n\n- The game isn't too accurate to lore either. In saying that it's not exactly butchering it though. For example Lascannons only instand kill marines on headshots. If it was more accurate to the lore it would kill a marine outright. As would the plasma cannon...and melta...\n\n- THQ no longer exists and SEGA isn't doing much, so no updates apparently to fix any bugs/issues (despite myself not actually discovering any bugs but anyway)\n\n- DLC has segmented the already splintered online playerbase somewhat\n\n\nNow, don't let these negative words sway you from the game itself though, i found it to be quite fun, the campaign is of a suitably long length and remains fun if you play it in bursts of an hour or so, the combat is oh so much fun and last but not least...it's warhammer! What isn't to love in the grim darkness of the far future!?\n\n"SPESS MAREEN, WAZ DAT SUPPOZED TAH HERT?"","September 19, 2015","true","161.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","10","11","4","0"

Boy were my expectations low (what with Relic being sold) and the poor general sales of this contributing to Relic's downfall.\n\nI was surprised and delighted, and have never been more flipped when trying something new. Relic really got this spot-on. This is a way better W40K game than many others that have come before it. This is really on par with the Dawn of War series in terms of the attention to detail. As a fully controller-supported, console-style game, this plays a very differently to Dawn of War, and is like a breath of fresh air on the PC. It is not a FPS and really does play mostly in third-person, but I like this, it allows you to see the detail and revel in the bloody destruction and orc blood splatters all over you. This is third-person done right, with an over the shoulder zoom for sniping play, so you can still pull off headshots before running in chainsaw-whirring. And it is that mish-mash that makes it damned good fun.\n\nThe online portion, while not well-populated on STEAM, is a sturdy, challenging defense against the hordes, and I hope more people buy this to help boost the multiplayer appeal of the game, which is surprisingly glorious havok.","May 13, 2015","true","3.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Hopefully Relic drew the conclusions may form another part of the game, which would be much longer and would give us a greater sense of freedom. Perhaps then we will see a real "game of the year".","February 25, 2015","true","15.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Smashing through the Orks is very enjoyable even though it can be a bit "samey". Even with you playing as the Ultramarines the game makes up for it by making Captain Titus a very cool character.\nThe multiplayer is also fantastic, but unfortunately it suffers from Peer2Peer connections resulting in lots of lag. This is a real shame, because with dedicated servers the potential would be reached.\nMost of the DLC is useless, even the map packs, this is because if you don't have a group setting up games for them you will never find a game. I say "useless", but the skins are good for Space Marine dressup.\nOverall its extremely worth it and it might just get you into Warhammer 40k if this is your first crusade.","June 14, 2015","true","26.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

However, this game, in my eyes, stands out a heavy cut above the rest as it showcases exactly what's wrong with the current trend in gaming. I could rag on it for some clipping issues and technical glitches, but then I would go back to reminding myself that this is a game so fun and over the top that the proper response to an enemy charging head-long at you is to charge right back at him and wrestle him down before decapitating him with your chain-sword to regain health. We need more games like this, badly, and that's not to mention things like the fact that the main character is actually a respectable and admirable human being as opposed to the scowling space marine of so many other shooters. A solid 8/10 just for the sheer amount of bloody awesome it manages to have, especially in a market flooded with cover-based shooters.","January 7, 2014","true","20.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/renkol123/recommended/55150/","renkol123","That Bearded Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/renkol123/","197 products in account","Space Marine is a third-person, over-the-shoulder shooter. You play as the Adeptus Astartes Ultramarines Captain, Titus. His mission is to save the planet by doing what no human could ever do: brutally murder Orks and Chaos forces by repeatedly shoving  a chainsword in various orifices. Is this game good? Definitely. Is it fun? Fantastically so!\n\nThe gameplay is your simple shooter affair: center the middle of your screen on something you want dead and pull the trigger to watch it be made so. Accompanying that is a wonderfully gory melee system using chainswords, power axes, and thunder hammers to wonderful effect. The bolter rounds feel like they punch the enemy and the melee weapons can send them careening across the map. The combat is most excellent and definitely worth the money for that, if you enjoy rampage.\n\nThe story is equally compelling. While it is set in a "parellel timeline" where Titus is captain of the second company as opposed to Cato Sicarius, it still feels just as real of a Warhammer story. Titus is strong, dutiful, and is more than ready to destory xenos and heretics in equal measure. He comes off as abrasive, but that only adds to his character as a soldier eager for battle. The other characters, however, are not so noteworthy. The game tries to make us like them, but none of them really hit home or even provide much more than expositional dialogue. The over-arching narrative was also quite excellent, but it did feel like it went on too long and one story was abandoned for another halfway through. I understand the reason, but it really felt hollow.\n\nNow, my biggest complaint is with the difficulty, namely that there isn't any. My first playthrough was on Hard, and I performed quite admirably. The few times I did die was do to my stupid mistakes rather than the game being difficult. For me, this felt too easy. Fun, but without enough challenge. For experienced shooter players, Hard difficulty should be an easy ride.\n\nI happily recommend this game to veterans and newcomers alike. The gameplay is easy to get used to and fun to play and the story is interesting and keeps moving forward, if slowly at times. The multiplayer will also provide hours of enjoyment either before or after the campaign. Now go purge some xenos filth in the name of the Emperor!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Do you like crushing your opponents?  The single player for Space Marine is a fun, short romp through the battlefield of the 40K universe fighting against orc and chaos factions.  Fun, short, and sets up well for a sequal that is unlikely to come.\n\nMultiplayer is balanced well between Chaos Marines and Space Marines.  You cannot choose which faction to play, but Chaos Marines are just a reskin of the Space Marines; so no big loss.  Weapons and equipment are identical.  There are a ton of unlocks for three different classes:  Assault, Jetpack, and Heavy.  There are many loadouts and weapons for each class, but most are locked behind an experience wall.\n\nBalance between new players and veterans is achieved by coping the loadout of the person who killed you.  If you died to a hammer-weilding jetpack player; choose to respawn with their loadout.  Died to a sniper?  Respawn with their loadout.\n\nThere are also cosmetic unlocks for different armor pieces (helmet, check, gloves, etc.) gained by playing that class or faction and earning specific achievements.\n\nOverall, Space Marine was fun in single and multiplayer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talvox/recommended/55150/","talvox","Talvox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talvox/","245 products in account","When I first heard about this game, I wanted it. I was finally getting an action game from Warhammer instead of a typical RTS that usually happens with Warhammer games. I bounced up and down in joy, I flew across the room and hit my face against a door. In happiness.\n\nBut anyways, I was a huge fan of the Warhammer games, and I wanted this game. I picked it up during the 2012 Christmas Sale, and haven't regretted it once. It's one of the few games where I go back and play it after finishing the game. I loved this game, so much. The gameplay involves you slicing orks, stomping a body and making it explode, removing limbs entirely, and just for lack of trying, you can blow their heads off. With a sword. It's one of the few games where it combines melee and ranged combat fairly seamlessly (There are a few holes here and there.), where it makes you feel like neither the melee or the ranged is overpowering the other. I played through the campaign, where I was expecting to just use melee, but that was not the case. I ended up using a variety of ranged weapons to get through the game.\n\nThe healing system is rather interesting for this game. You have shields that regenerate out of combat (Like in Halo, for lack of a better comparison.) but your health doesn't regen out of combat. You have to do special kill moves to regenerate health. These can include shoving a chainsword through an Ork's body then moving it upwards and removing pretty much their entire spinal cord. They can also include exploding an ork's face. With your foot. There are some things that could be changed though to make it a more enjoyable experience. For example, you regain the health after the kill move, and you can be killed during the animation. There's no way to cancel the move, but for the most part this doesn't get in the way too much.\n\nThis game really made me feel like I could take on an entire horde of Orks by myself and come out barely scratched. I also did that in the game. However, it has a checkpoint system that could be vastly improved. Or at least make cutscenese that you can skip. They stick a checkpoint before an unskippable cutscene then shove you into a fight you could die fairly quickly in, and you have to watch the cutscene again. That's one of the only design flaws.\n\nWhen I heard there weren't going to be anymore games after this, I was super bummed. I was hoping for Space Marine sequels even after THQ died. And then I read an article saying it had been canceled. Even if we didn't get any sequels, we got an amazing first game.\n\nIn short, I loved it. This is one of my most favorite games of all time.","January 10, 2014","true","37.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/55150/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a game that involves the Ultramarines, Orcs and Daemons. The overall of the storyline without spoilers is for Space Marine to take back the planet that the Orcs have conquered. This review is conducted in a manner where I have not played any Warhammer 40,000 games, and Space Marine is my first one, so I would not know if there is a continuing storyline. This review does not contain Multiplayer comments, only single player.\n\nCampaign: Space Marine includes a solid campaign. The campaign clocks in for me at 8.5 hours on "normal" difficulty. As stated without spoilers, the elements of the orcs, the ultra marines and eventually the daemons add a lot of twists to the storyline that make the game interesting. Throughout the campaign, you get that feeling that "oh wow, the game is about to finish and this is a great way to finish it", but it extends to another chapter, which is good, however whilst that happens a few times, it does drag. The ending was strong and gave me excitement for a new Warhammer, which most likely will not happen. The campaign involves sections that overwhelm the player (and you know, make the player respawn) and gives a strong surprise factor in certain scenarios.\n\nThe boss battles are cool due to the gameplay (more on that in a little bit) that may make boss battles repeatitve, but a fun experience.\n\nThe cutscenes in Space Marine are above-average to good. Some cutscenes intrigue me (especially the earlier campaign cutscenes due to seeing the environment in Space Marine), other cutscenes bore me as in my opinion, I got the same thought of "same old, same old". In saying that, some cutscenes are repeatitive and predictable. Another criticism of cutscenes is that it is disjointed. For example, before a cutscene, I am holding a Power Axe, the cutscene happens, I am holding a Chainsword. To add to this, the cutscene in a few particular scenes did not correlate with the gameplay at all. For example, in one cutscene I was beaten up (minor spoiler) and the cutscene finishes and it is like nothing happened, it was ridiculous and happened very occasionally in the campaign.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay in Space Marine is very good. Using Melee is basically hack and slash, which is very fun. The gun gameplay is pretty cool with the sounds, look and gunfights in the game, which I enjoy. Again, the main criticism of this section is that whilst hack and slash is fun, it gets dull further into the game. The involvement of jet packs added another layer to gameplay in this game, and created refreshment in the campaign.\n\nIn the final mission of the campaign, the gameplay involved was different than seen throughout the campaign, and I say it was actually very strong. Without spoilers, it involves flying and punching and I found this to be awesome, considering I don't play many games that have that sort of gameplay involved.\n\nNegative Comments: Space Marine contains quite a few bugs, some very visible, some not visible at all to some, but visible to I. The other negative comments have been explained above with the gameplay, cutscenes, and campaign.  Whilst the pros outweigh the cons in Space Marine, the cons impact the game more than expected.\n\nOverall: It is a very solid game, filled with bugs galore, but a fun experience. For I that was introduced to Warhammer 40,000 through Space Marine, I enjoyed a refresh from the typical FPS campaigns, but it is a genre I am not still not eager to play.\n\nMy friend purchased a Humble Bundle which included Warhammer series, and for Steam's price of $39.99, I personally would not recommend it. If I had to purchase this game again after playing it, I would not purchase it for higher than $29.99. I feel this is a fair price point because I have not checked out MP, and considering this game is four years old, no one most likely plays MP. I don't know about the modes so I cannot comment extensively, however older games I tend to purchase knowing I can only play the campaign, and don't have an overly interest in MP. If you play through the campaign on all difficulties, the player can probably get about 30+ hours out of this game. 7/10.\n\n\n\nUPDATE #1: I have just found out that there is two co-op modes in Multiplayer (one was patched in, other has to be purchased for $12.99) meaning with four people, you can probably get an extra few hours out of the game.\n\nAlso to mention, all DLC is multiplayer-based according to a forum post.\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/55150/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a third-person shooter set in the universe of Warhammer 40,000 that follows one captain of the Ultramarines, Titus, on his mission on the Forge World Graia, which is under heavy attack by a Ork horde seeking to posses the powerful weapons built in the planet's factories. Later in the game, Titus and his two accompanying Ultramarines, Sidonus and Leandros, must also face the threat of a Chaos Warband lead by a dangerous Chaos sorcerer named Nemeroth.\nThe main beef of Space Marine's gameplay is using the weapons you are given tocut through the hordes of enemies preventing you from advancing and then proceed in the levels. You are given both long ranged weapons (like pistols or sniper rifles) and close quarters tools (starting from a chainsaw and arriving at a huge electrified mallet): you must learn to switch between the two constantly, given you'll face various kinds of enemies (some of them dangerous on the long distances while others extremely weak if chopped down in close combat). Each weapon has different versions that are unlocked advancing in the game, each with its pros and cons.\nOn top of his health pool, Titus can take advantage of a recharging shield that can protect him against some of the enemy fire and a super mode of some sort: the mode is charged by dishing out damage and, whenever unleashed, allows you to recover health over time and aim at enemies in slow-motion. Finishing enemies when they are weak also allows you to boost your health.\nThe main campaign is extremely faithful to the Warhammer 40,000 universe, both in design of the environments and characters and the references made to the general lore of the series. It lasts for aboutsix or eight hours or so and, aside from fighting your way through Graia, you can find hidden servo-skulls bearing audio recordings that further expand the game's story. There are three different difficulties (easy, normal and hard), but I'd say that even the normal mode manages to be challenging enough.\nWarhammer 40,00: Space Marine also spots a rather interesting multiplayer mode. You can either play as a Space Marine or a Chaos Marine, and the game offers a customization menu that allows you to deeply personalize your marine (armor pieces, colours, insigna, ...). The multiplayer mode offers several game modes, the same you could expect into a big retail multiplayer shooter: capture the flag, capture the control point, ... The mode also features co-op missions. The player actually makes progress in multiplayer thanks to a level system, unlocking new armor pieces and/or weapons and perks as he/she gains more experience. As I'm writing this review and four years after the game's release, Space Marine's multiplayer is still really populated.\nWarhammer 40,000 Space Marine, along with the Dawn of War series, is a great example about how a complex series like Warhammer 40,000 can be boiled down in a rather charming game capable of offering a great time both to the fans of the series and newcommers just wanting to enjoy some good third-person shooting action","May 11, 2015","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I haven't played a 3D shooter in 16 years because the genre became so stale.  But, I love the 40k universe so I thought I would try this title.  normally I play MOBAs and RPGs.\nTLDR - you will have jaw dropping moments throughout the course of this game.\nSpace Marine has -\n1. epic space marine combat you might envision from the books.  full on, hard core, kick butt action.\n2. Titans.  yes.  there is a titan in the game and I wont spoil anything.  it was cool.  I want more titan action though if they have ever make space marine 2.\n3.  Holy crap... you are a gunner on a storm bird in one mission, it was epic.\n4. good warhammer 40k story line.  inquisition, imperial army, responding to a distress call from a hive world invaded by orcs.  Things get dark and the plot thickens.\n5. totally awesome, mind blowingly huge visuals you probably envision in the 40k universe.  the game puts you right into them.  Huge manufactorem, drop pods screaming out of the sky, chain swords, bolters, las rifles, melta guns\n6. I want more space marine games.  too bad the maker went bankrupt.  and too bad I just found this game now.\n\ncons:\nWould like better script and voice acting in the future.  Main characters were ok.  leandros... not good.\n\nrecommendations if the game makers ever read this review.  why not borrow a script author from the horus heresy, like dan abnett?  I think there are people dying for good story content.  same reason game of thrones TV show is successful.  it is rich in content and story with a great cast.","May 1","true","8.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well then you'll like this, provided you don't want the neon palette. This is the vision of a future where humanity is past its' prime and is trying to fend off the slow decay of time; all while fending off hordes of aliens and daemons. The grimness of this universe is a refreshing twist, even after several decades as a series.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine puts you in the boots and bulky armour of one of the Imperiums' chapters of Space Marines. If you like sitting behind a wall and occasionally firing over the wall, then just stop there. In this game, there ARE no walls (metaphorically speaking of course)! YOU are the wall. You are a shield for the weak and a sword to be swung by the powers that be. As much as the game preaches that life is the Emperors' currency; you are a sturdy block of gold, in a world populated by pennies and pound coins. So what makes you so valuable, apart from the shiny aspect of your nature?\n\nYou are a block of Gold. Let's do a comparison. I want you to drop a penny onto your fingers while they are on a desk. Didn't hurt, did it? Now; drop a big block of Gold. If you actually did, I applaud your delusion of invulnerability, but I'm not going to kiss your boo-boo better. If you didn't; you're smarter than the person asking me to kiss the boo-boo. You see, logical thought dictates that there is a big difference in the damage a penny and a Gold Brick can do. You play the heavier of the two objects; that most delightful bringer of death. You are a big stompy thundering cannon comprised of flesh and muscle, located securely behind an energy shield and a hell of alot of metal. You don't fire a little 9mm pistol as you do in so many other titles. With your bulkier stature, you should be able to wield more mighty weapons and this game will allow you. Ever wondered what happens when a rocket propelled explosive shell (with a diameter of nearly an inch) comes into contact with the face of a 6 foot Ork, armed with naught but a club and a suicidal disregard for the laws of physics and mortality? If you answered "red?" then the klaxons in your room, set to ring with the sounds of victory when you are correct (at least if you're as egocentric as I) should be deafening you in reward for your foresight.\n\nIn a world full of games with lots of brown or orange; this game decides that red is still a viable colour. VERY viable. In fact, so viable that often times you will encounter pools of red where once a green enemy stood. If you are discouraged by blood, this game isn't for you. If you like blood, this game delivers it in such vast amounts that even the least sadomasochistic of us would still require the unbuttoning of the jeans to alleviate the tightness the combat produces. While I recommend this game to women as well, this game has an undeniable reek of man about it. I would be surprised if the word "testosterone" was not included once in every five lines of code written for the engine. While there is a brilliant plot behind the title, it isn't one that I'd recommend you buy the game for. The plot isn't what you want in a game, is it? Plot is a nice addition but gameplay is what differentiates a game from a movie or book and this is a shining example of that ideology. You fire rocket propelled shells from a fully automatic death-cannon; when you aren't lobbing balls of corrosive plasma into the faces of a tiny little green fellow. But range is only a part of the game. To regenerate health, you are not allowed to cower. Your health is tied to your efficiency in combat, as it drops when your shield is depleted and raises when you execute an enemy in close combat. To replenish your red goo, you need to turn your foes into red goo, and presumably the splat perks your character up enough to make him healthy again. Still makes more sense than being eaten by a dog in an open world game and healing up by pulling a bullet out of your left arm. It sounds better too. There is a definite booming sound behind your guns and your mighty melee weapons sound vastly different when they smash into metal in comparison to tearing through flesh. Your chainsword revs pleasurably as you swing it and your heavy bolters sound exactly as the name makes you believe. They sound heavy, as if they were firing bolts.\n\nNow let us discuss multiplayer. Six big stompy fellows clash against six big stompy fellows and there are three types of big stompy fellow you can be. You can be a tactical marine, who lumbers across the battlefield with some medium power ranged weapons. The assault marines jet around the battlefield with jump packs, slamming with a mighty force into the ground before spinning their melee weapons viciously to rend the flesh of all who oppose them. If you are more of a heavy fellow, the Devastators will fit you perfectly. Armed with the biggest weapons of all three, they stomp and wield death at range. They are so heavily equipped that instead of shoulder charging an enemy to interrupt the swing of their sword; they kick them. Even as you walk, the camera shakes to give you the true sense that you are heavy, gifted the power of a ton of metal and muscle. The ground never seems to sit still when you introduce twelve armoured Goliaths upon a map.\n\nThis is a game of David versus Goliath; except this time, you play Goliath and logic wins over storybook morality. Big stompy fellows don't get stopped by a stone, they club the sling wielder into the ground with fist and foot.","December 18, 2014","true","37.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Though, seriously, I am friggin' sick of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ultramarines...\n\nBeyond that, the story is forgettable and the characters flat. Single Player doesn't really have much to offer aside from the beauty of WH40k rendered with loving detail. The grandness of the universe is well represented; everything is huge, and even the towering Astartes feel small.\n\nThe multiplayer, both cooperative and adversarial, is much more interesting than the SP.\nExterminatus, though very flawed, is a fun take on Wave Survival/"Horde Mode". With more polish and care, it coud have stolen the show, but as is, it remains obviously what it is: a tacked on extra.\nVersus, on the other hand, it extremely fun. Yes, Peer 2 Peer across oceans is lagtastic. Yes, it could use some balance. Yes, the maps are stale after 2 years. But it's still the most fun I have in gaming, and it's the only game that lets me play as the Adeptus Astartes. I can't help but love it.\n\nIn all, the game is a wonderful first step for Relic into the Third Person Shooter genre, and is amazing for the studio's first ever action game, but whether or not they will continue this trend under SEGA remains to be seen...\n\nIt should be noted that the animation quality in Space Marine is top notch, AAA, 5 star, all that and bag of chips.

But before you become too  judgemental about my negetive recommendation, I suggest you read it first. After my game lagged to  the point of crashing to desktop, I felt it was finally time I gave my word on this game.\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Space Marine is a fun little hack n' slash style action game game which throws you  into the grim-dark world of Warhammer where you play as Captain Titus of the Ultramarines. The story  is about as good as you can expect for a Warhammer game with pretty decent gameplay for it being a  transition from Relic's normally RTS style play to a third-person shooter.\n\nThe campaign isn't terribly long but not terribly short either, with unlocks for the Captain as you  go. While it could have been done better, I suppose I can't complain about what we got. After your  7-8 (at most) hour story is over, you'll pretty much be done with the game which leaves you with  either completeing the game again on a higher difficulty if you haven't already. Or playing one of  the two multiplayer modes available to you. With a good to mediocre suggestion for the story thus  far, I'm sure you can see where this is going...\n\nThe EXTERMINATUS mode allows you and three other space marines to band together and fight the green  skin menace in a co-op mode where you'll be flung into an arena where you must fight through five  ways and continue to the next zone, confronting more and more difficult enemies as you go. I highly  recommend playing this with friends, as the public matches are completely random with who you get  paired with, often matching you with new or inept players or outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You'll usually know  what you're in for when people refuse to help you, shoot at you whenever there's a lull in the  fighting, or swipe ammo from out beneath your feet. Which leads me to the next portion.\n\nMultiplayer. Multiplayer can be fun. It can be frustrating. Too often it's frustrating. The  aforementioned people can be found most commonly here. I've yet to play a multiplayer game with a  'good' community, so I can't really hold this against Space Marine alone. Expect lots of weapon/perk  abuse with cookie-cutter loadouts and over-powered weapons with little hint to any actual game  balance to be found. Assault marines will darken the skies and tacticals will roll about the  landscapes, burning away everything with the one-hit wonder meltagun. Unless you plan on fighting  fire with fire, I suggest avoiding multiplayer. Feeling more reminiscent of Call of Duty, this  gamemode feels very 'tacked on at the last minute' than anything else in the game and offers little to  nothing new to the rest of the game apart from the ridiculous armory challenges which grant you perk  and armor unlocks for customizing your multiplayer character but unless you plan on grinding for a  very long time, they aren't something you can achieve in the short-term.\n\nLatency... I've played good games. I've played bad games. I've played games with amazing  connections, and I've played games with bad connections. And then... I've played Space Marine...  Never in my life have I played a game with such pathetic connection ability, with frequent lag and  constant 'host migrations' (Which if you plan on playing multiplayer, be prepared to view this  screen: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=279705697 A. Lot.) the lack of  dedicated servers and actual lobby browsing leaving you to the mercy of the the dice roll on whether  or not you get a good server from the two or three that ever seem available grows very tiresome very  quickly. This is the number one thing that suggests to me that multiplayer was just an afterthought  once the game was made.\n\nOverall, I would indeed Recommend Space Marine to my friends who were interested or to any  Warhammer fan, if not for the story mode alone and possible co-op. Even non-fans looking for a fun  hack n' slash could possibly enjoy it. Though I leave with an actual POSITIVE recommendation, I  won't for the $30.00 dollar price tag this game sports. While fun, the shoddy multyplayer and lack  of being able to unlock things through exterminatus mode leaving you with a short, and underwhelming  campaign and ending leaves me wondering why this game is still so pricey. If you must buy it. Please  wait for a sale. $10-$15 dollars at most.\n\nTL;DR: 6/10 - There's better, cheaper games out there, should prolly go play them insted.","July 1, 2014","false","169.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

They have mostly captured what I conceive a Space Marine to be, which is a ♥♥♥♥ing mega tank that can run around exploding everything with its hands, feet, guns, knives, swords, chainswords, powerswords, poweraxes, grenades, and mouth and a variety of body parts.\n\nSpace Marines will mother♥♥♥♥ing KILL you and then eat your face to ascertain how much badonk your mom's butt has, using their flesh memory powers.\n\nThe single player campaign has you as an Ultramarine who doesn't really strike me as a standard ultramarine, because he's kind of Khorny and that's just weird. However, you bulldoze your way through hordes of Orcs and later Daemons to the end, which is a visceral experience. The feedback is pretty good as you can tell how powerful this guy is. The story is a tried and true Good Guys get duped but overcome everything in the end type thing.\n\nTHe multiplayer is another animal entirely, you play as either a Space Marine or Chaos Space Marine in several modes which are all fun. The best part is unlocking new armor pieces to customize your Space Explosion Dude so he can look like whatever mary-sue chapter you want. The worst part is the matchmaking which isn't region locked, so you may very well end up getting teamed up with some dude from Tokyo who is hosting the match and you get terrible lag. Also some of the weapon augments give a slightly unfair advantage and they all take some sort of skill in order to unlock.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that hardly anyone is playing anymore and that SUCKS A ♥♥♥♥. Please play this game, I'd like to try out the DLC I purchased that I can't play since no one that plays has it or just doesn't start matches in it.

A blast to play with friends, if a bit anemic to play alone. Still active enough to have games running most of the time. Armor customization is detailed, even if the colors do not provide the large RGB spectrum like Dawn of War. But the amount of armor pieces, patterns and color combinations means that you will be hard pressed to create the same thing as another player unless you do it on purpose. Though not free of flaws, many of the early ones have long since been ironed out.\n\n\nCons:\n\nA play-once campaign, with no supporting DLC to keep you going back, trains new players the wrong way for PvP. Anemic DLC adds very little to the game other than a small spattering of maps, unplayed modes, and an expensive lineup of unique armor that cannot be completely picked apart for custom outfits. P2P connectivity provides the constant, irritating spectre of lag and host switching. The graphics were already pushing middle-aged when it came out, but the animation and design made up for that. Nowadays, you'll either not mind or it'll drive you bonkers.\n\nThe game's been out long enough that it has some fairly entrenched players that can be an overwhelming challenge to newcomers. And with obsessive veterans comes the abusive verbal treatment seen in many communities that have been destroyed by it.\n\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nPeople disagree on the weapon balance.

While most of the players are amiable, there are a few grudge-bearing sour grape obsessives who will spend hours striving to verbally troll you out of an enjoyable evening. Like in most other online games. But since there isn't really any community control, simply block or don't respond.\n\nThe game does have cheaters, but they are very rarely encountered. If it isn't something lag-borne like being shot through a wall, and is instead obvious like plasma cannon teleporting to high ledges to release charged shots, then teleporting back to safety, then you'll know for sure.\n\nAnd since this game now has defunct support, there is very little chance we'll see any more content for it, or even a sequel.\n\nMy opinion's jumped around on this thing like a flea on hot coals.

Right now.\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a third person action game set in the mythical Warhammer universe; the player takes control of Titus, a Space Marine tasked with assisting in the eradication of an Ork invasion on an Imperial Forge world. Chaos quickly ensues, the situation grows out of control, and Titus soon realises there are far worse enemies than Orks on the planet.\nThe gameplay in this game is freakin' awesome. You can use a variety of guns, such as bolt pistols, heavy bolters, plasma weapons and other assorted ranged weapons; all of these weapons feel satisfying and lethal, and they all sound and feel the way they should. Melee weapons such as chainswords, hammers, and axes are made available, and this feels undeniably fun; you can wade into massive hordes of enemies and slash your way through gallons of blood and gore using nothing but your melee weapon. You can also replenish your health by executing enemies, which offers you a brutal and bloody finishing move that plays on screen while your health bar refills. It's safe to say that the combat in this game is highly enjoyable, and you'd be nuts to not enjoy yourself.\nHowever, many of the environments look very similar and you'll find yourself getting a little tired with the repetitious level design as the game progresses. The game really shines when it plunges you into massive areas and removes all training wheels and allows you to fully exploit the various aspects of combat the game has to offer.\nVisually, the game is quite stunning. The level of detail and graphical polish is fully faithful to the Warhammer universe, and the truly epic moments of this game (such as standing on the shoulders of a Titan) look truly amazing with this games' graphical capability.\nSince the campaign is fairly short, it's good that the developers included a multiplayer mode to plunge into after completion of the main game. There are a variety of game modes, all of which are a lot of fun, and the customisation for your online soldier is also quite solid. A lot of effort has been put into crafting a multiplayer mode that'll keep you going for quite some time. However, servers are rather dodgy and you'll find yourself dropping out of games more often than you'd like.\nOverall, this is a bloody awesome game, and I recommend it highly. It's a lot of fun, and I can't describe how much sheer fun I had with this! 9 / 10\n","January 23, 2014","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Those are a few things to expect when playing 40k Space Marine. You play as Titus captain of the Ultramarines, and wow your whole team just look so badass. You have giant shoulder pads with skulls on them, you rip guys apart to get health back, you don't use cover because ♥♥♥♥ that and your dude just looks even cooler by the end of the game.\nThe game starts off with you flying over this planet getting ready to land. When you spot Ork airships flying by. Then Captain Titus (you) makes the call and says were jumping, so that we can take out those airships. You do and you blow them up and of course you get separated form your squad. You then go out to find them and last survivors. The story defiantly takes a turn that I didn't really see coming, and it was a good one it changes up the story and the gameplay.\nFor the most part of the game it just has you ripping through guy and tearing them apart weather it be with your Chainsword or with your guns, and it feels like they have mastered ripping guys apart because they just blow up in to the mist of red when you shoot them our when you gut them in half with your sword.  Just going into a group of 100 Orks and just coming out the other end covered in blood feels amazing, looks so cool,and is so much fun.\nThe story mode will take you about 8 to 10 hours to beat if you play it on normal. It feeds you new stuff pretty frequently so it feels a little different now that you have this new gun or this new melee weapon, it never gets dull I'll just say that.\nNow on to the multiplayer, which has variety of different modes 2 competitive, deathmatch and a point capture mode, then it also has a horde mode with waves of enemies and different objectives. It is class based you have a melee, a stationary gunner guy, and just you all around gun guy. It plays pretty well and has the call of duty carrot on a stick aspect of unlocking stuff as you progress but not only do you unlock weapons and perks but you also unlock a bunch of cosmetic items through achievements and leveling up, which personally I spent a lot of time just dressing up both my dudes. One of the main issues I had with it was that in the beginning it felt like I was really at a disadvantage, because it was just getting killed instantly in some cases. That might turn some players off but stick with it you unlock a lot of cool stuff from new stuff like a jetpack to all the guns you had access to in the campaign.\nThe game is a great package with a satisfying campaign, some great multiplayer fun. It's centrally not perfect though, there's not that many different weapons, it can get dull and feel like your just doing the same thing over and over again, but those points are few and far between.","June 19, 2014","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Weighing the pros and cons together:\n\n\n\n7/10\n\n\n\nI've played for 1,200 hours. Of course I recommend it, with the understanding that the cons are taken into consideration before purchasing.","October 7, 2012","true","576.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They have mostly captured what I conceive a Space Marine to be, which is a ♥♥♥♥ing mega tank that can run around exploding everything with its hands, feet, guns, knives, swords, chainswords, powerswords, poweraxes, grenades, and mouth and a variety of body parts.\n\nSpace Marines will mother♥♥♥♥ing KILL you and then eat your face to ascertain how much badonk your mom's butt has, using their flesh memory powers.\n\nThe single player campaign has you as an Ultramarine who doesn't really strike me as a standard ultramarine, because he's kind of Khorny and that's just weird. However, you bulldoze your way through hordes of Orcs and later Daemons to the end, which is a visceral experience. The feedback is pretty good as you can tell how powerful this guy is. The story is a tried and true Good Guys get duped but overcome everything in the end type thing.\n\nTHe multiplayer is another animal entirely, you play as either a Space Marine or Chaos Space Marine in several modes which are all fun. The best part is unlocking new armor pieces to customize your Space Explosion Dude so he can look like whatever mary-sue chapter you want. The worst part is the matchmaking which isn't region locked, so you may very well end up getting teamed up with some dude from Tokyo who is hosting the match and you get terrible lag. Also some of the weapon augments give a slightly unfair advantage and they all take some sort of skill in order to unlock.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that hardly anyone is playing anymore and that SUCKS A ♥♥♥♥. Please play this game, I'd like to try out the DLC I purchased that I can't play since no one that plays has it or just doesn't start matches in it. You can be a ♥♥♥♥ing DREADNOUGHT that crushes and splatters dudes.

Why haven't you gotten this? Have you at least tried out the demo? No? *Smacks you upside the head* Go try it! It's a gore filled, bloody as Hell (No, wait, it's Orks. But oh, how they bleed.), and it's a VERY simple control system that'll have you taking on Hordes of Orks in maybe a minute after the start.\n\nAnd speaking from my experience on the 360 version, the Online is INCREDIBLY fun (Though I was limited due to buying the game used), and, believe it or not, I could find people. Yes. Actual people. In ALL the game modes I had. Exterminatus, Versus, the likes. Even though I was level 5 most of the time, I was doing a large amount of work for my team, keeping them well placed. I can only wonder what I would've been like at a higher level, with more weapons... <3\n\nAnd then I get to the campaign. It's a camping trip gone astra- And I'm going to stop there. No, it's a typical Warhammer 40,000 story. Orks, suddenly, *Censored*. Whoah. Since I'm still new to the series, it caught me off guard, but, hey. It's still well done. The final fight is a gory mess of blood and fun and gore. But that final game movie, it's a painful one. The people in Warhammer 40,000, especially Space Marines, are ♥♥♥ holes. No bars hold, ♥♥♥ holes. GLORIFIED ♥♥♥ holes, them Space Marines are. But somehow, Relic has, once again, created a sort of relate-able glorified ♥♥♥ hole who has a heart of light (Or so we may think, depending on how you take the game.), and is a good character for the 40,000 universe. Upon arriving to the first Guardsmen outpost, he tells the lead Guardsman there that they saved themselves, and told him to rise. Captain Titus seems to treat Guardsmen as a form of little brother. It's very amusing to me.\n\nAnd oh my Emperor, the music. The music is very much, to me, the highlight of Space Marine. It's an absolute blast to listen to, and every second of it sends chills down my spine. It's like listening to Dawn of War II's "The Green Horde Rises" in 19 songs, ESPECIALLY "A Hero's Legacy". Holy crap (That plays during the end video, before the credits).\n\nOver all? I'd recommend getting it while on sale, but get it. It may not be your cup of tea, but try the Demo out. The two levels included (Well, level and a half because of the SHEER size of the Jump pack mission in game) are essentially copied and pasted out of the game itself. They give you a basic understanding of how the game works, and plenty of ways to test your skill.","April 2, 2013","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","6"

I played this a lot on a coworker friends console but wanted it for myself on Steam. Great combat, graphics, effects, sounds, music, it has it all. I am not a fan of the Warhammer rts games but still this game is a blast.\n\nGood:\nThe game runs flawlessly, never dropping under 60fps for any reason. The art direction is fantastic because that's the best thing about the Warhammer Universe is how it looks. The level graphics are bland as ♥♥♥♥ but everything else is really nice to look at. Sounds are awesome especially on a surround sound setup or a good pair of headphones and the gameplay is solid and tight. It is a very fun game with some high production value. And unlike a lot of games that come out on PC nowadays, this one can claim to be well optimized and glitch and bug free. You can do kill moves which are sweet as hell and the weapons are all balanced and fun. I mean it's Warhammer, what more can I say? Pretty cool.\n\nBad:\nThe worst and really only major thing about the game is a lot of times you will be running down long expanses of empty areas. For instance, you will run down a long hallway with nothing but an ammo container at the end. You will open a new door to another long area with nothing to do but run through it and another ammo container which is seriously pointless since you already have enough ammo from that last container. Or my favorite, an arena with like 6 ammo boxes which is enough for ten waves of baddies, yet there are only four enemies then you take an elevator down lol. Why have so many long expanses of nothingness in the game and make the player do so much pointless running? To have the illusion of more content than is actually there, that is why.\n\nThe End:\nEven though I could care less about the 40k universe, this game is a total blast and I highly recommend it, even if you are not a 40k fan and especially if you are. 8/10","July 17, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's the standard slew of competitive modes (plus Dreadnought, which nobody ever plays) and co-op against waves of Orks in the exceptionally fun Exterminatus mode. The controls are cumbersome and take a bit of getting used to, and you'll need to put in the time to level up before you'll be competitive in multiplayer, which can be an annoyance to newcomers short on patience. However, if you like third-person shooters and are willing to put in some substantial time, Space Marine can be a very fun and rewarding multiplayer game.","December 29, 2012","true","40.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A nice tribute for all Warhammer 40.000 fans as well as new players.\n\nThe controls are somewhat slow and heavy but precise considering you are playing a huge guy stuck in a tin can armor in a 3rd person view. The transition between shooting and melee is seamless and the combat is fun. The campaign is awesome for most of the game with a great cast of characters and good story telling.\n\nIt is however in online multiplayer VS that the game shines. Here you have to choose your class and loadout and together with your teammates battle against the enemy team in different modes with different objectives. All the classes fills specific roles and every weapon is good with the proper perks in your loadout, so the game is somewhat balanced.\n\nThe downside in public multiplayer is the matchmaking and the few amount of players. This might result in that you face off against players in far away geographical regions which in turn leads to bad latencies that make the games outcome more random which usually isn't fun for anyone. The game also doesn't have any dedicated servers so one of the player is made host instead. If this player has a slow PC or bad connection the game session will have terrible lag.\n\nThe game needs more players in online VS so join the rank of battle brothers and wreak havoc on your enemies and die a glorious death.","December 29, 2011","true","344.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The difficulty of the game varies from Easy, Normal and Hard. The biggest pain in the game is trying to recover health from Stunning and Executing the enemies, and during this time the other enemies can hammer down on you and take away the health you just gained.

Did I mention death yet? Well, there's also a lot of death. While I'm not too big a fan of death and gore, I must admit that it is pretty good for a game that revolves around mass-murder and genocide.\n\nOne fairly large problem for immersion-loving players is the fact that on a planet previously controlled my the Adeptus Mechanicus, there is a tiny range of weapons to choose from. What happened to power fists and hand flamers? However, the weapons that are present are pretty good, so it's not all bad.\n\nEverythng around the player (Captain Titus) is dying - often by his hand/gun - but not in a way that makes the game seem to easy. And likewise, the game isn't impossible to complete. There are a few things that don't quite seem realistic, such as that there are times when Guardsmen are skipping, singing and staying alive while a Space Marine captain is dying, so maybe making the Guardsmen easier to kill would be a good idea. Also, I would like to thank its creators for making a great game and not (completely) overpricing it.\n\n\nRating:\n\nStory: 9 / 10\nWeapons: 8 / 10\nRealism: 8 / 10 (?)\nGraphics: 10 / 10\n\nOverall: 8.75 / 10","October 6, 2015","true","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Graphically rich and violent in its depiction of the waves of enemies you will righteously purge, it indulges 40k fans with one of the best depictions of the game universe I've yet played.\n\nAfter completing it I dabbled a bit with the multiplayer on Exterminatus mode, 4 players versus wave after wave of enemies or upto 8 man teams versus 8 other human players and that gives the game a bit of extra longetivity.\n\nUltimately, its a game you will want to replay for the campaign or pvp blast. Enjoy it, finish it and then load it up it up again whenever you feel like purging xenos (or human opponents).\n\n***EDIT*** I want add the multiplayer is really good. You can play with others against waves of computer controlled enemies as I mentioned before or on two opposing teams of human player against each other. This adds another level of enjoyment.\n\nI would STRONGLY SUGGEST you play the co-op game mode "Exterminatus" first to get all the weapons unlocked. "Versus" mode is pretty unforgiving if you don't have access to the Weapons and Perks. Killing the cpu mobs is fun and reasonably easy. With practice I can now complete 2 and a half waves solo, although no doubt there are others who can do better.\n***/EDIT***\n\nFinally, my recommendation.\n\nI picked up the game when it was on sale and frankly I wish I had done so sooner. Grab it whenever it's on sale and don't worry about the DLC, it's not necessary unless you want to look cool in multiplayer.","November 29, 2015","true","73.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The future is cockney...\n\nThis seems to be one of those games you either love or hate.  I’m definitely in the love camp for this simple yet astonishingly over the top bloodbath.  This was my first contact with the games workshop stuff, and it’s a pretty cool IP.  Playing as Captain Titus, some sort of monastic space warrior lord, complete with chunky baby-blue armour and a few chums, you must save a factory planet from about a bazillion cockney-accented space orcs.  At its core, game design is not very nuanced or progressive; you shoot, grenade, and chainsaw your way through masses and masses of enemies, with little bits of jet-packing here and there.  Despite that, Space Marine is just so much damned fun I could barely put it down, even on my second play through.\n\nFor one, this is pure, unadulterated power fantasy with amps turned up to 11. Combat unfolds something like an early Slayer album, as waves upon wave of baddies (who all sound like Hackney cab drivers, for some reason) charge you in cathartic and blissfully chaotic battles which are exhilarating from start to finish. Your green-skinned adversaries often try overwhelm you with sheer numbers, which gives the game a crowd control element not common in these types of shooters; in small numbers, you can paint the walls red with them, but when 30 of the boys run in for a scrum, you’re in for a real slug.  By the end, you will have spilled oceans of blood, as it flies frequently and with reckless abandon.  Add in some great weapons (chain-sword and vengeance launcher, anyone?) and exquisite sound design which adds weight to your weapons and agony to the cries of your foes, and you’ve got one hell of a game.\n\nSecond, this game gives you something different in that there’s no cover system and no health packs.  Instead, health is regained by using your melee weapon to gloriously eviscerate any enemies; perhaps you’re also some sort of space vampire?  Anyway, it means you must do some gritty hand to hand fighting, and more crowd control as enemies will try to scrum you when you go to replenish your health, making battles even more desperate and ultimately fun.\n\nGraphically, this is nothing too special, but it runs well on even modest pcs, and I had good framerates all the way.  I enjoyed the story, although I had to hit Wikipedia a few times to understand what was going on in the wider universe as well as some of the terminology.  I also though the music was very fitting, especially as ominous horn blasts herald charges of green fury.  I haven’t tried the multiplayer yet, so I can’t comment on that.\n\nMy only real beef is that that Captain Titus and his two buddies are such boring, unemotional and uncharismatic characters. From what i've read online, there are other much more interesting space marine armies, like space vikings, space ninjas and space goths.  Wouldn't you rather play as a space viking?\n\nEven though I’m not a games workshop boy, I had a cathartic blast playing through Space Marine, twice.  It’s not subtle, nuanced, or revolutionary. What it is, is just damn good fun.  I dunno what happened to the devs after THQ went bust, but I’d love to see a sequel or successor to this one day.","May 31, 2015","true","9.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You'll need to have some knowledge of 40K in order to understand what's going on in Space Marine.\n\nLong story-short: It is the year 40,000. Humanity(The Imperium of Man) has expanded throughout half of the Milky Way Galaxy. The 2 fighting forces of the Imperium consist of the Adeptus Astartes(Space Marines) and the Imperial Guard(basically normal humans). The leader of of the Imperium is known as the God-Emperor of Mankind, who has been in a vegetative state for the last 10,000 years. What happened 10,000 years ago?\n\nBack in the year 30,000, the Emperor commanded his 20 legions of Space Marines alongside his sons, who are Primarchs. Primarchs are the 1st space marines of their legion. But something went horribly wrong. Horus, who is the Emperor's favorite son, lost faith in his father and planned a rebellion against his father. Before doing so, Horus gained the trust of multiple other space marine primarchs to fight with him against his father. The other space marine legions didn't know of this. As a result, they were backstabbed and when the Emperor required their assistance, the loyal legions were delayed heavily. Back on Holy Terra(Earth), the Emperor with 2 of his loyal legions were holding back the traitors, but eventually the traitors broke through. Then, the Emperor began a counter-attack on Horus and his forces. The Emperor led an assault with Sanguinius(Primarch of the Blood Angels Legion) and Rogal Dorn(Primarch of the Imperial Fists Legion). As they entered Horus' battle barge, Sanguinius confronted Horus first. Horus then attempted to convince Sanguinius to rebel against the Emperor. But Sanguinius refused to convert. As a result, Horus murdered Sanguinius in cold blood, but the Emperor was being delayed by the traitorous space marines. Somehow not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself from witnessing the death of a Primarch, a Imperial Guard guardsman named "Ollanius Pius stood up against Horus saying, "You can kill me and 10 more will take my place. Kill those 10 and 100 more will follow." He dueled against the strongest Primarch to buy time for the Emperor to arrive. Eventually, Ollaniuos perishes, but the Emperor finally arrived. Emperor Mankind fought it to the death against Horus. Horus died from the battle and even though the Emperor was victorious, he was wounded so badly he was barely able to stay conscious. The Emperor was then put on the Golden Throne to prevent him from "truly" dying.\n\nSpace Marines are genetically modified super-soldiers able to withstand incredibly high amounts of punishment. They have 2 hearts(1 being a backup in case the main heart failed), 3 lungs(3rd one acting as a filter out toxic chemicals), immunity to poisons and super fast regeneration. Their stomachs can break down majority of raw materials, including cellulose(which normal human stomachs cannot break down) and a space marine's saliva is similar to acid, so they can chew on metal bars and eventually eat their way through. Their cell regeneration rate is very fast. A deep cut from a knife can heal in 3 to 5 seconds.\n\nSpace Marine armor(AKA Power Armor) is composed of 3 elements and/or alloys. The 1st element is Ceramite, which is an element that is unable to conduct heat(heat/cold-resistant), however is rather soft compared to the other elements composed in Power Armor. The 2nd element is Adamantium, which is nearly indestructable and the densest element in Power Armor. The 3rd element, which is actually an alloy, is Plasteel, and I don't have any damn clue of what it does. There are more types of Space Marine armor such as Artificer Armor(basically more durable Power Armor) and Terminator Armor(turns of Space Marine into a living battle tank, as if they aren't tanky enough).\n\nSpace Marine weaponry are probably equivilent to small tank shells or rockets. Their standard-issue rifle is a Bolter. A bolt round has a Diamontine(diamond) tip, a Uranium(densest naturally-forming element on Earth) core, and an explosive equivilent to a couple of grenades. Immediatly after the round breaks through the armor or skin, it detonates. If a normal human took a round to the foot, both legs would be destroyed.\n\nTheir melee weaponry are just as impressive as their ranged weaponry. They have a "Chainsword" which is just as the name implies. A chainsaw fused with a sword. There is also a Power Axe, Power Fist, and the mighty Thunderhammer, which are weapons that have a force field and release a powerful discharge upon contact. A Power Fist and a Thunderhammer are nearly the same amount of power. For example, a punch from a Power Fist has enough force to rip the side off of a modern-day battle tank, and send it flying a few hundred meters.\n\nWhat am I doing? Making a game review or giving a history lesson? Anyway, 40K Space Marine has pretty good gameplay. The executions you can perform have a very high amount of gore. i.e. forcing a sword with rotating teeth through the torso of an Orc, pulling it out of its stomach, and kicking the Orc's face to have it and the top of his torso explode, drenching your character in blood.\n\ni'd give this game an 8.5/10","August 23, 2015","true","120.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everything works fine there.\n\nI played it on the Xbox 360 when it first came out, and it was okay. But now, with it being so old, I haven't been able to find any multiplayer matches that have any kind of quality connection. The game was great back then, but now...the campaign is only interesting so many times, and lagging through half of a match isn't what I enjoy.\n\nMost of the multiplayer unlocks, equipment and armor, is only unlockable in Versus mode.

It also doesn't unlock any new equipment for you to be able to use.\n\nI can't recommend this game unless you already have people to play it with. Finding any sort of multiplayer match is not worth waiting more then fifteen minutes and still be waiting. If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k, and want to see the story, then the campaign is there.

Combat employs  both melee and ranged attacks seamlessly. Ripping off a mounted heavy bolter and mowing down Ork grass is always 400 bullets of pure joy. The voice acting is good and a decent story line. The audio books you find along the way add a nice touch.\n\nExterminatus - Co Op survival vs hordes is also fun with a group of guys, gets very challenging at the end!\n\nCon's:\n\nCampaign - This is really the best part of the game. The only con is the levels seem pretty plain as far as design, variety, and fine details. Much of a halo 1 type feel.\n\nExterminatus - The 2nd best part of the game. Pretty good, but really disappointing you don't get the very useful finishing moves and some of the melee combos you get in the campaign. There are also only a couple of maps so variety isn't there.\n\nPvP - This is where the review starts to take a big negative. I'm not sure if the game originally had dedicated servers, but it sure doesn't now. It uses peer to peer connections. Since the game is a little old, the player base is pretty small and scattered worldwide. Playing peer to peer across continents in an FPS game is a nightmare.\n\nThe worst offender to game experience is assault marines warping all over the place. It looks like you've dodge rolled out of the way and they aren't swinging even close to you but your guy just falls over dead. The fall speed from jump packs is way to slow. Once an assault marine jumps they can just float in the clouds for 2 min until you show up and slam down with their laggy swings to lock you in. While the jump pack is on its few second cool down they get very boosted "mini" jumps. If the game didn't suffer from horrible lag every single match I could work with it.\n\nPlasma Cannons are annoying with grenade launcher like shots all over the map. But I guess I can't blame people for using them. You need to cover a lot of ground to hit a warping assault marine.\n\nAnother problem is every time someone joins a match the games slows to a crawl while they connect to all other players(another benefit of P2P). It's incredibly disrupting to game play.\n\nYet another constant disruption during matches is "host migration". I'm not sure if it only changes when the host leaves or starts to have poor performance, but it happens many times during matches and you guessed it, the match comes to a complete stop until the new host is in place then resumes. The game usually waits until you are in an important fight to screw you.\n\nAchievement Hunters - Stay away!!! The campaign achievements are fun. It's when you get to multiplayer where you will get killed. There are 3 really bad achievements here.\n\n1. Completing all 90+ weapon challenges . It takes a very, very long time to get and will make you depressed if you want 100%. They aren't all just based on getting x amount of kills with x weapon. They include things like kill streaks, multi-kills, and head shot only kills(not terrible but keep in mind the lag).\n2. Getting 40k kills(combined all game types). The best way is playing exterminatus where you fight waves, but the game will get boring way before that.\n3. The 3rd is having a 10 KD on annihilation. That's a problem because either no one plays it or the match is too short to get in the 10 kills in time. You could boost in a private match to get, up to your standards.\n\nWill I like this game?\n\nAchievement Hunters: No!! Do not buy. You will suffer greatly.\n\nSingle Player: You will love it! Wait for a sale though.\n\nDLC: Do not buy, no one plays it.\n\nCo Op: Limited amounts of replay ability since only one mode and a couple of maps, worth it on sale only.\n\nPvP: Although has potential to be fast paced, brutal, and constant action; it's just drowned out by aweful P2P lag. Do not buy at any price.","April 8","false","189.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","2"

Everything you could hope from a third person sci-fi. Brilliant detail, hordes of different enemies and you get to look awesome whilst you do it! The variation of different weapons you can have is great too and that goes for close combat as well. For a 40K fan this is perfect, the Adeptus Astartes have been modelled well and you can't find fault with the enemies either. The only mode is good too, being able to form a proper squad with great customisation and c'mon, who doesn't want to rip through a massive ork with a chain sword! 10/10!","June 1, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Truly gut wrenching euphoria.\n\nOnce more RELIC has dared as they did with WARHAMMER 40k DAWN OF WAR 2 and once again they have shown with jaw dropping success to the fan masses change is a good thing.\n\nHere is hoping there will be many more chapters unfolding in the huge potential of SPACE MARINE.

It is a mix of shooting and melee, big swarms of enemies, bullets flying, blood spraying and lots of noise !.\n\nPros:\nThe only game representation of a Space Marine i have ever seen to actually nail it. They are straight out of the Black LIbrary Fiction.\nThe Orks are really well done, again, proper 40K style.\nI like the scenery, the bleak imposing architecture of the Manufactorums contrast with the tighter hab levels. Its not far off what i imagined a Hab world to be.\nThe Melee combat is great, you feel like you are doing some awful damage.\nThe guns, while not as much fun as melee, still have a satisfying punch. The bolter especially captures that big calibre bang well.\nEven on normal, it can be quite tough, you need to think as much as button mash. You are not invincible.\n\nCons:\nIt is essentially a corridor. A long pretty one but still, a corridor.\nI sometimes found the camera a bit wonky in tighter spaces, it would zoom in to the point i didnt realise quite how many Orks i had on me or, crucially, allow me to register how many Ork Shootas had me in LOS. I do suck at games mind you !.\nI tried playing on M/Keyboard at first..... You will need a game pad. It works nicely on a pad but obviously this limits control options.\n\nOverall i would say if you like action games and you like the 40K Universe then this is worth your time.","July 14, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Certainly, during the beggining it is impossible to compare it to Gears of War, but once you forget take that away, you start to sense its true esence. it's more a Hack & Slash with a great touch of shooting action and in my opinion the creators made a perfect balance of these two elements. I'm not a Warhammer 40000 franchise fan, in fact, this is the first game I've played.\n\nNice story, great scenario design, amazing effects. The jetpack experience is awesome, the wepons feel exactly as they should (the small ones are easy to control, the heavy ones feel like that, the sensation is amazing) it performs great with a medium pc.\n\nPerhaps the main character had to be polished, make him a little more expresive cos he runs all the time with that "I'm Deadly calm" expression no matter what happens during the game. that's the only thing made me to not feel connected with him.\n\nSeriously, you will love it.

I'm not the type that plays online but the gameplay is very satisfying at times.\n\nThe gameplay is somewhat similar to Gears of Wars where you hack n slash, shoot, and throw grenades at enemies as you progress in the story. There are no items to regain health, the only way to regain health is that you need to execute an enemy. If I'm going to be nitpicky, I have to say that the execution animations is somewhat off at times, but I'll let it slide seeing it's THQ that made this. There is this special that you become more powerful and regain health for the moment if you're being overrun by enemies.\n\nThe story, as I got so far in the game, is that you play as Titus, Captain of the Ultramarines, to turn the tide on retaking the Forge world from the Orks and must defend the Titan "Invictus" from the Orks before they will kill the entire planet...I won't go any further on the story...but I can tell you that the ending is a cliff hanger...there was suppose to be a trilogy of this game but since THQ is no more and it's under another company, we will not see anymore sequels to this game.\n\nThe game is good at the time of 2011.

The Orc dialogue can get a bit boring with: Kill the Space Marine every 5 seconds. The linear map design hurts it also. The story is good. The graphics are console level so it loses points on that. The weapons are a bit overpowered but a lot of fun when you find a good one. You really don't notice the music most of the time, because you are too busy defending/attacking waves of enemies. The game reminds me of C&C: Renegade. I would say that the $7.49 is what the game is worth when it was released new. Not a lot of bugs found. Some glitches but not game breaking. I almost forgot the melee: It is badass'.","August 11, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though the generic Ultramarine chapter has been designated for the SP campaign, the MP game allows for infinite chapter colours as well as some great DLC chapters. Acquiring all the achivements can take some doing as there are some very specific demands for a lot of them in order to gain bonuses, whereas levelling up to 41 is simply about playing for a long time. The MP co-op is pretty good fun, against the Orks, in a Left4Dead fashion you have to face wave after wave of hoardes of greenskins with a few specialist troops thrown to make things tough. There is also a Chaos version offering a variety of Chaos themed foes. The voice acting is good, gorefest is high, the AI can sometimes be quite tactical and tricky to overcome. There is a strange grenade launcher, original to the game and not a GW concept, it takes some getting used to, though to be fair the most fun comes from using bolters and the chainsword in melée. During MP get used to annoying players who spam metagun and plasma or lascannon attacks, as they are instant kill weapons which generally require less skill than the rest of the armoury. MP's biggest weakness is the lack of an open server list, you are thrown into the lobby of a match the game decides on and that's it.. shame, as this game could easily have attracted a bigger player base had it been more flexible with regards to offering hosting options.","March 10, 2014","true","91.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It perfectly matches the atmosphere of the Warhammer 40k universe.  The game takes place over a short period of time during which the action and importance of what is going on quickly escalates.  Playing as one of the Ultramarines provides a great look into the world of 40k by allowing the players to become a seemingly unstoppable weapon as you fight hordes of enemies.  The game does a great job of making the events feel significant, and by the end of the game I was completely invested in the story.  Sadly, no sequels will be made to follow up on Space Marine, but the game completes what is necessary for the players to guess as to what could happen next.  I would highly recommend this game to Warhammer 40k fans and gamers wanting to be a part of a gritty adventure.","March 11, 2014","true","33.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though, it can get quite repetetive and can get boring after a few chapters. Where everything seems to be the same. But because of its story that reels you, there is some kind of balance that hides that boredom. Battle can get pretty challenging, a little sad for me because at each fail you can't even skip the cinematics.\n\nThis game was an eduction for me as it is the first Warhammer 40K game that I have ever played.

It's not going to knock your socks off in terms of narrative depth, but it absolutely nails the look and feel of WH40K.\n\nThis game covers all of the Warhammer 40K bases. You fight Orks. You fight the forces of Chaos. You blow things up and you kill tons of bad guys.\n\nWhen you get to multiplayer, you have a wealth of options in terms of weaponry and armor. You can choose paint schemes from the old tabletop and miniatures games, or you can create your own. Armor comes in sets, but you can mix and match the pieces to create a space marine who looks just the way you want.\n\nLoadouts are made up of a class, a weapon, a backup, and some perks. Each class has its own built-in abilities, but it is your weapon and your perks that really dial in your playstyle.\n\nThe Assault gets a jetpack, and it's just as fun to use as it looks and sounds. The Devastator gets the heavy and long range weaponry. They have high damage potential and can be a little tougher than the other two classes at the cost of being a little slower. The tactical marine is surprisingly maneuverable, and falls somewhere in between the other two. Not quite as mobile as the Assault, not quite as tough or as good at long range as the Devastator.\n\nThere's a nice balance to the multiplayer, though the population is pretty low this far out from release. Also, there's often "that guy" you'll run into with a cheap, super effective, or heavily-practised loadout. The early matches in multiplayer can be a bit rough due to some of those cheap and/or veteran players combined with most of the gear and perks not being unlocked yet. If you stick with it a little bit, you'll unlock more of the equipment and you'll find your niche. There are definitely certain playstyles that hard-counter others, but for the most part teamwork and positioning matter more than the gear you bring.\n\nThe only issue specific to PC multiplayer is the effectiveness of sniper-type weapons. They weren't used much console-side and still have their drawbacks, but with mice being so accurate some of the sniper-style weapons have become way more effective in PvP than they really should be. It's not often a problem, but on certain maps you may find yourself being killed from across the map or at any range as soon as they spot you; due to the ease with which they can hit you. Space Marines are big, bulky, and a bit slow. Most of the combat is designed around this, but players using these sniper-type weapons will often find the nearest vantage point and begin mercilessly destroying you and your team at all ranges. Sometimes, sneaking up on them isn't even enough. If they spot you coming up on them or if you don't kill them before they realize you're there, they can fire just as accurately at close range as long range (even if most of the other weapons outperform in speed or raw damage). It's annoying, and so are some of the Assault players when they catch you alone, but those are hardly deal-breakers.\n\nIf you decide to purchase this game, do it for the excellent single-player campaign and the co-op horde mode (which you can play solo and can use to farm some of the weapon challenges). "Annihilation" mode sometimes has players, and it can be very fun, but it's more of a nice bonus than a guarantee.","June 5, 2015","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though Captain Titus doesn't really exsist in the Warhammer World he is a rather cool character and he fits the story of the game very well.

If you like feeling like a a giant human tank that just ploughs through enemies shoots buttles the size of sniper rounds out of a bolter and health regenertation through finishing moves than this is the one for one. The game can be beaten in about 8 hours  and has multiplayer that doesn't have much of a community. My only gripe is that the story ends on a cliff hanger, and since the developer behind the game went under and its assets purchased, I have no idea how long it will be before we will even see a sequel.

Though the generic Ultramarine chapter has been designated for the SP campaign, the MP game allows for infinite chapter colours as well as some great DLC chapters. Acquiring all the achivements can take some doing as there are some very specific demands for a lot of them in order to gain bonuses, whereas levelling up to 41 is simply about playing for a long time. The MP co-op is pretty good fun, against the Orks, in a Left4Dead fashion you have to face wave after wave of hoardes of greenskins with a few specialist troops thrown to make things tough. There is also a Chaos version offering a variety of Chaos themed foes. The voice acting is good, gorefest is high, the AI can sometimes be quite tactical and tricky to overcome. There is a strange grenade launcher, original to the game and not a GW concept, it takes some getting used to, though to be fair the most fun comes from using bolters and the chainsword in melée. During MP get used to annoying players who spam metagun and plasma or lascannon attacks, as they are instant kill weapons which generally require less skill than the rest of the armoury. MP's biggest weakness is the lack of an open server list, you are thrown into the lobby of a match the game decides on and that's it.. shame, as this game could easily have attracted a bigger player base had it been more flexible with regards to offering hosting options.","March 10, 2014","true","91.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It perfectly matches the atmosphere of the Warhammer 40k universe.  The game takes place over a short period of time during which the action and importance of what is going on quickly escalates.  Playing as one of the Ultramarines provides a great look into the world of 40k by allowing the players to become a seemingly unstoppable weapon as you fight hordes of enemies.  The game does a great job of making the events feel significant, and by the end of the game I was completely invested in the story.  Sadly, no sequels will be made to follow up on Space Marine, but the game completes what is necessary for the players to guess as to what could happen next.

Even the neckbeards can't help but stay their rage and praise Space Marine for how awesome it is; one of the few times they would bow down to an Ultramarine.\n\nTruly an Astartes-tier campaign, the story was like it was written by one of the holy trinity of the Black Library (though its planned sequel kinda made me happy a continuation is never coming into fruition, because the story seems to have come under the authorship of C.S. Goto [Titus founds a new chapter? LEL] a very bad thing).\n\nGood multiplayer too, just playing it suddenly made sense of Dark Millenium's cancellation. So much that it was like Tzeentch went "just as planned". I mean, I know Space Marine's online mode cannot be compared to DM's MMORPG type gameplay (though it arguably could be since Space Marine allows player avatar/ character customization), but wouldn't you want it better that you can fight theoretically under a single chapter or chaos warband rather than having so many customized characters in battles as if the Codex Astartes never existed? Works for Chaos though.\n\nThe only downside is the very fact that so few gamers play it, which makes the online in-game population suffer as well. In terms of grpahics, I think it's superb. And I guess more importantly (to 40k fans such as myself) in terms of the use of the fluff, I think THQ has come a long way from Dawn of War and uh... Fire "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" Warrior.\n\nOverall, I'd only reaffirm my claim, that Space Marine is one of the best 40k games out there, a must play for any 40k fan.","December 9, 2013","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is great for giving you a chance to see a Space Marine in action as well as the world in the 41st Millennium where there is nothing but war.\n\nThe campaign was great, really enjoyable combat against the toughest enemies to Mankind along with how the Imperium of Man's Forgeworlds are, especially the Titan Invictus. The multiplayer is the weakest part of the game, especially if you played on PS3/Xbox 360 due to the UI bug but the community gathered together and added members to play prearranged games and it rocked!\n\nSeeing what Space Marine had to offer, I saw it as a solid first step that had potential to evolve Space Marine into a better game with future sequels, sadly that chance won't come anytime soon since THQ went down and seeing what Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade has to offer. Having seen some gameplay of 40K:EC, it seems that the combat system is coming back with vengeance.\n\nBut with every game comes at least one sin. If you know the Ultramarine history of the 2nd Company, Titus isn't the 2nd Company Captain, it's Cato Sicarius. Seeing Black Templars with an Inquisitor, a psyker?! Black Templars hate psykers due to their chapter's vows etc. Those are the only issue I had with the game story wise but still really enjoyed what Titus had to offer, a very solid character and inspirational.

If you like feeling like a a giant human tank that just ploughs through enemies shoots buttles the size of sniper rounds out of a bolter and health regenertation through finishing moves than this is the one for one. The game can be beaten in about 8 hours  and has multiplayer that doesn't have much of a community. My only gripe is that the story ends on a cliff hanger, and since the developer behind the game went under and its assets purchased, I have no idea how long it will be before we will even see a sequel.

Considering this review is..well....a bit late, i would further like to say that these will be my opinions on the game as i have experienced its thrilling campaign and multiplayer. Firstly, Warhammer 40k: space marine is a 3rd person action, hack and slash game that prides it's self for having preposterous amounts of orks flooding your screen whilst you are hacking each one of them with your chain sword, it is immense and epic to see this game combat system fully present its true colours as there are enough orks to kill at any moment. 40k space marine is set where the orks have sent a massive invasion force towards the Forge World Graia (world dedicated to producing weapons and gear). as the results look grim, the space marines are sent in, particularly the ultra Marines, which in my opinion, are a bunch of mary-sues. I would have maybe liked to play as a different chapter like the blood angels or black templars rather than the "heroes of the imperium". anyways you are commander Captain Titus who needs to find out what the orks are up to. to save spoilers, lots of stuff occur and mini plot twists which maybe you could have seen from a mile away but yeah. keeping this a brief review i will say that the games story is excellent but has pacing issues, the graphics are standard for a game like that but are nice looking and the combat is meaty as ever which is great in a game like 40k. Overall, this game is awesome and i would like to propose that you should give it a go. SCORE: 8.5/10.","October 1, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly, Warhammer 40k: space marine is a 3rd person action, hack and slash game that prides it's self for having preposterous amounts of orks flooding your screen whilst you are hacking each one of them with your chain sword, it is immense and epic to see this game combat system fully present its true colours as there are enough orks to kill at any moment. 40k space marine is set where the orks have sent a massive invasion force towards the Forge World Graia (world dedicated to producing weapons and gear). as the results look grim, the space marines are sent in, particularly the ultra Marines, which in my opinion, are a bunch of mary-sues. I would have maybe liked to play as a different chapter like the blood angels or black templars rather than the "heroes of the imperium". anyways you are commander Captain Titus who needs to find out what the orks are up to. to save spoilers, lots of stuff occur and mini plot twists which maybe you could have seen from a mile away but yeah. keeping this a brief review i will say that the games story is excellent but has pacing issues, the graphics are standard for a game like that but are nice looking and the combat is meaty as ever which is great in a game like 40k. Overall, this game is awesome and i would like to propose that you should give it a go. SCORE: 8.5/10.","October 1, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't know why orks who are basically scrapyard junkers can fly spaceships, why it's the far future but humanity worships a machine god, why some of the dialogue is vaguely medieval, or why Space Marines are all at least SEVEN FEET TALL.\n\nWhat I do know is that this is a pretty decent third-person shooter.  It's basically Warcraft (which I DO know about) meets Gears of War.  The campaign will only last you 7-8 hours, and from what I understand, the multiplayer has several modes (thanks to AFatalPapercut for correcting me on this)  but no campaign co-op.  If it's on a good sale, pick it up.\n\nGraphics are pretty decent, but with few customization options.  Voice acting is good, optimization is so-so considering the game is 5 years old.  There are occasional absurd difficulty spikes, but the controls are easy, and mingling a fair amount of melee weapons and combat into the game works surprisingly well.","March 14","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game had me by the edge of my seat and with every chapter that\npassed by i got closer and closer to the edge i was afraid i would fall out of my chair! I can hardly find anything to\ncomplain about this masterpiece of a game but if i had to mention something i would probably say "it has no replay\nvalue" but that only if i was forced to find a negative about the game itself. i can easily see myself giving this a second\nplaythrough within the year. after watching the ending of this game however i began to wonder to myself "ok, so wheres\nspace marine 2?" unfortunately since the game didnt receive alot of attention at its launch and it wasnt producing "call of duty" numbers, sequels are unlikely. hopefully the current IP holder (sega) decide one day that this work of art deserves a sequal that all fans of the space marine game will be able to enjoy.","January 10","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't know why orks who are basically scrapyard junkers can fly spaceships, why it's the far future but humanity worships a machine god, why some of the dialogue is vaguely medieval, or why Space Marines are all at least SEVEN FEET TALL.\n\nWhat I do know is that this is a pretty decent third-person shooter.  It's basically Warcraft (which I DO know about) meets Gears of War.  The campaign will only last you 7-8 hours, and from what I understand, the multiplayer has several modes (thanks to AFatalPapercut for correcting me on this)  but no campaign co-op.  If it's on a good sale, pick it up.\n\nGraphics are pretty decent, but with few customization options.  Voice acting is good, optimization is so-so considering the game is 5 years old.  There are occasional absurd difficulty spikes, but the controls are easy, and mingling a fair amount of melee weapons and combat into the game works surprisingly well.","March 14","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seems like a basic shooter, but the weapons and enemys plus the twists and story will keep you entertained as you slash your way through hundreds of orks or blow their bodies apart with massive Laser Cannons.\n\nThis is a very enjoyable game and although got a few glitches and bugs, still an amazing grab.

Some were good, and others were so great that I still play them, even several years after their release.\n\n\nThis is one of the best 40k games, period. It nails everything- from what makes a good 3rd person shooter, to what makes a true-to-lore 40k game.\n\nTo start off, This isn't your standard 3rd person-totally-not-gears-of-war game. Whilst most 3PSs focus on a cover system, Space Marine removes that entirely. You ARE the cover. You can wade into a mob of enemies, without dying every 3 seconds. It perfectly encapsulates what makes a space marine a space marine, and lets you experience that firsthand.\n\nThe combat is divided into two parts- ranged and melee. You are given a wide variety of weapons to slaughter your enemies in different and uniquely brutal ways. Each weapon feels (and sounds!) exactly how it should. The shot of a bolter, the hiss of a meltagun, and the roar of a plasma cannon. And although the ranged weapons are cool, the melee weapons are even better. Chainswords (chainsaw-swords) evicerate and rend flesh whenever they strike, turning a large horde of orks into a bloody mess very quickly. Thunder hammers, although slow, deal tremendous damage and completly pulverise your enemies. The combat (especially in single player or the horde-mode) is immensly satisfying and one of the best parts of the game.\n\nThe game has both a single-player and a multiplayer. The single player has a decently lengthy campaign (10-12 hours) with a pretty good story. It does have its faults (unfinished story arcs that will probably never get finished b/c r.i.p THQ). The multiplayer, although good and reasonably well balanced, gets repedative with the 4 maps (excluding expansions). You also can't choose which side you are on pre-match, meaning you might not even get to see your shiny new color scheme for a couple matches. The multiplayer also follows the standard 'level up to improve' philosophy, with special perks unlocked by completing challenges (some of which are brutally difficult without help).\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic 40k game that really makes you feel like you are playing a space marine.\nIt's practically a badass simulator, 10/10 from me.","January 14","true","68.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything in this game adds up to a great experience. The story line of this game and all the settings make this a beautiful game. Some of the graphics aren't top notch but the way they are used and the well designed levels make you feel like your in a large open world with amazing designs. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the hack and slash shooter genre or anyone that likes Warhammer as this game does both justice.\n\nThe game revolves around a Space Marine Captain who you play as and the event of an Ork invasion upon a Imperial Planet, fighting with the Gaurdsman you must stop the invansion at all costs. It seems like a basic shooter, but the weapons and enemys plus the twists and story will keep you entertained as you slash your way through hundreds of orks or blow their bodies apart with massive Laser Cannons.\n\nThis is a very enjoyable game and although got a few glitches and bugs, still an amazing grab. Its definately worth the price. 8/10","April 8","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Can be Repetitive.\n\nMultiplayer:\nAt first it might seem like a bunch of super soldiers flying around and cutting you up. Because thats what it is. While there are sniper rifles and other guns many plays like to play as a sword or hammer wielding maniac who charges straight at you.\nThe servers still have some life but its nothing like it once was.\n\nSurvival mode:\nBasically, you and a small squad fight against a set number of waves to complete an objective.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/55150/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TLDR – Space Marine is a third person hack & slash shooter taking place in the world of Warhammer 40k. If you’re working your way through the games in the Humble Relic Bundle, Space Marine is a great way to round out your Warhammer experience after beating the Dawn of War Real Time Strategy games. Remember Starcraft Ghost, the first person shooter taking place in the Starcraft universe? Me neither because that game was cancelled. But Space Marine is a decent approximation of what I think that game would have been like. You encounter the distinctive enemies of Warhammer and lead your squad through a war torn world beset on all sides by alien hordes.\n\nIn this chapter of the Warhammer 40k saga, you play Captain Titus of the Ultramarines (like regular Space marines, but more ultra I guess). Your mission is to infiltrate a planet under massive Ork attack and secure a vital strategic asset before the Orks can get their grubby mitts on it. The Orks (with their British accents) are generally scavengers and will pick apart any technology they can get, including the super secret weapon that happens to be on this particular planet, so it’s up to you to stop them.\n\nThe game is played in the third person perspective, like Mass Effect but with no real cover system and much more emphasis on melee fighting. You have a small selection of guns and a few melee power weapons that will be familiar to people who’ve played the Warhammer games, for example the chain sword and power axe. The guns are reasonably powerful and you can mow down waves of enemies with your limited ammo before getting to the hack and slash melee fighting. At key points in the game you also get access to the badass jetpack that you often see space marines run around with in the RTS games. The Orks almost always come in large numbers so get used to the melee portion, it will make or break your game experience. Orks aren’t your only enemies though, and you’ll find yourself under attack by forces of Chaos closer to the end who are significantly more difficult to deal with.\n\nPros:\n+Greater immersion in the Warhammer world since you won’t be getting an overhead view like the real time strategy games. You’ll actually be dropped into it playing as a single person fighting xenos in the name of the emperor. Enemies from the Dawn of War games like Nobs and Chaos demons are real threats, unlike their counterparts in the other games.\n+Decent story, and some flavor added through “servo skulls” which act as personal logs (similar to the recordings in the Bioshock games). These give you some background on the world you fighting for, and the enemies you’re up against.\n+The game has multiplayer with some people playing, so I was able to join a few cooperative matches when I wanted to try it out.\n\nCons:\n-This might be a personal problem, but I seemed to get headaches when playing this game for more than an hour. It probably has to do with the movement of the camera as your Space marine stomps around in his power armor.\n-There’s a bug with one of the servo skulls if you’re going for the achievement to collect them all. Just get this one last and you should be good. Fortunately you can load specific chapters from the start menu.\n\nNote that the difficulty of the game skyrockets in the last half hour or so of the story. The rest of the game is pretty straightforward and you can take your time, but suddenly you’re all alone up against a horde of powerful foes. Overall though, the game is fun and I would recommend it to any fan of the Dawn of War games or action games in general.\n","September 21, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/honestcat/recommended/55150/","honestcat","Honest Cat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/honestcat/","67 products in account","Reading some reviews on steam and russian playground.ru, i was a bit disappointed about this game. There were mentioned some mistakes of the developers, concerning behaviour and wearings of the Adeptus Astartes. Never the less, i made up my mind to buy Space Marine. And you know... that was perfect, despite of some mistakes. What about its "minuses" - 1) Its russian dubbing is badly done in some phrases of the main character - sometimes it sounds too indifferent. That irritated me a bit. 2) Meltagun in the game is a kind of shotgun which shoots a cloud of gas, though it releases just a stream, that melts a tank - in cooperation mod it can't humiliate a marine within a shot. 3) Yes, there are some appearance mistakes, which contradicts with the Codex. These are minor mistakes, so if you are not acquainted with precise details of Warhammer "lifestyle", the game will be perfect for playing either in the campaign mode or the coop. Well, "the pluses" - 1) The Ultramarines kill dozens of orcs and heretics. What can be better? 2) Good storyline, i can say it is perfect. Good job. You just should play for a better understanding of its plot. 3) A good cooperation mod, where you can find at least one game. It is good for all the rest Warhammer games, where you have to wait your turn for an hour, 'cause there are no players. 4) Despite of some mistakes, which i described in minuses, the reference to the Warhammer back can be seen here, especially if you know it. The main hero reprimands his subject in narrow interpretation of the Codex and that leads to his departure in the inquisitor's ship. That point leads to forgotten II and XI legions of Adeptus Astartes, forgotten and deleted from Imperial archives. The Ultramarines (as known from some books of Warhammer Horus Heresy) became the biggest legion, just as mainly they were those who recruited marines from these two legions. These marines have one distinctive feature - often they act as they want, not looking into the Codex, while "real" Ultramarines can't but follow it in their belief that no one can be more educated in military science than the Imperator and their Robute Guilliman. This fact points out, that the main character is one of these recruited marines. That fact makes the plot clear and answers everything, concerning this matter. My opinion: don't be afraid to play this game.","March 23, 2015","true","65.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The audio and environments are well done as is the feel of the Warhammer universe.  The core mechanics are well done and the weapons feel great to use.  There are only 2 complaints that I have; you can't skip some cut scenes/FMV's and the final boss battle is really just a series of QTE's :(.\n\nNot being able to skip the FMV's is really only an issue a few times, most notably near the end as the battle leading up to the boss proved difficult for me on the hardest difficulty setting.  I had to run through that cut scene too many times.

It's got several different modes (single player, exterminatus, and versus), each one of which plays very differently. Single player is a typical Warhammer 40K story; i found it quite engaging and interesting, but i'm a fan of the genre. Exterminatus is where you fight wave after wave of enemy, with up to 3 other people. Versus is your typical death match type game.\n\nWhat really makes it stand out to me is how fast-paced the game play is, and how fluidly it blends attacks together. There's also a variety of play styles it supports - you can be a Raptor, or a tactical marine, or what have you. It's got enough variety to keep things interesting for a while.\n\nI also really enjoyed that you could play as chaos in exterminatus and versus modes.\n\nThe character customization is a lot of fun if you are a fan of Warhammer 40K.

As you play, Death is your companion and ally, a trusted friend who brings doom to the Ork.

Well then you have to get this game.\n\nIf you love the world of Warhammer 40K then this is the game for you, infact even if you don’t you will still enjoy blasting away enemies with huge guns whilst running around in a battle suit that effectively makes you a living tank.\n\nThe gameplay is great, the attacks and motion feel heavy and full of momentum, and considering what you are wearing this is no surprise. The many weapons, and there are a fair amount of them, all made me feel like a bad ♥♥♥. Each shot blasting holes through enemies and leaving a trail of blood and body parts in my wake. And speaking of close combat, you get a chainsword, enough said.\n\nThe story is one that you would probably need to have some brand familiarity with before you could get the most out of it. As I said I love the lore of 40k and this was a treasure trove for me. Even if you are new to the franchise this game has a solid and engrossing story that you will want to finish. Also the voice acting is pretty sweet, always what I imagined an Ultramarine to sound like.\n\nThe scenery and environments were great, they added a lot to the game and as you traverse the war torn world you get a great sense of the monumental loss that has just taken place. A real feeling of anger against the swarm of green skins that now overrun the place just adds to the pleasure of gunning them down.\n\nThe multiplayer was a great deal of fun too, a little steep on the learning curve but with match’s still frequent to this day you will get the hang of it no time.\n\nThe asking price may be a little high if you aren’t interested in the setting but buying this on a sale is a must for everyone. On the other hand if you love 40k then it’s worth every penny.\n\nHave fun ^_^","May 16, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was so wrong. The game offers a great view how a casual day in the life of a space marine looks like. And the graphic is decent. The game runs on nearly all computers, and it's pretty easy to learn.

Well then you have to get this game.\n\nIf you love the world of Warhammer 40K then this is the game for you, infact even if you don’t you will still enjoy blasting away enemies with huge guns whilst running around in a battle suit that effectively makes you a living tank.\n\nThe gameplay is great, the attacks and motion feel heavy and full of momentum, and considering what you are wearing this is no surprise. The many weapons, and there are a fair amount of them, all made me feel like a bad ♥♥♥. Each shot blasting holes through enemies and leaving a trail of blood and body parts in my wake. And speaking of close combat, you get a chainsword, enough said.\n\nThe story is one that you would probably need to have some brand familiarity with before you could get the most out of it. As I said I love the lore of 40k and this was a treasure trove for me. Even if you are new to the franchise this game has a solid and engrossing story that you will want to finish. Also the voice acting is pretty sweet, always what I imagined an Ultramarine to sound like.\n\nThe scenery and environments were great, they added a lot to the game and as you traverse the war torn world you get a great sense of the monumental loss that has just taken place. A real feeling of anger against the swarm of green skins that now overrun the place just adds to the pleasure of gunning them down.\n\nThe multiplayer was a great deal of fun too, a little steep on the learning curve but with match’s still frequent to this day you will get the hang of it no time.\n\nThe asking price may be a little high if you aren’t interested in the setting but buying this on a sale is a must for everyone. On the other hand if you love 40k then it’s worth every penny.\n\nHave fun ^_^","May 16, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And I, the relentless skipper of cutscenes watched all the cutscenes cos I love the way the endoctrinated uber-fascist space marines go on.\nLike a mix between borderlands and warframe but plays better then either.","February 12","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game along with Space Hulk shows that Warhammer 40k does not have to be confined to the RTS genre.\n\nYou play an Ultramarine named Titus, who leads a squad of two other Ultramarines. Your squad is made up of a grizzled veteran and a nervous play-by-the-rules rookie. Characterwise they are shallower than one might expect, but they act as one might expect space marines to based on lore. Plot is also decent so far.\n\nGameplay focuses on melee and ranged combat. You are able to switch seamlessly between the two, and perform combos with your guns and your melee weapons. Weapons are pretty standard, you have an assault rifle (A.K.A bolter) sniper rifle, etc. The only real interesting ranged weapon I have come across is a remote detonation grenade launcher. But the intense combat makes up for the lack of interesting ranged weapons. The melee weapons are also much more diverse, each with its own combo sets and abilities.\n\nI would also like to add that the game is extremely well optimized, lowest fps I got was 40 on med-high settings and I am fairly below the recommended system requirements. Something like that is hard to find anymore.\n\nTL;DR this game is pretty good you should grab it.","December 29, 2014","true","7.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's controls feel weighty and satisfying, as do its guns, and the game does a great job making you feel like one of the Emperor's finest. It also does a great job capturing the scale of things in the 40k universe, which really impressed me.\n\nBiggest downside is the writing. It's probably the worst I've seen in a game.

The only major flaw this game suffers from is stupid ally AI that will walk around in the open, take fire, and not return it. A great resolution to this would have been online co-op, but sadly there's no singleplayer co-op.\n\nI just want to point out that Space Marine is the first game in what was supposed to be a trilogy, but things happened, companies went extinct, and there may never be any sequels. With that said, the ending ends on somewhat of a clif-hanger leading up to the next game. However, don't let that stop you from experiencing one of the best & most fun games I've played in a long time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadlicated/recommended/55150/","tadlicated","Tadlicated","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadlicated/","117 products in account","I bought this game for $10 because i loved the Warhammer 40K series. Warhammer made great Dawn Of Wars in RTS modes but when i saw it in third person shooter i was thinking what the ♥♥♥♥? When i took a closer look i saw Games Workshop + THQ. Now that blew my mind. I loved Games Workshop's games and THQ's games so i imediately bought it and played it.\n\nFirstly, the campaign is extraordinary with sublime graphics. The cutscenes had fine graphics and the gameplay was awesome! I could not believe how well developed the questline was. Just like Darksiders 2, there is fast gameplay in the campaign where you start off with a chainsaw and a bolt pistol. Then you start cutting all the bloody orks up and Captain Titus does not give a ♥♥♥♥! Next, throughout the campaign, you develop better weapons and a special skill as well which allows you to restore health. New melee weapons such as the Power Axe and the Power Hammer is unlocked. Some levels even allow you to equip a jetpack! When wielding the Power Hammer and flying on a jetpack, the combos and skills combined are absolutely magnificent. Smashing up Ork boyz and beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of ♥♥♥♥tards who get in your way! When combos are used correctly, you are unstoppable. Through out the game you also discover weapons such as sniper rifles, laser snipers, heavy bolters, plasma pistols, plasma bolters, grenade launchers and lots more! Later in the chapters, the chaos demons and the chaos space marines appear from a portal after Captain Titus was used as pawns by the Chaos lord. Now havoc wrecks the place and Captain Titus has to save the world with his two companions. In the campaign there are 17 chapters! Each chapter last about 15-45 minutes (depending on difficulty and your skill level). After the campaign there is an epic epilogue to it but, we aren't finished yet.\n\nAfter finishing the campgain there is an online option! In the online section there are 4 main different types of games. Versus, Versus Private, Exterminatus and Exterminatus Private. Versus is basically PVP where you can choose between lots of modes such as capture the point, team deathmatch, free for all, capture the flag and seize ground. The versus servers are still really active filled with players. Versus private is basically versus except it is only for friends and solo. Exterminatus is the co-op survival mode. You can play with 2-4 players on 4 different types of maps. After every 5 rounds you switch to a different map but with harder monsters. In Exterminatus you kill Orks. On the last wave (bonus wave), stage 21, chaos demons and chaos space marines invade you and you must kill them all to win. Exterminatus private is basically exterminatus but with friends/solo only. In multiplayer mode there are 41 levels in total. When you reach level 4 you obtain a place where you can customize you space marine/chaos space marine. When you progress through each level you can unlock more gear, weapons and perks. Armour can be unlocked by finishing really hard challenges or you could buy custom ones from the steam DLC shop for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. In multiplayer there are 3 types of main roles:\nTactical: Carries a default bolter and a deafult chainsaw\nDevastator: Carries a default pistol and a deafult heavy bolter\nAssault: Carries a default pistol and a defaul chainsaw\nThe tactical is the support. The devastator is the tank and the Assault is the damage per second. The assault usually wields power axes and power hammers or it can wield relic items from the DLC.\n\nThis is one of my favourite Warhammer 40,000 games. Games Workshop already makes great RTS and THQ makes great bloody third person gamers such as Darksiders II. If you are a Warhammer 40,000 fanboy, love THQ games, love Games Workshop games, love Darksiders II or if you love thrid person shooters/third person games then you HAVE to buy this game. DO NOT wait any longer buy it now! The only thing that's stopping you is the price -_- Although it is slightly over priced ($39.99) you might want to wait a while until it's about 50%-75%. Stunning graphics, unbelievable gameplay, good multiplayer, great features and epic weapons and classes! MUST PUT ON YOUR CHRISTMAS WISHLIST FOR 2015!!! DON'T LISTEN TO THE ♥♥♥♥ED UP NEGATIVE REVIEWS! BUY THIS GAME NOW\n9/10\nChop\n2015","January 11, 2015","true","39.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"

Honestly, it is very tough to say a game is perfect, but this gets very close.\n\nTL;DR @ bottom.\n\nPros:\n+Pretty up to date textures\n+Nice amount of weapons that you can choose from\n+Smooth controls (I would recommend a gamepad if you have one, although M&Key is OK.)\n+Pretty great soundtrack\n++Amazing voice work\n+++One of your Ultramarines looks like Anthony Hopkins\n+Decently long game\n+Plenty of multiplayer content\n\nCons:\n-Due to THQ going bankrupt, there will be no sequel to this *planned* trilogy. (Ends on insanely annoying cliffhanger)\n-The online playerbase is a bunch of elitist neck-beards that hate new players\n-Even on the hardest difficulty, the game was still pretty simple\n\n\nThis game is all around pretty solid for 29.99. For all the DLC as well, it is 59.99, and completley NOT worth it. Pick this up on a sale, and get the full collection if you really enjoy multiplayer. This game definitley requires that you join a group to have fun with multiplayer.\n\nIf you've wanted to get into Warhammer 40,000, I'd say this is one of the CHEAPEST ways to do so and enjoy it. This is just scraping the surface of the Lore 40k has to offer. I honestly recommend this to anyone looking for a good 3PS.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nGreat 3rd Person Shooter, feels a bit like GoW with less clunkly movement. Game is stupid difficult without a built in 'cover' function, but still very fun. Pick it up on a sale, and only get DLC if you like multiplayer games.","January 11, 2015","true","34.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/55150/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Decent game. The single-player part is a bit boring at times, where you're just walking around, doing nothing. There are also a lot of lifts, with no real function. I think they're there to increase the playtime. Also, I wish there was more variation in environments. About 90% of the game you're inside a building.\nThe shootouts and close combat are satisfying, but can become frustrating. And the reason for that is when you're executing an enemy, you're still open to enemy fire. So while an execution should increase your health again, most of the times it doesn't even help or even gets worse, resulting in too many deaths. And... well, there aren't too many bossfights. I think there are only 2-3. Disappointing.\nThe graphics are sharp, and the voice acting is brilliant (Mark Strong !) though. But this game could've been so much more. Wait for a pricedrop before buying, unless you're into decent games, of course. (The multiplayer is supposed to be fun though, but I've yet to try it.)\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","September 11, 2011","true","10.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Although some of the game's functions may not work as well as the devs might've hoped, it still delivers hardcore killing-action without any delay (sometimes it gets annoying, but what can you do? Stop crying). Surprisingly similar melee weapons give you many opportunities to pulverise, slash and pound your enemies with; so you'll certainly have your fair share of blood and gore (or don't, and just hoard ammo,  hang back and be the kind of captain that says: "No, you guys go ahead into the fight. I'll stay back here and cover you with my little bolt pistol that conveniently has infinite ammo"). And even when you finish the campaign (Which is a challenging go-here-and-hit-these-things type story on it's own) you can go head to head with the other 4 or 5 players that still play the multiplayer feature, or form a team with up to 3 other players and take on 21 repetitive waves of overpowered enemies in the slightly more popular and less broken exterminatus mode.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Felixbz/recommended/55150/","Felixbz","[V-M] Felix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Felixbz/","197 products in account","So I'm updating my previous review which was written at 112 hours of playtime. At present I have just about 548 hours on this game and have to say it's absolutely fantastic if you enjoy Warhammer 40,000 and can get over the occasional lag issues, you will also want to look into joining a clan or a group in order to play the game more frequently.\n\nThe game's story is good, lengthy and an enjoyable slaughterfest of carnage in the Emperor's name, there has not and most likely may not be any game to come out in the near future that will allow you to wield as much power as you do in this game without being overpowered, you never feel that there's no chance of death and tactics are required even though you can cleave through your foe as though they were made of paper, the singleplayer also allows you to perform epic feats through the use of a slow-mo system called "Focus" that allows you to slow down time when in aim-down-sights mode and increase your melee damage by an incredible amount that allows you to cleave through boyz, nobz and meganobz with ease, the game does lose some of its touch when you finally get to the last few levels where you fight Chaos Space Marines, they are much harder to kill and do not feature any sort of gore which leaves a lot to be desired, but the game is pretty good overall even for just the singleplayer, It'll take you about 8 hours to beat if you play on normal, may vary depending on skill of course.\n\nNow. Onto the multiplayer, while it is a laggy pile of crap that often causes desyncs and frustration when people use ridiculously overpowered weapons, it is also bloody fantastic and one of the best and most easily accessible 40k games featuring the Adeptus Astartes to date, no game I've ever played allows you to feel this powerful whilst still being on equal standing with your enemies, you feel like an absolute beast of a man who can tear through an entire team given the right loadout and skill, I've personally gone on 20:0 (K:D) rampages with a stalker bolter with precision shooting in both long range and close combat, it's absolutely visceral and I love it. There are of course the issues of lag which cannot be ignored, every other game will lag worse than playing with Dial-up, remember downloading a 1 minute youtube video for about 8 minutes? that's basically what this multiplayer can be like, people warping around, instakilling you but taking no damage and even receiving no damage even though they stand still. It's very buggy and can get very frustrating but with a group to play with, it's absolutely amazing.\n\nNow, I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price unless you're satisfied with the singleplayer content as the game's multiplayer is becoming less and less active with the upcoming release of Eternal Crusade, I'd say pick this game up on a sale if you can, play it and enjoy some multiplayer games if anyone is still playing but I'd recommend anyone who loves Warhammer 40,000 keeps an eye on Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade, it's an upcoming MMOTPS in the style of Planetside 2 set in the 40k universe, it's shaping up to be absolutely amazing and definitely a game people will want to pay attention to if they love the 40k universe as much as I do.","October 22, 2015","true","548.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is because with the removal of the Warhammer universe, I would not have enjoyed playing what ultimately is a rather reptitive and linear room to room combat game--though the combat can be very enjoyable at times. I enjoyed this game mostly because I was witnessing all of these references to the Warhammer Universe that were scattered throughout, I was paritipating in Ultramarine storyline against the trickery of the Chaos Gods and that is cool for any Warhammer fan.","April 7, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only major flaw this game suffers from is stupid ally AI that will walk around in the open, take fire, and not return it. A great resolution to this would have been online co-op, but sadly there's no singleplayer co-op.\n\nI just want to point out that Space Marine is the first game in what was supposed to be a trilogy, but things happened, companies went extinct, and there may never be any sequels. With that said, the ending ends on somewhat of a clif-hanger leading up to the next game. However, don't let that stop you from experiencing one of the best & most fun games I've played in a long time. You will indeed feel like a bad @$$.","April 17, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadlicated/recommended/55150/","tadlicated","Tadlicated","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadlicated/","117 products in account","I bought this game for $10 because i loved the Warhammer 40K series. Warhammer made great Dawn Of Wars in RTS modes but when i saw it in third person shooter i was thinking what the ♥♥♥♥? When i took a closer look i saw Games Workshop + THQ. Now that blew my mind. I loved Games Workshop's games and THQ's games so i imediately bought it and played it.\n\nFirstly, the campaign is extraordinary with sublime graphics. The cutscenes had fine graphics and the gameplay was awesome! I could not believe how well developed the questline was. Just like Darksiders 2, there is fast gameplay in the campaign where you start off with a chainsaw and a bolt pistol. Then you start cutting all the bloody orks up and Captain Titus does not give a ♥♥♥♥! Next, throughout the campaign, you develop better weapons and a special skill as well which allows you to restore health. New melee weapons such as the Power Axe and the Power Hammer is unlocked. Some levels even allow you to equip a jetpack! When wielding the Power Hammer and flying on a jetpack, the combos and skills combined are absolutely magnificent. Smashing up Ork boyz and beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of ♥♥♥♥tards who get in your way! When combos are used correctly, you are unstoppable. Through out the game you also discover weapons such as sniper rifles, laser snipers, heavy bolters, plasma pistols, plasma bolters, grenade launchers and lots more! Later in the chapters, the chaos demons and the chaos space marines appear from a portal after Captain Titus was used as pawns by the Chaos lord. Now havoc wrecks the place and Captain Titus has to save the world with his two companions. In the campaign there are 17 chapters! Each chapter last about 15-45 minutes (depending on difficulty and your skill level). After the campaign there is an epic epilogue to it but, we aren't finished yet.\n\nAfter finishing the campgain there is an online option! In the online section there are 4 main different types of games. Versus, Versus Private, Exterminatus and Exterminatus Private. Versus is basically PVP where you can choose between lots of modes such as capture the point, team deathmatch, free for all, capture the flag and seize ground. The versus servers are still really active filled with players. Versus private is basically versus except it is only for friends and solo. Exterminatus is the co-op survival mode. You can play with 2-4 players on 4 different types of maps. After every 5 rounds you switch to a different map but with harder monsters. In Exterminatus you kill Orks. On the last wave (bonus wave), stage 21, chaos demons and chaos space marines invade you and you must kill them all to win. Exterminatus private is basically exterminatus but with friends/solo only. In multiplayer mode there are 41 levels in total. When you reach level 4 you obtain a place where you can customize you space marine/chaos space marine. When you progress through each level you can unlock more gear, weapons and perks. Armour can be unlocked by finishing really hard challenges or you could buy custom ones from the steam DLC shop for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. In multiplayer there are 3 types of main roles:\nTactical: Carries a default bolter and a deafult chainsaw\nDevastator: Carries a default pistol and a deafult heavy bolter\nAssault: Carries a default pistol and a defaul chainsaw\nThe tactical is the support. The devastator is the tank and the Assault is the damage per second. The assault usually wields power axes and power hammers or it can wield relic items from the DLC.\n\nThis is one of my favourite Warhammer 40,000 games. Games Workshop already makes great RTS and THQ makes great bloody third person gamers such as Darksiders II. If you are a Warhammer 40,000 fanboy, love THQ games, love Games Workshop games, love Darksiders II or if you love thrid person shooters/third person games then you HAVE to buy this game. DO NOT wait any longer buy it now! The only thing that's stopping you is the price -_- Although it is slightly over priced ($39.99) you might want to wait a while until it's about 50%-75%. Stunning graphics, unbelievable gameplay, good multiplayer, great features and epic weapons and classes! MUST PUT ON YOUR CHRISTMAS WISHLIST FOR 2015!!! DON'T LISTEN TO THE ♥♥♥♥ED UP NEGATIVE REVIEWS! BUY THIS GAME NOW\n9/10\nChop\n2015","January 11, 2015","true","39.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"

Honestly, it is very tough to say a game is perfect, but this gets very close.\n\nTL;DR @ bottom.\n\nPros:\n+Pretty up to date textures\n+Nice amount of weapons that you can choose from\n+Smooth controls (I would recommend a gamepad if you have one, although M&Key is OK.)\n+Pretty great soundtrack\n++Amazing voice work\n+++One of your Ultramarines looks like Anthony Hopkins\n+Decently long game\n+Plenty of multiplayer content\n\nCons:\n-Due to THQ going bankrupt, there will be no sequel to this *planned* trilogy. (Ends on insanely annoying cliffhanger)\n-The online playerbase is a bunch of elitist neck-beards that hate new players\n-Even on the hardest difficulty, the game was still pretty simple\n\n\nThis game is all around pretty solid for 29.99. For all the DLC as well, it is 59.99, and completley NOT worth it. Pick this up on a sale, and get the full collection if you really enjoy multiplayer. This game definitley requires that you join a group to have fun with multiplayer.\n\nIf you've wanted to get into Warhammer 40,000, I'd say this is one of the CHEAPEST ways to do so and enjoy it. This is just scraping the surface of the Lore 40k has to offer. I honestly recommend this to anyone looking for a good 3PS.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nGreat 3rd Person Shooter, feels a bit like GoW with less clunkly movement. Game is stupid difficult without a built in 'cover' function, but still very fun. Pick it up on a sale, and only get DLC if you like multiplayer games.","January 11, 2015","true","34.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/55150/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Decent game. The single-player part is a bit boring at times, where you're just walking around, doing nothing. There are also a lot of lifts, with no real function. I think they're there to increase the playtime. Also, I wish there was more variation in environments. About 90% of the game you're inside a building.\nThe shootouts and close combat are satisfying, but can become frustrating. And the reason for that is when you're executing an enemy, you're still open to enemy fire. So while an execution should increase your health again, most of the times it doesn't even help or even gets worse, resulting in too many deaths. And... well, there aren't too many bossfights. I think there are only 2-3. Disappointing.\nThe graphics are sharp, and the voice acting is brilliant (Mark Strong !) though. But this game could've been so much more. Wait for a pricedrop before buying, unless you're into decent games, of course. (The multiplayer is supposed to be fun though, but I've yet to try it.)\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","September 11, 2011","true","10.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

For those of you that know what I mean by "predictable" I mean over done, and here's why:\nThe Space marines have been on almost all the marketing for Warhammer 40k. Because of simple box art this usually results in people outside of the fanbase thinking "oh hey, those are the good guy Spartan people from Halo of duty fighting demons in Hasbro reskin armor....Let's go make a chess game out of it...With grenades and AOE attacks...Ya'know, just like chess."\n\nSo you better like the Space marines 99% of the time because that's what you are going to get until someone revisits Fire Warrior, or release a game about Eldar, Imperial Guard, hell the Orks sound fun! ♥♥♥♥ it, let's begin the review.\n\nThe Campaign  You play as captain Titus, an ULTRAH SPHESS MEHRIEN! sent to this Forge world with a mission to retake the city from the massive Ork horde. But wait! Turns out the Orks are being led by someone with a brain! Just so you know I'm being sarcastic, it's no surprise who it really is and the videos on the store page give it away before you even purchase the game.\nThere isn't much to talk about the campaign for Space Marine, it's simply 'meh' it's not bad but it isn't good either. It's just...Decent, at least enough to keep you going, unless you get tired of getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by Nobs in tight hallways.\n\nThe Gameplay  To be honest I'm a little disappointed. The execution animations get tiresome after a few hours so that means you'll be playing this game in sips.\nThe ranged weapons also feel dull, and campaired to the awesome power of the melee weapons within the game I felt like there was no point to the guns. It's like giving the player Excalibur at the very start of a game then tell him/her that he/she should use a squirt gun instead...Chances are you're going to go with the over powered weapon they just gave you.\n\nBut if that was the only flaw within the gameplay I would call this just nit picking. Unfortunately this is a console port...Best way to say that is "♥♥♥♥ keyboard players!"\nI rarely use controllers since I play 70% of the time on my desktop/laptop. But there are games out there that are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to play without a controller. So, how bad is it? Well the mouse feels slow and unresponsive. The keys are placed in odd areas on the keyboard, for example: by default the 'ctrl' key is the aim button. Character movement on the keyboard is sluggish and hard to control, espeically while sprinting- (I feel like I'm driving a heavily armored gothic bumper car with chainsaws attached! and there are no breaks!)\n\nAnd then there is the audio...The XBOX360 version of Space Marine's sound is perfectly fine, but on the PC? Sound tearing everywhere! This happens generally when there are a large amount of enemies in the area, this is a game about fighting Orks by the way...Enjoy the sound of- "WAAAAAAA-RIIIIIIIP*STUTTERSTUTTER*-AAAAAAAH!!!!" I assume Space Marine suffers the same problem Source games have, but I can't confirm this so I won't go into too much depth about it (god knows I get enough flame wars on these reviews just for saying Hack'n'Slash instead of Hash'n'Slash...Yeah don't ask)\n\nThe Multiplayer  Normally I'd say the more content the better, but I think multiplayer is the reason why less attention was placed into the singleplayer. But besides that, you start off with a class selection and a long ♥♥♥ road of unlocks (oh joy)\nTactical, your basic soldier with a bolter rifle and a selection of grenades. After progressing for a while in multiplayer you'll find yourself with a wide selection of guns to use such as- the Plasma gun, sniper rifle, storm bolter, and finally a grenade launcher. Sadly other bolter varients from the lore are not in the game. Also the flame thrower isn't in there either which I have a hard time understanding.\nHeavy bolter marine, he starts out with a heavy bolter but eventually you get a las canon and a plasma cannon. Although I don't know why because the only "vehicle" in multiplayer is the Dreadnought, and that's a 9.99 DLC!\nFinally the Assault trooper, this is the most fun you'll get in multiplayer, jumping around from place to place with your jetpack. You start out with a chain sword but eventually you unlock stuff like the power axe and the thunder hammer. Sadly he dominates the other two classes once you get the hammer and it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ just killing one of them.\n\nThe Final Verdict  When I first bought this game I wanted to give this game at least a 7/10! But later down the road I realised this game is mostly generic. And at it's worst, the PC port was hard to play with all the audio tearing and bugs.\nThen the multiplayer didn't help with the stupid ♥♥♥ progression system children these days demand we have in all of our game selections. If there were no loadouts or leveling system, just pick a gun up off the map then it would be fine. But because Call of Cancer has devoured the minds and hearts of game developers, publishers, and consumers alike we may never see triple A titles free themselves from this terrible trend.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a 5/10! The console version is a 6/10, but only because the controls and the movement were smoother, and the audio wasn't making my ears bleed. It's decent, but that's all this game has to throw. My suggestion? Get this game when it's on sale, because Relic are a collection of fairly decent folk it goes on sale around 17 bucks every now and then. Until someone stops making Space Marine centered games I'm going to wait another 5 years.","October 3, 2015","true","44.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Extremely enjoyable ride. Ride full of slashing limbs and making big holes in torsos and vaporizing hundreds and thousands (definitely thousands) of green skins and heretics.\n\nThe combat mechanics are nothing new, but they are well polished and the killing enemies is satisfactory. The melee fighting in large groups of foes could take some work because your character starts to stutter when he is being hit from every possible side and angle. But it's still better than being surrounded by group of enemies and being attacked only by one at a time (ehm ehm AC ehm ehm). Shooting experience is also really good, as is the feeling of watching explosion of blood after a bolt from your weapon penetrates the body of your target. The execution mode which regenerates health by finishing enemies has nice range of incredibly good looking animations.\n\nThe weapon progression is slow but steady. You have 4 different melee weapons and 10 ranged weapons at your disposal. Through out the game you'll find fury seals (something like a berserker mode) which will upgrade your ability. But only with something incremental as longer fury time, or regenerating HP by inflicting damage. Those are nice things to have, but there could be something more interesting gameplay wise. The steady progression comes to a halt few chapters before the end of the game, which is kinda sad. There are also few instances where you have a jetpack, whit which you can propel yourself up into the air, find a group of foes and fall down on them dealing massive damage, stunning them and looking at the awesome shockwave.\n\nThe level design isn't anything special or even good. It's a corridor with a lot of curves and vertical traverses. But even though  it isn't great from gameplay point of view, the game has an amazing atmosphere. I love postapo and I could feel it everywhere I've went. It was awesome, the heavy feeling that this world is doomed and that there is no hope for civilians. And that I'm here to help however I can, fighting "alone" against the never ending hordes. This is nicely complemented by a atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nThe story isn't something special, it's your generic shooter story with a villain and wanna be twist waiting for you somewhere. But I would say that for a WH40k fan it has to be really enjoyable. It's a game that is suppose to be pure fun and relax, not something to think about, so I don't see a problem with the story line. The only weak point was the final boss fight which was a dull sequence of the same QTEs over and over again.\n\nThere isn't anyone in the multi player right now which is sad. Because when I've played it with friends few years ago it was great fun. There are some basic modes like versus (team against team) or you can play some parts of the story (I don't think it's the whole story, but I can't remember) with a group of friends.\n\nMy conclusion is that it's a great entertaining game, pure fun from killing thousands of enemies and I can recommend it to everyone.\n\n8.7/10 (I like the number 7)","July 31, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Weapon selection is annoying, and weapon swapout points always occur BEFORE a save point, locking you into a weapon set that may be completely unsuited to your needs in the next section.\n\nIf you're buying this for the single player campaign, dont bother unless you're getting it dirt cheap.","May 9, 2015","false","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I play tabletop (dark angels/eldar) and have pretty much grabbed up every single title the 40k universe has to offer. I did not like this as a game simply because there is SO much wasted potential.\n\nTL/DR version: Fan of 40k, buy on sale for campaign. Otherwise their servers are terrible and it falls short in many ways.\n\nCampaign Pros:\n\n*you vs hordes of orks\n*cool weapons, and they function mostly as they should\n*artistic enviroment true to a 40k forge world\n*Warlord class titan is pretty spot on\n* Inquisitor and plot surrounding him is so good.\n\n\nCampaign Cons:\n\n*Whiniest space marine ever in Leandros. Hate hate hate his character.\n*Find yourself running through empty areas and thinking "there should be something here"\n*zero progression. no new abilities really.\n*jump pack out of fuel gets a little annoying, not much more than a tease.\n* Story conclusion tries to be epic, ends up being "press this button to win"\n\n\nI played through the campaign on normal then the hardest difficulty. It gets repetitive very quickly, even with new enemie types added periodically.\n\nThey tried to change from the common halo/call of duty you have this much hp/shields and it regens at x speed. Space Marines do not hide, they charge into battle killing as effeciently as possible. It is too bad that most of the time sync kills on enemies which should regain your hp only cause you to take more punishment from other foes. You end up fighting more like a Raven guard or alpha legionare (not bad just not what was promised)\n\nMULTIPLAYER!\n\nPros:\n\n*customization is so darn cool! weapons and armor.\n*requires some skill, most of the time (exception melta in close confines)\n*dreadnought dlc is so hardcore\n*Ranking up weapons is not so much grind but skill in unlocking the set requirments\n* Co op comp stomp mode is great!\n\nCons\n\n*Their servers. They are simply the worst I have ever played on in any game. More detail on bottom.\n* Some guns are obviously more powerful than others, not uncommon to see the same loadouts all over\n*unlocking gun abilities in private servers with freinds letting you kill them kind of removes takes x skill to achieve x perk\n\nHonestly this game would have stomped its competition if a few small tweaks had been made and one major one. It felt like they spent $2.50 on their servers. Constant connecting to host mid battle as it tries to find the best one. Usually ends of finding the guy farthest away so everyone but him lags.\n\nI hope this review helps you make your decision.\n\n","December 22, 2014","false","70.9"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skarrphedinn/recommended/55150/","Skarrphedinn","Skarphedinn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skarrphedinn/","322 products in account",""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine". The game where you're supposed to be the best of the best. One of the strongest thing in the Imperium of Man, however. That is not the case. I bought this game on release a few years ago when it was released and stopped at just at the beginning of Chapter 3. But as the years passed. I couldn't exactly remember why I put down the game, I saw it in my library and figured I'd reinstall it. I couldn't phantom why I put the game down without finishing it. So I booted up Singleplayer again to finish my campaign.\n\n\nI recall watching an interview for the game before its release. I remember them saying, "You're a Space Marine. Cover is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Space Marine is designed to keep you in the fight." They completely failed on this. The combat is awful. You aren't a Space Marine, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥. Your shields go down in an instant until you get the Iron Halo (which is at the end of the game). You can be torn to shred by Orks no problem. Even the standard Chaos Space Marines you encounter later on the game are tougher than you are.\n\n\nCombat is flawed from the very beginning. Since you aren't supposed to be in cover, you're getting shot all the time. No matter where you are. There is no rest in a fight. You're always being hit unless you retreat back and hide behind some crates. Even then, most of the enemies. including the orks have unnatural accuracy. You'll learn to despise the Orks with Rokkit Launchas and Chaos Marines with Plasma Cannons, as they'll volley over any cover you're hiding behind and hit you directly. But then, it doesn't matter. Since the game doesn't focus around cover, you'll still take damage from any rockets or grenades that explode on the other side of what you're hiding behind. One hit is enough to completely remove your shield, and two or three more will outright kill you. So if you get hit by all three rokkits at once? You're dead.\n\n\nThe game largely revolves around staying in melee combat and preforming executions to keep yourself going. However, if you try to preform one while in the middle of combat, you'll either get the same amount of health you started with, or you'll just die. As I mentioned, enemies have an unnatural accuracy with all their weapon. During the cut scenes for the executions, you can (and will) still get hit by any ranged or unit within melee range. The unnatural accuracy also extends to the point where they can fire through their teammates and still hit you without killing their buddies. (Excluding Grenades and Rokkit Launchas). Later on in the game you'll start encountering chaos pyskers, they'll fire a beam at you and if you're hit in the open by one. You're as good as dead.\n\n\nFights are all designed around this type of encounter. An extremely powerful ranged unit in the back (or several). While you get swarmed by melee infantry which can quickly over run you. So most of the game is just back peddling into corners to deal with all the melee infantry before you can peek out and take a few pot shots at the ranged units, as staying out for more than a few shots will generally get you killed. This if course, gets worse along in the game as you go from dealing with Orks to Chaos. At some points you'll be getting bombarded by plasma weapons, pyskers and swarmed by traitor guards and regular chaos space marines. Most of those fights require simply dumb luck and very slow movements to progress through. Dealing with Chaos is simply a cluster♥♥♥♥, as when you're distracted with those who pose a threat, you'll be getting shot by traitor guard, who serve no purpose other than to take up half of your screen with the hit indicator.\n\n\nSo the game is about 6-8 hours of the same combat over and over, ontop of artificial difficulty. It quickly gets frustrating as the game has no actual save system, just check points. Which is extremely annoying as dying some times will put you back right before a lengthy cut scene. (Looking at you, boss fights). Which are unskippable. The game is the same story as literally every other Warhammer game. You're under attack by orks, then SURPRISE ITS CHAOS, even though it was completely obvious from the beginning.\n\nEven the very end wave fight is awful, and insanely harder than the last boss.It consist of going through several waves of enemies with little to no cover. Each wave having more ♥♥♥♥ tacked onto it. If you fail it, you have to start back down the hallway so you have to run back and watch the same few minute long cutscene again. The Boss fight after it is a compete joke, its an on-rails quick time event where you fall down a spire. A few moments have free movement where you can dodge stuff thrown at you. For some reason you can fire, but Titus just holds his gun to the side and all the bullets fly off the screen.\n\nThe secret to killing the boss is this:\n\n1-1-1, hit space, 1-1-1, hit space. Hit F, cutscene. Repeat x2-3 times.\n\nCongrats, you win.\n\nTL:DR?\n\n- You play as a weak ♥♥♥ Space Marine Captain.\n- Muh Ultrasmurfs.\n- Awful, repetitive combat.\n- Extremely accurate orcs.\n- Demons are somehow weaker than Chaos Marines.\n- Same exact story as any of the other games.\n- Bad check point system.\n- Dead Multiplayer.\n\n\nIf you're a 40k fan, you'll find several annoying flaws in the game. So I'd recommend passing this game up and go play Dawn of War or Chaos Gate. Something else worth your time.\n\nIf you're looking to have some fun and don't care about repetitive combat. Pick it up for when its less than 20 on a steam sale, forget about all the DLC since mutliplayer is dead.\n\nIf you're looking to just play Multiplayer. Don't. The only active game mode is Exterminatus, all of the others are dead. Including the DLC ones, even Chaos Exterminatus. So save yourself the money.","October 14, 2015","false","22.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","6"

I WANTED it to be good.\n\n...however, this game is AWFUL.\n\nWhat we've got here is a boring, linear, repetitive third person action/shooter game.

The failure to find a sweet spot for game play turns this sour early & stays sour. As a button masher this isn't the worst I have ever played but it forces you to close the range gap to heal your self in close combat with stuns & then death blows, that fails to work when you are getting shot at & have a mob of over 10 orc's around you. The shinny did hit the mark with the feel & story that is 40k but if you cant enjoy the game at all I don't see how that could raise the mark at all. The more I played this game the more I just hated it, you don't feel like a space marine you feel weak & frail not a gene altered human that's 8 ft tall in armor & that has been trained to handle every thing. One of the major problems just comes from the play balance having 360 combat all targeting the player with shooting raining down & no way to get healed but to stay in the melee mix just fails as it drags out every combat & makes the next combat worse if you didn't get healed & remember you still have to run to the shooters to kill them or just get chipped away as you shoot back & don't get healed, the game really just felt like pulling teeth after some levels. This is the fan in me that cant let this one go the bolter is a gyrojet rifle (look it up its a real weapon) not a machingun & it just makes the space marine so much less, a bolter is for a skilled fighter one shot = one kill the machingun is for some one who cant shoot & needs 20 shots to hit...","November 28, 2013","true","45.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For example checkpoint saves. Why? Secondly, random slow down on screen and no FPS drop. Literally, things go slow-mo for no reason at times. And, this problem has existed for a while, too. With QA like this, THQ deserves the slide they're in. The Art department needs a ♥♥♥♥ing raise and employment else where as they did a fantastic job. In fact, all of Relic did great here, but THQ constraints no doubt put a damper on a lot of the awesome, leaving a great game just being good.\n\nThe biggest and most daming problem is the multiplayer: No ♥♥♥♥ing dedicated servers? Kiss my ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥. Dedicated servers are ♥♥♥♥ing superior to P2P. Not only that, the game builds up the customization of the player only to LOCK AWAY ALL OF THE ♥♥♥♥ING CUSTOMIZATION. Almost no one plays online, so when you unlock the Customizer, you have ♥♥♥♥ all save for paint jobs. Unlocks are a fad that needs to ♥♥♥♥ing go the way of the dodo.","September 12, 2012","true","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I installed it in the morning and finished the campaign in the evening. If you're not interested in the multiplayer (which I'm not) there isn't a whole lot of content to be worth the 30 or so they ask for. I picked it up on sale so I don't feel particularly burned by that. It's another one of those console ports that's designed to be beaten in a single rental session.\n\nThe gameplay is more or less what you'd expect from a God of War clone, just set in the WH40K universe. You can tell Relic doesn't make this kind of game very often, because there isn't even the oh-so-modern feature of being able to huddle up against some cover at the push of a button, like you'd expect in Gears of War or Mass Effect or whatnot.\n\nThe story was as mentioned very short, and kind of bland as well. Orks show up, Chaos shows up, you kill a lot of stuff and then it's over. That's about it.\n\nStill, smashing orkies with a power hammer was very enjoyable.","December 7, 2013","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is an intrinsit problem when combining those two gameplay elements.\n\n7 / 10.","June 25, 2014","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
