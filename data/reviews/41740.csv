I can imagine this game being thought of one late night at the office with nothing better to do. Theories asside, lets talk about the game.\n\nThe story of the game is somewhat hard to follow, but without trying to give out spoilers here, you must help these mechanical "gods" re-create the world with your engineering and creative powers. There are four seasons in the game, each one with different themes, like winter freezes all the water so you can drive on it. The game took me about six hours to finish, and thats with me messing around a bit. After you finish the story mode there are little to no reasons to do it again. The only thing for replay is sandbox mode, where you play around on the island with many (but limited) tools, making any vehicle your heart desires.\n\nOne small thing this game did horribly is sound, the begining sequence the voice acting was bad enough to make me want to quit the game. It got better from there, but the sound just isnt there in this game.\n\nThroughout the game there is a little bar at the bottom of the screen that tells you what to do next, but I would of rather seen a check list menu or really anything other than this. It doesnt grab your attention easily, and I offen times would find my self forgeting about it and wondering what to do next. Other times when I did see it, what it said didnt make sence, one example that tool me awile to figure out was, near the end of the game it told me to "Find a large object" and it tool me almost fifteen minutes to figure out what I was suppost to do.\n\nNow the big grabber in the game, making your own vehicle, is somthing this game does fairly well, you startout with a base for your vehicle and build from there. So, say you want to build a car, start with a car base, add a few connectors, add wheels to the connectors. and you are all set! However, on occasion you will run into problems. The game gives you blueprints that you can find, these are pre-made vehicles that\nA. get the job done,\nB. Are faster to make and,\nC. Look cooler than anything I could make.\nBy the end of the second season I found myself going to these rather than building anything myself. Also the gravity and physics in this game dont feel right. Planes and helicopters feel like they're made from paper, the cars are too drifty, and the boats feel like your anchor is alwase down.\n\nAll in all this game is a quirky, fun, just plain weird building game that lets you be creative in a world full of weird things. But the story isnt there, the gameplay is diffferent and it really feels like its incomplete. But if you have six plus hours to burn, this isnt the worst of all choices. (Just dont get it for full price) :)\n\nGameplay.....7/10\nPhysics........6/10\nStory............5/10\nReplay..........4/10\nSound...........5/10\nGraphics.......6/10\n\nOverall.......6","November 29, 2013","true","6.3"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","50","53","0","0"

It's ♥♥♥♥ing weird, which is what I have come to expect from Ice-Pick Lodge, and why they're probably my favourite developer. They never play it safe, and they're always trying something new.\n\nCargo is totally strange, set around a rather shakey premise (stopping the rotation of the planet would NOT "switch off" gravity... I'm just saying) involving harvesting Fun (the game's currency) from little naked dudes and conversing with these mechanical "gods" with grotesque circus masks...\n\nThe voice acting is dreadful (may just be a problem with the English version, the developers are based in Russia), the music is obnoxious and the controls at times can be frustrating. The story is convoluted and doesn't make a lot of sense, and the tasks the game has you carry out are nonsensical and vague. So why do I like it? I am not entirely sure, it just has a certain charm to it, it made me think about metaphysics I didn't expect it to and on occasion surprised me.\n\nMy recommendation is don't play this if you expect a polished or familiar experience, but if you want to play a game that is nothing like anything you've played before I can't think of many better candidates.","October 18, 2014","true","12.7"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blakeyrat/recommended/41740/","blakeyrat","Blakeyrat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blakeyrat/","1179 products in account","An entertaining, if confusing, game\n\nStory Summary: Three bumbling Gods responsible for recreating Earth as an experiment hire a zeppelin captain and his pilot/mechanic Flawkes to deliver parts so they can repair their planet-building machine. The devil, who sabotaged the planet-building machine, talks Flawkes into editing the Earth into his own image. Flawkes must entertain the proto-humans (called Buddies) to produce FUN, a currency that can be used to build machines and pull heavy objects out of the stratosphere.\n\nThis game is a mix of puzzle-solving and building and driving around in your own crazy vehicles. The faster/higher they go, the more entertained the Buddies will become and the more FUN you earn.\n\nPlaytime: about 6 hours to complete the story mode\n\nPros:\n* The story and visuals are hilarious at times: the first time I had a “Buddy dance party”, I was laughing so hard I couldn’t breathe.\n* Vehicle building is easy and fun, designs can be saved and reloaded at will. Or, if you don't enjoy it, you can use pre-made blueprints and skip vehicle building altogether.\n* Game lets you import and use your own music for Buddy dances.\n\nCons:\n* Crashes, bugs, and insufficient auto-saves. Twice I managed to strand a submarine underneath the seafloor, once while going past a loading screen and another while editing the submarine when it was resting on the sea floor. The game only autosaves at the beginning of a new season, and seasons are very long. I’ve also read reports of the game failing to load saves made at particular times.\n\n*** Important: if you decide to play this, save your game often and save in a new slot each time. ***\n\n* Sometimes it’s hard to know what the game expects you to do. I had to consult a walkthrough for the volcano restarting section in winter, and for the tornado sequence in summer. I also had to look up online what the key for placing clefs was. (Enter.) This might be due to poorly-done translation of the guiding text (Cargo was originally developed in Russian.)\n* Airplanes don’t control well.\n\nIf you’re a fan of games with weird characters and settings, like Zeno Clash, a fan of games where you build vehicles, like Spore or Kerbal Space Program, or a fan of silly nonsense humor, I think you'll enjoy this game.","December 8, 2013","true","6.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Actually, if they did make this game, the result would be a bit more coherent and a lot less bewildering than this! I appreciate what the game is trying to do - blend surreality and a little of everything into their game, then marry it to their vehicle building gameplay mechanic. You build vehicles! You're not really sure why you're building them or why the hell you're doing this, but the main thing to know is this: You can kick little naked midgets off of the sides of mountains for points. Plus you can put music in the game and have the little naked midgets dance to this. The high point of this game is getting the little naked midgets to dance to The Residents' Commercial Album.

I played it to the end (one end of two), and only stuck it out to check it off a list of games I have in my library.  It is short (less than 6 hours).  The physics of the game are frustrating (especially at the end when flying comes in).  The humor is not my style, but it may be yours...  The story is terrible.  Making your own vehicles serves little to no purpose as the blueprints of vehicles are often good enough.  They force you to build one time during the game, but that even that was limited (as there was only one real option on how to build).  I do not think this is worth your time let alone money.\n\nI should add that the time listed for me is slightly off due to steam network issues.  It was less than 6 hours of play time though.","January 30, 2014","false","3.7"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","26","46","0","0"

If the part of Garry's Mod that you liked was the building part, or if you ever played Garry's Mod and were all like "Man, I wish it was easier to make awesome vehicles", this game.  The storyline barely makes any sense, but it is hilarious.  Don't go into it thinking "OH MAN WHERE'S MY PERFECT PHYSICS" or "GAAAAAAWD GUYS THIS PLOT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE".  It doesn't need to.  It's not supposed to.  It's fun.  It's just fun.  That's all it's suposed to be.  Build random things, play with the bizarre locals, have a few hours of laughs and giggles, then put it down.  You won't play this every day, and you won't ponder over the story and its depth for days to come.  You won't.  You just won't.  But it will let you have fun for a few hours, and it will teach you that sometimes replayability or depth just aren't necessary for a game.\n\nIf you go in demanding these things and ignoring what Cargo! is trying to show you, you will be let down.

Holiday Sale because it looked like quirky fun...and (ok) because I wanted the achievement for the steam badge or coal or whatever it was.  I enjoyed playing it briefly then, though I seem to recall the vehicle construction feeling a bit clunky and frustrating.  I got whatever the achievement was, and played for another hour or so, and then dropped it until tonight.  Picked up from my savegame, and after the initial confusion of wondering wtf was going on and what music notes did, got back into it.\n\nIt's definitely different, and quirky, and humorous.  The vehicle creation can be a bit frustrating, particularly until you get used to it a bit (dragging vs clicking, making sure you click on joints so you don't reset the piece type, etc.), but the only real remaining frustration I had there was when I couldn't delete a piece because it had attachments (I think it was based on the order you placed the pieces, so that even if there was a valid "connection" elsewhere, it wouldn't let you delete the initial "connection", resulting in having to remove and recreate a whole bunch of pieces).   If you are expecting something serious, or competitive, or particularly challenging I doubt very much you'll enjoy this.  Revel in the silliness, play it casually, and ♥♥♥♥ around plently and you're likely to have a good time.  I'll probably revisit it at some point in the future to make silly vehicles, and try out using custom music so I can have all my buddies rocking out to Cypress Hill, because that sort of thing amuses me.","December 31, 2013","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Which was the first 2 minutes of the game. You crash land on an island filled with masked gods (Which have the longest, most annoying, and out of context conversations) and small man babies that you can kick around the island for some kind of point system. The objective of the game is to rechieve enough pieces from your blimp to rebuild it and fly off the god for sacken island. From what the trailer and images showed is that it is a sandbox adventure game in which you can create various aircrafts and boats to do various tasks with. But from the gameplay it shows that you have to pay in game currency for parts of the ships and it took me the two hours of playing this game to figure out how to activate the building sequence.

You also design custom cars, ships, and airplanes from parts you find laying around or you buy from god (who is comprised of 3 masks).  It's not too difficult to make things, but you can't get too elaborate because if you leave the Buddies alone too long they start jumping into fan blades and such.  There's some puzzles to solve but 90% of the game is keeping the little ♥♥♥♥ers alive so you can kick them to generate fun.

The mechanics are well implemented with the exception some elements not being extremely well polished such as the flying or underwater vehicle controls. I found going to deep or to high very easy to do at times on mistake. The game just really works and is fun. Its not extremely well polished but thats almost negligible because the gameplay is solid.\n\nIts an adventure game in a time when good adventure games are dead.\n\nCargo reminds me of Banjoo Kazooi Nuts and Bolts or Garrys Mod (but unlike Gmod theres specific goals and a point to keep playing the game aside from messing around) The major downsides is in its polishing. This is a low budget game from Russia is what it feels like to me, and it is definetly from Russia.\n\nSometimes a puzzle can be confusing as to how to actually solve it but usually just keeping doing what I was doing worked out. That said the puzzles usually arn't terribly repatitive but I didn't enjoy the sub level because I was very unsure of what to do at that point and I was forced to back track for awhile.\n\nBut the setting is very whacky, characters goofy and entertaining, and the game itself is fun. Just building a vehicle once you figure it all out can be fun, while the game isn't terribly long and dousn't drag on fortunately.\n\nIts a good game if you can let go of the negative aspects and have fun with the gameplay and whacky story.\n\nThis game is cuh-razy and pretty cool but its not very high quality unfortunately. But how much can you expect from a Russian game made in an apartment or something like that? Just try to get it cheap, $5 or around there is a decent price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTgkzmx0ZRY\nWatch Giant Bombs quick look!","May 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Their idea of fun is getting kicked around, jumping into high speed fans and getting pulverized, etc.\n\nIf you like games that make almost no sense in our world, are kind of confusing even in their world, and is based on immature and sometimes inappropriate humor, then yes I recommend it.\n\nIf you value your time and money, no.","July 8, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","4","2","0"

I think the devs were on some harsh drugs developing this game. The humor isnt funny, the story is crap, the art direction is crap, the collision is crap, the voice acting is crap, the gameplay is crap, the crafting system is crap... Do you get where this is going yet?\n\nThe game is full of bugs and lacking in features. The jumping mechanic is awkward to say the least. I cant really think of anything good to say about the game.\n\nWhere is the depth to the crafting? Where is a quality control for the volume for the voice actors? It sounds like the captain was recorded in a different studio. Why is "Fun" forced down your damn throat? Hint to the devs ---> if you have to ask if your customers are having fun, THEY ARENT <---- Why are the cut scenes unskipable. Why does it matter to save 1 or 2 buddies when its so easy to get more? Why can you not explore the buildings and such you bring down from the stratosphere? Where is the multiplayer? Why are the buddies so god damn anoying? Who was in charge of the sounds? Who thought the mechanics for the submarine was a good idea? Who thought the lame ♥♥♥ "Organ hero" mini game was fun? Who though the life saver link on the vehicles was a good idea to be such a big part of the game? Why does your character just say "I love my job" over and over?\n\nWhere is the inspiration?
