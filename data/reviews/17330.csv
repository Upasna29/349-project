"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/17330/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Crysis Warhead is a first person shooter, and is a standalone expansion top the original Crysis game. This was released in September 2008.\n\nWarhead follows a side plot to the original story of "Psycho", an ally of the original protagonist, Nomad. You are thrown into challenges on the other side of the island at the same time as the original story.  One change with the gameplay that Warhead brings, is the chance to customize your weapons, allowing you to put silencers, different sights on, and other additions such as flashlights. All of the weaponry which was in the first game is still present here, with the addition of a few new guns such as dual wielding SMGs which are absolutely bad-♥♥♥.  We see the return of the super human style nanosuit too.\n\nWarhead features a optimized version of the Cry Engine 2, but it still lacks 1080P resolutions which is a real shame. The game still looks really nice and blows alot of recently released titles out of the water graphically, even though it is almost eight years old now. The graphics menu has interesting options available, you are basically having to pick the style of gamer you are; you get pigeon holed into categories such as "gamer" or "enthusiast" for example - to me this really doesn't look good. I should be able to pick the graphics options with their regular choices, and not some predefined garbage categories which we see here.  The lack of high resolutions slightly lets the game down. There is a hot-fix you can do by changing .ini file settings, but this also messes with frame rates, and lord knows what else.\n\nThe story is a complete stand alone to the original game, you can play this game first and still be none the wiser that their is a prequel to it. I really like the idea that all of this story is going on at the same time as the original though, it makes the plot seem even deeper than before.\n\nWarhead has some well recorded voice acting, all be it a very generic English accent on the main character, but all of the other dialogue and sound effects are all very good.\n\nThis game has various difficulties, much like the original. Playing on Delta mode, which is the hardest, will certainly give you a well worthy challenge if you are an experienced Crysis/FPS player, stick to the lower difficulties if you just want to see the story as enemies and gameplay takes a significant drop in difficulty.\n\nWarhead, much like Crysis 1, could sometimes be considered as an open world game. The levels which you are playing in, are absolutely huge. There are so many different methods of reaching the same location, that you can play this game exactly how you want it. I personally opted to try a more stealthy approach, and normally games don't really cater for different methods like that, but I was still able to experience everything the same. There are tons of little nuggets of extra story to find throughout each level too, from computers to checkout, to radio broadcasts of propaganda. Plenty of stuff to keep you looking in every building you come across.\n\nA full playthrough of Crysis Warhead will take you just about five hours; depending on how you play. My first run through was a regular all gungho all guns blazing playthrough, which took me just about four hours to complete. My second run, which was my stealthy approach, took me quite a bit longer. Normally I don't get as much enjoyment out of my second run through a game, but I was able to get the same, and if not more enjoyment out of a second playthrough, I was able to see a different side to the game which I didn't see before in the regular playthrough, and the higher difficulties add a little bit more replay ability too.\n\nAs well as the aforementioned resolution issues I had. I did notice a little bit of screen tearing on the cut scenes. Turning on v-sync tanks the frame rate to sub 30, which is unacceptable. nVidia users can enable v-sync in their control panel but you will still get a bit of tearing sadly. I guess that's what you get from older direct 9 version of games when you are running more recent operating systems/direct x versions.\n\nCrysis Warhead definitely stands the test of time when it comes to gameplay and story; it's hard to believe that this game is almost eight years old now. You wouldn't think so with the quality of the gameplay on show. It is a welcome addition to the Crysis franchise and one that should almost certainly be played by fans of the series, and just FPS fans in general.  For the low price of £7,99, you will be getting a significant length story mode, with plenty of replay ability with a very fleshed out story line to boot.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

A lot of other people will probably tell you this too. Warhead feels as if Crytek made it specifically to address that problem. It’s pretty much a more tightly-designed package of Crysis levels with a couple new weapons and vehicles.\n\nIf you were actually interested in what the original Crysis game’s story was about I don’t know what to say, but Warhead’s is slightly better. It’s kind of like the difference between Predator and The Rock respectively, the latter being slightly less cheesy, but still bombastic in its own way. Warhead follows Psycho (the British guy) and features a somewhat decently played-out character arc between him and a new supporting character. That’s all I think I can really say about it.\n\nAside from the original game’s suit powers, a new grenade launcher, EMP grenades which weaken nanosuit-equipped enemies (who are far more common in this expansion) but you as well, drivable APCs, and a couple new kinds of mounted gun, Warhead’s selling point is its superior level design compared to the original game. Luckily the level designers managed to stay strong throughout.\n\nCrysis is a game that, behind its graphics, is hailed for open-ended mission design reminiscent of GoldenEye or Thief with huge maps. Ironically, almost all Warhead’s missions are pretty linear compared to the first game’s. But it manages to be linear without feeling like a Call of Duty-style corridor. It’s a very “wide” sort of linear.\n\nThe first mission ends with an open-ended base infiltration similar to some levels from Crysis, but after that everything is technically a straight line that still manages to give you a lot of options in how you play the game. The vehicle chase sequence immediately following that infiltration somehow doesn’t feel like a scripted event but instead simply has you follow a target within an open area. This is followed by what is, actually, a pretty well-done boss fight to contrast with the first game’s mediocre final boss. Afterwards there’s a section inside a battleship where Crytek actually manages to play some scripting tricks on you without automatically controlling the camera or putting you in a quick time event or anything. It’s almost more Half-Life 2 than Black Ops in this way. Warhead makes even its literal tunnels dynamic enough to let players have a say in how they tackle each combat situation, including a train section.\n\nVisually, Warhead looks slightly better than the original Crysis but hasn’t had nearly as many mods made for it. Fortunately Crytek actually tried to optimize Warhead a bit so for most people the game should run better than Crysis. Warhead’s highest graphical features also aren’t locked behind DirectX 10.\n\nCompared to the first Crysis, Warhead is kind of like the same meal with the same ingredients but prepared more diligently after the chef got some experience.","December 31, 2013","true","14.5"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","34","34","0","0"

See Conclusion\nNOTE: Also see my Crysis 1 Review (though it follows my old review format):\n\nINTRODUCTION:Crysis: Warhead was released in 2008 and serves as the stand-alone expansion to the 2007 hit game Crysis. (Famous for being one of the most technologically advanced video game in terms of graphical and visual fidelity back in 2007, but at the same time, infamous for making most, if not all, gaming PCs at that time obsolete.)\n\nThe player takes the role of former British SAS Sergeant Michael "Psycho" Sykes. He currently serves as a member of Raptor Team (a Spec Ops unit equipped with Nano Suits) who were sent to Lingshan Islands to investigate the presence of North Korean forces. The story takes place after Raptor Team is split up and Psycho is sent on a one-man mission to sabotage various North Korean targets and to capture and recover a mysterious container that the North Koreans are very eager to get their hands on. Discover a new side of the island and join in Psycho's action packed adventure that made some players during the first game wonder what he was doing while Nomad was waging a war as one-man army.\n\nPROS:+ Better optimized to run with more systems than Crysis 1\n+ Beautiful graphics and scenery\n+ Good choice of main character but...(see CON #2)\n+ Large pseudo-open world map but...(see CON #3)\n+ Intense firefights and action packed gameplay\n+ Added Multiplayer (Though I personally haven't played it)\n+ Nice straight forward story that features another aspect of the Lingshen Island Incident\n+ Chicken bullet secret DRM\n\nCONS:- Very Short (3-4 hours played at the highest difficulty)\n- Unimpressive voice acting from some of the cast\n- World map is smaller than Crysis 1\n- Not much re-playability\n- Full price tag does not justify the short campaign. (May be the multiplayer holds it up but then again, I don't play multiplayer)\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION but I can only RECOMMEND this game if it's bought while on SALE or with the Maximum Edition (Crysis 1 and Warhead) or Crysis Collection (Crysis 1, Warhead and Crysis 2).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

While this game isnt really a main part of the Crysis Trilogy but more like an extension of original Crysis which explains how Psycho got his hands on the indestructible Ceph Scout which can be seen on the final mission 'Reckoning' of Crysis. Its a must play for all those who want to play on the good ol' Cryengine 2 World but much more improved and optimised version of Crysis.\n\nThe campaign is very short as the devs put a lot of effort in making the Multiplayer component like more maps. I used to play a lot of Crysis Wars back in the day, it was a great game but its all a waste as EA had to shutdown its servers on most of the old games (including Crysis). There is a mod though, where we can play the Multiplayer but the community isnt much active these days. Its a Sad Reality. Not worth the full price for what it offers but grab it on sale like for 75% off.\n\n7/10","November 28, 2015","true","6.5"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","0"

Even though it’s now 5 years old the game looks fantastic and has some impressive physics (apparently the CryEngine was updated for this). The story is adequate, given the limitations of a game such as this, and the voice acting is convincing throughout. The gameplay is perhaps a little more linear than in the original but it’s also faster paced and more intense. The combat is pretty tough at times, although the final boss battle was actually easier than much of what had gone before. There’s a lot packed into this short game, and that’s the only downside: it’s over way too soon.\n\n5/5","December 1, 2013","true","10.6"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","2"

It still has both open and tight levels (which are alternated between for better pacing), but they are presented differently this time around. The open levels don't quite offer the same freedom of approach and alternate routes as the first game, presenting instead a wide but more straightforward route to your objective. The tighter sections are much better designed and are pretty fun to fight in. Warhead is also more action-oriented, often rushing you into a battle rather than letting you approach a potential encounter from a distance. Fortunately, the game still offers plenty of freedom and options for the player to handle confrontations. Improvements over the first game include the alien enemies, boss battles and vehicle controls. Overall, a short but highly enjoyable campaign.","October 17, 2014","true","11.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Crysis Warhead offers an alternative story from the eyes of Physco another one of the nano-tech marines.\n\nStory:\nOn the same island as the original Crysis Warhead starts the story with Sergeant Sykes, Physco, who is on a vital mission to capture Korean cargo. It is up to you and your friend O’neil to push through the forces of North Korea and aliens alike to complete your objective.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign consists of approximately seven missions, which vary in length. The campaign lasts anywhere from around four to seven hours depending on your play method. The initial missions are before are against human AI, but as you progress the enemy shift begins to occur as you start fighting less humans and engaging more aliens. The enemies, weapons, and abilities are the same as the original meaning this expansion only adds new missions and story. Regardless the campaign is well planned and the levels keep you wanting for me. They offer  dynamic play-styles that allow you to choose your completion style.\n\nGameplay:\nAs in the original the gameplay varies based on your difficulty. I played Delta and noticed most of the game was more about utilizing my cloak ability and catching enemies by surprise. The enemies will fire in the same place if you cloak and run, but if you hide for a few seconds they tend to forget you even existed and continue on with their business. Realistically this game is pretty fun and the combat can be dynamic – if you’re looking for run and gun you’d probably want to play on an easy difficulty. On the other hand if you’re more into sneak and strike then I’d recommend going for a harder difficulty. The abilities are fun, but you’ll notice you tend to use some over others. I rarely found myself using speed or super-strength, but instead almost exclusively cloak and shields (which auto selects when cloak deactivates).\n\n\n\nHints:\n>If you cloak in mid battle and move prone most of the time you can avoid actually having to move as the enemies will be shooting above you.\n>If you see a gun with an attachment you have make sure to drop your gun and exchange for that one. Otherwise you won’t unlock the attachment.\n>The Plasma Accumulator Cannon only fires a short range then explodes sending missiles outwards.  This means to really damage your enemies you need to get close to them.\n>IF you use a flashlight or a laser and cloak they can give away your position.\n\nResults:\nAll and all Cyrsis Warhead is a great addition to the series and even if you didn’t play the first Crysis I would recommend giving it a go. It doesn’t really ruin any elements from the original if you play them backwards, but adds more depth to your Physco who in the first game seemed rather annoying. The campaign offers great complexity and amazing new environments. The graphics are of par to the original, annoyingly not 1080p, but still it looks good enough that you couldn’t tell anyway. I’d definitely recommend this game for someone who loves FPS games.\n\nPros:\n+Suit abilities which allow you to change up your combat style.\n+Loads of different weapons with unique attachments: silencers, lasers, flashlights, grenade launchers, etc.\n+Decent enemy AI and good combat mix.\n+Smooth difficulty curve accommodating for various skill levels.\n+Good length campaign, which offers many new environments and combat scenarios.\n+Good story and addition to the continuation of the series.\n\nCons:\n-Not too many check points, you can manually save but sometimes you’d forget in the head of battle die and be warped back to what seems like the beginning of the level.\n","March 28, 2015","true","7.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","16","19","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/recommended/17330/","Tribeman","Tribeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/","452 products in account","Crysis Warhead, technically a sequel to the original Crysis, you play as Psycho, a teammate of Nomad (the main character in the first game). At some point in the original Crysis, you two split up to handle separate missions, this game takes place right after that and ends right before you meet back up in the original, thus, it is a fairly short game.\n\nStory: 8/10\nBecause it is in the same time-frame and environment as the original Crysis, not much needs to be explained. You already know what is going on, but at some points it felt kind of cheesy and forced, and you are also following this damned container that remains ever out of reach until the very end. Not a BAD story, besides, you are playing this for the fun of messing around most likely.\n\nGraphics and Audio: 9/10\nDespite a few points in the game where my framerate choked out, Crytek did a marvelous job with this game in terms of graphics. This game came out approximately a year after the original, which means they optimized their code and this didn't make my computer want to cry. It runs smoother and looks cleaner, and is completely action-packed from the get-go. Also, the cut scenes are in third person, which I feel is an improvement so you can see how your character is reacting to his situation as it develops. As far as audio, it sounds about the same quality as the original Crysis so all is good in this department.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nSame game as Crysis, but in my personal opinion, I had more fun before the aliens show up. I was looking forward to sneaking around and messing with my Korean enemies, and because this game starts so close to when all hell breaks loose, you don't really get a chance to do that. That aside, however, the controls feel really familiar and smooth, I was going to play with my Xbox controller but when it comes to FPS games, I prefer keyboard and mouse. By the way, the game is Gamepad enabled if you want it to be.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nIt isn't the original Crysis, and that isn't necessarily BAD. The game is shorter and plays MUCH smoother, but I feel that the story in the original was slightly better. Both games are great and I recommend buying both. The game excels at showing what Crytek does really well, creating an action-packed blockbuster movie, but instead of the movie, it is a game, which is amazing.\n\nAdditionally, this game comes with Crysis Wars, apparently a Multiplayer Crysis, I didn't try it, have no interest.","December 17, 2013","true","0.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Coupled with gameplay changes, from minor changes to suit usage for increased usability and general effectiveness as well as overall level and encounter design, there's a different experience available here. It is much more focused on what it wants to deliver and does so at the expense of vast open enviroments, but not so much that there isn't plenty of room for you to breathe and negotiate the areas you're in. There's a perhaps greater emphasis on action as you're carried from encounter to encounter, but this generally feels like an improvement over potentially mundane driving sequences in the original.\n\nThe only major criticism I have of the game is its length. Whilst it maintains a brisk pace from start to finish, it does end after not too long a play-time, howerver it doesn't feel like a let down given its approach as a sort of side-quest from the main game. Of questionable worth in of itself, as an addition to Crysis it provides a really fun accompliament such that if the original was of interest, Warhead should certainly not be ignored.","February 11, 2014","true","4.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I remember this being praised for its better optimisation while the game at the same time had the exact same requirements as its predecessor. Also it looks better, there's not much difference, though, as it uses the same environments / assets as the original Crysis game.\n\nThe story is a tad bit unusual here - instead of this being a continuation to Crysis it actually takes place at the same time. However, the game puts us in the shoes of Psycho instead of Nomad. We pick up the story just after the two buddies get separated - with Psycho alone there's more focus on fighting the Korean military (initially, that is) as the emphasis is on retrieving / destroying the nuclear warhead they have in their possession (hence the title). I liked the in-game cutscenes they made for the game and the fact that we have a Korean colonel as the game's antagonist.\n\nThe campaign is, being part of an expansion pack, shorter than that of Crysis but is a BLAST! I found it more action-packed and interesting (even though we know there are aliens rampant on the island which is not a surprise anymore). Since multiplayer services no longer exist (see the disclaimer re GameSpy on the store page) there's no point in elaborating on that one.\n\nPerhaps there's a solution for that, but this would definitely be something unofficial. Thus, at this point, this game is only worth purchasing for its short but satisfying campaign content. If discounted, it may just be a decent purchase and then you can make up your mind whether or not you want to see what Crytek achieved with Crysis 2.","April 2","true","4.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FALLENV3GAS/recommended/17330/","FALLENV3GAS","MC FALLEN MC V3GAS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FALLENV3GAS/","129 products in account","Pretty Good Game Review Considering (PGGRC)\n5.5 Hours to Complete\n\nTL;DR - Hidden gem and the grandfather of shooters to say the least. This is very similar to the original crysis but is much more of a standalone dlc to crysis and it shown by the 7 missions it has which is less than the 12 mission’s crysis had. It’s the same besides mission length (still good and varied) and the story is through the eyes of a different protagonist which makes little different. All in all both played is the perfect first person shooter package and will make you resent other first person shooters for not having the flexibility and fun of the crysis franchise.\n\nIn depth:\n\nPerformance - Well the game is old. 7 years old at the time of this review. Other games in comparison that are 7 years old look like ♥♥♥♥. It’s actually a lot better than the first crysis with better performance and slightly better graphics as the original crysis had random fps drops despite exceeding the hardware. This is very smooth with no frame drops.\n\nGraphics - So I said the game was smooth that must mean the game must look average right? Nope. Even now the game looks beautiful considering its 7 years old. The game in fact looks better than some games that came out this year. That shows that they actually value PC gaming and did not cash in with consoles the same way they did later on with crysis titles *cough* Crysis 2 and 3 *cough*.\n\nGameplay - Now on to the gameplay: Solid. The gunplay is enjoyable and lots of different attachments which provides different opptunities against each enemy type. Each enemy is varied: From humans having a similar arsenal to you, flying squid aliens which ambush you and vehicles such as helis, jeeps and apcs that will need strategy to beat rather than a bigger gun, though that helps. Might I add that you can also drive them. You can see why I like this game? On top of that the nano suit brings you a new strategy to complete your objective. Armour making you a tank to go guns blazing, Stealth to be a cloak and dagger, dash to completely evade any enemy and strength to just throw ♥♥♥♥ at people. The game is so varied in how you approach objectives and how you complete them because of the open world map and the nano suit. Great in terms of depth and playstyles. Only drawback is the story which is very B-movie. It keeps the game going and gives you an excuse to enter new environments. The story is very generic; aliens evade, take them out, done. Its forgettable and basic so don’t buy it for that it’s the gameplay and graphics this rocks at.\n\nReplayability - A lot. With the playstyle, different weapons, attachments, routes, vehicles and pace can give totally new experiences. Not more to say then the time it took me I enjoyed every bit due to its flexibity and freedom lacking in game today.\n\nConclusion - If you can’t tell I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. Everything besides story just shows the potential and the missed chance many games coming out miss. It’s not about building a story then putting in gameplay. Gameplay is what makes this game because it only focuses on that and as a result it’s amazing and competes with many games out now. Any playstyle is rewarded with the nano suit, weapons, attachments and vehicles. You probably have got it but if you don’t, GET IT.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyleAdder/recommended/17330/","KyleAdder","Slade Wilson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyleAdder/","110 products in account","Because Spelling Crysis normally isnt cool enough...\n\nThis game is a Strong standalone expansion to the original Crysis game which was released on September 2008. Warhead follows a plot that happens during the original story of the first game and explains lots of things from the first game! You follow a Tough as Nails englishman Nicknamed "Pyscho" and he has a very interesting story to tell, although a short one!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687935814\nWarhead features a  clearly optimized version of the Cry Engine 2, with 720p graphics (good for the time.) with lots of settings to choose from. Lots of Mods are also avaliable for people who want current graphics and extra options. (Shooting chickens instead of bullets, infinite energy and custom enemy skins are my favourites.)\nDetermined players will have arange of options with graphics and tweaks if they look hard enough. But the games look itself should be enough for the average player. It is something that it prides itself on, although it is less desirable nowadays.\n\nThe Idea for the story is very well done! The Fact that is isnt a prequel nor sequel really shows the sophistication in the story. It happens exactly on the side of the main plot. Which is rare to see nowadays! It basically deepens the overall story that you play through.\nThe Length is obviousy going to be shorter. But at 3-4 hours, it isnt what players really deserved here. No matter how deep the plot might be, the raw length has to be at least 6-10 hours. Although since this tells a side story, it can be let off.\nIn terms of new addition to gameplay from the first game, not much has really changed. Although there is a new weapon which is amazing (Dual SMG's). Overall Combat and Gunplay hasnt changed, this is mainly because it was released very close after crysis 1 so the devs didnt feel like they needed to add anything. Also since it happens at the same time, itd have to make sense on that scale.\nThats enoguh Briefing, heres the Pros and Cons:\n\nPROS:+ Better optimized to run with more Builds/systems than Crysis 1 since it is newer\n+ Beautiful graphics and scenery, much like the first game which provided a Lush wide area for most of the game.\n+ Good choice of main character with a mysterious past and a great personality. Tough Guy persona, with some english stereotypes and friendly rivalry with his squad mates.\n+ Large Levels with some side objectives at times. (Go to x to extract intel is a common one.)\n+ Intense firefights and action packed gameplay often possible with multiple approaches (eg: Stealth and Action), much like the far cry series!\n+ Nice straight forward story that features Crucial aspects of the Lingshen Island Incident.\nThe Ending is great as well! It basically ties the two games together like a neat knot at the end.\n+Stealth and All guns blazing approaches add some Replayability, especially in the harder difficulties.\n+The Vehicles included (Same as the first game) make travering the map much faster! You wont want to rely on your suit for travel, unfortuntely.\n+Explosions and other visual effects are very well done (Always reminds me of Far cry).. Basically all PC's can run this game now, and thats awesome! The only things that stop people from getting it are the price and a basic interest in FPS games.\n+Once again, the pacing is reminiscent of an Action Movies such a Rambo and even some general parts from Independance day!It even has a Human Antagonist (A Korean Mastermind named General Lee kim Sun! The Chase to capture/kill him really represents the backbone of the story. But the Main"mission" is of course pursuing a Top-Secret Nuclear Warhead that intel believes the Koreans possess. Thats a really dumbed down verison of the summary. If you even remotely liked any of that. Please Get this!\n+Did i mention shooting Chickens as bullets?\n\nCONS:- As it is a standalone game that has to live in the first games shadow, it is going to be very short (3-5 hours max played at the highest difficulty=Delta) Although length of playthrough will obviously depend on the players approach (Completionist, speedrunner, Stealth-focused, etc.)\n- Unimpressive voice acting from some of the cast, some scenes could have had a stronger impact if the voice acting was more convincing!\n- Most levels have a much smaller map-area than Crysis 1, i guess size does matter..\n- Not much long term replayability since it is very linear and theres no unlockables or a big reward for finishing it either.\n- Full price tag definetely does not justify the short campaign at all!\n-Old game=Old issues that fit Old Pc's\n-The game is mainly there to fill in plot gaps, not to introduce lots of new mechanics, weapons, characters or better graphics. This is good for fans of the series obviosuly, but people that buy this game to get into the series will be worse off.\n\nOverall I really enoyed this game, but i had to pay attention to cutscenes or i would miss lots of important info! Flashbacks were a great addition as well, but having a Main Boss to pursue throughout the game was definetely my favourite Section. If you liked the first game and want to continue the ride, Definetely get this! However if you like the information that i provided about it and want to understand the whole story, start from the beginning. I makes a big difference. I would recommended this to any Lovers of FPS, Sci Fi or just general action games.\nI rate this game an 8.5/10!\nThe first two games are so different from crysis 2 and 3 so this could be a suitable stopping point for some players if they wanted. Buy this on sale, it would be a Crysis if you didnt buy this!\n\nLeave a comment below as usual with any questions. Thanks for reading, now if you'll excuse me my Nano-suit needs charging\n-Kyle","May 11","true","61.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Why ? It was better optimized and it was shorter and more action packed. The graphics are about the same, which are still lovely, if you have a capable system that is.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is very simple. Yes, there are special powers that you can switch on the fly, but you'll probably end up using only 1 of them most of the time. It just feels so simple, there's no heart. Call Of Duty manages to pull people in with its first person action moments that really make the player a part of the game. In Warhead moments like these are nowhere to be found. And that's a shame. Because it could've been so much better. But it's not. So... nope, it's not for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/17330/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","In the original Crysis, you fought off North Koreans, discovered an extra-terrestrial plot, and began the fight for humanity, all as the special-ops agent codenamed Nomad. But as you saved the day in the main storyline, your cohort Psycho was off on his own mission. Warhead shows you what he was up to, by putting you in his head and unleashing you against the dastardly enemies who stand in your nanosuit-powered way.\n\nCrysis is an open-ended first-person shooter in which how you proceed is really up to you. Set on a beautiful tropical island filled with lush scenery, flora and fauna, you're equipped with a special nanosuit that allows you to cloak, speed up, increase your strength, or increase your defence. This nanosuit affords you a number of options in how you want to take on your enemies: do you sneak up behind them, grab hold of your target, and toss them into their ally? Or do you stay in the underbrush from a mile away and pick off your targets with a rifle? Of course, you can always just run into battle, guns-a-blazing, if that's your thing. Or punch everything with super strength, sending it skidding across the ground. The possibilities are endless, and it leads to replay certain encounters again and again, just to see the different results.\n\nWarhead doesn't really deviate too much from this formula, but that's alright, because it doesn't need to. Some level design does change, though. Levels are fairly smaller in this expansion, but with more in them. In the original, while you spent most of your time walking through long, lush, but boring valleys, this one had the action more condensed. The pacing is much improved, leading to less running around and more shooting/punching/tossing/humiliating your foes. Overall the game can last about six to seven hours, depending on your play style, so while it not be a lengthy campaign, it's a good addendum to the original's plot.\n\nAdditionally, as opposed to the sudden appearance of aliens doesn't suddenly eliminate the Korean presence on the island like it did in the first game. Both groups will show up as your aggressors throughout the game, sometimes at the same time. This leads to you being able to get them to combat each other, letting you either slink away in the firefight or simply eliminate the last remaining forces.\n\nCrytek have also stated that the graphics have been optimized, and therefore aren't as system-taxing as the original Crysis. While I've heard some reports to verify this, I've also heard that there are some problems with how the game goes about its graphical business. While I didn't directly notice these problems with the exception of an odd framerate hiccup, reports of unreasonable slowdown and graphical glitches are somewhat common.\n\nWhile Crysis: Warhead doesn't really bring anything new to the series gameplay-wise, the expanded-upon storyline and better pacing of the game will intrigue any that enjoyed the original Crysis. Wide open settings, fast-paced action, and the ability to fling someone across a great distance make it a fun game to play, especially with all the different ways to approach a situation. So, while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, if you enjoy a bit of choice with your explosions, and enjoyed the original, Warhead is definitely the game for you.","March 11, 2014","true","6.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you're a fan of the original Crysis then this is a must play as the game has been improved from the original with automatic ammo pick-ups, new weapons and new vehicles. The graphics engine has been slightly upgraded which allows the game to run at a smooth 60 FPS at all times. The action starts from the get-go and does not stop until the end of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/17330/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on March 19, 2010\n\nCrysis Warhead is the official expansion for Crysis, set from the perspective of "Psycho", your Jason Statham look-alike on Team Raptor.\n\nGraphically speaking, the game runs a bit smoother than Crysis, but this is largely because of a lower default LOD scaling distance which results in more pop-in and lower res textures, generally speaking. Not terribly annoying, but graphics nerds will be very upset. What is upsetting is the persistent memory leak problem that I had with the game, which I have confirmed others have as well. Scope in lag, quick turning lag, lag in vehicle segments and cutscenes all result from an overloading of RAM with leaky memory. It needs to be patched.\n\nGameplay wise, it is largely an improvement, with the introduction of many great new features. New weapons, such as the grenade launcher and sidearm smg, AT mines, claymores, and more. New vehicles, like light apcs/recon vehicles with mini-guns and 20mm cannons, and new em-placed weapons as well. The auto ammo pick up feature is very welcome, especially seeing as it also allows you to pick up scopes and attachments automatically. Level design is good, allowing stealth and assault paths for taking down objectives, except when it isn't. Driving missions feature heavy forced action and no stealth, and are confusingly and sometimes inadequately designed. In addition, the game is generally more linear than it's predecessor.\n\nThe story is ok, but it's nothing special, focusing on what Psycho did between Crysis' "Assault" mission and the return to the carrier. His ultimate goal is track down what first appears to be a nuke but later is revealed to be an intact alien marauder corpse. The side story which involves Psycho's relationship to a pilot named O'Niell is a bit iffy, but has a good ending ultimately. I was not a fan of 3rd person cutscenes in Warhead, as the 1st person ones in Crysis were some of my favorites. I understand that Nomad is the main character of the series, not Psycho, and that's why this is done, but considering the majority of the game is played in first person anyway...\n\n\nUltimately though, Warhead delivers more incredible Crysis gameplay in an incredible visual package, from a refreshing perspective. There are just a few hitches along the way.","December 31, 2013","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/recommended/17330/","bohlingc","Kahless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/","322 products in account","Crysis Warhead represents the apex of the Crytek sandbox FPS genre. This is the one and only time the formula's been applied flawlessly. Far Cry 1 brims with promise but is plagued with staggeringly unfair AI and bad checkpointing that can make the game sometimes unfun. Crysis 1 starts off incredible but devolves into linear COD-esque nonsense two-thirds of the way through. After Warhead, Crysis got consolized and turned into a generic linear shooter, and Far Cry got open-worldized and turned into a generic Ubigame.\n\nBut, for the brief duration of Crysis Warhead's 7-hour running time, the style is done perfectly. It's linear, of course, in the sense that you need to go from point A to point B, but there are innumerable paths to take and a variety of available playstyles. Want to stealth through most of the game? No problem! Want to kill everybody? No problem! There is a slightly more linear train level, but you can just jump off the train and sneak through the woods if you want (in fact, on the highest difficulty, you have to - staying on top of the train means insta-death).\n\nThe story is inconsequential and won't make sense if you haven't played Crysis 1, and the game's still a system melter just like the original, but neither of those things diminish how much fun it is to play around in these environments. Thankfully, this game has quick save, so you can play around to your heart's content and try different things without worrying.\n\nDefinitely worth the $20 asking price.\n","December 10, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was the first game on PC that was a fps that I enjoyed. I actually learned to play shooters because of it. The world is soooo immersive. It still keeps up with most games of today. Unlike most shooters you feel your hand is held and led to any direction the narrative is. But with Crysis it is actually roam, and figure it out yourself. Take the tools from your enemy, and you decide how to enter it.\n\nYour a b.a in a military suit, but it doesn't make you invincible. You can't be an idiot with it. You feel powerful, and challenged at the same time, and that's what a great game does. Balance the player with skills, and weapons, and lets them decide their own path towards the same objective. While not making it a realistic hell, or way too easy. Unfortunately Crysis 2 isn't like its beginner. This is the only time you can say that beginning was way ahead of the others to come. This is the grand daddy of the best fps. How unfortunate people now think Call of Duty, and roaming for hours like Battlefield is fun.

Compared with Crysis, the story was more focused in Warhead. In addition to the original weapons, there are a few new weapons like the SMG and shard gun. Some of the other guns have undergone face lifts with custom camo, but there are no other changes otherwise. Enemies remain the same, although more abundant than the first game.\n\nThe best thing about Warhead is that it’s an overall better optimized game by comparison to Crysis. It performs better and is less glitchy. The campaign is shorter, but it’s got a reasonable story that keeps the game at a steady pace. It won’t feel like a completely new experience, but there’s enough action packed levels to keep you on the same level as Crysis. Overall, a decent game.

The result is a game that stands on its own as "better than the original". The characters (now you play as "Psycho", Nomad's former SAS teammate) are now vastly improved, with the game exploring the depths of Raptor Team's  former history. Whereas I did not find General Kyong to be a wholly believable character, I found the ruthless Colonel Lee to be a far more engaging (not to mention competent) villain- it's a pity one could not fight him at the end, like the General in Crysis. So yes, the characters are better. The storyline is slimmed down, which in my mind provided greater coherence throughout the game. Essentially, the player pursues Colonel Lee, who is in possession of some valuable alien technology, all over the island. The missions are now highly varied, from standoffs with hordes of aliens in the frozen mountains to a vehicular frag-fest atop a moving train. The missions absolutely kick-♥♥♥! The weapons have now been substantially modified, with tons of new ones being added in. I absolutely enjoyed the new turrets, the 20mm definitely being the superior one. The Gauss rifle is slightly weaker in this game, which was a little disappointing, but the Sniper Rifle is as accurate and deadly as in the last game. The Hurricane minigun is as good for throwing up a wall of lead as in the previous installation. The last thing I want to point out (aside from briefly mentioning the awesome soundtrack that accompanied this game) is the massive changes to vehicles. The APC has its moments, but without a doubt the best have to be the BMP-esque tank with the 30-or so-mm autocannon, and the AA installation, with its' guided missles and awe-inspiring flak cannons. I missed the vehicular combat in Crysis, and felt that that was an avenue which the developers could expand upon. Here, they have done so. Nothing is quite as thrilling as manning the AA battery and shooting down alien after alien during the final swarm (I have a thing for AA vehicles, as seen by my admiration for the Shilka in Arma: Cold War Assault).\nThis game DESERVES a 10/10, but JUST because it is not Arma: Cold War Assault or Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, I have to take off a small point. It's a clerical issue- anyone who reads this review will know what the real score is!\n9.9/10","September 8, 2015","true","36.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay feels great too. The gamepad buttom mapping is a bit strange and i couldn't change it (IDK why), but if you are using mouse and keyboard, you're going to nail it.\n\nWhat i meant by saying that "the game was not made for me" is that, even though it has some stealth gadgets and stuff like that, i couldn't help but notice that by playing in a stealth approach, i was kind off "doing it wrong". I mean, if you are carefull, you can pass 80% of the game just by walking slowly with your cloak turned on. And that IS NOT fun at all.\nAll i had to do was turn my cloak on and walk slowly on the bush. There's no challenge in that!\nAnother proof that the game was not made to be played in a stealth approach is that some sections you can only proceed after you've killed all of the enemies. And you DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO A SILENT KILL. YOUR CHARACTER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BREAK A NECK AND HE DOESN'T CARRY A KNIFE. Silencers help, but if you use them, you WILL be spotted and alert the whole enemy base!\n\nAnyway. If you like playing games where you walk forward and kill everything in your way, this game is for you. On the other hand, if you like playing games in stealth, you are going to have deal with the no silent kill thing.\n\nI'd give this game a 7/10.","October 15, 2015","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This may be due to my hardware but other more knowledgeable reviewers find the engine lacking.\n\nThe island, i.e. the outside levels, is not overwhelmingly pretty which makes the beach huts somewhat comical. In contrast I really liked and enjoyed the inside levels. They were less forgettable and I were misssing those in the original Crysis, although Crysis had "The Core".\n\nAfter I passed this initial boredom of the tropical trip I started getting annoyed by the badly directed cut-scenes. Those were too long and really slowed the experience of the "story". I wouldn't blame anyone for not understanding the "story" if they had not played the original.\n\nIn terms of presentation I felt like Crysis Warhead tried and someone had some nice ideas but those were not thought through and the execution was severly ragged.\nAs an example I once expected one certain pilot to die and see Psycho (protagonist) experience some emotional turmoil. But instead another nameless pilot (/soldier) died and Psycho copes with this heavy loss by drowning some unknown, unlucky, wounded enemy. Which I came to realize later.. disappointing me subsequently again.\n\nIf Crysis Warhead were an expansion or DLC of the original Crysis (which it is in a way) I would have given it a positive rating but since it is considered a standalone I see it falling just below the threshold to recommend you playing it.\n\nI would recommend buying Crysis Warhead on sale if you liked the original. Anyone else might save their time.","January 3","false","6.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

No real variety in enemies or weaponry here, but the gameplay is a least smoothed.  Its more modern military shooter, less Far Cry 1.  I ran the game via the 64bit exe so my game time on record here isn't accurate.  Seemed to perform better at least.  The story is more self contained thus not disappointing compared to the first but it just holds the story together and isn't at all interesting on its own.\n\nDid you like the first or shooters in general?  Then by all means, play this one, its more of the same and handles and looks just fine.

Nothing is added to the gameplay and it was loaded with glitches and bugs.

I has potential, but for me it was more disappointing, than enjoyable. First of all the bugs... I mean I got killed more times by getting stuck in barrels and other object, than actual enemies. Second the map design was disappointing,  most of the levels were just tunnels and they felt like tunnels, rather than the feel of openness of the original. The new weapons? The mounted ones are good, other than that, the UZI is useless (IMO), and the PAX is just for the finale, it's good but there was no time to enjoy it enough. The story is kinda lame, the cutscenes are sometimes very slow, the incompetence of the soldiers and Psycho's too is kinda lame too (I mean come on he has weapons, and he starts fist fighting every ****** time, and the container is always getting taken away. nice work). The grahics is good and it still looks nice, the swamp map was very good and refreshing. The enemy was good, varied, and the game was sometimes "hard" or just a bit challenging, the new enemy type (the shielding one) was a good idea. Overall if you liked Crysis, you'll probably want to play this too, but IMO don't expect any miracles.

Janky animations, poor pacing, interminably cheesy cutscenes, and poor hardware optimization. The final battle of the game is damn near unplayable on any setting, which was the same problem with Crysis 1. They just overload the level with about 5x the enemy amounts than you ever saw in the previous levels, leading to this sudden slideshow experience. Crappy design decision. It's a damn shame overall, because the main character of this game, Psycho, is infinitely more loveable than Nomad of the original.","March 4, 2014","false","7.4"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","3","18","0","1"

Its basically identical to Crysis, with pretty much nothing new. It's several hours more of the same lame story, and mindless shooting at the same enemies, with same weapons, and same vehicles. Again, and again, and again. Cutscenes are often lame or plain silly, with voice out of sync with characters actions. Ending is lame and plain dumb. Just like Crysis, Crysis Warhead is more of a graphical demo, and system benchmark than actual game. Can get it for $5? Go ahead. Just to see the pretty graphics.

Psycho is a very believeable character and several of his personality are shown which makes for a character that you can connect to quite easily.\n\nDespite being mediocre in story, the game makes up more it in gameplay. The game is extremely fun and is worth playing through several times. Alien fights are epic and require you to plan your actions carefully, or you will likely get caught in an ambush which will require on-the-fly planning and precise movements. AI in this game is a little braindead, but they do well and help you through tight spots in the game's campaign.\n\nHowever, as with every Crysis game I have played, it is my opinion that driving in any one of them is atrocious. Controls are awkward and confusing as both the A D keys control view as does the mouse which takes a lot of getting used to. The vehicles are also incredibly bouncy and get thrown around.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10","August 16, 2012","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's obvious that  the devs put more effort into trying to achieve a more variant gameplay. Besides the usual run and gun missions in which you can freely choose your way of approaching them, there are newly added area defense missions. These are a hell lot of fun due to the awesome cryengine. (SPOILER ALERT!)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/perfectpencil/recommended/17330/","perfectpencil","PerfectPencil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/perfectpencil/","291 products in account","Just like Crysis.. i wish there was a vote inbetween thumbs up and down. This is another "meh" title.\n\nI had high hopes for Warhead. Crysis leaves you on a MASSIVE cliffhanger and I figured this game would go back and you would continue on. In Crysis the characters "Nomad" and "Prophet" go into the alien sphere for what seems like an epic battle. That game ends abruptly right there and leaves you hanging.\n\nWarhead instead of doing what it was supposed to do, just puts you in the shoes of a completely different soldier "Psycho" who you see for a short while at the start of Crysis. Worst still, it takes place along side Crysis on a seperate part of the island. Its not a prequel or a sequel. That's pretty annoying. The only justice in this title is that at least is wraps up Psycho's story somewhat.. problem is the ending of Crysis happens after the ending of Warhead, so even though Warhead wraps up, it can't close off the open story created by Crysis.\n\nSeriously, this is another example of a tech demo and not a full game. Worse still, Crysis at least showed off some amazing design and some really interesting visuals... even if there was no gameplay present during those moments. Warhead on the otherhand just recycles literally all of it's visual content from Crysis and doesn't add anything to the experience. Psycho's storyline is uninteresting. You spend the whole game trying to capture a "thing" in a box. Once you get it the game doesn't have the good grace of even telling you what it is... however by the time I was done I was so burned out on the experience I didn't care. I didn't expect the game to answer the questions it poses so I wasn't dissapointed this go around. I was expecting mediocrity and I got it.\n\nBy why still a thumbs up? True I want to give this a nuetral rating, but it is still fun in it's own right. It barely leans towards a thumbs up, even less so than Crysis did and I was feeling conflicted by that one. I'm 7 years late to this party, but at least writing out this review feels cathartic.","April 3, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Psycho is a very believeable character and several of his personality are shown which makes for a character that you can connect to quite easily.\n\nDespite being mediocre in story, the game makes up more it in gameplay. The game is extremely fun and is worth playing through several times. Alien fights are epic and require you to plan your actions carefully, or you will likely get caught in an ambush which will require on-the-fly planning and precise movements. AI in this game is a little braindead, but they do well and help you through tight spots in the game's campaign.\n\nHowever, as with every Crysis game I have played, it is my opinion that driving in any one of them is atrocious. Controls are awkward and confusing as both the A D keys control view as does the mouse which takes a lot of getting used to. The vehicles are also incredibly bouncy and get thrown around.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10","August 16, 2012","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good.\n\nThis game is better than the original crysis in every respect except it seems to have no idea how to tell a coherent story. Indeed, if I had not played the original game first I would not have any clear idea as to what is going on in this game and as a result it is very necessary to play the original to understand what this game's plot is about. But....the graphics are better, the game runs better, there are even fewer bugs and the same great enemy AI has been retained.\n\nLike its predecessor, this game encourages you to "think outside of the box" and come up with more innovative solutions to tactical situations than some other games would have you do...but also like its predecessor if you think too far out of the box or get too innovative you can fully expect the game to come up with some crazy, contrived way of instantly killing you. Good example: I decided to bypass a large battle area and outflank all the opponents in an entire battlefield by swimming underwater. A giant shark came by and instantly killed my character, despite the fact that he's wearing a power armor that can deflect .50 caliber bullets with relative ease. Oh well.\n\nBut despite its intrinsic and inescapably linear design, this game is still a lot of fun to play. It's loud, action packed and full of between level cutscenes that somehow bridge the gap (or straddle the fence between irritating and campy. This game also gets an honorable mention from me also because it has one of the best train battles (where you jump from one railroad car to another wild-west style) that I have ever seen (the very best was still in Soldier of Fortune however). The music was better in this iteration of crysis also but still not spectacular enough to warrant getting a soundtrack for it. This is a game that was fun enough that I'd consider playing it through on an even higher difficulty sometime or other...if there wasn't such a huge selection of other games out there vying for my attention.

You're more impulsive, so the missions are more suitable for an aggressive play style. You can still try to use stealth if you like though.\n\nSome of the more memorable moments:\n\n1. You chase down the Korean General in a Hovercraft over a frozen jungle, while epic music play in the background.\n2. You hijack a train with mounted Heavy Machineguns and Automatic Grenade Launchers while human and alien enemies try to take you down.\n3. You fight off enemies across an entire airfield, only to realize when you've cleared the Korean troops, it's overran by aliens. There is also epic music in the background, in case you're wondering.\n\nThe major complaint about this game is the unpolished cutscenes: there's no voice dialogue (even when Psycho is being tortured, he doesn't even grunt, although his face is clearly in agony). People say nothing, so you're watching these silent cutscenes with occasional ambient sounds. They felt really awkward, like they were added in last minute.\n\nIn any case, great fun for a short campaign.\n\nRating: 9/10.","December 8, 2013","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although much shorter, I feel Warhead is an improvement over the original in numerous ways; even though one does not experience the original "wow factor" as they did playing Crysis for the first time. Nonetheless, the game is faster paced, the graphics are even better (and slightly more optimized, though my 2010 computer STILL could not run the game at its highest possible settings--incredible), and the shooting mechanics are simply fantastic. Although arguably less "intelligent" than the original, and more about simply blowing and shooting crap up, that in my opinion is what makes this game so fun. Just a short 6 hour romp with nothing but grenade launchers and bullets strapped to your waist.

Kinda. . .  it's still more of Crysis' core gameplay, which is still damn fun, but the cost of being an expansion pack is a lot of streamlining and narrowing of the maps, and limitations on what you can do.  There isn't a lot of room to be stealthy, and there are a lot more big skirmishes (I spent most of my time with Max Armor active than any other suit power).  It also ends on a pretty dull note compared to the original's massive finale.\n\nAlso on the downside, you get to see more of Psycho and his ugly mug (never liked him), and he's usually teamed with another unlikable guy, so whatever narrative is easily skippable.

This is both good and bad, but more positives than anything. You play Psycho, one of the special forces soldiers who was sent in with the original game’s Nomad. This is his story and what happened to him while separated from Nomad. While the core story of Crysis wasn’t too interesting there is a better mix between the open world and corridors. The game still gives you the option to choose to approach each objective by sneaking, sniping, driving, or guns blazing.\n\nThe game has more of a variety of objectives such as a train ride, and killing the larger aliens which can be pretty fun. There aren’t any new weapons, and everything is pretty much the same. If you’re looking for Crysis 2.5 with this you’re going to be disappointed. While the game plays exactly like the first there are more cinematic moments such as running from a giant alien, and towards the end the game gets really epic. There are more aliens involved this time around instead of just mostly KPA soldiers. I still would have liked to see different alien types, and maybe make the game a bit more scripted since the game is so short.\n\nThe game still looks the same with no graphical improvements at all. You still need an ultra powerful machine to run this on highest settings with DirectX10. Even my monster computer struggles to keep the FPS at a non-choppy rate during large firefights. The game is also more forgiving this time around as I only died maybe a dozen times during the whole campaign. The mass of enemies are easier to take on since the game seems to feel more balanced and the close quarters environments seem to be designed for this too.\n\nWhile I wish there would have been new weapons, new enemies, and totally new locales it works with the game’s story. Warhead will really make Crysis fans happy and add an extra 4-5 hours and give you more of a back story to what happened to the strange Psycho.\n\n--Score: 8.5/10","June 28, 2012","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any old fan of the Mechwarrior franchise losing faith in Mechwarrior Online or anyone with a thing for giant robots should try it out. Well worth the price of this game, at any price level! Despite the mod having ceased development, there are still a few people playing, and they are ususally rather helpful to new players.\n\nAs for the base game, well, It's okay, but not fantastic, and definitely not remarkably better than standard single player Crysis. There's a few new toys to play with and looks as good as expected, but it boils down to the same "Kill hundreds of Korean Soldiers for a few levels before wierd space aliens come" formula.\n\nStock multiplayer is either lacking in players entirely or is riddled with hackers. Avoid it like the plague. Fortunately, there are various multiplayer mods that are quite popular without the unpleasant cheaters, like the aforementioned Mechwarrior: Living legends, and the Crysis Wars EX mod, which provides an improved version of the stock multiplayer (Which is quite fun in the first place), with additional weapons, maps, vehicles, game modes to keep you entertained.\n\nOverall, if you're an avid fan of Crysis or its sequels then you should look into this for a quick and dirty booster for your Crysis addiction. To anyone else, the fantastic mods should keep you hooked for a while, but you're not particularly missing anything special if you've tried any other Crysis title.","July 18, 2012","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is another "meh" title.\n\nI had high hopes for Warhead. Crysis leaves you on a MASSIVE cliffhanger and I figured this game would go back and you would continue on. In Crysis the characters "Nomad" and "Prophet" go into the alien sphere for what seems like an epic battle. That game ends abruptly right there and leaves you hanging.\n\nWarhead instead of doing what it was supposed to do, just puts you in the shoes of a completely different soldier "Psycho" who you see for a short while at the start of Crysis. Worst still, it takes place along side Crysis on a seperate part of the island. Its not a prequel or a sequel. That's pretty annoying. The only justice in this title is that at least is wraps up Psycho's story somewhat.. problem is the ending of Crysis happens after the ending of Warhead, so even though Warhead wraps up, it can't close off the open story created by Crysis.\n\nSeriously, this is another example of a tech demo and not a full game. Worse still, Crysis at least showed off some amazing design and some really interesting visuals... even if there was no gameplay present during those moments. Warhead on the otherhand just recycles literally all of it's visual content from Crysis and doesn't add anything to the experience. Psycho's storyline is uninteresting. You spend the whole game trying to capture a "thing" in a box. Once you get it the game doesn't have the good grace of even telling you what it is... however by the time I was done I was so burned out on the experience I didn't care. I didn't expect the game to answer the questions it poses so I wasn't dissapointed this go around. I was expecting mediocrity and I got it.\n\nBy why still a thumbs up? True I want to give this a nuetral rating, but it is still fun in it's own right. It barely leans towards a thumbs up, even less so than Crysis did and I was feeling conflicted by that one. I'm 7 years late to this party, but at least writing out this review feels cathartic.","April 3, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it almost immediately after Crysis, and all sorts of strangeness abounds. For example, I played Crysis on maximum settings and didn't notice anything (aside from the occasional frame rate drop in larger levels) that would impact gameplay from a tech side of the house.\n\nBut Warhead? I had to turn everything down. I wanted that 60 fps sweet spot... but it wasn't happening without minimum settings. I didn't play it on minimum, I compromised for about 40 fps, so I could actually see things like grass (which is necessary for my play style, as I like to be the Predator and kill from stealth). I'm curious as to why this stripped down expansion was literally more taxing on my system than the 2013 Tomb Raider (also played on max - but without the PhysX hair).\n\nIt may be the combination of age, poor optimization, and video drivers (which age has a pretty big factor on whether or not your drivers will play nice with the game) that prevented me from getting the sort of performance I was getting with the original game (plus, the original game underwent a series of performance patches after it was released).\n\nThe gameplay is essentially unchanged, which is good if you like it (I do). All the old weapons are present, though they did add a couple of new ones. However... again, the overpowered alien enemies rear their ugly heads (as expected) and the game becomes less fun as a result. You basically have to carry the gauss rifle at that point forward, and cloaking is a waste of time from there on in. Worse, like before, as soon as the aliens arrive, you're given linear paths and objectives (though Warhead is in general, more linear than the original).\n\nStory wise, I like Warhead better, mostly because you play as Psycho and get some great character development out of the experience. From the first game, the only thing I knew about him was that he was British and slightly sarcastic. And that his callsign probably meant he was a daredevil or just deranged. Psycho is much more interesting than Nomad, and actively defies orders at certain points for fairly justified reasons.\n\nI actively despised the Korean general who is the antagonist of Warhead, and hated it whenever he got the upper hand on Psycho, but the ending was made all the sweeter for it.\n\nOn the whole, I recommend Warhead for fans of the first game, with the caveat that it has the same issues of said first game, as well as a few new ones. It's also short, about half the play time of the original Crysis (which I think is fine - it doesn't overstay its welcome).","March 23, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is not nearly as long as the first game but has plenty of naughty North Koreans and nasty aliens that you just assume kill you as buy you a Starbuck's Frapp. And there are some weapons you get to use in Warhead that were not available in Crysis.

It is, I guess officially, a standalone expansion to the original Crysis game. However, it doesn't build on the story of the original so to say. It's really a retelling of the story from the perspective of Psycho from the original Crysis. You can expect Warhead to last you about 6 hours of gameplay so it's about half as long as the original game, but since you are probably playing Warhead after the original you really don't need the entire backstory. I feel Warhead was just long enough to, "get the point across," so to say. Warhead contains the same graphical capabilities and intuitive controls of the original, while adding a very well done alternative point of view. For these reasons, I recommend that anyone who plays the original Crysis also play Warhead.","December 29, 2013","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're more impulsive, so the missions are more suitable for an aggressive play style. You can still try to use stealth if you like though.\n\nSome of the more memorable moments:\n\n1. You chase down the Korean General in a Hovercraft over a frozen jungle, while epic music play in the background.\n2. You hijack a train with mounted Heavy Machineguns and Automatic Grenade Launchers while human and alien enemies try to take you down.\n3. You fight off enemies across an entire airfield, only to realize when you've cleared the Korean troops, it's overran by aliens. There is also epic music in the background, in case you're wondering.\n\nThe major complaint about this game is the unpolished cutscenes: there's no voice dialogue (even when Psycho is being tortured, he doesn't even grunt, although his face is clearly in agony). People say nothing, so you're watching these silent cutscenes with occasional ambient sounds. They felt really awkward, like they were added in last minute.\n\nIn any case, great fun for a short campaign.\n\nRating: 9/10.","December 8, 2013","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is effectively half the volume of the original, you get very little in addition to what was found in the first game. Fun albeit a little shorter.\n\nNot reccomended for those that want anything with a good story or replayable content.

I have now also played warhead, the followup which takes you through the same timeframe but on the other end of the island, playing as Psycho instead of Nomad. The game is identical in most ways to the previous one, so I'm copy-pasting much of what I wrote about that here.\n\nFrom what I'd seen prior to playing Crysis, I was under the impression that you'd play a kind of semi-indestructable super soldier in this game, dashing and jumping around at high speed and slicing through dozens of enemy soldiers with ease, but really it plays more like you're just a fairly standard FPS soldier dude with a few perks. I found myself not bothering with things like the stealth and speed mode very often as they both drain your energy incredibly quickly. On hard difficulty, a few well-placed enemy bullets can still take you down if you're not careful so you don't really feel invulnerable.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly standard FPS fare, akin to Call Of Duty or whatever, with open-ish world elements but lots of set pieces. The game world never feels as open as, say, the Far Cry series and you are pretty much railroaded into tackling things in order, though how you approach each set piece is up to you and you do feel that you can take a variety of approaches to solve the obstacles you encounter.\n\nThe graphics have really stood the test of time, It didn't feel particularly dated.\n\nThe Crysis campaign only took me 10 hours to play through and I didn't exactly rush through it. Warhead was even shorter, at a shade over 6 hours! The storyline is very standard and unengaging, following a rather cliched 'US saves the world from alien invasion that is unwittingly aided by the nasty Asians' formula that's all too familiar by now. In this iteration, you play as stereotypical Brit hardman with a heart of gold Psycho, who constantly has to remind the racially stereotypical Korean baddies that he's a Brit, not a Yankee. Warhead's plot and ending were even weaker than the first game, sadly.\n\nOverall, I'd say that if you've never played Crysis before, play that first. If you enjoy playing that game, this is just more of exactly the same! Pick them both up when on sale with a heavy discount and you can't go wrong, really.","November 1, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a real pleasure to hide within the lush jungles of the island.  You really do feel like you are in a real forest.  Turtles included. !!\nThe gameplay of crysis is pure FPS nirvana.  The weapons are pretty cool but they need a little more reactivity and rebound.  Sometimes it seems like enemies are being tazered rather than blown away by a big gun.  It leaves you in the middle of gameplay wondering if they really have gone down permanently or just received a gentle blast.\nBut gameplay is enjoyable and the shotgun has the desired effect at close quarters.  Grenades are also effective and realistic.  The very best weapon is the experimental gun you receive at the end of the game.  It totally destroys the large alien floaters and their smaller counter parts.  One shot does the job.\nIt would have been fantastic to have this beast of destruction earlier on in the game.  But - it isn't.\nI love Crysis.  I hate multi player centered games and I only enjoy the single player campaigns and crytek give you a decent chunk of gameplay.  Varied and interesting.\nThe voice acting is generally very good but the main character's voice does not match his appearance.  It isn't terribly out of place but it didn't match up.  But the main character actor does an excellent job.  There are a couple of shameful acting moments but they are generally few and far between.\nCrysis is everything we want in a FPS.  Big guns and aliens and tactical planning in the moments of gameplay - mean you can be creative in silently sneaking up on your opponents or go in with guns blazing.\nI really enjoyed blowing up the armoured vehicles but sometimes got confused with their selections in the menu.  It meant that I sometimes blew myself up - mistaking the detonator in my hand for another explosive.\nThe speed mode of the suit isn't really that fast - I thought it would really make the character zip across airfields or swamps but it is kind of sluggish.\nPerhaps a few seconds more in the cloak energy mode would have been nice.  It runs out VERY quickly and left my behind clearly visible to enemies as I tried to reach that last hiding place.  But that in itself is quite thrilling and led to some funny situations.\nCrysis warhead is a really cool game and I heartily recommend it.   8/10","January 31, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had wait some years to play it in desired quality, but waiting was worthy :). If you like sci-fi and stealth possibilities with sandbox play i'd definitely reccomend it to you. Anyway Warhead involves much more aliens and less humans than Crysis 1 - i am fine with it, but someone could find it boring as he likes 'pre-sci-fi' part of orignal Crysis 1.","May 8, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Downside, other than exceptional potential graphical assets, the game is generic. The game is effectively half the volume of the original, you get very little in addition to what was found in the first game. Fun albeit a little shorter.\n\nNot reccomended for those that want anything with a good story or replayable content. While this game attempts more in terms of story, but like the first Crysis game it's pretty disposable and unremarkable.\n\nRecommended if you like a fun generic shooter and don't mid very little story (and explanation).","December 12, 2015","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Developers also did improve the texture quality and lightning effects.\nHowever game still runs like nightmare on 64-bit systems, and that's a shame, so you’ll have constant crashes, random FPS drops and so on.\n\nYou now play as Sergeant Michael "Psycho" Sykes, who were your teammate in original game, but unlike Nomad from Crysis, Psycho is voiced and has some character to him, maybe his lines and behavior is a cliche, but still I had a great fun filling his shoes. Psycho story-line is a parallel of Nomads from the original game, and he goes on to hunt North-Korean officer Lee, who's in charge of evacuating a mystical container which might have a nuclear warhead in it.\nGameplay is pretty much the same what you expect from Crysis, however, game escalates pretty quickly, you  acquire most powerful weapons early in the game and combining it with Nano-suit's abilities you feel like unstoppable Juggernaut of death, and to be honest, that's just so much fun to play. Maybe if the game was bit longer it would outstay it’s welcome, but for campaign that is about 8 hours long, it was perfect. Standalone expansion also introduces some new weapons like dual wielding fully automatic pistols and granade launcher, new vehicles as well as some new enemy types.\n\nIn the end, I really enjoyed Crysis Warhead, it’s a definite improvement in every way, but the technical problems and Crytech’s attitude to fix them for new’er systems just pisses me of. Again minus technical side, the game would be 9.0, but for current state – it’s 7.0 maximum.\n\nThanks for reading!","December 26, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

During the story in Crysis I, Psycho get separated from Nomad, in order to fulfill another important mission. This new story is quite good and it's connected to the story in Crysis I, which is awesome. Even though it doesn't provide too much info about aliens and characters, I liked the way it was linked to the main story, so this is why I gave a better score.\n\nGraphics: 10 out of 10\nThe graphics are almost the same as for Crysis I but with some improvements in details in almost everything. This is quite a good thing, I didn't quite noticed at first, but after checking some videos on youtube, the differences are pretty big. If I could have given a better score, I would, this expansion is improved on almost every aspect.\n\nGameplay: 9.5 out of 10\nFirst of all, I like to mention that this game is a bit harder than Crysis I, but this isn't because of AI improvement, but mostly because of more difficult enemies throught the game. While in the first Crysis, you fought KPA soldiers over 50 % of the game (which were quite weak even on Delta difficulty), in this DLC you'll only fight KPA soldiers during the first 10 % of the game. Instead of KPA soldiers, in Crysis Warhead you'll fight a lot of KPA Special Ops (which are bassically nano suit soldiers just like yourself), which are pretty damn good. The producers also included some alien packs that are immune to damage until you destroy the one that generates their shield. All this makes the game a bit more challenging than the first Crysis, which is a good improvement from my point of view. They also added new vehicules and new weapons like grenade launcher, new pistols, new grenades, all this further improves the overall gameplay. Great job !\n\nAudio: 10 out of 10\nThe audio is similar to the previous Crysis, so that means is excellent. Didn't noticed any differences here.\n\nAI Behavior: 9.5 out of 10\nThe AI is better, because you don't have to fight too many KPA soldiers, instead you have to fight a lot of aliens, KPA Special Ops and some bosses. The KPA Special Ops are quite good because they use nano grenades to deactivate your suit before moving to attack, the aliens instead, have the same behavior like in Crysis I, so for more details see that review.\n\nMultiplayer: not tested\nAs with Crysis I, I couldn't test the multiplayer since the servers were deactivated. There are some instructions on the internet on how you can play multiplayer, but I didn't bother to try.\n\nOverall: 9.7 out 10\nA lot of improvements done in this expansion compared to the previous Crysis, that makes this game even better. On top of all this, Crysis Warhead is a stand alone game and doesn't require the original Crysis to be played, but in my opionion is very recommended that you play the first Crysis before checking Crysis Warhead, so that you may have a better understanding of what is happening during the storyline. 100 % recommend, a true clasic masterpiece to the fps genre.","February 27, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WorthAShot/recommended/17330/","WorthAShot","Worth A Shot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WorthAShot/","88 products in account","Crysis is the original game.\nCrysis Warhead is this game.\nCrysis Wars is defunct multiplayer.\nCrysis 2 is the proper sequel but plays very differently than the above.\nCrysis 3 (and 4) are on "Origin" not Steam.\n\nBackground:\nSee my earlier review for Crysis the original.  This time you play as Psycho during the sections spent apart from Nomad (the player) in the original game.  This game looks the same but runs smoother on modern cards (GTX 970) and all but the hardest difficulty now use auto ammo pickup which is so much better.  Vehicles start in third person.  The UI isn't really improved from the first, though it tries.  There are definitely more weapons to play with but it doesn't change much.  This game is very clearly the polished version of Crysis original.  Way more fairly long cut scenes.\n\nGameplay:\nAnother first person shooter in a mostly open world.  This one is more linear but has less sections that you get stuck working through and hate.\nYou start off with all suit powers (hold middle click and drag in a direction):\n- default is armor which includes faster health regen\n- then cloak is overpowered (drains power as you move and drops if you attack) yet fails at melee range.\n- strength makes you jump higher and absorb more falling damage\n- speed makes you run faster, really fast for a short time\n\nGood to know:\nFairly unforgiving again (seriously consider playing on easy and you will still die a bunch).\nFalling damage can kill (use strength to minimize).\nYou can breath underwater.\nThere's also a separate night vision that drains a separate power meter.\nArmored vehicles require explosives to destroy.\nYou can only carry a few kinds of weapons at a time, but can swap on the fly and recall a previous weapon's ammo pool (which is the only reason to swap late game).\nHealth is regenerative but the meter is on screen.  No achievements or collectibles, just secondary objectives with no impact aside from providing another ammo cache.  Relatively short compared to today's titles (7-10 hours).\n\nVerdict:\nWorth $5.  You could skip the original to play this one in a pinch, but it explains a lot more of the story (maybe watch YouTube videos of the original).  But play 1 first if you're planning to.  Read my review of 2 before you buy it, it's a very different game.","May 17","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
