The characters look good from far away which is what's important I suppose but up close they look like they're meant for the original playstation.  It ran well on my midrange machine but I guess that's to be expected for a game that looks like it was mean tfor the first iphone.\n\nKindof fun but gets boring fast.  Much better options for this type of game.","January 26","false","1.8"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

Not much variety of enemies or the environment (so far anyway) but it's fun collecting stuff to buy upgrades with.  I do wish that more health would be available during the levels but it seems to be a fairly rare drop - I end up spending parts to replenish my health when I could be using it for more upgrades.  At any rate, it's a fun little time-killer of a game so I give it a thumbs-up.","February 10","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My main reproach is the lack of knowing where the character is aiming probably in relation with the top 3D view and the character movement.\n\nThe game also seems to get boring pretty fast... Run around, some stuff to shoot, keep going without much more to do and intereactivity with the surrounding.\n\nFor cheap (like in the current Indiegala weekly bundle), you may want to give a try, otherwise probably stay away or get ready to go with the Steam refund process.","February 8","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The real problem is the gameplay; it's quite boring! There aren't enough monsters or additional things to do in this massive map. You spend most of your time running around looking for more stuff to kill...\n\nGood story and intro movie, but the gameplay didn't live up to the initial start. There are only 2 modes which include Survival and Story Mode; these are essentially the exact same and feel quite repetitive. This game desperately needed a multiplayer mode; it would have changed my whole outlook on the game.\n\nThe game is much more fun if you use a controller so I highly suggest trying that; I was able to utilize my Steam Controller which really pleases me. You will have to set up the controller yourself since this game may never have a community uploaded preset.\n\nNot worth the heavy $8 price tag. I'd pay $0.99 if there much better multiplayer twin shooters.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

Works and looks great on an old laptop in "simple" graphics. Would look even better on a newer machine. I bought it on sale for $5 - worth it if you like this type of game. Doesn't take up much hard drive space. Wanna try it on a Windows Tablet hooked up to a large screen and a game controller. Lots of fun!","January 29","true","0.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The AI is basically nonexistant and its hard to tell where your bullets will go due to the skewed perspective and lack of a crosshair.\n\nThe graphics are colorful at least but plays more like a timewasting minigame than a full title.  Where's the depth?","February 10","false","3.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
