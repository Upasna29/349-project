Graphics are minimal but stylish and functional, sound is electronic and appropriate and the gameplay is simply fun. By finetuning mouse-speed it's possible to steer in the collider by making fine and controlled movements, which made me almost feel like being in that mad tube. The sensation of speed is cleverly reached, so mission accomplished.\n\nJust one - to me serious - flaw: the achievements are completely broken. Many people have already complained about this on the Community Forum, but up till now no solution has been offered yet. Some may get them, so may not. Weird.\n\nEdited: Thanks to the efforts of some players, a fix for the achievements has been found. Look at the discussion page, there is a thread called "Achievements", and the fix is being discussed there. It involves downloading a file from Microsoft, but it's nothing too complicated. The developers should have fixed this a long time ago, so I won't up my score for this.\n\nOverall score: 7/10","November 3, 2014","true","2.3"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","50","56","2","1"

MPH? KPH? Scoville units?), there's just nothing else to do or any reason to keep playing it.\n\nI'd say the replay value is abysmal but it's actually absent.\nThere's literally like a dozen (or maybe less?) of obstacles that pop up in front of you every now and then. I mean, I'm sorry, I meant to say that this game is "procedurally generated".\nThe only other thing that's supposed to add an edge to the gameplay is the coins, which are pointless. You can only use them to buy continues, and since you can get the "perfect/clean" playthrough achievements in 30 minutes anyway, you don't really need the coins and they're merely a distraction.\n\nVerdict:\nPossibly the most forgettable game I've ever played on Steam.\nBut, for those of you who need to bump up that 100% achievements count, sure why not, go nuts.","November 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 52 of 67 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","52","67","6","3"

It's a fast paced arcade type of game that takes place inside a particle accelerator and you will have to go through obstacles to pass the test.\n\nI'm not going to go into many details, but The Collider is a fast paced game, and I mean a very fast paced game. The levels will progressively get harder and you will accelerate faster and faster towards the obstacles, giving you less time to maneuver them and will challenge your reflex skills.\n\nThe controls are very simple, you just use your mouse to move the particle around and avoid the obstacles. It also has some controller support so that is a plus.\n\nThe achievements can be easy to get, you'll most likely get them all within an hour or so. The leaderboard is also a very nice feature to have, you can try to beat your friends' score and it gives you a purpose to keep going further than usual. The music is really decent as you play it, I like it. :)\n\nAnd let's not forget about the trading cards. ;)\n\nAll in all, it is enjoyable and yet, challenging at the same time. You won't get very far at first, but you know what they say: "Practice makes perfect."\n\n\nShould you buy this game?I'd say you should. If you are looking for a challenge or some relaxing fun then yes, you should. It's worth the small price. Or you can just wait for a sale to happen if that's your style.\n\n7.5/10","March 28","true","2.9"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","28","29","2","0"

Although I take this as a mistake, I will not be to critical as this could of been a design choice, as having all this on your screen may be slightly distracting game-play wise.\nI was also slightly dissappointed with the introduction, as I was really hoping to be able to traverse through different boosters, as this was the highlight of my particle accelerating fantasies. I was also very dissapointed with the lack of ending cutscenes, as I am still very curious as to what happens to the packet you are in control of. as there is no other protons to be able to collide with, I lost loads of fantasy filled nights thinking over the results of this specific collider. I was expecting there to be a cutscene at the end where you finally collide with another proton to cause many new particles or atoms to fling out so I could record the results. But maybe there will be a DLC, or even better, a sequel to the game which might show this.\nOverall, I found this collider simulator very fun to play, although not very realistic, I had a great time achieving the fantasies I've always had.","November 12, 2014","true","2.1"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","86","25","29","19","0"

I quoted this already, in other review, but I must repeat that sentence: "It is not possible to see of any psychic experience from common physical elements like movement and masses" (E.Mach, Erkenntnis und Irrtum. p.12). Again, I think that Mach was not right in his philosophy, while being a genius in physics.\n\nAll this little game, Collider, is about speed. You're accelerating, then accelerating further, and even faster... until finally you meet some obstruction on the way, and game begins anew. And you know what? It appears that I'm afraid of speed! I wasn't so scared while playing Amnesia or strolling through the 100-meter precipice in real life! I can drive my Skoda up to 160 km/h (100 mph for you, Imperials) quite easily, but I was frightened big time while going through that Collider. Certainly, I'm not of Midi-chlorian symbionts, and don't deserve to flight to the Death Star.\n\nStill, I was able to beat this game in one hour for the gold, with all achievements unlocked. And after another hour of idling I got 3 steam cards, each worth quite alot.\n\nSo I definitely recommend this game! For one, you can test yourself with the speed, to know your limits, and so on. Second, you getting steam cards which costs almost as much as this game without any discount. That means, if you buy The Collider on sale, or via bundle, you'll even get a profit! And, for third, if you not a victim of tachophobia, you'll get a nice easy full-complete game.\n\nMy mark 7/10. Quick game, nice atmosphere of pure speed.

The leaderboards actually show if you are playing on Steam, Android or Apple.\n\nSo, if you want to play a very short but nice game, pick this one up!

A simple concept, to be sure, so how does the game ultimately fare?There is little to say about The Collider, as it isn't so much a typical game, as it is a mild distraction to stave off boredom. Basically, the aim of the game is to thread a white dot, representing the cursor of the mouse, through circular panels that have small openings, some with coins, and some without. Crash and it is a loss of life; crash enough times and it's Game Over. It is possible to continue from crashing via spending the coins that are collected.That's really all there is to it.The main thing to keep the game going is the incremental increases in speed. At first it is pedestrian, but later on, the game whizzes along at such a speed that any form of blinking will result in a crash and Game Over.Essentially, anyone with experience in staring contests and with good reflexes should be able to have plenty of fun with the game. That's really all there is to it, though.Colourful and joyous, there's not really any graphics to speak of, but the courses are a wonderful kaleidoscope of colours. The soundtrack is rather basic with a whooshing sound as the thread goes through the needles.The Collider is a solid game that sets out what it wants to do: get the player jumping through hoops at ridiculous speeds. That is all it offers, though; there isn't enough here to justify a score higher than 5/10.","December 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

The object of the game is to get as far along as you can before crashing. As you move along at dizzying speeds, you collect coins while avoiding obstacles. The coins can be used to revive you when you crash (which will be very often) up to three times in a round, which ends up being very helpful once you get farther along in the accelerator. There is a nice variety of obstacles, but I sometimes wish there were more.\n\nThe sound is okay, but not something I would want to listen to for long. Luckily, there is a mute button, so this isn't a problem. You can just rock out to whatever you want, while improving your reflex skills.\n\nThere's not much to The Collider, but it's definitely worth picking up if you like racing games. It's also nice for achievement hunters, since it only take a little bit of time to unlock them all. Be sure to get it while it's on sale, for that's when you'll be happiest with your purchase.","March 27, 2015","true","7.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The 30 cents I put on this game have been the most satisfying 30 cents in my life. Heck, If I knew this game existed I would have paid full price for it. It is a clever game, resembling one of those old arcade games. The only difference is, you don't have to pay to play again. Its 3 dollers flat, and you can go on and on. No in game purchases to give you boosts, the only boosts you get are the ones you earn in the game. The controls are utterly easy to learn, the senstivity slider is a good implimcation.

You basically have to pass through obstacles without crashing while constantly increasing speed at a fixed rate. It's quite casual in the sense that you don't have to finish speed 100 to 1300 in one sitting. You can readjust the starting speed whenever you unlock a new one (which makes for quick and painless achievements). My only complaint with the game is that I somehow lost progress after reaching 1200. I tried to record the last stretch on Fraps and I'm not sure what happened during that time to trigger it. Thankfully, you can easily re-climb back to 1300 by using extra lives that cost coins. For all of you achievement hunters, don't use extra lives if you're trying to get the no-crash achievements.

Spooky.\n\nIf you played Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc and partook in the Missile Command minigame, this should feel familiar to you. You're essentially guiding a camera through a series of conveniently placed rotating discs with holes in them. The holes differ in size and shape, which I find to be challenging yet rewarding. As time progresses, the speed at which you're zooming by increases exponentially with each interval (every time the counter reaches 100, to be exact). If you're appreciative of pretty colors, you're in for quite the treat here -- there are a lot of them.\n\nThe soundtrack in the game is an upbeat electronic motivator. It makes the entire experience a bit more exciting, though it does get old as you continue playing. Hearing the same song over and over again typically doesn't bode well if it doesn't resonate with its listener, surprisingly enough. Still, though -- it's a tune I certainly wanted to dance to at one point.\n\nIf you're looking for a euphoric graphical experience, you've come to the wrong place. You can see for yourself in the screenshots provided on the game's store page.\n\nThe only indication that you're finished with the game would have to be the achievements. I'm not too keen on my champion status (the game includes a leaderboard), and as such, the game is finished for me once I've acquired all of the achievements available for me to earn.\n\nThe only issue I've found within the game is that at a certain point, your crosshair is simply too large. I often found myself struggling to see where the hole was because of it. It's easily remedied by proper peripheral vision, though.\n\nDefinitely worth the price. I bought it while it was on sale for a few cents, I'd advise you to do the same.\n\nOh, and don't blink.","December 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't forget the snacks as you're going to be playing for a while until you beat it. Yes, 'The Collider' has that essential element to it, that challenges you to beat it. It's a very simple but frustrating game. and forces you to play it until you have beaten it ! Its simple fun, and it apparently messes with time and space, as before you know it, you have either beaten it in an hour, and gotten another perfect game to show off on your profile, or you have spent most of the day in front of it, wandering why you can't quite make the last couple of achievements. The collider isn't very original, essentially a simplified 'Race The Sun', or perhaps 'AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity' ... it isn't really that well done ...not many options, variety, or backing music but it works. The game is simply coded to consist of a narrow light tunnel which is constructed to give the impression of motion, with occasional twists and turns, obstacles are introduced which consist of disks with holes of varying shape and size blocking said tunnel, occasionally rotate through which you have to navigate. It has 13 levels which once beaten can be used as a starting point to continue in your efforts to complete the game. These save points make it easier to beat and greatly simplifies the pursuit of the 'perfect game'.  Its all about not blinking, turning up the mouse sensitivity, drinking coffee and getting those reflexes sharpened.... if you're like me and really really _REALLY_ old, its going to be really hard....and you will be writing reviews just to get a break! But if you're not out of elementary school you should be done in an hour. Don't think about it, buy this game, don't even waste time looking for a coupon on the forums... buy it now, play it now.

It's cheap, starts off slow but gets going and has pleasent music paired with pretty colors. Gameplay is simple: get through the holes without crashing. There is a weekly tournament held for retry coins that you can also earn in-game. It's not Pay2Win. I've never played a game quite like this and I must say it's nice to take a break from shooters, RTS and open world sandbox style games. Basically, it's a good way to waste an hour or two.\n\nWith that said, why do I not recommend The Collider? Well at the risk of sounding like a broken record: "Basically, it's a good way to waste an hour or two." There is no replay value whatsoever. The highest speed you can start at is 1300 even if you get up to 1400 speed. After you reach your peak there isn't really a good reason to keep playing. There are no "levels" in the traditional sense. The color of the track changes as the speed increases but thats it. There are no characters, no story, no other game modes to play - NOTHING. You could challenge yourself to get all the Achievements but, they do not unlock. AT ALL. EVER! I've seen other people have this problem since at least November of 2014 and people still are having this problem now in April of 2015. I'd say any chance of a fix is long gone by now. I would only suggest buying this game if you have a coupon for it as a way to increase your steam rank. Otherwise it's not even worth the $2.99 asking price.\n\nEXTRA COMMENTS: I have no clue how fast we are going. 1300 MPH? 1300 KPH? 1300 Light-years per hour? In my personal opinion I'd rather spend $2.99 on a pack of gum. I'd get more use out of the gum than this game.

Not to mention I can complete the achievement set easily, it's a bonus.\n\nThis is another version of Super Hexagon, can be infuriating especially when you fail the last distance to get the next checkpoints but hey... it's a part of the game. You will auto move forward and your job is to get as far as you can without hitting the obstacle in FPS mode - think of FPS racing except you don't have rival around you. Each 100 distance mark will earn you checkpoints, of which you can replay from the point onward to get even further. The last required distance is 1300 (as in checkpoint and achievement), so after that there's little to zero replay value.\n\nBe warned, though, there have been reports of achievements failing to pop up, although there's a workaround found by players already. And there's silence from the developer, so if you see his future title, consider of his abandonment of this title also before purchasing.\n\nScore: 7/10","March 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sense of a speeding tunnel is very fun and almost kind of soothing; it really feels like you're slightly up in the air and you're cutting through that endless abstract space. Game was very smooth and responsive for me, as Unity works great for that kind of 3D action.\n\nGet on sale if you don't mind your games being very simple, Flashgames-simple.\nIt's pocket change and it kind of pays off.\n\nP.S.

It's along the same lines as Super Hexagon in that it's addictive and high-energy, but is basically a flash game.\n\nThe objective here is to guide a small dot in the center of your monitor through an infinitely long tube comprised of screens with holes in it; you hit a screen, you die. The ultimate goal is to survive as long as possible. If you can guess, the game is rather punishing: expect to die a lot and make very little progress.\n\nThe achievements are very wonky and unlock all at once after you quit the game. It took me all of 19 minutes of gameplay to get them all without trying--so there's that.\n\nIn conclusion, other than demanding intense focus and quick reflexes, this game doesn't offer a lot of playtime. There are no special modes or items--just the base game. It's interesting the first few times around, but definitely not worth $3. Maybe try it if it's on sale and you have an extra quarter lying around, but otherwise, skip it.","November 28, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Along the way you will earn money, and points to be put into a leaderboard. But beyond that, I cannot see any other "stand out" features within this game. In itself, the mechanics that make it "simplistic, and intuitive," as the description of this game states, makes it quite bland, and it gets old quite quickly.\n\nFrom my first experience with this game, I booted it up and saw the default Unity Launcher with no customisation at all (a great sign for any game that I just payed money for! Sure, if you have a Unity logo on setup, I don't mind, because you're making a game for free to get money to make more games. However, when you don't customise the launcher AT ALL, it demonstrates to me that you put no effort into first impressions.) However, the soundtrack for this game was good!\n\nGetting into the game was a surprise as I saw the leaderboard filled up with iOS and Android, but, I decided to move on because maybe iOS and Android players of this game are better/have more experience at this game? The gameplay at the start was actually quite entertaining, until it got to the point where it was the same thing, just faster, and faster, and faster. By the first 40 minutes of playing, I had completed almost all the levels inside the game.\n\nI cannot help but feel as though this is just a game really badly trying to be Super Hexagon, without being Super Hexagon.\n\nOverall, the first 10 minutes of this game was actually quite enjoyable... until you realise it starts to become very "samish" throughout the game. I think you should spend the extra premium of 2 dollars or so and buy Super Hexagon, a much more enjoyable game that (although having almost the same amount of content) is quite addicting, and is very challanging.","December 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It's a simple first-person autorunner. The graphics are simple and bright and change color as you level up your speed every 100 points. I would like to point out that I got this game with a steam coupon for 30 cents and at that price I can say the game is worth it. However, the game retails for $2.99 and feels like a free or 0.99cents smartphone game.

This game offers no signficant advantages over the free Flash equivalents.\n2. For a paid game, particularly one with free alternatives, it has a lot of mistakes / bugs / issues.\n\nSome of the big issues are: Achievements in the game don't become unlocked when you meet the criteria, top scores feature for the game does not work, in game documentation is next to none, available documentation has typos, and finally the point value earned for hitting coins is seemingly random.\n\nOverall, it's got decent music for this type of game, goes full screen nicely, and is amusing for 15 minutes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femme-fatale/recommended/319550/","femme-fatale","Femme ❤ Fatale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femme-fatale/","499 products in account","Let me say this straight and simple: If you are going to buy this game, you are going to buy this game because of the incredible ease it takes to obtain all the achievements. It takes most about 20-60 minutes to do this, and even still many people have difficulty getting the achievements validated. Look to the forums if you have problems, the solutions are there.\n\nThe reason why I put this as thumbs down is because there is a free (and much better) game that is like this one on Kongregate. It is called Accelerator, here's the link http://www.kongregate.com/games/TenebrousP/accelerator.\n\nThe main differences between this one that you are paying money for and the free one are the sounds, visual, and a few game play differences. Accelerator has a much better sound system, but no music. It doesn't need it. It ends up giving a much better atmosphere than Collider without the music. Also complimenting the atmosphere are the visuals. There are no drastic colour changes besides the square tunnels being blue. This gives the game a more stream lined sense, and helps the progression without accidentally crashing.\n\nWhile this isn't a problem in Collider because of the reviving function, Accelerator doesn't have that. it is much more harder because of this and you feel like you have actually achieved something. What Accelerator does have is a difficulty setting, and this changes one thing mainly, the level design. Harder difficulty levels will result in tight corners and diverging paths, which when you are going fast, become really difficult to traverse. It just adds to the feel of satisfaction when you get that impossible badge for reaching a speed of 1000.\n\nAll in all, my basic gripe was paying for this. Yes it is cheap, yes it gave me a perfect achievement thing, but in all honesty, why play this when Accelerator on Kongregate is free and so much better?","February 6, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great purchase!\n\nIt is a fun, simple, and unique game in the arcade/racing genre.\n\nThe basic jist of the game is that you are a particle in a particle accelerator. (excuse my lack of knowledge of science)\n\nYou use only the mouse to control the particle through various obstacles in the accelerator.\n\nThe game has great speed and could compare to other games like wipEout or F-Zero.\n\nIt is pretty addicting and I find myself constantly clicking the 'play again' button.\n\nI did however notice various patterns of obstacles after 40 or 50 minutes of gameplay. It became a bit repetitive.\n\nAlso repetitive was the song used when playing. There is only ONE!\n\nIt would be nice if there was more variance of gameplay like different types of levels, more music tracks, and more patterns of obstacles.\n\nOverall, 'The Collider' is a good game that I enjoyed and thus will recommend. It is a little repetitive, but stangely addicting.\n\n7/10\n\nP.S. I wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for this one, so wait until a sale comes around :)","March 16, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is simple (recommend turning mouse sensitivity all the way up or close) aim the white dot on the hole you want to go threw. Basically you go threw holes collecting coins and trying not to hit the solid part of the obstacles, as you do this you are constantly speeding up (you start at 100 speed). The fact that they have a leader boards is gratifying to know that all the hard effort you have done went towards something. Coins are not that important from my understanding the only real use for them is if you do hit the solid part of the obstacle you can repair and continue where you left off (from my understanding you only get 3 repairs). I recommend this game for sure, trading cards, achievements, and pure bi polar fun/rage.

I got this game for 68p due to a voucher Steam gave me for my badges, And i am so glad i bought it. It's really fun! and slightly addictive.  I am not normally a fan of any "minigame" or "arcade-y" type games. I play games like TF2 , Csgo and Osu which is far from this genre but i am VERY impressed with this game. The simplicity and CLick and play feel Just makes it such a good time killer. And the Leaderboards makes it slightly competitive too.\n\nPros: Fun\nCompetitive\nSimple\nAddicting\n\nCons: Not worth £1.99 But very good fpr 68p\n\n\n\n","May 9, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The speed keeps increasing, so the more you hold on, the harder it gets.\n\nTo be frank, as said in many other reviews I read before even purchasing, it's really handy if you need to train your reaction skills for a FPS game (I play CS:GO and I do confirm I did improve a bit). Besides, it can help you waste some useless time, if you have any to spare.\n\nHowever, the music is not that great, only 1 soundtrack looping over and over again. The most annoying thing is how fast things end, at least in my case. I spend less than a minute before having to start from the beginning (or alternatively start at a speed I reached before), which makes for even less time playing.\n\nAll in all, it's not bad for killing time, but you may get frustrated at how incompetent you are dodging obstacles at insanely increasing speeds.","September 13, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The speed keeps increasing, so the more you hold on, the harder it gets.\n\nTo be frank, as said in many other reviews I read before even purchasing, it's really handy if you need to train your reaction skills for a FPS game (I play CS:GO and I do confirm I did improve a bit). Besides, it can help you waste some useless time, if you have any to spare.\n\nHowever, the music is not that great, only 1 soundtrack looping over and over again. The most annoying thing is how fast things end, at least in my case. I spend less than a minute before having to start from the beginning (or alternatively start at a speed I reached before), which makes for even less time playing.\n\nAll in all, it's not bad for killing time, but you may get frustrated at how incompetent you are dodging obstacles at insanely increasing speeds.","September 13, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a game that is $3, you get what you paid, however here are my pros and cons.\n\nPro's\n- Game is fun and helps with your hand to eye co-ordination.\n- Game is great to pass time (expecially at an airport)\n- It gets challanging going from speed 100 to speed 700 and not crashing.\n- Music is repetative but doesn't distract your play\n\nCon's\n- Finished it quite quickly, would love to have more different objects or more than a colored tube.\n- Getting 100% was relatively easy, about 2 hours gameplay.\n- Might fry your brain.\n\nConclusion, I want to give this game to my friends to see how far they will go before they lose their minds. If on special, it is a small game just to play when killing time for something else.\n6.5/10 would go crazy again.","March 5","true","2.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I Recomend this game because it is very fun/addictive and is cheap.\nThis game helps your aim because the crosshair pn your screen needs to go through the holes and it helps with aim correction not the flick shots.\n","July 2, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The goal is to get as far as possible by controlling the dot to get through the holes, and moving obstacles. I highly reccomend this game, but I would suggest buying during a sale though. I didn't put in enough time for it to be worth $3, but you might, depending on what you use the game for.\n\nUses:\n\nThere are several ways to utilize this game. Here are some examples.\n\nGreat for killing time\nPracticing aim and reaction time for FPS games like CS:GO\nPure enjoyment, as the game itself is really fun.\nEasy game to get all achievements for perfect games","July 3, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From Steam Community I found out I have to install some Visual C++ packages from Microsoft's page. It is quite unacceptable that player have to do something like this to make game fully work. And this is not even free game, I wonder how Steam let clearly broken games to be in their shop. After some C++ installations, I got the achievements. All of them during few games, even though I didn't actually reach those goals I should have.\n\nOther than that, this is nice small game. Looks okay and sounds okay. Fast paced and some good reflections are needed. Or getting to some weird flow state where you stare screen and move mouse without thinking anything. Fun to play few times, but I don't see so much reason to go back to this game.\n\nIf the achievements would work, this game would be worth of those few euros. But now it is broken and unfortunately I can not recommend this game.\n","June 6, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
