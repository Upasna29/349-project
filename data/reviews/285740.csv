I love you not only for your adorable looks, but also for your sparkling personality. Often, you can be a bit cheesy, but you always know how to make me laugh.\n\nI enjoy the completely nonverbal but totally understandable communication that my clients make, and I love your innuendos and your swingy little music. Sometimes you remind me a little of Cook, Serve, Delicious, in that you are a very well-balanced, innovative, and challenging game in the guise of a loungey little casual game. But don't be jealous, honey, because you are definitely an original.\n\nI love that you look at a player less for their reflexes and more for their memory and attention to detail. I really like when you encourage my competitive side and make me want to be the very best (out of all my Steam friends). I also think it's really sweet that you've helped me to get love blossoming amongst my friends (who are cool enough to play this game).\n\nI really enjoy your progressive nature, and the way that you make me work to unlock new perks and goals as I play. You keep adding new and fresh things into our relationship, and that just makes the fun last longer.\n\nKitty, you and I have spent several nights with each other, and every time I just don't want the evening to end and for us to part ways. Sometimes this makes mornings very difficult, but that's ok because I enjoy every moment of our time spent together.\n\nBasically, Kitty, I am simply crazy about you!\n\nLove,\n\nPraxis","June 9, 2015","true","21.0"," 232 of 253 people (92%) found this review helpful 100 people found this review funny","92","232","253","100","22"

You create a character, that is supposed to be "You". You choose your looks, your personality traits, your birthday which is also your star sign (Gemini, Aquarius, etc.) Your first date you set up you cannot mess up, as it's the tutorial that's running you through how to play.\n\nYou choose your venue that you want to act as a matchmaker for. Each venue has different people's personalities. You do kinda feel like a third wheel on the dates, since you're just silently watching them. The goal is to pick up on verbal cues by the dates and give them the best experience. Make the right comments, order the right food based on the hints they give, etc. You can date other peoples character profiles as well.\n\nYou get coins that are used as a currency to buy upgrades and other things to help you. The better you do, the more coins you are tipped at the end, the higher your reputation goes up, and the more you matchmaking you can do.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty interesting game and if you like the idea of setting people up on the perfect date, then it's worth a try.\n\nHumorous, non serious review:\n\nI am Lord Tippington, a balding, introverted, antisocial, nerd. I have hundreds of hours logged in "The Sims", have had many lovers, and as such I feel I am the most qualified to take the esteemed role as "Matchmaker".\n\nMy first day begins now.\n\nI have chosen a comic book shop as my first matchmaking venue, I will help fellow nerds such as myself find love.\n\nMy first individual is none other than m'lady "Ambrosia Bunfoot". I tip my Fedora at her. "M'lady!" I inquire, "What doth bring  such an esteemed m'lady such as yourself to my humble abode?"\n\nShe does not answer, save for the phrase "DUNGEON MASTER."\n\nAh! But the esteemed m'lady is a dungeon master! How could I not have guessed by her beautiful bowl-cut-mullet which appears to be stained by the grease of hot pockets of the distant past?\n\nI brush my trenchcoat back and fall to one knee, and grip noble Ambrosia's hand with my cheeto stained fingers, "M'lady, I, Lord Tippington, am an expert matchmaker and can find you the most noble of men!  Pray, tell me, what interested such a fine m'lady such as yourself?" It is not long before she robotically belts out the words:\n"FPS GAMES."\n"WIZARDY."\n"ELVES."\n\n"M'lady! I had no idea you indulged in wizardry! Pray, tell me, are you familliar of the Wizard's Gathering?" "Nevermind yourself with such trivial questions! I will find you a suitable sir right away!" I tip my fedora as I search for potential candidates.\n\nI find a match! I tip my fedora multiple times in glee. He is a fellow neckbeard, with a long, grease drenched mane. The sir goes by the calling of "Lucas Goldthwaite".\n\nTonight is date night, I have chosen a noble English pub as the location. They are taking their seats! I begin tipping my fedora furiously in anticipation.\n\nM'lady is getting along really well with Sir Goldthwaite!\n\nThey're... quite happy together. Happy. Together. My sausage-fingers clench into a fist and shake with jealousy.\n\nAs I watch in the shadows I notice they order Cheese Cauliflower and a Cheese Board to feast upon. I would've chosen something more bacon oriented, but alas.\n\nThe date winds down. They have agree'd to get more serious, settle down with a glass of fine champagne in a romantic hot tub, and partake in the age old tradition of making autistic kissing sounds at eachother. I watch from a distance, and stare at the happy couple I have created with ever-growing jealousy and tip my fedora repeatedly with rage.\n\nMy next dear romantic is a M'lady by the name of Rita. Rita... is b-beautiful. I find myself at a loss for words upon her entry.  I begin sweating profusely, and begin to sheepishly stammer: "H-hello m-m-m'lady.. can I h-help you today?"\n\nShe is no different than the damsel as before.\n\n"TRAIN DRIVER."\n\n"BUILDING COMPUTERS."\n\n"UFOS."\n\n"READING INSTRUCTIONS."\n\n"I must find a sir for such a perfect m'lady!" I thought.\n\nI turned to my computer and placed my cheeto dust stained fingertips upon my keyboard and began searching the database with expert precision. I have concluded her match is a dirty peasant butcher by the name of "Frazer Melonthwaite". A sir that appears to have taken after Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nDate night has arrived and they have chosen an American themed restaurant. It appears to be a 50's style diner. I would have chosen a Taco Bell at 3 am to ensure I would only encounter my own fedora and trenchcoat clad brethren.\n\nThe two have taken their seats, and Rita, being the kind, and gentle lamb of a lady has allowed the uncouth sir "Frazer" order first.\n\n...He appears to have ordered something without meat! S-surely he must be mistaken! A sir-ly sir that may be suitable to ste- I erm... mean... take the harmless Foal "Rita" from my good graces just yet! No! I will h-help him. I will get him a large order of Buffalo Wings! The manliest and sir-liest food in all the land!\n\nMy dear Rita loves it! Frazer... Frazer is displeased.  My tip my fedora in disgust.\n\nI shall try conversational topics next! I have told the sweet, dear angel Rita to ask the peasant boy Frazer his valueless opinion on her attire!\n\n...\n\nHe hates it?! Oh, my dear Rita how I'm sorry for wasting your precious time with this... dirty individual.\n\nHe's left for the restroom? How dare he leave such an exsquisite m'lady all alone?! I expect him to be gone for long, as he is likely only accustomed to disease-ridden defecation holes. I ponder whether I should approach her and take his place...\n\nAlas, he eventually returns and he appears to have mistaken the toilet as a wash bin, and tried to freshen up. His hair is soaked. It looks awful.\n\nBeing the fragile little butterfly Rita is, I inform her to lie to this insufferable fool of a "sir" that his hair looks good. Alas, she is timid and her speechcraft is lax. He does not believe her, and storms out. Rita is heartbroken, my white knight instincts kick in. I extend my greasy hand towards her and bellow "Dear Rita! Please allow a true good guy such as myself to court you! I shall treat you to only the best Hot Pockets my mother has to offer, and I will protect you from the evil "bros" that wish to harm you!"\n\nShe ignores my White Knightery. She is heart broken and  vows to spend the rest of her days in a trash can.\n\nIn the desert wasteland.\n\nDuring a neverending storm.\n\nI tip my fedora in shame and question why no m'lady would allow such a good guy to take their hand in courtship.\n\n10/10 Strangest and best blind date & bitter third-wheel-nerd simulator.","April 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 190 of 247 people (77%) found this review helpful 208 people found this review funny","77","190","247","208","10"

You want to play for an hour? WRONG. You will play for several.\n\nIn the game you run a dating agency and find perfect and not-so-perfect matches for your clients.\nYour guardian angel, Kitty herself, drops occassional sassy hints throughout the game which require me to breathe in a plastic bag.\n\nThe game consists of choosing a client, looking at their interests, personality traits and preferences then finding a match in the little black book (a must have *wink*). If the match prefers a certain hair colour you can always change it before the date. Because who doesn't want to change themselves for someone else?\nBe careful with picking the right restaurant! Each has different difficulties and scenarios. If you can't calculate the right tip, like me - someone who cried on their final math exam, here is a nice link I found to help you out: http://www.onlineconversion.com/tip_calculator.htm\n\nMake sure you watch out for your mail as the clients will write back to you whether their relationship has grown or dissolved. With all the weddings I arranged I'm upset I haven't be invited to a single one!\n\nI never found anything in my life so satisfying as matching fictional characters and watch them diss each other's outfits and hair.

You have this sinking feeling that something or someone may judge you, but you know what? It tastes good and it just FEELS SO RIGHT.\n\nThis is a very well thought out dating sim game and I'm happy to still be waist deep within it. Your task is to help your boss, Kitty Powers, make perfect matches. Send your clients off on their dream dates and make sure they don't blow it.\n\nSimple enough, right? Not quite. There are types of people to mix and match together while hoping that date goes perfectly. Will it take one perfect date or do you want to steam it out with three dates? Guide your clients by playing mini games to make sure they succeed in winning the affections of their date.\n\nIf you succeed, you get promotions and you get paid. Getting paid means better restaurants to take dates to, better ways to fancy up your clients (because they REALLY need your help), and other little perks like kicking out the more troublesome clients.\n\nThe tutorial makes things look incredibly easy, but once that's done, you are almost completely on your own and left figuring out things for yourself. You'll have to understand clients interests and how your little black book works. You'll either figure this out through dumb luck or failing. Either way, there's no harm in making a few mistakes at first. No one's perfect starting out. Even I have a completely ruined relationship from a client that I thought were totally into each other. Oh well, win some and lose some.\n\nI love that you get updates from satisfied customers and you get perks from their continuing relationships. I thought that this was a great touch and another incentive to get things right the first time. Another thing that I loved? Making my own profile to send out myself to be a "mystery shopper" for my own dating life. Can't wait to see the results to have a good laugh over that.\n\nThe graphics are bright and inviting, reminding me of traditional time management games. And those games? Those games remind me of addiction. They remind me of "just one more level". That's what I noticed immediately. I wanted one more date conquered just because I needed the ego boost. Just to say I was Kitty's best employee (I have no friends playing this so this is my wild imagination), I needed to do more work for more upgrades. Just ONE MORE client! It's very friendly and I'm almost happy that Kitty isn't cartoony because that would take away from the humor that is our wonderful and loving boss. She is quite sassy and pixels just wouldn't suit her, after all.\n\nI especially appreciated that there was a bit more inclusion in this game. It's not just limited to man-seeking-woman or woman-seeking-man, the devs did realize there's more than man and woman relationships so I must say I appreciated that option. Thank you. It means a lot that you did that.\n\nThere is a bit of stereotyping...but more so on the personality types of "sporty", "nerds", "hippies", etc. If that offends you then I have no idea what to say. If you have trouble with characters who are supposed to be "punk alternative" speaking with what seems like (forgive if I read it in the wrong accent!) a Cockney/London accent then steer clear. Seriously. British Punks from London stereotypes. I can't imagine anyone hating that but hey, they're there amongst a few other cliches. I thought they were all incredibly adorable characters I really, desperately wanted to see happy. They're very "human" with wants and needs and the need to be validated.\n\nEven for cartoon people without souls, yes. I'm entirely serious.\n\nThe more things you buy for your matchmaking business, the harder things get. If you buy better restaurants, you get paid more, but the games get harder and sometimes slightly lewd. Yes there is a game to hold in your fart. The fact I can write a review complimenting a game for recognizing that yes, you have to hold in your gas during a date and it is indeed a game of chance is astounding. I never thought I'd have to compliment a fart mini game.\n\nBuy a salon for your business and you can alter your appearance for a better potential mate for your client. Wouldn't that one guy or gal be great IF ONLY your client dyed their hair lilac? Now you can...if you do it quickly. Does that guy/gal prefer a more chic style? Quickly change clothes after you buy an add-on for your salon. They say you shouldn't change for anyone but hey, let's make an exception, right?\n\nIt's an easily accessible game that truly anyone can play. While I'd keep this for the crowd that can understand dating, I'd honestly say this is really a decent game for anyone to play. It's cute. It's bubbly. You can play against your friends and compare scores. You can even send your friends personas on dates if they're playing. You get bonus points for making matches with real life people and you'll tell who they are by the little globe by their profile as you match them up to people.\n\nI can't find a single thing bad about this game, really. It's a little tycoon/sim on dating and it really illustrates the whole luck/chance and repetition that is dating. And I'm not bored! There's always some new curve ball coming at me!\n\nPlus Kitty Powers is the best boss I have ever had. If I could just do this in real life with Kitty as my real boss, this would be great.","April 30, 2015","true","9.9"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","88","51","58","19","1"

It gets you thinking which person you can match up your client with to have the highest mathematically probable chance for success in the future. It offers real dating dilemmas which do occur in real life, and of course some comedic ones which can happen but are often rare (well, rare for most people anyway lol....such as what would you do when you cut the cheese on a date).\n\nThe colours and the characters are very vibrant and make you want to come back for more.

With absolutely nothing in common except his documented obesssion with blue eyed beauties, Liberty took my advice and went on a date with loser #1. The evening started horribly, Liberty having selected all-American fine dining at its best with real authentic truck-stop flavours. Except Greg, her date, wants some fancy red meat dish with milk and the only thing on the menu is corndogs and french fries. Liberty suffered through Greg's talks of UFO's and internet meme's, eventually realizing through dull conversation that he shared none of her interests such as celebrity gossip or clowns. At the end of the date, Liberty thought she'd give it one more shot by asking Greg out for a second date. Greg is fairly unimpressed at this point and wants Liberty to beg for a second date. Liberty begs. Guess she swiped right after all.\n\nThis game is great and doesn't discriminate.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/285740/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","I'm Hobbes Bauer, and this is the longest day of my life...\nSome days you get a review, and you know it's fate. Where the game picks you, as much as you pick the game. Kitty Powers is one such game. It's a strange beast, being made up of one part casual coating, one part extremely devious memory games and puzzle minigame, and one part hideous pink topping. Had this been the same mechanics in any other presentation (say, a popcap game), this game would be literally flying off of digital shelves all over the place. The problem stems from well, the insane use of pink, but more of that shortly. Let's get into what the game is about.\n\nA dating simulator that's actually mechanically interesting? Say it ain't so!\nYou are a fresh hire in the ever expanding world of the Kitty Powers Matchmaking empire. You have been given a franchise branch in a city, and it's your job to service the city by matching people up and sending them off to find love and happiness (or at least make you enough money to keep you in profit). To this end Kitty Powers furnishes you with two hundred "Kitty Coins", a Kitty Powers office which would make Kerry Katona weep tears of joy, and introduces you with a step by step tutorial that teaches you the ins and outs of the basics of the game, as well as introducing you to some of the most basic of the minigames you'll encounter.\n\nOnce you've completed your first tutorial date, the training wheels come off, and you can use your Kitty coins to purchase anything that's within your level. As you successfully complete dates and match couples, you'll gain reputation and experience, this unlocks more things to spend your coins on, and as it turns out, there's a lot to buy. There's a big selection of restaurants to pick up, there's a wide bevy of make-up customisation to groom your dates before the night out, as well as additional pages in Kitty's book for room for more dates to give you extra leeway in selecting possible date options. In short, this game has depth, which is surprising, it will take you time, quite a bit of it, if you want to see everything.\n\nEach restaurant comes with its' own unique events, along with a generic pool that means each restaurant encounter will be different, along with the conversation system (where you "pull the love handle", deities help me, that's a thing now) which not only requires you to remember the personality types of each date, but enforces harsh penalties if you repeat topics, not just on the same date, but on previous dates as well. For a supposedly casual game, this one doesn't pull its' punches when it comes to the memory mini-games and layering on the difficulty over multiple dates. You get reminders about topics covered and restaurants visited with a given couple, but the game will make damn sure that you're kept on your toes. It might -look- casual, but under that cute exterior, this game has a rather steely spine.\n\nMechanically excellent, graphically chintzy...\nIt's all presented in this smooth, glossy casual style that immediately evokes memories of Popcap games, and has that easy, big button approach that makes it very straightforward, and friendly to those even with poor fine motor skills (even if the humour sails terribly close to the wind on many an occasion). The art style is very, very consistent, albeit in many cases you're going to wish that the designers had a volume dial and they used it to tone the damn thing down, the game uses neon pink liberally. Great for calibrating your monitor, not great for your eyes, have ice buckets on standby if you intend to play more than half an hour at a time.\n\nHerein lies the great contradiction at the heart of the game, the mechanics are good, and in any other game there's the foundation and the scaffolds of something really good. This game hasn't got the positive reviews it has just for being he-he-hilarious. It's got them because when you manage to get past the horrific pink, there's a really solid game under the surface. But the visual design is going to deter people, I mean it uses comic sans fer chrissakes. That's not how you win the hearts and minds of some people. But then I have concluded the audience for this game is likely not the traditional audience who plays things like say, Counter Strike or the likes. Still, softening the pink would have helped a lot.\n\nLove can be simple, except when it's not...\nThe game does a really good job of translating both the concept of a dating game, something that to now has always been done pretty terribly, and the longer term effects (by sending letters) using good procedural generation techniques. It's managed this by taking itself "not very seriously". This game isn't afraid to poke fun at itself, the loading screens are full of self deprecating humour, the game likes to jibe about various game genres, it asks you to "Pull the love handle" with a straight face, it throws chintz about in the same way Max Payne threw bullets.\n\nIn turning the whole process of dating, love and romance into this utterly comic and slightly off the wall casual game that's both approachable and yet at the same time potentially really tricky, it strikes a fine balance. As you get into the higher difficulty dates, you'll find the memory games get genuinely hard, like, brain training hard. You'll be asked to remember details that you may not have been paying much attention to ordinarily, you'll be asked to remember and pick out the desert from a list as they roll past, you'll be asked to correctly identify and order food based on vague descriptions. As I said, inside this cute chintzy game, there's a really tough nut in the center.\n\nIt's just too damned pink.\n\nThe guilty pleasure of being fabulous...\nSo. Hm. How do I put this. It's good. As much as I grit my teeth and press the button to recommend this, it's actually a good game once you get past the first initial dates and the difficulty ramps up. But you'll need a serious tolerance for the visual design (or a good pair of sunglasses) and probably Clicker Heroes so you can hide what you're doing, lest people stare at your Steam Profile and go "What in the name of gods..."\n\nVerdict : Highly Recommended as a guilty pleasure. So do your research first, and/or run Clicker Heroes so people don't start laughing loudly in your chat window.","May 22, 2015","true","5.4"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","18","28","8","4"

I honestly don't even know how to describe what I like about it. It's just plain fun. Instead, here is the small list of things I don't like about it, compiled over my admittedly meager 1.5 hours played (in my defense, I bought this at 1 AM on a Monday morning).\n\n-Loading seems to happen all the time. If there's a different 2D background for the 2D characters, there will be a load screen, and they're often relatively long. I can usually load a new area in heavily modded Skyrim at least as quickly as KPM can load the lewdly named American restaurant. I feel like load screens and load times both should be pretty minimal for something like this, but I'm no expert, and it's not horrid. Just annoying.\n\n-It can get a little samey, and it's probably not something most people want to sit down and play for more than a couple hours because of that. The dialog is modular (i.e. there are probably 5-10 different ways of saying "I like your hair" and any other conceivable saying), but you see them a lot. After 30-45 minutes of playing, I stopped reading the unimportant dialog because it wasn't funny or interesting after seeing it a few times in that time. It was still fun, just a little less immersive, especially because it felt like the same people talking. Also, unless things change further in, the dates are all just dinner at a restaurant that consist of a few random minigames from a small pool. While they do vary from each other a little and it's a good formula, it does get old.\n\n-A lot of the difficulty of the game seems to stem from its randomness. Randomness is kind of a necessity in a game like this, but I think it has a little too much influence. It's very hard to predict how your client's date is going to react to what you say or the decisions you make, and I think there should be more reliable guesswork, if that makes sense. But maybe I just need to play more to understand. I do like that failing a client too much makes them leave and hurt your rep a lot - I almost got to a third strike with one client and I had to do everything I could to make their last date work out.\n\n-I'm not sure if I'd pay the full $10 for this game, just because it remains to be seen to me how much the gameplay fleshes out, but I got it on GMG for $6 and that was definitely worth it. At time of posting, it was $7.49 on Steam, which I would have paid if not for the GMG deal.\n\nAll that said is just overanalysis of things that weren't big deals. The art is fitting, the voice work and images for the one persistent character is hilarious and well done, and the gameplay is enjoyable and error-free. If you're looking to play a game all day, this probably isn't it, but it's definitely something you can keep on hand and get a few hours of fun out of. It also throws your friends' characters in the game as potential clients/dates, so you can have some fun with that if you can convince someone else to play it. I also plan to break it out at LAN parties so my friend Brian can laugh at me and call me rude names.","April 27, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

This game is completely unique to anything I've ever played before, and it combines so many elements!  Let's start with clientele!  First you choose a location (disco, gym, comic book store, ect.) for Kitty to set up fliers to attract customers.  The locations you pick determine the type of clients that arrive; for example, choosing the comic book store will bring in the "Geeky" types.  Each client is different, varying in looks, personality, and interests.  Because of the uniqueness of each character, it can be hard finding the right match for your client, but that's what makes it so much fun!  Will your client swing a home-run of strike out on their date(s)?\n\nThe actual dates are the most intricate part of the entire game.   Literally everything has a part in determining the success of the date, from choosing a restaurant to holding in your farts!  There are fun mini-games to be played that vary with each establishment you go to.  Leveling up unlocks new restaurants for clients to visit and different features in the salon to beautify your client before the big date!\n\nThere is quite a lot of memorization involved in the game, so it can get tough once you reach the higher scoring dates, but I don't believe it distracts from the overall entertainment of the game.\n\nMy favorite thing about the game is the mailbox feature.  After successfully setting up your client with a hot date, you will receive mail from he or she updating you on how things are progressing in their new relationship.  Sometimes things go sour and the couple breaks up, but sometimes they'll end up with children and even name one of the babies after you!

It can give off the repetitive feeling since you're basically doing the same thing over and over again.\nOne of the game mechanics I thoroughly enjoyed would be the matchmaking system. Leveling up will give you more options to make conversations between your client and his/her match. There are groups of clubs that you can advertise to gain more clients.\n\nAn interesting part of the game that made it stand-out would be the integrated matchmaking system where your created character can be matched by other players by either using your facebook account or steam. I did not get the chance to see my character being matched but I did match up a lot of other players with a bonus reward of cash and xp. I liked how bringing up bad dates would lower your reputation thus making it harder to get more cash.\n\nThe only bad news I can say would be that personally for me the game crashed quite often but as long as I just verified my integrity cache,it was fine. It would also be great if the developers made an option to be able to merge your character if you bought the game on another platform so you didn't have to start all over again.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nSure,it's a good game to lose yourself and relax. At the same time,I guess it did help me learn some new ways to talk to people.","October 19, 2015","true","18.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Dating sims such as this are a serious guilty pleasure of mine, so this game is right up my ally.  This one is a little different, however, because rather than going on dates yourself, you pair up other lonely hearts and send them on dates in an attempt to help them find their soulmate.  It's set up in a game show-type fashion, where you watch your client and their date through secret cameras and tell them what to say to their date in an attempt to impress them.  If you can't impress them, however, you will lose reputation points and undoubtedly hold your head in shame.  One negative thing that I must bring attention to is that this game gets stupid hard later on.  It may just be the fact that my skillz just aren't mad enough, but I'm a little too dense to figure out the date's type based on their interests, which is something you must know for maxium chances of success.  It would be nice if you could see their type along with the rest of their info.  Another thing that I'm not so keen on is the randomness of the mini games which can get pretty frustrating.  Sure, you can cheat, but only if you have enough coins.  But I suppose the random aspect is all part of the fun, kinda like Mario Party.  Overall, this is a fun, simple game that I must admit is pretty addicting, even if it is a little difficult.  It doesn't take itself seriously at all, which I something I value in life as well as games, so if you think this is the sort of game you would be interested in, I'd definitely give it a shot.","July 26, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Prunk must pay close attention to learn about character peoples.  Then must do math (thank gods Prunk had calculator), use memory skills, and play guessing games to make client date a happy date.  Sometimes, it no work out and Prunk lose client when they had three bad dates which make Prunk want to work harder on next one.\n\nA slot/fruit machine give you choices of questions to ask date what they like.  You get more choices with career promotions from Kitty Powers.  Kitty Powers is cooky fun - Prunk like her style!  Game start with a few restaurants to take date on, then you can buy more restaurants which open more fun mini games.\n\nIf you believe (Prunk does not) that a person need change to make other person happy, you can buy salon things to change client's hair color, face accessories and so on.  Sometimes Prunk changes client hair color to suit date's taste, but not so much other stuff.  Many choices to make in game, many fun minigames, and Prunk have fun trying to figure character peoples' personalities.\n\nTutorial is nice and Prunk lose much time playing game.  Game should come with warning that could harm real relationships because love playing game too much, hahaha.  Prunk, though, recommend game - very fun game.\n\nEducatedOrc Prunk say:\n\nFun & Entertaining - 5 / 5 grunts\nSkill Leveling - 5/5\nAction Intensity - 1 / 5 grunts\nStoryline - 4 / 5 grunts\nAddictive - 5 / 5 grunts\nOVERALL - 4 out of 5 grunts","August 23, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the anime games are fun, this one has the british theme.  The personalities of the dates are amusing, the challenges are fun, and I'm just surprised all around with this game.\nIt will definitely test your memory as well.  As the levels progress theres more and more to remember about your potential dates, as well as a little luck, just like actual dating!\nThe host character is also just hillarious.  Quite the Dame Edna type.  I'm not sure if that was the intent of the game, but it worked wonderfully.  She's a fun mentor as you progress through the game and is never lacking a funny quip or two.\nAll in all, I found the game challenging for a dating sim, refreshing in the fact its not another anime dating sim, and all in all just a lot of fun.  Perfect for a casual hour or two, or a marathon that you find yourself still playing the game at 5am and you have to go to work/school the next day.  I honestly lost about 3 hours saying "just one more date"\n","April 22, 2015","true","14.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

While Kitty romps around town collecting the loneliest hipsters, geeks and chic types, it’ll be up to you to pair them off with suitable partners, reaping both fame and fortune if all goes well.\n\nAnd how, you ask, do we ensure that our potential couples hit it off?

From the screenshots, one might assume it's another iOS port onto the PC, but this game actually goes way beyond what we've come to expect from iOS games.  Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is about your own custom character's adventures being Kitty Powers' matchmaker and pairing up individuals you think might make nice couples.  Sometimes things go exactly how you think it will, and sometimes it takes a bit of prodding to get them to love eachother.  Sometimes you will taste the taste of total failure, sometimes total success.  Dates can go either way in this game with the dates getting progressively harder as the player unlocks more things, such as resturants, salon stylists, and more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffySama/recommended/285740/","FluffySama","FluffySama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffySama/","205 products in account","I have fallen in love and it's all thanks to Kitty Powers!\n\nMore seriously, this game is incredibly fun and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a casual game that'll steal hours, and hearts, from them.\n\nStory:\n\nYou're a matchmaker. Make some matches. Try to make REALLY GOOD matches too so that you can make some extra money and make better matches.\n\nGameplay:\n\nSimple but effective, each "round" you play is a date for one of your clients. At any date any given "event" might happen, triggering a mini-game; the amount of mini-games it draws from depends on your progression and how many different restaurants you get. The games are fun (if occasionally frustrating!) and don't really get old. Examples: card matching, higher or lower, plinko, spot the difference, etc.\n\nIt's not surprising to me that this is also a mobile game; however it doesn't necessarily feel like a mobile game ported to the PC, if that makes sense, and I would definitely rather play it on a PC than my phone or a tablet. I do wish there were some integration of the keyboard for mini-games though.\n\nOverall my biggest worry about gameplay is always whether or not it detracts from or serves the story. As it's not a story-heavy game, and as the gameplay is quick and casual, I'd say it hits the mark perfectly. Low investment in skill or cognition for an inversely high amount of pleasure.\n\nArt and Writing:\n\nThe art is campy, randomly generated, and absolutely perfect for what the game is. My one complaint here is that ALL of the characters are super thin and cisgender/gender normative? But diversity in appearance, race, and sexuality make for a fun enough romp that I forget that while playing. Kitty Powers herself is absolutely adorable while jumping off the screen, and while I think she's a tongue-in-cheek joke herself (she is a drag queen), the game has so far managed that without dipping into transmisogyny (I'm only level 9 though). The characters are incredibly repetitive, but the combinations of what they say change each time and the new combinations are almost always very funny.\n\nSound and Music:\n\nThe voice-actor for Kitty Powers is awesome. The character really comes alive even though she completely lacks animation. The rest of the sound? Eh. The music is loud, even when put down all the way to 1 and mostly it just annoys me. That's not terribly surprising, though; I rarely prefer to play games with their music (I like to turn on netflix or similar while playing). Sound effects and character "chatter" (they're not really speaking English) are very nicely done, though.","May 13, 2015","true","19.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I saw a Let's Play of this game and decided I needed it in my life. The Kitty Powers character - while I don't personally like her - is very reminiscent of the Lily Savage style character, a fun but fabulous drag queen who rocks it.\n\nThe gameplay itself has you setting up clients with potential dates and trying to make the right matches for them based on personality type and more. It gets pretty nuanced which is pretty cool.\n\nBut that's not all, you're also a fly on the wall in each date, the client has an earpiece through which you tell them what to say. You have to work out what the date wants to eat from clues like "I want something cold with no meat. And no wheat." You play a slot machine for conversation topics. You'll have to choose whether to lie or tell the truth on some of your answers, whether you think the date will be pleased or not. If you lie, you spin the 'Wheel of Misfortune' to see if you got away with it or not, with the chance of winning bonus coins. The coins you use in the shop to unlock add-ons to the salon where you can do your client up before their date, unlock more pages of potential dates, and unlock more retaurants. Each restaurant unlock adds in a new "thing" in to a date. For example, one restaurant unlock throws in the chance for your client's ex to randomly show up and you have to decide whether to be honest about who it was or lie. The date will either care greatly, or not. If you lie, you get the Wheel of Misfortune and if they don't believe you, as before, it's a strike. You get 3 strikes in a date. If you get 3, they walk out. Oh and if your client gets dumped they get a broken heart. If they are dumped 3 times, they storm out and you lose a bunch of reputation.\n\nTL;DR - It's a very pink, camp game with a really fun centre and I'm bloody addicted. But prepare for a British culture slap in the face.. I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to "go for a cheeky Nandos for a bit of bants."","June 14, 2015","true","33.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game just does not stop being ridiculously playable. The writing is funny, the combinations of qualities/like/hates/looks of the daters is pretty much infinite, the mini-games are a mix of skill (often memory) and total dumb luck. Maybe the only truly frustrating thing about it is that some of the Steam achievements are really difficult, but considering you can just keep going from town to town to town building new parts of Kitty's matchmaking empire, I guess they're not theoretically impossible. But you can't get greedy and impatient about pulling them off - you'll only get mad. Crazy value for money.

There are tons of things to love about this game.  It's smart, witty and, let's face it, if drag queens ruled the world we would all have fabulous hair.  The game-play is, overall, enjoyable...with enough depth to require some brain work, but that's also a downside because I apparently don't have enough brains to make it work.  When taking on a client, Kitty tells us what "type" they are, which is easy enough, and we need to match the client with a compatible type, but it's difficult to figure out the type of character I'm hooking up with the client.  Each type has a number of different interests, and different types enjoy the sames interests at varying degrees, so it's hard to really figure out which characters are a good match for the client.  If they're not a match, your reputation goes down the toilet and game life begins to suck.  You can look at the guides that intrepid players have tried to compile, and even the enormous graphasaurus table is not nearly complete.  When it comes down to it, having a successful date in the game seems like little more than chance, which takes away some of the motivation to keep playing, especially after a run of miserable dates.  I don't mind putting in the time to figure out a game, but it has to be within the capacity of the human mind.  After 17 hours of play, I'm apparently the sorriest matchmaker on earth.  Still, this game is fun and funny, and is worth trying.  And...drag queens.  Every game would be better with drag queens.","December 31, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's entertaining fun that has made me laugh out loud so many times, and I can't remember the last time a game did that. The titular (oo-er) Kitty Powers is probably the greatest part of its appeal, with her strong personality and hilarious quips. The characters are so funny and cute, the mini-games are incredibly fun, and overall the whole thing is just so amusing. It's fun to play, and that is the most important thing in a game.\n\nIt's also a well-made game and works solidly. It has all the options (and more, really) that would be expected from a modern game relating to display, audio, and so forth. The whole package (oh MY) truly is an appealing one, making the experience a pleasure. Play for a few minutes and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the day, or play for a few hours and go on a matchmaking marathon!\n\nI find it especially laudable that both Kitty and the developers have stood behind the game and continue to promote it, to encourage videos, and have even made appearances for the game. They have continued to update the game, and overall they have been exactly the kind of developer everyone loves. It's clear a huge amount of love and care went into this game, and I'm glad to see more people discovering and enjoying it.\n\nEven if you aren't sure if this might be your kind of game, I still suggest giving it a try. It's a lot more fun than most games in this genre can manage. It's funny, cute, sweet, and really enchanting. It pulls you in and has so many things to unlock and discover, there is so much play value to it. At its regular price it's a steal for all it has to offer, but at a sale price, I have to say you should get it immediately.\n\nGreat game, great fun, and far more entertaining than plenty of the games I've played with a higher profile. Kitty Powers will put a smile on your face and maybe inspire you to do some matchmaking of your own! Or maybe just to play one more date on the game...just one more!","January 2","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I bought it and played it. Here is my conclusion.\n\nPros\n-Kitty Powers is a super fun narrorator (love you Kitty!)\n-Art style is nice and cartoonish\n-Though it's a dating simulator, it's not just hitting on hot girls/guys (whichever you're into). In Kitty Powers' YOU'RE the one pulling the strings, which means you WATCH the failure, YOU'RE not the failure. Plus, I love playing god :)\n-The music is adorable\n-The dialogue is pretty funny, I especially like the "space alien dialogue." It's won my cardiovascular organ!\n-The mailbox. Apparently a couple I made named their first child "Ozzie." Aww!\n\nCons\n-Game can get repetitive quickly\n-If you're not into goofy, cartoonish things, this game is not for you. Coincidentally, if you're not into goofy, cartoonish things, I don't want to know you :)\n-The Mailbox. It's SO DEPRESSING when a couple you thought was PERFECT for each other breaks up.\n\nOverall, for the $9.99 price, I say Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is definately worth the buy. It's a good thing to play once you've broken up with your BF/GF and want to destroy the meaning of love. Fabulous!!!","October 14, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of going on dates yourself, you guide your clients through their date with the girl/guy you think is right for them. You can also choose which restaurant they go to. The restaurants have 3 levels; easy, medium, and hard. You can also change the way your client looks before your date.\n\nIf you succeed, they get together. Afterwards, depending on how you acted on the date, they'll break up.

If you fail 3 times in a row, they'll leave the agency, and your reputation will drop.\n\nSometimes, you'll get stuck in the middle, and have to go on three dates before you succeed (or fail).","September 19, 2015","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had to climb the corporate ladder for months, going on years before I was given interesting cases and finally explored the depths of myself to find my true inner being. The first good clients I had, were John Green and Colbie Caillat. I gained more confidence with successfully matching them, and even tried my hand at mascara.

I absolutely love the fact that it supports same-sex equality within the game itself. The game is very laid back and peaceful in a way and it's very positive and upbeat. It definitely keeps me in a good mood; however, when I fail to match a pair, I get a tad frustrated, but that's just me—I like to succeed when I play games, but, then again, who doesn't? If you're still not sure whether you should get this game or not, I would recommend watching iHasCupquake play it.

It's entertaining fun that has made me laugh out loud so many times, and I can't remember the last time a game did that. The titular (oo-er) Kitty Powers is probably the greatest part of its appeal, with her strong personality and hilarious quips. The characters are so funny and cute, the mini-games are incredibly fun, and overall the whole thing is just so amusing. It's fun to play, and that is the most important thing in a game.\n\nIt's also a well-made game and works solidly. It has all the options (and more, really) that would be expected from a modern game relating to display, audio, and so forth. The whole package (oh MY) truly is an appealing one, making the experience a pleasure. Play for a few minutes and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the day, or play for a few hours and go on a matchmaking marathon!\n\nI find it especially laudable that both Kitty and the developers have stood behind the game and continue to promote it, to encourage videos, and have even made appearances for the game. They have continued to update the game, and overall they have been exactly the kind of developer everyone loves. It's clear a huge amount of love and care went into this game, and I'm glad to see more people discovering and enjoying it.\n\nEven if you aren't sure if this might be your kind of game, I still suggest giving it a try. It's a lot more fun than most games in this genre can manage. It's funny, cute, sweet, and really enchanting. It pulls you in and has so many things to unlock and discover, there is so much play value to it. At its regular price it's a steal for all it has to offer, but at a sale price, I have to say you should get it immediately.\n\nGreat game, great fun, and far more entertaining than plenty of the games I've played with a higher profile. Kitty Powers will put a smile on your face and maybe inspire you to do some matchmaking of your own! Or maybe just to play one more date on the game...just one more!","January 2","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After a long 12 hours of playing this game, I can assure you this game is an absolute addiction! I shall present my TOP 3 REASON for you to consider this game in your collection!\n\nTOP REASON\n1. Everyone just loves Kitty Powers, who won't? She is the QUEEN!\n\n2. Each and every one of the clients who step into the agency is just a unique human being as any real human being are. It is just like a real-life online match-making service and that is the main key why this game is so much fun! You won't and will probably never meet the same client, EVER!\n\n3. Surprises and surprises! Honestly, the best part of the game, at least to my opinion, is the moment you receive letters from the pairings whom you succeeded in pairing. The letters are fairly mysterious and I LOVE it. Whether the pairings go happily ever after or the relationship didn't work out is 50/50 which makes me absolutely amused.","October 20, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
