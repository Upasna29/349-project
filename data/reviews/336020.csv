This is so low quality made, so imprecise for cursor clicks. Also achievements are deeply bugged! Just with one word said, it's TERRIBLE game. This game should be free, because is not even 1$ worth...","February 2, 2015","false","9.2"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","36","45","4","0"

Then this game is for you!\n\nThe 'adventure puzzles' are ridiculous (90% of them involving a magic scroll to solve problems). The other puzzles are just dumbed down versions of ones you can find in better games (for example a match-the-shape one that's more suited for a three year old). It feels like a cheap hidden object game just without the hidden object scenes.\n\nThe graphics are basic 3D rendered scenes that feel absolutely lifeless. You can see on the screenshots that it's barely better than early 90s 3D rendered pictures. This wouldn't be a problem if the game was actually good and engaging, but it surely isn't.\n\nThe voice acting is decent and the cut scenes have at least some effort put into them. The story itself though is very generic and quite boring.\n\nThere's nothing in this 'game' that makes it worth playing. There are better free games out there. Much better games...\n","January 27, 2015","false","0.9"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","0"

Placing  things in order by color, sliding puzzles and jigsaw puzzles are the usual ones.  The graphic is  okay, the story  okay, the game play okay.  If you're into point and click, with an element of HOG, then this is  an 'okay' game.  For me it didn't quite  draw me in like  Myst, Blade Runner, Syberia, Grim Fandango, Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword and Disc World to name just a few.  I don't think i'll be looking back ten years hence thinking  this was a classic, but it is playable and mildly intresting so it deserves a thumbs up.","April 19, 2015","true","5.8"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/336020/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Pahelika puts you in the shoes of a man finding a magical book and set on the trail of a mighty one used by a king to defeat  his evil enemy.\n\nThe game is a little adventure one, you find objects, you combine with others, you use them and you solve some puzzles (sliders, codes, jigsaws, etc..). You visit different "worlds" (fairies, ice, an old wizard's tower, etc...). While the gameplay is well balanced, there is however a big problem with Pahelika.\n\nIt's a problem of hitbox. I was trying to put an object where it should have been to see it being refused. I was on the glittering zone but nothing was working, unless I click a little more above or a little more under. Also, it was not always easy to understand what to do.\n\nI was even stuck at one moment because I couldn't find the switch, that was so tiny, that I thought that the game was bugged. I did a new profile and I wasn't stopped, yet, I realized that sometimes, it was not easy to spot. I don't know for you but when you have to rely on a walkthrough because you're tired of some non-sense, it's not satisfying. I mean, Pahelika falls into the category of games where I feel like I don't need to look for a guide - it's been like that since I play casual games. And having to look for the walkthrough on the Internet is frustrating.\n\nThe graphics and the soundtrack are correct, the story is told like a comic, which is a nice feature.... though the guy you're incarnating is different from the header on Steam and drawn in the cutscenes.\n\nAnyway, I can't really recommend this game. Despite a good gameplay, I didn't quite enjoy the game like I should have if it was more polished.","December 14, 2015","false","4.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

You're just supposed to guess.  The badly rendered environments result in several pixel hunts.  At least one of the hints is blatantly wrong.  It's telling that the best parts of the game were the repeated stock sliding and jigsaw puzzles.\n\nPahelika: Secret Legends resembles something a small child would come up with if tasked to design an adventure game (EDIT: It looks like people found that insulting to small children; I apologize).  KISS Ltd has published some bad games, but accepting something like this is just shameful!  Spend your time and money on something that deserves it.","January 26, 2015","false","3.4"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","15","27","3","0"

After stage 5 however, any reasoning behind the puzzles seem to disappear, and you'll make extensive use of the hint/skip button.\nThis would not be so bad if that button did not take ages to charge.\nStorywise, it's more of a prologue, and not really worth the 9 euros.
