This game supports a controller.\n\nThis game is aimed at the family with a younger audience as a focus.\nThe creators all work (or used to work) at Pixar.\n\nIn Flyhunter Origins you play Zak, a clumsy one-eyed alien, who seems to be the only survivor of an alien spacechip. Because of an incident all precious cargo has been ejected from the ship and landed on planet earth. It's your task to return it. This precious cargo is a bunch of exotic flies, hence "Flyhunter".\n\nArmed with a Fly Swatter (later you get access to a gun) and a jetpack you have to find these flies. On your quest you'll find numerous obstacles and enemies (earth's insects). Zak is a very small alien, so earths creatures are about his size or a lot bigger. You can collect eggs you can use to upgrade your weapon stats (add +1 to damage, very basic).\nAt the end of a level when you're about to catch the fly the game changes to a 3d racing game, in which you have to smack the fly a few times. Odd imo, but it works.\n\nIts a typical platformer. Controls are easy (jump/doublejump/shoot/melee). There are plenty of spawn points. Anyone can play this.\n\nThe good\n- Lovable and funny maincharacter\n- Very easy controls\n- Controller support\n- Nicely priced\n- Pixar style artwork and characters\n- 3D Racing\n- Upgradable weaponry\n\nThe bad\n- Hit detection seemed to be off sometimes. I had a lot of trouble defeating the big spider. Could be me though.\n- Might be a bit too easy for the more mature players.\n- Graphics arent really impressive\n\nOverall a nice game for the younger audience. There are more impressive platformers around though.\n\nRecommend? Yes, but not for everyone. 70/100\n","December 11, 2014","true","2.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","1"

During this journey you will fight various bugs and spiders, and try to avoid larger bugs and frogs. In some levels you'll be controlling a different character, initially completely unarmed and later only equipped with a zapper (stunner) - so in those levels you'll just be avoiding bugs and robots, while when you play as the janitor you're also armed with a swatter.\n\nEvery episode (5 of them total) ends with a fly chasing sequence where you'll be chasing a fly while flying through a 3D cannyon, swatting at it until it feints.\n\nYou can upgrade your zapper and swatter, and this being a casual platformer you'll have them both maxed somewhere in the middle of the game even if you don't try to collect every egg.\n\nControls are quite OK. Sometimes I jumped off a platform instead of up and such, but there's plenty of checkpoints and the game is very forgiving. You shouldn't achieve frustration even if you're normally not good at platformers. (Judging by myself).\n\nGraphics are nice, character models in cutscenes are excellent and cute. What little story there is is similar to kids' cartoons - nothing special, but you'll occasionally chuckle and the whole thing is cute.\n\nI didn't really have any big problems with this game, two things I noticed are that the boosts during fly chasing sequences don't really do much as the fly accelerates as well, dragging those scenes out, and sometimes the sparks/stars that fly out of stuff when you hit it with a swatter seemed to appear in wrong place on the screen.\n\nSloth Academy's verdict: 1 golden sloth","December 29, 2015","true","3.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

There's also a lot of whimsical humor and charm. It's obvious some talented artists came together for this.","December 11, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
