Escpecially as it's only 392mb. Planes look nice and you can fly with a mouse.\nIn easy/arcade mode; it's an easy campaign of maybe 4 hours. I flew into the ground a few times but\ndidn't get shot down. On normal/arcade mode;  enemy planes take a lot more damage and seem to be\nsuicidal as they willl ram you and they seem to be better shots. Not quite as easy. And there's still flight mode which is harder than arcade.\nDefinitely worth $5.. I think I got it < $5 in the Holiday sale.\nIt would most likely be a lot easier to fly the planes with a joystick. You fly a Hurricane then a Spitfire.\nA twin engine heavy fighter called a Whirlwind a few times and an prototype fighter\ncalled a a Tornado. I don't think they were all that common(?); perhaps late in the war they would\nhave been available.","January 13, 2014","true","1.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Because aiming and hitboxes are inconsistent trying to use rockets is a complete waste, so you just use machine guns every level. The turret levels are the worst I've every played, because you can be shot from guys that are too far away to hit or are over your head and you cant look up high enough to see them, which seems like a huge design flaw and ruins many levels. On these levels the hitboxes and aiming are the worst. Sometimes you need to be directly on a plane to hit them, sometimes you need to be way over their head. You think you get an idea on how aiming works and then you try it again on another plane and none hit. On some planes I moved the aimer on top, slighty in front, way in front, and all around them, and none of the positions registered hitting, which showed lack of polish. No wonder this was a budget title.","November 19, 2014","false","3.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

There are 23 missions to be played they all felt the same, you go and kill the enemy in the sky over and over again. The graphics got fun to watch when the sky is filled with enemy planes and you get to shoot each one down. It feels like alot of the time that you are the only one shooting all the enemies down even though you are in a squadron of planes. The voice acting was funny in the beginning of the game but after hearing the same thing multiple times it gets old. This game took me around 1-2 hours to beat. If you play it, play it in sections instead of just straight through in one sitting. The controls in the game can be a challenge in the beginning to understand but ounce you get them down then its a really easy game. The game was good but not great. Its repetitive, if you like to kill planes and not have a challenge to it then this is the game for you to burn your time with.","November 13, 2011","true","2.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

And it doesn't even sound like a WWII-era radio, it sounds much more modern.\n\nIt also doesn't seem to work with a flight stick very well. I use a Saitek CyborgX stick, and while the throttle seems to work fine, control surfaces don't seem responsive, I ended up running out of ground and exploding on the runway.\n\nIt's okay as an arcade flying game, much like the Blazing Angels series of games, but what I seek in games like these, which are historic titles, is historical realism.\n\nIf you want a good flying game that has great flight dynamics, go take a look at Il-2 Sturmovik:  1946. All I can say that's convenient about this game is that it offers a low-requirement gameplay experience for people with low-end computers like myself, but that's about it.","December 31, 2013","false","3.2"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Those actually aren't the main reasons I uninstalled this, just the most heavily glaring problems. I actually gave this game a try. The game textures look like vomit and it is just not fun having to circle around and do several passes to kill targets if you miss.

This type of game has been done many times before and often done much better. I used an analog game pad to play all of the flight levels and it worked relatively well but I found it impossible to use in the few gunner levels.\n\nThe gameplay is completely arcade and not at all simulation, so if you want a sim, this is not it. It's mostly enjoyable and not very difficult, it's just not that fulfilling overall. At no time would I have considered the game to be immersive and I was constantly reminded of the game: Secret Weapons Over Normandy, that I have played and I wanted for it instead, since it does everything here better.\n\nThe voice acting for the player character is atrocious but is thankfully not present too often. The other characters constantly chatter the same repeated lines ad nauseam, so it gets old fast. Also, adjusting the resolution can only offer a stretched display on a widescreen monitor, so that was a bit annoying.\n\nI never played multi-player, so I have no opinion of its quality. Overall, the game was mildly enjoyable and I felt to get my money's worth sice I purchased it during a sale. I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a simple arcade WW2 dogfight game for a short, simple time of mediocre fun, preferably if it's on sale.","February 28, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is something very satisfying about taking down multiple enemy fighters within minutes.

I bought it not really expecting it to deliver a high level of enjoyment, but I have been pleasantly surprised. The medals give incentive, as do the promotions through the ranks. You mostly fly planes, but every now and again there is a stint of turret gun and artillery firing thrown in. I am having fun! I'm glad I bought the game.","December 31, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm very disapointed in this game.\nThe fights are dull and boring. Missions are repeating. 3 different enemy plains,with 3 different boats/ground targets.Controls are easy (W,A,S,D, Q,H and l/r mouse button) thats it.\nLimited plains, limited weapons, multyplayer base dont exist, Enemys are way too easy to shoot down. I died 2 time by hitting the ground and thats it. 5 missions in 50minutes is far less that you would expect from 5$ game.  Your off better buying IL-2 Sturmovik to play than this.","June 4, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get to fly four separate aircraft through the course of the game, each with it's own pros and cons- I found myself pursuing different tactics depending on the aircraft I was flying. The game really gives a sense of flying and can present a challenge on higher difficulty levels.\n\nSome cons:\n- Gameplay ends up being somewhat repetative.\n- Soundtrack is dull (and it's the same thing on loop for every mission)\n- The physics are unrealistic. The planes don't stall, I've gotten into mid air collisions and somehow still managed to keep on flying with only minor damage.\n- No artificial horizon, which sounds like a small thing, but having one would really help the player orient him/herself.\n\nI got this game on sale for absolute peanuts, so I can hardly complain about the faults. If you enjoy flying, you'll most likely enjoy this game.\n","May 3","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It mostly worked fine, except the control for right and left moved the camera in that direction and the plane go to the opposite end of the screen.  the bad rudder control made turning harder, and occasionally just threw me off to the right.  i dont need incredibly accurate flying, but that was way too arcady and i gave up after the training mission.","May 22","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
