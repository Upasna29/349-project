You play for the feel of it, the atmosphere, the music, some quirk that intrigues you; but you can't exactly call it -fun-.\n\nI took a chance on this one because the premise sounded different and interesting, and I'll admit it delivered on that, but I somehow still feel disappointed. When I look at this game again without my original expectations it's still a quirky piece that feels more like a book rather than a game. The only reason it's a game at all really is to explore the different ways people deal with grief. And maybe that was the whole point to begin with.\n\nBasically you're playing as a girl that's not only dealing with the death of her father, but the loss of herself in an incredibly tiny little town. In many ways your story is already written for you before you start playing; the people in town already have a set idea of who you are, something your character isn't really comfortable with. Fights aren't really fights so much as emotional puzzles; you're not actually playing to win just playing to survive. There's this feeling of inevitability and hopelessness that colors the entire game; making it feel more like a study in depression and mental health issues rather than a game. The actual game mechanics themselves are painful in a lot of aspects. The font is tiny, the movement awkward, the system unintuitive, and the gameplay itself is rather dull and boring.\n\nHowever; the story is a beautiful and dark one. You genuinely feel lost yourself, combating these ghosts of your own making and fighting against the perceptions of your fellow villagers. The dialogue is moving and intense, and some of the puzzles are complex and took me more than just a couple of tries. It is definitely a unique experience.\n\nIn spite of everything I found myself picking this up time and again just to hear the next bit. Like a book so painful and so raw you can only read a few chapters at a time, and although you can't say it's a joy to do so there's this draw to it because it speaks to you somehow.\n\nI suppose in short if you're looking for a game to play Winter Voices probably isn't for you.\nIf you're looking for an interactive view into falling down the rabbit hole of depression and feeling uncomfortable the entire time, then yea pick this one up.\n\nI debated for a long time whether or not I could honestly recommend this, but in the end it does deliver what it promises; an experience unlike any other. Just leave your expectations at the door, and if you do plan on getting this make sure you do it when there's a sale and it's nice and cheap so you don't feel like you lost out if it ends up not being your cup of tea.\n\nRating this as a 'game': 2/10\nRating this as a different experience: 8/10","October 31, 2014","true","49.5"," 67 of 68 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","67","68","0","0"

This is not my type of game. I played it for about 2 hours before I gave up.\n\nIt's a game similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, with more narrative and less combat. The setting is interesting, and the way the delivery is handled is very good.\n\nThe artwork is decent. The writing is amazing. But the game is slow-paced and there's a lot of minor things that doesn't grab me. I definitely recommend the game to someone who enjoys adventure games with light combat. If you're into visual novels - a game where the story is 90% of the game, then this is for you.\n\nFor me, this is like giving a sports game to a nerd. I don't know how to appreciate it.","December 14, 2013","true","2.8"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","52","59","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/recommended/72900/","derungrund","Der Ungrund","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/","387 products in account","Truly unique turn-based RPG that doesn't quite reach the potential brilliance of its central conceit, but has enough that's great about it to be worth playing.  You are a girl in a fantasy kingdom trying to piece together your history while overcoming the trauma of your father's death.  All of the upgrades and skills are associated with different psychological ways of dealing with grief and all battles are psychic manifestations of said grief.\n\nThat's the brilliant part.  Unfortunately, the writing doesn't always match the game's central, great idea.  It can be vague, meandering, and unbearably pretentious in a super self serious freshman creative writing sort of way, especially at the start, but the plot does pick up significantly around episode 3 (and there's even humor at times, or attempts at it, anyway).  I suspect that the game suffers from a rather poor English localization, which might make the writing seem more stilted and awkward than it is in French (it tends toward the poetic at times, and poetry, like humor, is notoriously difficult to translate, so if you speak French it's probably best to play it in its native tongue).  Once you get acclimated to the stilted language and glacial pacing, however, the story itself is quite interesting in its own small scale and internal way.  This isn't an epic quest about a chosen one trying to save the world.  Just a girl trying to learn about her family while fighting for her own sanity.\n\nThe battles themselves are fairly well done.  They tend to be rather puzzle like, in that you often have to think about how to use specific skills to accomplish specific goals, rather than just being about pure combat.   Likewise, while they start out fairly simple in the first couple episodes, they can get fiendishly difficult as the game progresses.  This is one game where I highly, highly, recommend hording skill points from level to level and only spending them as you come up against battles that you find unbeatable.  Because the game's skill and stat system is so unique, it will take a bit of trial and error for even experienced RPG players to figure out how things work.  Especially when playing a Max memory Volva character (this game's equivalent of "hard"), just picking a skill tree and investing in it could very well leave you unable to beat the game at some point.\n\nThe game did suffer from some huge bugs on release, hence the terrible metacritic reviews, but most of those have been squashed and the developer is very active on the forums to this day and responsive to issues (I found a fix to one bug myself and the dev sent it out as a patch within 24 hours, which was kind of cool).\n\nOverall, this is a unique, challenging, turn based RPG that deserves to overcome its terrible launch and become a cult classic.","June 12, 2015","true","20.0"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","0"

It's a deeply psychological game, built around a core of the sense of loneliness and isolation, even from those who should be friends or even family.Winter Voices is also buggy especially because of Adobe AIR and some levels can seriously take minutes to even start the mission just because the engine is so inefficient, it can't even load the map. The game has an unforgiving side, as well. Skills bought on the skill tree are permanent, and the game likes to spring surprises on you where suddenly, some skills are disabled, and a build that was powerful before suddenly fails.The strong points of this game are story and gameplay. The story is amazing. The protagonist is one of the most relatable characters in recent memory and the dialogue is very well written.The gameplay is very original, I can honestly say I've never played an RPG quite like this. Pretty much every aspect, from the battles to the stats and abilities are a means to drive the story forward. This is definitely not a game for everyone. However I would strongly suggest it to RPG fans and people looking for something new and unique.

This isn't even remotely funny-bad, as Bulwer-Lytton contest entries, but simply painful-bad, the hail-like slew of obstreperous adjectives hurtling down in contradictory fashion, each a shard of ice with its own unique, cutting edges inflicting a slightly different shape of wound on my suffering literary sensibility, to combine to envelop me in a veil of unseeing mist, muffling prosaic taste with a bitter aftertaste of a poison blade.

I thought I should buy the episodes, but decided to try the prologue before investing any cash into the episodes.\n\nI'm thankful I did.  The game and story seem very interesting. The world that the developers created IS great looking, and I do want to see more of it, but I've given up having any fun playing this game.\n\nThe game kinda makes me feel like it's ME who's being tortured in "playing" the game rather then the main character.  Most of my complaints seem to echo others who would not recommend this game (and even some that do).  Moving around is too slow, the puzzles/combat seems to vary from easy to "this is making me hate my life", I also seem to think that perhaps the learning curve is at least a little bit steep,  I don't seem to understand effectively what attracts/detracts/masks you from the enemy memories (something I didn't realize was happening until I got tired of the game) or how that fits into the universe (how does one hide behind a rock from a bad memory?).\n\nAnother thing that also puts me way off with this game is the lack of ability to do any kind of actual fighting.  I'm all for the game not being violent, but I finally stopped playing when I felt hopeless that all I can do is push these "memories" around, and reduce their damage, while they slowly hunt me down, pushing me, reducing my movement, surrounding me, and finally killing me.  If I could lock some of the enemies down by trapping them somehow, or maybe push them so far they stop being a threat. I do wonder if some of those things are options that I just don't understand.\n\nI feel like I've given the developers a few hours of my life, and despite their valiant attempts, all they accomplished is having tortured me.\n\nHaving said all that, it might just be something I'm missing, or just not my cup of tea.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaybreakToke/recommended/72900/","DaybreakToke","Daybreak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaybreakToke/","153 products in account","Winter Voices is an indie text heavy RPG a bit akin to Planescape: Torment, but also very different. Its strongest point is its fairly linear psychological and existential story centred on some of the darker aspects of us humans, but ultimately it's an experience of struggle, development, hope and growth; made with psychological insight. Next its "combat" encounters and its weakest the free roam hub-sections like the starting village. The game has a lovely artistic vision and ambience created by its hand-in-hand art direction, soundscape and writing. Which all have a wonderful poetic feel and are tied into the "combat system" beautifully. Plus if you are fond of metaphorical writing in works like "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Nietzsche, then you're bound to find the dream sequences interesting, as they employ metaphors to great effect. That said the English translation can be a bit iffy, so play it in its native French if you can.\n\nThe game is set in a fictional universe at the start of an industrial revolution in a Western country. The plot unfolds in a little remote, primitive and snowy mountain village, which lives by and practices a variant of Old Norse religion, whether the game is set in a Fantasy setting, or employs Magical Realism is up to interpretation, though it isn't at the core of the narrative outside of the dreams. You play a young and fragile twenty-four year old woman whose father has just died, it fairly quickly becomes apparent that you, the protagonist, have an abnormally hard time dealing with this death (wink wink), which propels you onwards on a journey of self-discovery within your dreams and the real world.\n\nRPG mechanics\n\nThere are three classes to pick from Huntress, Weaver and Völva (a shamanic seeress). All of which favours one the six stats (Humour, Willpower, Memory, Perspicacity, Charisma and Intuition). These stats represents your strengths and weakness in your psychological profile. You get, primarily,  XP points to level them up from completing quest, "combat" and speaking with people. Separate from this you also gets Skill Points  as you level up. You can use them in a giant 2D-snowflake-formed Skill Tree with a total of 90ish skills to choose from enveloped by twelve different main paths (Negation, Metamorph , Pride, Social, Support, Composition, Ex-nihilo, Acceptance, Resilience, Resistance, Protection and Dispersion. ) to pursue, as you start out in the centre of it. You won't be able to learn all the skills in one play-through. Each of the twelve paths represents different ways, more or less gamey centred, human beings can deal, reflective or not, with grief and loss, whereas the "sub skills" are mixed between human traits such as creativity, perfectionism etc., and more culture specific things on the other hand such as: Song: Voluspa and Void Walker.\n\n"Combat" encounters. The combat encounters take place in the dreams of our protagonist. Troubled dreams that portrays her struggles to come to terms with her father's death and her past. They are turn-based puzzle-like encounters on a grid that represents her fight with her inner demons.  Overall I found the combat encounters interesting and varied enough in their different puzzles in my play-through as a Völva. Though an occasional freezing bug of the entire game was annoying in some of the longer key encounters, especially as you couldn't save in between them.\n\nIn fact it made me put the game aside for around a year before returning to it once again. Though I am glad I did, as I really, really loved certain parts of the narrative :D","January 16","true","51.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The English translation unfortunately suffers from many "bugs" (translations that don't flow well and don't always make sense). The voice narration also doesn't quite correspond to the written text (the voicing dialogue is better), which was enough to bug me by itself; I wish there was a way to hide the text completely in some instances.\n\nI'd seen on the developers' website that they planned/plan to provide a fully bugfixed version... I don't know if that's still happening given the state of their team, but I recommend waiting until that happens, or at least that you be prepared to save your game every 5 possible minutes in case the interface stops responding in any useful way (or you get stuck in a dialogue after the interface has already disappeared.) It feels as though devs skimped on having too many state checks to allow/disallow clicking, and the way I naturally interact with the interface just interrupts the game and forces me to reload too often.\n\nBeware, this also happens in places where narration immediately precedes a fight, removing any option to save. If the interface bugs out during those, you'll spend long minutes getting back to where you were if you die / try again. This is made worse in spots where 3, 4 battles are chained. There's no relief for me as this happened in every episode.\n\nPathfinding also has issues where your teammates block the way out of a screen, and there's no way to control them or get them out of the way (you have to reload a previous save).\n\nDon't look for many keyboard shortcuts, this is a 97% mouse-driven experience, although it feels like the keyboard was forgotten rather than purposefully omitted.\n\nAnd finally, don't expect to have story options that lead you out of the main character's comfort zone, unlike many modern RPGs the point is not to cater to the player's tastes and provide many options, but really to tell a specific story.\n\nI have lots of spare time and am curious enough to play through the entire thing (on ep. 5 now), as I found the story captivating enough for that even despite the issues, but technical issues really are that frustrating throughout.

It's a puzzle-strategy game where you must build your character around psychological defense mechanisms that will allow you to outwit the demons in your character's own mind.

Sometimes you find yourself surrounded by enemies, the text hints some a mechanism is being introduced and then you have to figure out what it is.\nIt would be fine but combine it with slow pace (mostly thanks to slow movement of everything on screen) and the will to experiment leaves you.\n\nIt brings me to another flaw in the game and that is general slowness.

I bought it on sale for less than $5.\n\nI enjoyed the game's interesting story and its creative interpretation of RPG elements such as character classes, character stats, skills, and battle system. The universe of Winter Voices held my attention. Hintings toward magical or spiritual themes made me curious for a greater understanding of this world, but interest alone does not make a game.\n\nI see this game as appealing only to a small, niche audience. I wouldn't recommend it because it needs more polishing. Striving to complete the game felt aggravating, even torturous, at times. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1) Text-driven game with heavy reading. This game is not for those who cringe upon seeing walls of text.\n\n2) Battle system is more puzzle-strategy than tactical turn-based strategy. You don't actually kill enemies, but employ defensive strategies of spatial rearrangement or using decoys. Common goals per battle include surviving, protecting, or reaching a checkpoint. Different maps, enemies, and goals were enough to keep it fresh. Some puzzles were easy; others made me want to throw my laptop out the window.\n\n3) Limited skill points. The snowflake-shaped skill tree is really cool (ba-dum tss), but you only gain one skill point per character level-up. I ended the game at level 7 with 6 skill points alotted. You're meant to develop the skill tree over the course of the series, but completing some challenging battles in the Prologue would have been impossible had I not manually reset my skill points repeatedly.\n\n4) Story is far too "artsy." It tried too hard to be deep. This is mostly due to the writing style, which is very flowery and comes off a bit pretentious. I'm all for complexity and poignant commentary on the hardships of life, but many metaphorical comments were lost on me because of the writing style. Sometimes I didn't know what was going on in the main character's real life. Most importantly, her father seemed cold an unaffectionate, so why would she care so much about him? I couldn't understand the premise of the whole plot. These factors undermined my motivation to complete the game.\n\n4a) As for the main character's inner demons, the writing goes overboard trying to be mysterious and grotesque. Still, it's interesting to read and makes you wonder about the main character's mental state and a possible incorporation of some kind of spirit world. But it needs less surrealist sequences and more relevant discoveries to the main character's life, or it starts to lose relatability to the player. Enemy memories are never revealed as specific memories relevant to her life, so we still don't know any more about the relationship between the main character and her father by the end of the prologue.\n\n5) Slow paced. The pacing of the game is slow in general, so you must have a lot of patience to play. This is largely due to emphasis on reading and point-and-click mechanism. Your character has a very slow walking animation. Because clicks don't redirect, one misclick means you have to watch your character saunter to that point before you can backtrack. Sometimes clicking on the edge of the screen to go to the next area of the map was unresponsive.\n\n6) Art is beautiful, yet the portraits of people are...kinda ugly. They are reminiscent of badly drawn anime. It's just not the style I was expecting from their concept art.\n\n7) Music. No complaints on the music; it greatly amplified the mystic and somber atmosphere.","January 3, 2014","false","16.5"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","26","42","0","0"

The skill snowflake is wonderful, and the story, though confusing due to the developers' native language clearly not being English and some heavy purple prose, lends itself to wonderful atmosphere and genuine intrigue. The baffling decision to design the game around Adobe Air harms it a great deal, as it makes the already-questionable gameplay near-intolerable. The game feels like the worst, grindiest parts of any Spiderweb RPG as written by Björk. Still, I didn't regret my decision to play it in the slightest, and I ended up buying every episode. It is something I feel I will come back to a lot in the future. Ultimately, I do recommend you play it, because I've never had an experience like it before or since.

While it has a unique style and gameplay, it's unplayable. The pace of the game is horribly slow, it tries the patience. Your character walks slowly, it is extremely loaded in text and every action you take is slow. That aside, the game runs slowly too. It has trouble keeping up with each spell you cast, areas take a long time to load, etc. If the previous two points weren't enough, the frequent glitches in the game had me reloading constantly, making any sort of progress painstakingly difficult.\n\nThe difficulty is also very problematic. While most encounters are very simple to get through and will allow for many different approaches and a variety of skill set, some are near impossible. I can count half a dozen encounters that I had to either retry 30 to 40 times, give up or win through sheer luck. I had to give up at a certain point in the epilogue after my 20th attempt at a 5-part encounter that you have to retry from the beginning every time you fail.\n\nSimply interacting with the environment is annoying. The only way you can interact with the environment is by walking to certain areas. This poses many problems: it takes ages to reach any point, the areas you need to walk to are not indicated, NPCs can get in the way (especially your companion), certain interactions block others, etc. The fixed camera means that half of the map at any given time is not visible, which means getting around and aiming at enemies is very difficult­. It's also often unclear on what tile an enemy is standing, it takes a lot of getting used to and even then, you still make a mistake every now and then.\n\n\nI could probably criticize this game further but I'm sure my point is clear by now. All in all, what could've been a great experience was ruined by the poor construction of the game. I got this game for a few dollars during a sale and regret purchasing it and spending as much time as I did on it. It is most definitely not worth the full price.","May 8","false","40.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has a standard tactial RPG setup, with a turn-based "battle" system, attribute points, and a skill tree.  You'll notice that I had to put quotation marks around battle.  To be blunt, you aren't usually battling things.  Most encounters involve running away from or avoiding enemies.  And crying, I can't forget to mention how much crying and sobbing there is.  It is peculiar mostly in this regard: you don't fight things, even though you are in a gaming framework where you'd expect to be able to fight things.\n\nEarly on, probably even for the entirety of the first act, these battles are fairly unsatisfying.  For me, it wasn't until the second and third act that I started enjoying the game.  You start off with maybe three or four tools to use in battle, but slowly as you develop your skill tree you gain access to more and more possibilities.  This is where I think Winter Voices shines.  How you envision your character and which skills you use truly change your gameplay style.  Is your heroine the sort of person to run away from her problems?  Is she more likely to just ignore them?  Does she invent stories to help her forget? Does she rely on friends instead?  I feel like these choices make a bigger impact than "Do I want a giant flame hammer or a shiny ice dagger?" type of choices you might find in other tactical RPGs.\n\nThe game has many flaws:  the plot is murky at best, the writing is over the top (I wish I could think up enough ridiculously highfalutin words off the top of my head to convey this, but I cannot),  and the battles can be infuriatingly boring.  I still give it a positive review because, in the end, I enjoyed it.

When it comes to the good, the game used to be buggy as hell from what I hear, but it’s fairly stable now. The idea that you run away from enemies is a neat one, but it’s way too easy to utterly gimp yourself build-wise and the later game encounters are horribly designed to point that it can make the game unwinnable, even if you’ve been using a really good build up till that point. The atmosphere is really good and the soundtrack complements it well; there's a real bleak and lonely tone that permeates the game. It also has an interesting world inspired by Norse mythology that maintains ambiguity whether or not there is anything supernatural going on. The writing when it comes to characters is alright too, it’s just the narration and the dream world that are bad. Though it also really does fall into some bad clichés (Let’s have our female protagonist get almost r*ped twice guys!) . Overall there is some quality stuff here that I liked that kept me playing until towards the end of  Episode 4 but the negatives eventually dragged the game down.

The "combat" is really more like a series of puzzles framed as dealing with opponents which, in theory, can be quite fun and interesting. The pace ruins it, making each combat an exercise in trial-and-error and hoping that the AI doesn't just decide to finish you off.\n\nThe story is rather fascinating and an interesting take on the heroine's journey, or growing up, and one could argue the game's design is meant to give the player the feel of the despair and depression the character is feeling.

The writing is deeply irritating and pretentious nonsense, which is fine. I'd be happy to suffer through a little irritation if the "game" parts of Winter Voices weren't just as deeply irritating. Simply put, the "combat" is terrible.\n\nFirstly, it would be inaccurate to call this combat. It technically is a tactical RPG combat system, but what you're doing isn't fighting so much as avoiding damage for an arbitrary number of turns (one of the popular "win" conditions is Last 10 Turns) or reaching a certain tile on the tactical grid. When I read about it, it impressed me as a novel way of representing the game's protagonist dealing with nightmares and emotions and such, and it is, but the implementation is clunky and amateurish in the extreme.\n\nThe art's very attractive, the setting is intriguing, the UI is effective (as you can tell from the screenshots) and while I personally find the faux-Proustian pretentiousness of the writing insufferable, it's entirely possible that it gets less so in the later episodes, but the combat system drags it all down into the mud of disappointment and unplayability. I feel like this would've worked better as a more traditional story-driven adventure or even visual novel-type experience than trying to cram it into tactical RPG shoes.","August 11, 2015","false","6.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

The artwork is amazing as well. The strategy involved in the battles is alright until you find an unwinnable scenario (yay, traumas blocking the path with a wall behind them so you can't push them or draw them out, and no, you can't attack them either).\n\nBut the story was written by someone who threw as many words in as possible to make it seem like they are poetic - they're not. It could have been a great story, if they had spent their words more wisely. I love reading, I love poetry, I hate the story in this game. The whole time I was playing I was distracted by wondering what kind of person wrote the story, rather than enjoying the game. They butchered the English language while probably thinking they were saying something amazing, deep and insightful.\n\nIn a game like Winter Voices, the story is everything.

What it lacks in loot and action it more than makes up for in atmosphere and immersive narrative.  Combined with a pleasing artistic style and music, this is a great game.\n\nUnfortunately, it does have it's downfalls but they are all technical.  For starters, it's built on Adobe AIR.  That should be enough to make you think twice about purchasing.  Once inside the game, you'll likely encounter abrupt stops to pathfinding, map changes not triggering, walking through doors and some combat bugs that force you to reload the game.  So far these have been nothing more than an inconvenience to me though.\n\nIn summary, it's almost like this game was conceived and scripted by the best poets and artists of the ages but programmed by a monkey on a typewriter (or maybe poets and artists).  Bottom line: If you like story and can deal with technical annoyances, you will absolutely enjoy this game.","March 25, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One stage in particular repeatedly put me in a position where it was impossible for me to win, and impossible for me to kill myself so I could try again, forcing me to reload my save.

The developer of this game and I have talked in depth. During that time, with regard to the r.ape apologizing his game has done, he not only doubled down on it, expressing the belief that as unfortunate as it is, women can do certain things to help prevent them from being r.aped, (though he maintains that the r.ape apologists in the game are that way because of the time period and their own flaws,) but also stated that he understands this r.apist he wrote into the game and excuses away his act by saying he is a simple man and desired the protagonist heavily! I discourage anyone from buying or playing this game. You can read the progression of my comments below with some spoilers.\n\nOkay, I don't think I can really overstate this, but this game needs a big "trigger warning!" sign attached to it. I was really enjoying the game until episode 4. I knew full well that there had to be ♥♥♥♥ involved somewhere, but I didn't expect the mental scarring that episode 4 has presented me with in all its craziness.\n\nSee the bottom for why I changed my mind on recommending this game. Also, the blocked word is r.a.p.e I'm not using it incorrectly or in obscene sense, the game focuses around it, so hopefully I won't get in trouble.\n\nSome of this might destroy the plot for you (kind of) so if you want to buy this game, skip this paragraph. The short is, there is a freakish amount of attempted ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥. ---- This game's plot is mostly done through written text. It's very metaphorical and verbose, and really has some great writing. Sooo, episode 4, you are on a ship. First off, you get a guy that hits on you even when you make it clear you are not interested in him, then you get a drunk who makes sexual advances at you early on. No I'm not complaining about either of those. In the span of a few fights and the events in between, (fights are usually just expressions of dreams or emotional anguish, all these fights are while you sleep, you get story info from them and other story stuff happens when you are awake,) my character had these two characters attempt to ♥♥♥♥ her in a rather graphic sequence of events with your character just eerily standing next to them on screen and the description in text. But if that doesn't screw with your head, your character is slowly realizing she was ♥♥♥♥♥ at an earlier time, (before the game starts,) and suppressed the memory. And while the details are, as I said, very metaphorical, they are also extremely graphic. Seriously, I'm at the end fight of ep 4 and I have been emotionally torn down all day and don't really want to play the game, though only in a small part because I am stuck on this episode's final fight and may need to replay the episode entirely. And to screw with you further, you have a couple of ♥♥♥♥ apologists, including an old man you divulge your secrets to (whether you want to or not.) He actually says you "provoke men." Another guy says you are kind of asking for it, but he is clearly meant to be a jerk, and you can insult him at length even before that.\n\nSo on to the problems with gameplay. There aren't a lot of them, but you can't respec skills or stats. One of your stats is memory, which decides how hard the game is for you. If you muck this up, you won't know until a big mandatory fight. I have a very low 45 memory, and I am getting trashed in this ep 4 fight. It is mandatory, and I've defeated all the level 4 fights before this but one ridiculously hard one. Nothing has been even remotely this hard before, so I would periodically raise memory to increase the challenge. With another character, I have the max possible memory, and can not get past the prologue.\n\nThat said, I don't know whether to recommend this game or not, due to my complaints, but also because the writing is so awesome and the concept is so refreshing (except the ♥♥♥♥, seriously, do game developers have no other ways to bring depth to female characters besides victimizing them?) So I am going to not recommend this game, just because this entire post has been complaints anyway.\n\nEdit: Okay, I've thought about this. I still am not comfortable at all with the r.a.p,e apologist (seriously? blocking the word ♥♥♥♥? how the heck am I supposed to explain the issues I have with a game centering around that?! Hopefully spelling it out once so everyone knows what I'm actually talking about will help.) I do like that game, though I think a strong message needs to be sent to the designers about including that kind of thing.\n\nHonestly, I'd like to see a sequel though, and they haven't made the kind of money for that. This is a pretty good RPG/puzzle game, and the thinking required for some of the harder fights is pretty heavy. Especially with how many different skills there are. I cheated for the last fight of episode 4, and may cheat for the chessboard fight for episode 6. There are guides to cheating, but trying to screw with your level works poorly, though you can respec your stats that way if you don't like them (lowering your memory can drop your level though.) I just gave myself a bunch of pending skill points and bought tons of skills so I had a better selection of what I could pull out of my hat while fighting.","February 2, 2014","false","45.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

Seriously. You will think it's good because it's cheap and it's pretty and because fighting inner demons with the power of imaginary friends and a mahusive ego sounds like a good idea. It's not.\n\nProblem 1: Text. Walls and walls of pointless text. NPCs will tell you about your own character in a way that clashes horrendously with the character you have been creating. The narrator will describe beautiful landscapes to you for 5 - 10 minutes at a time, while you're looking at a beautiful, handpainted picture of said landscape. Some battles require you to follow instructions that are unclear, incomplete (but incredibly purple!) and not logged anywhere.\n\nProblem 2: Animation. Too long. No sprint option. Poorly designed map. Repetitive locations. Overly long fade-ins and fade-outs. JUST LET ME PLAY ALREADY.\n\nProblem 3: Sound. While the music fits this game perfectly, the narrator was driving me insane. His performance, like everything else in the game, was far to slow. And having a male narrator read out poorly written text that can't decide whether it's talking TO and AS the female protagonist was just plain confusing. And there no sound effects. Not for walking, not for different environments, not even for the HUD. Which brings me to...\n\nProblem 4: Bugs. The game will freeze regularly. Often during round 50 of a battle during which the save feature is disabled. Sometimes just before or after screen transistions or cutscenes. And in a game this slow, you can never tell when the game actually froze and when it's just being leg-chewingly slow.\n\nProblem 5: The writing. Oh my god, the writing. The writers seem to operate on Tell, Don't Show, Then Tell Again. And Again For Emphasis. And Again Because Otherwise The Game Would Be Over In Half The Time. There is zero character consistence. Dialogue options are extremely restrictive. When you get a rare moment of narrative freedom the game pretends you followed whatever option the writers liked best. The 'humorous' dialogue options come across as psychotic. Every single female NPC can be insulted - allegedly they talk too much. The 'shut up' option for male NPCs that were too creepy was missing entirely. The writers are so full of themselves that they give you this disapproving 'Are you sure you want to skip the intro?' message every single time you start up the game.\n\nProblem 6: Winter Voices: What Do The Devs Want Me To Do? This applies to every single aspect of the game. Trying to navigate from one area of your village to an adjacent one? Too bad, you need to go via the marketplace. Trying to navigate from one area of a different village with the same layout to an adjacent one? Yep, no problem, just head over there. Don't feel like solving riddles? Have fun with those unskippable battles that require ridiculously specific solutions. Looking forward to fleshing out your character via dialogue options? Any choice other than 'sniffling shy mentally 4 year old' is ignored or patronised by the game.\n\nProblem 7 (SPOILER Ep 3): The sexual assault scene on the boat. Out of character for everyone and the godawful writing made me hate my companion ('I will beat up this person you've enjoyed flirting with for the past few days, but will stare blankly into nothingness after the resident drunk assaulted you twice.'). Of course the game was written by French males, so it has to have at least one sexual assault on a woman.\n\nProblem 8: I think the crow wants to romance me.","June 24, 2014","false","12.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","1"

While being slow paced isn't exactly a bad thing, Winter Voices can grind to snail pace and is not helped by the painful movement speed and horrid detection of screen transitions. Some combat segments can be dull and while most of them are skip-able, some painful ones are not. There are some bugs, one of the worst being when you intend to talk to someone only to step on the square that activates a screen transition suddenly you find yourself looking a black screen. So yes as a game, it is pretty bad... but it's also one of the most satisfying purchases I've made.\nAfter the introduction of narrated soothing muse and eerily somber music you create and name your female protagonist (side note: if this game's story had either been told from the perspective of a man or had been designed with the intent for both parties being possible protagonists, it would probably have been a lesser game. ), you get placed into a story of loss, self discovery, pain, and growth... if that sounds vague, it's because spoiling it would hurt the experience . but to give the jist, your dad died and you are starting to feel out of place in the village so you decide to leave.\nthe games combat is narrative driven and even the rpg element of learning abilities is structured more like a metaphor for dealing with loss, or your problems in general. It can do this since you are actually fighting the mental hallucinations of you own tormented soul, which sounds awesome; but, it would be a hell of a lot more engaging if it wasn't such a dull and monotonous task.\nWhere this game fails to be a game it works wonders as an interactive story. The writing is beautiful; it matches the sad and sometimes Gothic tone of the story perfectly and is presented in an almost poetic manner. Coby Batty does a great job with as the voice of the father and narrator. In all honesty, if I could give one indie title a Triple A budget, this is the game I would love to see perfected. So I do whole heartedly recommend grabbing this game and pressing through it's dodgy design choices because it is that good of an interactive story. Here is waiting for Season 2.","December 27, 2014","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These and other bugs happened on a nearly minute-by-minute basis.

The graphics are all rendered in a painterly style, and most of the dialogue is cryptic freeform poetry.  Oh, and you can't actually attack your enemies during combat (with few exceptions).  Gameplay is largely defensive.  The object is typically to get from one side of an area to the other, or simply to survive for so many turns.  It's undoubtedly not for everyone, but I'm enjoying it.\n\nI had been holding off on playing this and giving it the thumbs up because it was buggy as all hell on release, but hey, it's patched now!
