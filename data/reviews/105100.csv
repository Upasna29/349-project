If you do find it in a bundle however (like I did) sure, get it.\n\nNow it's time for an explanation. The game is cute and your character actually walks around "real" objects, as in, the scenes were filmed with a real camera and then blended into the game.\n\nIt's a point and click puzzle game and it isn't an easy one either. Which, again, in itself is fine.\n\nThe puzzles are usually either a bit easy to solve or at least to figure out what to do, but there's 1 of them that is really quite horribly difficult to even make sense out of it.\n\nSPOILER about that "tip" for that puzzle, it's a page of a book with the "ONE" in "GRAMAPHONE" underlined, and a #9 on the corner of the page... what this supposedly means is, there's 9 numbers you need (for a locker with 3 digits, therefore 3 sets) and it starts with ONE, then you have to read the text and find either the actuall number like "fig. 2" being the "2" the second number you need, and then "three"... then there's a year, 1887, the "1" is the last number of the second set of numbers and "887" the last one.\nThe problem with this is, the game gives you NO CLUE what this book is related to or even what to look for, your character only says "A book grandpa's been reading, he wrote something on it" and that's it, you really need a guide or an epiphany to figure it out.\n\nLastly, and this is what made me say NO about buying this for 6,99€ is that the game... only lasted me a few minutes, seriously, there are like 5 different screens (not counting small camera transitions) and only a dozen of puzzles or so, it's a cute short "story" but it's not even an apetizer, sure, in the end it says "end of lume part 1", but it's a part where you pay 6,99€ to get.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n- One of the puzzles is nearly impossible to solve on your own, and crucial to finish the game;\n- Even if you get stuck a lot, you can beat the game in only a few minutes, not even 1 hour.\n\n\nWould I recommend playing this game? Sure, it is a bit fun at most and challenging, you will probably need a guide for 1 or 2 puzzles though and it's an interesting new concept.\n\nWould I recommend buying this game? No, unless you're either filthy rich, or get it with a bundle, seriously.\n\n\nIn terms of the overall game and enjoyability I give it a... maybe 8/10 (without my puzzle issue).\nIn terms of the price/quality ratio I give it a 1/10 just because it's visually pleasing and new.\n\nThanks for reading this (if anyone ever does).","January 17, 2014","false","0.8"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","0"

The only hope you have of seeing your grandfather again is to solve these puzzles and get the power working again. Lume is a point and click puzzle game. Each puzzle is masterfully done, adding layer upon layer. Its not just typical puzzles, but these are puzzles are off kilter. A is E, a triangle is 3, north is north east sort of off kilter. There are cryptic clues are everywhere. You'll get an inventory of parts to create a power generator and see your grandfather alive.\n\nThe truth is that you play as a child and your grandfather has gone to go investigate something. So he left clues for you to get his power up and running again. He's the madman. There is no threat, danger or game over. There is a variety of puzzles. Everything from lock combinations, to spinning wired tiles to connect all circuits. The clues for the most part will be in select pages of books and following instructions meant to get you lost with irrelevance. It is all a brain teaser's dream.\n\nThe game itself looks unique, because it looks as if someone made it with construction paper. Then filmed transitions between environments. The real downfall about the art is the resolution is stuck low so its a small screen with a giant dark frame. With such a unique art style, it should be a higher resolution to bask in its glory.  There aren't many environments. Just a three interiors, two closets and an exterior consisting of two screens.\n\nThe controls are simple, just click things. Since it is a Flash game, just hover your mouse over something and the cursor will change to a pointer. Your inventory is easy to get to at the top of the screen instead of completely switching to an inventory.\n\nAt the end of the hour or two game, you find out this is just Episode 1. These were some difficult puzzles, but without the unique art style it would have gotten lost in the shuffle.","November 5, 2014","false","1.6"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","32","47","0","4"

And a game that makes me wish for a ‘neutral’ button…\n\nLong version:Lume is very short puzzle game– filmed entirely in a small paper and cardboard house– about a little girl called Lumi, whose task is to solve the puzzles left by his handyman grandfather.\n\nThis Flash game is so short that feels like as if it should be a free demo on some web site, not something that costs the current price. Especially since it has about half dozen puzzles in total; if they had in-game instructions and if one wouldn’t require a randomly appearing hint, the entire game wouldn’t last twenty minutes.\n\nSure, we are treated with a very creative and fun visual style during that time, but in the end Lume feels like a very pricy demo version of the incredibly superior sequel, Lumino City.","January 4","true","0.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Although, with that said, it's very important to mention that this is almost an introduction/demo into the world and the style of the game. This would definitely not pass as a full length game.\n\nI am yet to play Lumino City, it has great reviews and i'm willing to bet that you skipping "Lume" before going straight to that would be of no loss to you.\nI first played this a while ago and i can say that it was definitely a disappointment as a game at the time. I was very impressed with aspects of the game but it's barely an hours worth of gameplay, it has no real story and as pretty as it is, it isn't worth the price. I would only recommend buying this if you can get it really cheap or even just free.\nThe only reason i have come back to it was to remind me of the world, style and the setting before i started on the sequel. As a stand alone game It's definitely not something i would recommend.\n\nHowever, as a "taster" of sorts for the next game, my short time in this game did definitely manage to grab my interest once i found out a full length game was being released as a sequel.\n\nThe art style of the game is wonderful. A hand-made, miniature model, stop-motion and animation mix of a game. I love the extra care and attention that are put into these sorts of games. It does really manage to make them unique. The game is made to feel very homely and cozy with this kind of technique and creates a warm and relaxing feeling.\n\nThe puzzles were fun and quite interesting. There was one that was kind of hard to find the logic behind without resorting to a guide, but that was the only one I had trouble with. The others were interesting but do-able. I hope to see more puzzles like these in the next one.\n\nAs it goes, i think i will have to down-vote this game on the basis of it being a stand alone game.\n\nBut with that said, i am looking forward to writing a very positive (hopefully) review of it's sequel.\n\nAll in all, It's decent for a demo or taster, but not as a game. Play it if you can get it free or just really cheap. Otherwise, just take a look at the sequel instead.\n\n\nTL;DR : Just buy Lumino City.\n","January 23","false","2.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I really enjoy puzzle games but this one is extremely small.  If I'm not mistaken, this was part 1 and, overall, you can complete it very fast. It has a small amount of puzzles for you to do and I can't say they are very hard; the problem in my opinion, is that I feel the developers didn't provide enough or even helpful clues/info for one to complete the puzzles in a fast and easy way. I had a bit of a struggle with a few just because I couldn't find any logic in them whatsoever (I'm not the only person that feels this).\n\nAs for the aspect of the game alone, it is very simple but it's still 'cute' for a flash game.

Žaidimas yra šviesus ir linksmas. Jis turi neįprastą, bet gražią vizualinę pusę kuri šiam žaidimui suteikia savotiškumo. Jei jums patiko tokie žaidimai, kaip Machinarium ar Botanicula jums be abejonės patiks ir šis žaidimas.\n\nŽaidime atvykstame aplankyti senai matytą senelį, bet mes jo nerandame namuose, o vietoj jo tik raštelį. Perskaitę raštelį sužinome, kad senelis susidūrė su elektros tiekimo problemomis, todėl nutarė pats išsiaiškinti kas nutiko. Ir tuo pačiu paliko mums pūzlęs(jų yra ~7) kurių pagalba, galėsime padėti seneliui. Ir nieko nedelsdami puolame ieškoti užuominų, bei spręsti užduotis!\n\nVis dar galvojate, ką po velnių reiškia mano pasisakymas "Paprastumo grožis" ? Norint suprasti šį teiginį, grįžkime prie vizualinės žaidimo pusės. Žaidimas sukurtas iš popieriaus tikrąją tą žodžio prasme, žaidimo išvaizdos kūrimui buvo panaudotos popierinės konstrukcijos su šiek tiek kompiuterinės grafikos. O aplinkų perėjimai yra tiesiog nufilmuoti su vaizdo kamera, taigi tai yra labai paprasta bet ir tuo pačiu gražu ar ne ?\n\nKad ir kaip būtų viskas gražu ir linksmą, žaidimas turi ir minusų. Tai yra istorijos ilgis, jis siekia vos 1h, tai gi visas žaidimo malonumas ir smagi atmosfera greitai išblėsta. Kaip be būtų, tai nereiškia kad žaidimas yra prastas, jis tikrai malonus ir linksmas, Žinant, kad žaidimo kaina siekia vos 5LT, jo trukmė tampa nebe tokia svarbi. Kurėjų teigimu šis žaidimas yra tik pirmoji dalis didelės istorijos, taigi belieka tikėtis, kad Lume antroji dalis bus ilgesnė :)\n\n7/10 - Nuoroda į apžvalgą : http://www.games4you.lt/lt/naujienos?naujiena=7","January 12, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Though it's only part one, I got it as part of a Humble Bundle along with some other games, and I think it's very charming!\n\nThe game is "filmed" on a beautifully-crafted set made out of cardboard and every detail got so much love put into it! Every piece of the set is hand-crafted (similar to IloMilo's cutscenes if you've played that) The characters Lume and her Grandfather move around on the set, but they don't look out of place.\n\nThe only critiques I could give is that the puzzles are really difficult, and it's really short. Like "I could knock this out in a lunchbreak if I wasn't stuck on this puzzle for twenty minutes" kind of short. However, the puzzles can be solved eventually with a little focus and determination (all the pieces of the puzzles are there, though the key puzzle takes some trial and error), and this is only part one so I am still very much looking forward to more of Lume!","January 5, 2014","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To give a short answer: do I recommend that you purchase it? No - go pick up Lumino City instead. It's the fully fleshed-out version of what the developers were more-or-less experimenting with here. It's absolutely beautiful, and I would recommend it in a heartbeat. For most people, that's probably all you need to know. So go check out Lumino City.\n\nIf you're still reading, here's some slightly more in-depth thoughts. Lume is effectively an early experiment for what would become Lumino City. Here, State of Play got a good sense for how this "animating on top of a paper world" idea could work for a fully-fledged game. That being said, this is not that game. It is very short, there isn't much of a story developed, and some of the puzzles are not presented in a way that gives the player any clues as to how to find the solution. It is very much the little brother of Lumino City. It's clear that the team had dreams of larger environments and a bigger story, and some of the puzzles (the wiring and the music lock) were improved upon and included in the larger game. And of course, they used Lume to experiment with this fantastic art style. Basically, Lume serves as a historical artifact of how Lumino City evolved from an idea into the amazing game it is. So here's my recommendation: Go play Lumino City. If you enjoy it (and I think you will) and are interested in seeing how it came to be, pick up Lume when it's on sale for $1-2. But you have to come at it knowing that this isn't some astounding game, but a stepping stone towards one.","May 15","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I honestly can only think that the developer's face throughout making this game was one of a TROLLOLOLOL. I read through the guide after saying, "nope!!!"\n\nWhat you'll need to complete this game without a guide:\n-Huge amount of time\n-Directional awareness in a circuitry trace diagram\n-Simplicity when it's required\n-Astute observation skill in observing the smallest clue  PLEASE, tell me how someone is supposed to know #9 means 9 numbers instead of being included/excluded in the solving of the puzzle? It is true that the puzzle only requires 9 numbers, but why would you include #9 to further confuse your players? Of course after they tried the 1st set of numbers they would realise something was wrong, but they wouldn't know what went wrong and head directly into a guide\n\n-Knowledge of Roman numerals  I have no idea whether the crosses are religious ones, or X which is another roman numeral, but somehow it's supposed to be 3\n-Knowlegde of geometric shapes  count corners and indents [star is 10]\n-Knowledge of the fact that  6 with a line above * is 9? No idea where that came from\n-Knowledge of musical sheets\n-Knowledge of musical notes\n-Knowledge of mapping  A5, A8, G8, G10, J10, G10, G8, F8 ... can't see the instructions on guide, so I don't know how hard this one is.\n-Rest of game is then exploration and moving back and forth until completion.\n\nWhy?-Short game with normal puzzles.\n-Small area\n-Not worth the money unless it's like 50¢ to $1 even better if it's in a humblebundle with games you actually want.\n-No Clues\n-Too much guide neccessity\n-Sadistic puzzles that either require a huge amount of time to solve[or luck] with nearly no clues, or very subtle ones.\n-No skipping of dialogue\n-You require too much help where none is given, so naturally you look at guides.\n\nOnce finished with that puzzle and resolving to not look at the guide once again assuring yourself that it was merely a hard part...you encounter a second...more sadistic puzzle.\n\nSpoilers:\nThe second puzzle, you'll be hitting yourself on because of how simple it was[Occam's razor], but the way the hint was given is complicated due to how various other things where written near the P.S. of the letter. I did realise that the letter did hold the key to solving opening the door, but was not sure how to translate them into numbers.\n\n#2:  Kicking yourself yet? AGA near the end of the letter is meant to be translated into numbers of the alphabet - 171\n\nThe third puzzle encounter was even more difficult than the second as it was keys with 2 different colors, silver and copper, with varying heights, indents and the fact that they're TOO IDENTICAL TO ONE ANOTHER.\n\n#3  counting from the top middle silver short key, select key #3, #8, #14 ... no idea how anyone figured that out other than trial and error.    14 keys, 3 needed, so 364 Combinations...I dearly hope that someone DID NOT spend that much time solving this puzzle\n\nFinal Thoughts:At this point...I thought, "No, not even worth my time and read through the guide." To which I confirmed my suspicious that the game was sadistically hard and not worth my time, whew.\n\nThis is my honest opinion...I own and play a plethora of puzzlers, HOGs and adventure games where there are varying degrees of difficult puzzles, but none approach the difficulty of this unfriendly and anti-player game where you're required to have fore-knowledge of varying degrees in substantially different fields that do not relate to one another. I consider that a bad game, indeed.\n\nThere is no sense of completion even if you have solved the hard puzzles on your own because of how long it took you to solve it, or you, like me, looked at a guide, which most would consider demoralising.\n\nI feel developers of this game would then laugh at you because you didn't know something so, "simple."\n\n^Read this twice before you think of commenting something idiotic and not worth engaging.","April 12","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Aside from one obscure puzzle it's fairly straightforward, the plot elements are kind of pointless and the game itself incedibly short (as of writing, at least, though there are more episodes promised?). Even then though the only real draw is the art style itself, the game itself is certainly very interesting to look at if nothing else. The one music track that repeats over and over would get more tedious if the game was longer, I suppose, but yeah, only one music track, enjoy. Like I said though, the game itself is fine except for its length, nothing spectacular and it's probably wiser to throw your money at better point and click adventure games either way, but for the price tag, no, don't even think about it.

Lume is very short, especially considering its price. It took me an hour to complete, and that’s including stopping to admire the visuals, and I honestly can’t see it taking much longer than that. You might draw it out to 90 minutes, but that’s about it.\nBut if you look beyond that you’ll find an absolutely charming and adorable game. There, I said it. I’m supposed to be cynical goddamit, but here I am calling a game ‘adorable’. But it is, it absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing is. It’s made out of cardboard for god’s sake. CARDBOARD!\nYes, this game didn’t take very long to win me over. Look at it though, it’s gorgeous. Sure, there isn’t much to see, but what you do see is incredible. I still can’t get over the fact the game’s made out of cardboard. Man, this game made me grin like a ♥♥♥♥ing child, and I hate it for it.\nIt is a puzzle game, though the puzzles are rather generic and simple. Still, some fun brainteasers, but I feel resentful towards them because they aren’t made out of cardboard. In fact there isn’t much that is made of cardboard because the area is very small and can be explored in a few minutes, meaning you backtrack a lot and most of the length is spent solving puzzles.\nThe fact that you don’t get much of the game’s best feature in a very short game is a bit of a problem, so it’s hard to recommend at full price. I got it in a bundle which was perfect, but for a considerable discount I’d say it’s worth experiencing. Then again, I’m all set for getting the sequel Lumino City (get it?), discounted or not, so maybe the price isn’t so bad after all...\nIt’s made of cardboard though, and that’s got to count for something, right?

I bought it ages ago in a Groupees bundle and was intrigued by the unique but fine quality art style.  I'm the type of person who puts off playing games, but I played this one right away.\n\nIt was very short and I didn't feel like the puzzles were very satisfying.  There was one puzzle that I had to look up how to solve, (this seems to be a common issue) but the rest I solved before even getting their clues.  I would find items that were completely useless for me.  I kept expecting to leave the house after fixing it up, but the game just... ended.\n\nRight now as it is I can't recommend it.  I feel like it's definitely unfinished storywise and the difficulty is baffling to me.  If it at least had steam trading cards I could say, "play it if you get it in a bundle" but as it is, I can't even say that.  I'd say just look at the pictures or watch the trailer because you'll get all the charm of the art, but none of the disappointment of the actual game.\n\nNote:  I am NOT one of the people who criticize this game for its length.

There's really only one puzzle that I feel is poorly designed, which requires you to dig through the same handful of books a bunch until you happen upon a specific one with a very vague clue on it, look through the rest of the page, and then visit the Internet and look up the solution.\n\nResults may vary.\n\nI understand Lume as an art piece. And it's a pretty cool one, having used papercraft dioramas to create a point-and-click adventure game. It works better than you might expect. The game doesn't look bad, either, though the characters turned me away before I even started the game. I don't really like their look, but that's not really the problem with this game.\n\nThe issue with Lume is that it's short. Including time spent checking the Internet, Steam tells me that it took 0.8 hours to beat the game. So that's roughly 48 minutes. Now, this game is $7. That's a lot of money for less than an hour of an art piece game. I could understand a dollar or two. I wouldn't be so cruel as to suggest it should be free, I know we all have to make money. But for the content, $7 is steep. It's for that reason alone that I cannot recommend it.\n\nThe ending mentions that it is the end of Lume: Part 1. If Part 2 were released as an update to the original game, then the price would make a lot more sense. After all, episodic games have been known to charge for the entire game, and then release over sometimes very lengthy amounts of time. Though it's been nearly three years since Part 1's release, at the time of this writing. Another quick glance at the Internet tells me that the next part is still in development, but after all of this time and considering the flash format, I strongly doubt that such will be the case.","March 6, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good game, but too short to pay more than a dollar or two.","January 26, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music's not shabby either, and fits the setting. Looking at all these, I was ready to take on this puzzle adventure since I'm a sucker for puzzles. The first puzzle made me think that this might be easier than what I've heard, but the puzzles get harder and harder.\n\nSo here I thought, it's not bad at all! It's easier than I thought, but at least they were interesting puzzles (some required guesswork, like having to take the metal frames of the bicycle after you got the dynamo from it in the game, which I'm not very fond of in puzzles). Then finally I got to the end of what I thought was the first part of the game, which was setting up the turbine. And all of a sudden, BOOM! and I was presented with something reminiscent of a Congratulations-on-clearing-the-game-screen.\n\nDid I just spend a few bucks on a Flash game that takes a little over half an hour to complete? Yes.\nWas the game good? Yes, it's not too bad to be honest.\nDid I enjoy it? Yes.\nWas it worth the price? No. It's definitely beautiful considering it's a Flash game, but I was utterly disappointed with the length of the game. What I thought was probably 5% of the game turned out to be the end. Granted, they seem to be continuing with development so we'll probably get patches that allow us to continue past the completion of the turbine, but there's a limit to what shouldn't be done.\n\nThey should have taken their time to make something which allows at least a good 3.5-hour of playability, and I wouldn't mind spending more then. Not something that costs 6.99 and ends in 40 minutes or so.\n\nI do not recommend getting this game. At least, not right now. Maybe if they release a few more patches.","January 7, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Granted, it was picked up on the cheap, but at this point, even at a discounted price of around $2, I can't find myself recommending it over other adventure/puzzle games on Steam. The visual style is fresh and unique and I like it, but that doesn't offset the short length (only about 30 minutes) and the lack of inspiration/challenge behind the puzzles. You can find longer and better games like this for the same price, and looking into the company, there doesn't appear to be a release date in mind for the sequel. After so many years, that is very disconcerting. Take your money and look elsewhere for a more complete game at a similar price, or put your money on a Humble Bundle.","January 6, 2014","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only gripe so far - I wish there was an option to mute just the background audio music without muting the SFX too.  The BGM is pretty pleasant, until you get stuck on a puzzle for longer than you'd like and you just want some peace n quiet to think think think! (SFX is required to solve certain puzzles, so NO, the existing mute function does not help).  Other than that, it's a pretty enjoyable game, I hope the devs carry on with more parts soon! :D","April 10, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good artistic quality and music.\n\nYou play as Lumi who visits her grandfather's place only to find him missing and the house without power. You then go about clicking various items to find clues and puzzles to advance forward in the quest of restoring powering back to the house.\n\nThere are about 7 puzzles, of varying difficulty, from matching patterns and numbers, a map with a grid, a puzzle board, to one with a musical sequence. I got stumped at the last puzzle and found it too vague, with minimal instructions and clues. Frustrated and without any further hints in game to move forward I resorted to an online guide. The last puzzle I thought could do with more clearer instructions and/or hints and likewise for the plot device of assembling a contraption which required some items that were not clearly stated. Puzzles and exploring things through clicking around were fine, but it got to a stage where it felt like a wild goose chase, except you are not quite sure what you are supposed to find in the first place.\n\nAfter the struggles and expecting to progress forward, the game came to an abrupt end with a promise of a continuation. That was about under an hour of gameplay.\n\nThe second instalment called Lumino City was scheduled to be released Spring'13 but seems to be delayed, though there are updates on their facebook page as at Jan'14. The sequel seems to involve a larger world for exploration and more puzzles.\n\nCommendable is the artistic quality that was put into the building of the detailed sets and the pleasing music fitted the atmosphere well.\n\nThe flash game ran at a small 800 x 535 resolution so it sat in a black rectangular box in the middle of the screen. Overall, the lack of hints or signposts to point you in the right direction along with the short duration and lack of replay value for the game, I find it hard to justify the value of the game, even for a quick one off experience.\n","January 23, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's really only one puzzle that I feel is poorly designed, which requires you to dig through the same handful of books a bunch until you happen upon a specific one with a very vague clue on it, look through the rest of the page, and then visit the Internet and look up the solution.\n\nResults may vary.\n\nI understand Lume as an art piece. And it's a pretty cool one, having used papercraft dioramas to create a point-and-click adventure game. It works better than you might expect. The game doesn't look bad, either, though the characters turned me away before I even started the game. I don't really like their look, but that's not really the problem with this game.\n\nThe issue with Lume is that it's short. Including time spent checking the Internet, Steam tells me that it took 0.8 hours to beat the game. So that's roughly 48 minutes. Now, this game is $7. That's a lot of money for less than an hour of an art piece game. I could understand a dollar or two. I wouldn't be so cruel as to suggest it should be free, I know we all have to make money. But for the content, $7 is steep. It's for that reason alone that I cannot recommend it.\n\nThe ending mentions that it is the end of Lume: Part 1. If Part 2 were released as an update to the original game, then the price would make a lot more sense. After all, episodic games have been known to charge for the entire game, and then release over sometimes very lengthy amounts of time. Though it's been nearly three years since Part 1's release, at the time of this writing. Another quick glance at the Internet tells me that the next part is still in development, but after all of this time and considering the flash format, I strongly doubt that such will be the case.","March 6, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

("Grandpa's gone, I'd better fix this before he gets back!") Some good ideas marred by ameteurish execution; graphics, sound, controls, difficulty all get a 5/10. Most puzzles are very simple, but need just enough thinking to keep you engaged,.. then one is almost impossible to find the clue for, and another is made from an insane code. The interface feels much to slow to transition from point to point.\n\n$6 is insane, $1 might be worth it, but it SHOULD be included as a free intro in the much more complete sequel. Not that it only has 10-45 minutes of play (depending on how patient you are), but that it's so unpolished and plodding.\n\nThe random details completely unrelated to the game make it interesting.

I played it with my wife, and it was worth playing.\n\nIf I had purchased it for 5,99, would I have felt satisfied?  No.  The game has two big faults: brevity and obtuse puzzles.  We fully completed the game in about 1,5 hours.  The game takes place in one location, really, and with only one real task to accomplish.  So any length has more to do with puzzles that have solutions that are rather obscure.  Not only that, but actually several moments brought intense frustration as we found that the correct click boxes for specific objects can be only a few pixels in size, while the rest of the object brings no success.  So you click on one object to see what it does and find the task fruitless, only to click somewhere NEAR to where you originally clicked after exhausting all other options for 15 minutes and find that it now works.  That is infuriating, and better designed objects could have made this game a much shorter experience.\n\nI don't know what else to say.  If you're okay with a snack of a game for $1,49 (or your regional equivalent) then it's good enough for that.

Yes, but with a caveat.\n\nI paid 1,49USD.  Was it worth that?  Sure.  I like puzzle games and point-and-click adventures, so it hit the spot for my appetite.  I played it with my wife, and it was worth playing.\n\nIf I had purchased it for 5,99, would I have felt satisfied?  No.  The game has two big faults: brevity and obtuse puzzles.  We fully completed the game in about 1,5 hours.  The game takes place in one location, really, and with only one real task to accomplish.  So any length has more to do with puzzles that have solutions that are rather obscure.  Not only that, but actually several moments brought intense frustration as we found that the correct click boxes for specific objects can be only a few pixels in size, while the rest of the object brings no success.  So you click on one object to see what it does and find the task fruitless, only to click somewhere NEAR to where you originally clicked after exhausting all other options for 15 minutes and find that it now works.  That is infuriating, and better designed objects could have made this game a much shorter experience.\n\nI don't know what else to say.  If you're okay with a snack of a game for $1,49 (or your regional equivalent) then it's good enough for that.  But for $5,99 you should look elsewhere.","December 27, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The power is out, so gramps is off to take care of things, Actually, gramps is off doing who knows what, and it's up to Lume to break into his carefully safeguarded home by solving his puzzle-based home security system. To make this, and the eventual destruction of his bicycle, up to him, Lume and the player decide to restore the electricity, thus emasculating grandpa and taking away his sense of personal validation.\n\n*ahem*\n\nA breathtakingly gorgeous puzzle game, Lume is brought down by a few technical problems and its incredibly short length.\n\nWhat technical problems could a game like this have? Well, the resolution is (according to the Steam details page) 800x600. If that's not correct, the fact remains that even at fullscreen, it takes up a tiny portion of my screen. Very tiny. Laughably tiny. It was so small, it affected my ability to appreciate its aesthetics and, at times, solve the puzzles. Yes, puzzles -- did you think those last few lines referred to something else?!\n\n*ahem*\n\nFurthermore, and this is a choice made by the developers, the Myst-like screen transitions have got to go.\n\nFinally, the game was built in Flash and is clunky. I wish they had... well, done anything else, to be frank.\n\nAll but one puzzle -- perhaps I'm forgetting another -- were quite easy. The other wasn't difficult so much as it required careful observation and recollection as to what we had investigated thus far. Expect to spend most of your playtime wondering what the heck the game wants you to do on this one, or perhaps another. Oh, and by investigated, I mean clicked anything that switched the cursor icon to a hand.\n\nHonestly, there really isn't much else to the game. That's because Lume is a demo for a larger title, Lumino City -- a fact I did not realize until moments before beginning this review. I'm disappointed, and while I really want to recommend this, I don't think I can. Maybe watch the trailer, and if it strikes your fancy, and you don't mind shelling out $1 for a charming one-hour puzzler, pick this up. If you want something with more meat on its bones, check out Lumino City. I have not played it, and... hm. I may not. As of writing, I'm undecided.\n\nToo long, didn't read: Lume is beautiful, and has some decent puzzles, but the mobile-spawned graphic settings will irritate anyone playing on anything other than an old laptop, and the fact that it's essentially a tech demo is a turnoff.","December 2, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are children-book-alike and the animation is a nice effort on 2.5-D. Gameplay it smooth (simple point and click). The music is nice and calm but if you spend too much time playing the game, the loop can result a little bit boring. The puzzles are rather difficult for a game whose looks seem to be children-oriented and the game gives you almost no-clues. The lenght of the game is, to be honest, too short.\n\nThe studio behind Lume (State of Play) is working on a longer and more complex sequel to this game, but unless you catch Lume on a bundle or at a great low price, I would recommend you to buy this first game on the series only if you really love to contribute to small indie teams or if you hate long games (Lume really, really feels too short).","July 1, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I do agree that the price is a bit high for a very short game, I do recommend this game. There was only one really unintuitive puzzle (the cupboard under the sink. I DON'T GET IT!!) but the rest was a nice experience. There is not a lot of replayability so it's definitely better for younger kids who may get a bit more play time out of it. Though repetitive, the music is soft and unobtrusive and can easily be turned off if it starts bugging you. I understand the creators put a lot of heart and effort into this so I understand the price even if I disagree with it. If you can catch it on sale, get it for your kid.","June 4, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
