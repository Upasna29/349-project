You travel around the world, but there are still lots of grey blocks.\n-If you don't like short games, you'll have a problem with this one.\n\nPros:\n-The story is simple, but cool. It revolves around themes like the ethics of surveillance and government vs private groups. Current stuff.\n-While I wasn't crazy about the cube-based level geometry, the visual aesthetic is catchy.\n-Displacement orbs are turbo as hell\n-Music isn't bad\n\nI'll remember this game for the solid futuristic vibes, and the interesting and relevant story.

I'm going to explain why but let me first say that this is a very good game and if you like stealth games, the real ones, you should try this one. If you want a comparison with other games, NEON STRUCT is basically Thief (1, 2 and DS) in a modern world. I've read a lot of people comaring it to Deus Ex and System Shock but the game differs a lot from them and I can't really understand what those reviewers played. You can compare the atmosphere of Deus Ex but not the gameplay.\nYou play as Jillian Cleary, a spy who got framed and has to find a way to clean her name. During the story you will find information about a cospiracy and more importantly about the people involved in this cospiracy. The story is quite simple and predictable but yet interesting. I was expecting something more honestly and I was a bit disappointed at the end.\nThe gameplay is similar to the Thief gameplay: you sneak around and try to reach the objective without being killed. Your weapon is the shadow and good timing. You can knockout people, move bodies, disable cams, pick locks and steal, You also have access to a big arsenal of tools that can help you, such as bombs that can create shadows or stims that can make you better in hacking for sometime.\nThe level design is good with multiple entrances and exploring the levels is nice. The main problem with level design is that levels are incredibly small for this kind of game. I'm not sure why the developer didn't make a bigger world but levels are often too small to be a real challenge and they can break immersion. Something that bother me is that the levels are smaller than other games, like Thief games, even if this game has been released in 2015. This aspect could be improved a lot imho.\nThe AI is terrible and predictable: you can easily learn how to trick the AI and if you knockout guards then the game will be in easy mode all the time. The game shines when you don't knockout the guards but I guess that's not for everybody and can be frustrating. Also, hitting a guards is very easy and that makes disable guards a joke; you just need to be "behind" them and they fall asleep immediately. It feels very unnatural and too easy.\nThe graphic is ... somehow similar to minecraft. Squares everywhere. It is minimalistic and has its own style but nothing amazing. I understand the effort behind but he didn't work for me. I also think that with a better graphic and more detailed world, this game would be better.\nThe music is amazing, if you like elettronic music, or annoying if you don't. It is composed by The Home Conversions and can be listened at https://thehomeconversion.bandcamp.com/album/neon-struct (the main track is Cave Living, check out also the remix). I personally think that the music is the best part of the game, it's just a perfect match with the atmosphere. The soundtrack worked more than the graphic for me.\nThe sound effect and nice but the sound engine has strange problems. Sometimes sounds are too loud, some others you can't head anything. Overall the sound effects are ok but can be improved.\n\nI think the game is a 3 out of 5 but with great potential.\n\nGood:\n- good old school stealth games with good level design\n- nice story but...\n- the soundtrack\n\nBad:\n- levels too simple\n- ...the story is not that immersive\n- graphic\n- easy (if you knockout guards)\n- nothing new, both Thief and Deus Ex are superior in term of gameplay and story","July 4, 2015","true","10.6"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","40","44","0","1"

However it uses simple mechanics and graphics in very clever ways. At heart Neon is a stealth game where you must be keenly aware of your enemies movements, defense system, and how much you are exposed. What I enjoyed about Minor Key's stealth game is the ability to approach situations in many different ways. Through the front door or the back? Knockout or avoid detection. Use precious resources like grenades and stims or wait for a rainy day.\nWhile the stealth aspect is very well done and fun. There is still silly moments where enemies seemingly are blind or stupid. A group walking right past you into easy knock outs. Albeit this could be due to difficulty setting. Visually NEON STRUCT is classic,  Minor Key Games style of graphics. However the neon and glow really add to the atmosphere of the game. Musically NEON STRUCT is top notch. With an 80's over the top theme that sounds wonderful. Sadly this isn't always heard as most of the stealth missions are deadly quiet. Nonetheless this is a solid stealth game. In a genre that desperately needs new ideas and shot of inspiration. NEON STRUCT doesn't reinvent the wheel but adds a unique flare and makes me remember why I enjoy this genre so much.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/k4z6EW9JxXQ\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","May 20, 2015","true","2.5"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","45","54","0","0"

It should be noted though that when I say stealth game, you need to imagine the word "stealth" in giant, 100 foot concrete letters, because we are talking full commitment here. Combat pretty much does not exist, and if you get caught your only option is pretty much to just run. The level design is outstanding, feeling nice and open in a circular way that gives you freedom to go about the levels in a variety of ways.\n\nThe story, while nothing original, is well written enough that it keeps you interested, even if the early plot twist you can see coming a mile away, especially if you've played Deus Ex. Still, it's good stuff.\n\nArt style is interesting too. Kind of reminded me of Killer7 at times, which is always a plus. My main criticism would be that there is no ambient music during the missions. There is a really nice soundtrack that you hear in the areas in between missions, but other than that, unless you are being chased there is no ambiance, and made the game feel a bit empty at times. I had to supply my own using the Deus Ex soundtrack.\n\nStill, it's very much worth picking up for fans of the stealth genre, and I do look forward to the eventual release of a level editor and hope there are a good number of contributions.","May 27, 2015","true","8.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buzz_bee/recommended/310740/","buzz_bee","Dangerous Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buzz_bee/","603 products in account","This game is a very fine stab at the stealth/immersive sim genre on a budget. The developers have kept their ambitions within their means, taking the mechanical and storyline outline familiar from the first Deus Ex, and simplifying it to a functional core, which while sometimes lacking the richness of its predecessor, is an elegant and well-made product in itself. Note that I base this review on playing Normal mode.\n\nThe graphics and UI are minimal, with a block-like aesthetic drawn from Minecraft, though from such a lengthy passage of games that have done the same, that it no longer feels consciously retro, and appears to be a method of keeping area design from becoming overly-ambitious for a small team. The levels are either city-style "hubs" or office-type infiltrations. I use quotation marks around "hub" because these city exploration levels are surprisingly small at times. The basic graphics while doing the job, also harm the diversity of environments, with different cities around the world really all looking quite plain and similar (a problem Deus Ex: Invisible War also suffers from).\n\nThe gameplay consists of familiar elements of the Thief series: an illumination bar to show you how concealed you are by shadows, running makes lots of noise, and even walking elicits that maddening "is Garret wearing high heels?" response that feels both nostalgic and archaic. Fortunately despite your rather loud footsteps even when crouch-walking, enemies are not overly-sensitive to sound, although running will find you noticed quickly. There is also the running crouch-slide from Dishonoured. The enemies when alerted have Dishonored-style marks above their heads which can be seen through walls until they lose you.\n\nThere are no AUGs, experience points, or even an inventory. The only in-game menu is the objectives on the esc/pause screen. This is both a positive and negative. It takes away from the maximalist style of Deus Ex, but embraces the minimalism of Thief. Depending on your expectations, this could make the game feel either excessively sparse, or designed in a very pure way.\n\nThe lack of experience points and the wealth of items to be found in Deus Ex does leave a little lacking in exploration. The game's solution to this is to place "Geocaches" around the levels, usually five or so per mission, which reward you with a coin that can be used to distract enemies. The fluff behind this is quite silly, and I'd rather just hunt for coins on the ground, but the mechanic for distracting enemies with them is fun, and it makes sense to limit their quantity. It's not all bad, however, as losing the experience point incentive for exploring and unlocking things allows you to progress through levels in a less artificial manner than the minmaxing that Deus Ex, and especially Human Revolution, encouraged by their mechanics.\n\nThe main items the game does have are either stims or grenades - stims will enhance your abilities for a brief while, giving invisibility, hacking, quiet foot steps, and so on, reminiscent of arrows or AUGs in the Thief and Deus Ex series. The grenades do things like disable robots, and curiously, one emits an "anti-light" field, which helps you to conceal yourself. Overall I feel that these items, and the Geocaches too, are not very well tied into the lore of the world, and feel somewhat artificial in effect, but that is just a bonus to their enhancement of the gameplay, which is welcome (I do personally however find myself mostly playing the standard peek-and-takedown style, often ignoring these items).\n\nI feel that Normal mode is probably too low a setting for an experienced player of these types of games. Hiding in shadow is extremely overpowered, and you can clear out a room full of people with takedowns without anybody really reacting, providing it is dark enough. Enemies also don't react much at all to discovering bodies on this difficulty level. I will edit this review when I play through on a higher difficulty if it's any different.\n\nSound design is both immersive and stylised. Music emanates from radios and travels a great distance, allowing for a wash of sound across the areas, but also for you to switch the music off once you become tired of it and have found the radio on whichever shop counter it resides on. Enemy footsteps are *extremely* loud and can be heard from halfway across mission areas at times. If you have a lot of enemies around you it can sound like somebody is cooking popcorn in the microwave or something with the pitter-patter of patrolling feet. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or intentional, but it's distinctive either way, though can make it hard to identify exactly where an enemy is, as something may sound very close to you, but is in fact a room or two away, or upstairs.\n\nThe writing is reasonable, which is not an attempt to damn with faint praise, as a lot of cyberpunk/gritty near-future games fail in their writing - especially the dialogue and flavour text. Neon Struct's writing is not quite as earnest, interwoven, and verbose as Deus Ex, but mercifully avoids the trap of trying to be too knowing with its material (dialogue which breaks the fourth-wall, deadpan "why am I examining this mundane item" humour, etc) which could sabotage a storyline which needs seriousness to maintain the high levels of immersion that this micro-genre demands. In the first few missions there seemed to be a distinct lack of fluff/world-building notes left around levels, but once I had acclimatised to this sparseness, what the game did have read well and did not come across as amateurish or lazy.\n\nThe plot on the other hand utilises the same globe-trotting as the Deus Ex series does, but the weight behind your actions, and the complexity of the narrative is less compelling. This is partly due to the Thief-like attitude to world building (no large exposition-dump newspapers that you can embrace or ignore as Deus Ex had), but unlike Thief, which had a very weighty design to the interludes between missions, Neon Struct tends to drop you into missions immediately with a telephone call to give some context.\n\nThe loading times for my middle-of-the-range PC are very good, both for initially loading missions, and also for quickloading. I got some microfreezes for a fraction of a second or so every now and again which was annoying, especially in the hacking minigame, which is just Breakout (and quite fun for a hacking minigame for once to actually be a game, something fun to play, rather than a precision or memory challenge). Curiously these freezes were not random, sometimes when reloading I got the same freeze in the same part of the area. But other than that the game runs rock-solid for me at a high framerate and with no crashes.\n\nIn summary, I greatly admire the developer for taking on the challenge of this genre, and they have produced something that was very maturely planned to achieve exactly what it set out to do and no more. It certainly feels lacking in a little detail or weight of atmosphere, but after the initial acclimatisation period to the graphics, the game world certainly has its charm. I really hope the developers stick with this genre, and see room for expansion on all fronts if there is a sequel. The game would benefit greatly from larger hubs and more sidequests, but the core of the mechanics and reactivity are in place and admirably one: the few side-objectives you do have, the game does not always alert you to there being alternate outcomes until you read a news report of the events in the next hub. These are naturally somewhat cosmetic differences, but their presence is welcome. Overall, a bargain, and I'd happily recommend this game to fans of the genre. Not perfect, but very good!","July 8, 2015","true","11.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I want get those out of the way in order to concentrate on the things I like about the game.\n\nThe visual style of NEON STRUCT walks a thin line between minimalistic and crude, sometimes strongly drifting towards crude. At the very least the visuals are clear and transmit all the information a player needs, but I still feel that a more advanced art direction could have lead to a unique and sophisticated visual style instead of the serviceable, but ultimately bland look of the game.\n\nThere is no voice acting, the story is told by written dialogue and texts found in the levels. I understand that NEON STRUCT is an indie game with very limited budget, but the fact of rather low production value still stands.\n\nFinally, the AI of guards in the stealth is in the habit of letting the player off the hook very easily. After being spotted, frantically running in a random direction is often enough to escape.\n\nAfter getting the weaknesses out of the way, let me focus on the good stuff. I'd never have thought that synthie pop in the style of the eighties could fit to a mildly futuristic cyberpunk scenario, but I was wrong. The soundtrack is excellent and helps to set mood and atmosphere of the game world. I bought the soundtrack after finishing the game. Levels are well crafted, not huge, but big enough to make finishing your objectives without quest markers or maps a moderate challenge. The stealth gameplay is enjoyable and somewhat versatile due to useable items, with the aforementioned caveat of the AI sometimes turning into AD ( artificial dumbness ).\n\nBut the strongest trait of the game is its story. It tackles the loss of privacy due to intelligence agencies and the struggle between security at all costs and the protection of civil rights. The narrative is minimalistic, but that is quiet fitting, not only because it brings storytelling and artstyle in accordance, but also because NEON STRUCT clearly aims at players who are willing and able to connect some dots on their own.  Unfortunately, political topics are rarely tackled in video games, and NEON STRUCT deserves praise for its willingness to go beyond a generic collection of tropes.\n\nThe protagonist is another asset of the game. She is an intelligence professional who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, resulting in knowledge about illegal activities of the agency she is working for. Consequently, she has to go into hiding and find a way to expose said activities while being hunted by the agency. What follows is not a superheroine kicking butt, but a believable tale of an intelligence professional trying to survive against the odds. A few story choices are added for good measure.\n\nA demo of the game is available, and if you have a taste for stealth and story, give the demo a try - or buy the game immediately. I recommend it.","May 25, 2015","true","13.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The gameplay is like Eldritch in many ways, the movement feels exactly like it and it reuses a lot of the audio from the game too. The hacking is pretty cool, you play a Breakout minigame to unlock doors, hack alarms and cameras and to open containers. The stealth itself feels like it could use some work tho, the AI is very easily exploited if you jump on 1 block above the ground the guards will circle you, get bored and forget where you are, and seeing as stealth is what you're doing most of the time it kinda cheapens the game for me.\n\nI've not played through the entire game and there might be something similar later on, but I feel like there should have been a close-range stun gun instead of holding f to knock out guards, or at least some karate chop animation. You have gadgets already at your disposal and holding f to knock someone out as your primary way of attacking feels off.\n\nSo far there seems to be a lot to this game, a great story, side objectives, hidden geocaches, rankings at the end of each level topped with awesome music and art style.

It isn't a difficult game to complete, but it is difficult to perfect it. Each level you are tasked with a number of objectives, but there are also 5 geocaches hidden on each level, which encourage you to fully explore the environment.\n\nAt the end of most levels, you are rated on: Undetected, No harming anyone, No bodies found, No alarms tripped, All geo caches discovered.

In addition to these missions there are a few investigative levels where there is no immediate threat and the goal is to just talk to people and gather information for the next stealth sequence. All of this works together to create a quick moving narrative that feels all to brief by the time the credits roll and this is the greatest fault of the game. What is presented is so compelling that by the time the story is over the game feels just like it is starting to open up.\n\nThere are a few AI issues that are no big issue but I wish the AI wasn't so near sighted (they literally have to bump into you if you are completely in the dark), and at times they feel inept blindly searching around in the dark when a light switch is near. This is balanced by Jillian Cleary (J.C) being very weak - with one or two hits from a baton or pistol causing death.\n\nThere are a number of tools at your disposal but I only ever felt the need to rely on them once or twice and the slide maneuver that you get seems slightly overpowered when used against the very forgiving AI.\n\nIt also feels like the world building was not given as much care as it could have been - it feels like a missed opportunity that more things weren't readable given that there really is only a handful of notes, news machines and computers in the game. Also being that there is no voice overs in the game there are no sections for eavesdropping on NPCs which might've helped slow down the pace at which these levels can be completed.\n\nAll that being said - this is a very impressive game considering that it draws comparison to both the Thief series and the original DX which are games that I hold in very high regard. If you are a fan of either game series or stealth gameplay it is very easy to recommend this game as it is a gripping experience with an impeccable sense of style even if it is over all to quickly. If you are new to the first person sneaker - I'd recommend maybe starting with this game as it is more forgiving than Thief 1/2 or the original DX.\n\n8.5/10\n\nI wish it were longer and that the world was more in depth - but it is a fun and compelling stealth experience with a unique minimalistic style. Also I have read that an editor is going to be made available which should extend the life of the game considerably.","May 24, 2015","true","8.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiombomberz/recommended/310740/","idiombomberz","Idiom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiombomberz/","225 products in account","[Rambling thoughts about the game at 2 AM]\n\nDeveloper David Pittman manages to blend both the old and new in this riveting FPS (First-Person Stealther). The game draws you in with a setting that's a mix of  Deus Ex  and  Blade Runner  combined with the mechanics of the  Thief  series, plus it has that power-up feature from the  Bioshock  series that carried over from Pittman's years at 2K (Now in consumable form).\n\nBesides the change to the plasmid trademark, not much has evolved in the way of gameplay mechanics since 2013's  Eldritch  . The one feature which had drawn the most attention from the indie game dev community, Pittman's considerate 'Tourist Mode', is exactly that- Considerate. It's kind of like that 'Super Guide' option that Nintendo devs have been adding into their games that feature any degree of difficulty since 2009, which completes a level that a player might be having trouble completing. However, 'Tourist Mode' isn't someone playing the game for you; it's  sort of like  an invisibility cheat code, perfect for a budding neo-gamer looking to get into stealth genres, someone desiring to only soak in the block-y aesthetics of the game, or a speed-runner wanting to learn an easy category.\n\nThe foremost fault of the game lies in the writing, which Pittman openly admitted is not his strongest skill. Specifically, I found the characterization severely weaker than the classic games which NEON STRUCT emulates. Very few characters resonated or really 'stuck' with me after experiencing the game. Let me demonstrate, in the most maximalist method possible, by referring to the names in the art book plus whoever else I can name that was featured in that Where Are They Now ending .\n\nlist]\nJillian Cleary: I remember that was called a "blank slate" by MKG. I guess they succeeded, because I can't really say anything about the female lead expect that she's somewhat of a workaholic.\nDirector Furtwengler: German = Evil. He's like all of the complexity and enigmatic qualities of the Deus Ex antagonists boiled down into a dude whose primary motive for being evil is "just cause". No real drive behind this dude.\nVinod Chhibber & Alyssa Lawrence: Chihibber is  a thinly veiled author insertion . Lawrence is  future underground railroad leader .\nFemale hacker type with some 'handle' like 'Data' or 'Ping' :  gives you a side mission to save her ♥♥♥ from getting a weapons possession charge but you won't find it on your first playthrough unless you feel like going out the front door where all the police are waiting to ambush you .\nThe Bouchard's: That couple that Cleary knows from college  that eventually slip her a Mickey Finn for the cash reward. Motivation? They're broke .\nPeter Tannhäuser: Julian Assange stand-in. Runs BuzzFeed.\nSikh IT guy:  Your contact for some B&E mission who serves to throw some political opinion at you before so can actually get to the mission .  Outsourced to and written by a real Sikh!\nBeatrix Cheung      :  Pretty cool gal who runs that big privacy invasion program that is Actually Good .\nOnce again, comparing this to Deus Ex, it pales, because it was almost entirely made by a one guy looking to save time and money by utilizing free resources and reusing assets whenever he could. Why? Because he's just one guy with a family to feed.\n\nDavid Pittman is creating Video Games and Tools For Making Video Games. When he quit his job at a studio that would be closed by the end of the year, did he get online and start linking people to his Patreon? Of course not. Nobody had heard of it back in 2013. But the point stands- he quit to develop games independently, to chase the dream, not sit back on hipster welfare.\n\n7.5/10 Best New FPS\n\nFull Disclosure: Minor Key Games provided Idiom with a copy of the game "for focus testing and reviews."

This game is conversant in the stealth genre-- you've got your Thief-style environmental effects, your Deus Ex grates and vents, and a mess of cool gadgets to play with. Despite that, it never feels derivative; rather, it feels firmly and intelligently situated in its context in a way that made its boundaries and expectations feel really clear to me. As far as I can tell you can’t engage in combat at all, and as such the stealth is a bit forgiving—most mistakes can be resolved by running away, and the guards are quick to forget you ever existed. I’ve seen other reviews pose this as a weakness, but I see it as a positive—instead of being punished for taking chances, your missteps are relatively easily remedied and give you a chance to try a different approach while at the same time introducing the new challenge of figuring out where you ran off to in a panic. There are tons of secrets to find, which is made more difficult and tempting by the sprawling, sparse environments and the complete lack of objective markers, causing you to have to rely on your own sense of direction and the dialogue to find your way. Again, I think this would be more frustrating in a game where detection=death, but the flexibility of the AI makes room for this approach to keep you on your toes without ever feeling unfair or unnecessarily frustrating. I’m a big fan of the sound design, which feels to me to be sort of omni-directional: I can tell that there’s an enemy somewhere, but not quite where, and that maintains the game’s tension, while not being intensely punished for stealth mistakes keeps it from being too tense or overwhelming. A solid cyberpunk plot, a unique art style, and playing a female protagonist are all bonuses to me, as well as a grading system that definitely tempts you to try each level again. Overall it feels like a new take on stealth built on classic stealth foundations; highly recommended.","June 21, 2015","true","9.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

They get AIDS.\nOh, and this game shows up along the way.\n\nGameplay:\nThis is one of the few indie games that really nails stealth on the forehead. Though the game has a rather simplistic look, it does have quite a bit of depth in terms of gameplay. Much like the Outlast stealth system, it relies on a combination of your relative positioning in the enviroment and how much you are shrouded in darkness. Also, similarly to Outlast, you practically have no defense against hostiles once you are spotted. The only method of attack is through takedowns from the back 180 degrees of a hostile. Once you do take them down, you have to lug their static bodies on you before throwing them on the ground in some safe place. The alarm system is similar to that of Deus Ex, as there are security cams and alarm systems you do have to look out for. Disabling, or avoiding said security systems is done through a series of nonsensical gadgets that somehow work (don't get me started on the anti-light grenades). The hacking mini game, on the other hand, consists of playing a Pong-esque game of bouncing a ball up against a wall of tiles till you can break a hole in said wall to get around. Along with gadgets for security is your standard stimulants for running faster/healing/walking silently, etc. Most of the time, collectibles are found while on missions, though there are several item vendors along the way, which will come in handy if you use collectibles frequently. As per usual, the game does reward you for exploring alternative paths with item caches, secret pathways to avoid security, and a series of collectible "geocaches", or little marbles(?) used to distract enemies. To top things off, you do have the ability to slide or climb over walls after sprinting.\n\nEnviroment:\nThe game seemingly takes place in an cyberpunk-alternative-dystopian 2015, where cars float, security droids fly, trees have (for some reason) been replaced with large, glowing banners on poles, and fashion has been reduced to the 80s. The Minecraftish look is assisted by coloring that gives a retro-gaming feel, and techno music (at least when you aren't sneaking around). The only complaint that I do have is that the environments' limits are clearly defined. Looking up, or being on the roof tops allows you to see that there really isn't much outside of the levels' walls. However, it is better than having beautifully designed environments that you in no way can access. The NPCs are rather simply designed, having minor details and rather smooth texturing, and have a bad case of mono-quote-iosis. The NPCs you do interact elaborately with do make up for their simple design with interesting personality.\n\nStory:\nIf you for some reason didn't read the game description, here's the short version: You are a spy. You found something out you weren't supposed to know, corrupt boss has you arrested. You escape with the help of ex-colleagues and strangers. Now you have to stay off the grid and figure out who is responsible/how to clear your name. A bit cliché, but still intense. Certain actions and choices will determine characters' fate and enemy spawns. As you progress, you'll think twice before making each action, wondering if it will lead your spy agency to you or to your friends. You don't know whose strings the agency is rigging. If you haven't gotten the catch yet, there is a waft of Minority Report seeping through the cracks. The game is supposedly based on Edward Snowden's going whistleblower, which does put an interesting spin on the game as a whole. That regardless of the technology that is still fictional, there are still threads that link Jillian's story to normal life, whether it being authority tightening its grip or the seemingly hopeless situation that surrounds what remains of the middle class.\n\n\nOverall, this game is good for its story and gameplay. Recommended for those who like stealth and/or cyberpunk. Obviously not for those who don't like stealth or lack patience. In other words, this is the Deus Ex you didn't know you asked for.\n9/10\n\n","July 8, 2015","true","23.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

At the best of times it looks pretty good (which is about the first couple of levels and then the last actual gameplay level). All the buildings are made out of these plain white squares, sometimes they aren't plain white, but not often. (I mean I brick building wouldn't be that hard, right?) I distinctly remember the third floor of a trashed appartment building being one pure white room made out of plain white bricks, a couple supports, and a few windows, actually, you're going to be seeing that one a couple of times.\n\nOver all, if you think you want to buy this game, buy Thief 2: The Metal Age. 's good.\n\nWhy do people keep comparing this to Deus Ex, anyway? It's like the barest bones cyberpunk.

It's delightful and I am so completely the target audience for this game. The story is nothing you haven't seen before but it's still told well enough to keep you playing. Gameplay is pure stealth with no ranged combat options and bonuses for avoiding all enemies rather than taking them out. It doesn't have a lot of variety but plays very well, and with the game's ~8 hour length I didn't feel like it had gotten stale before Neon Struct ended.\n\nThe art is lovely, especially if you're nostalgic for Unreal engine games. It's not the prettiest neon dystopia but it feels right. The soundtrack is phenomenal and elevates everything else. I rarely add game soundtracks to my main music library but I did here before I was even a quarter of the way through the game. Random framerate drops are hard to forgive given the simplistic art direction but it never made the game unplayable and was not a frequent issue, just seems like something that shouldn't happen at all.\n\nNeon Struct is one of the rare games I actually finished. Even when it got frustrating, I still kept wanting to come back to it, and I don't get that from games very often. It's not going to appeal to everyone, but if you're into stealth or would appreciate a loving tribute to the themes of Deus Ex this is definitely one to pick up.

The story is bare bones, and pretty much consists of 3 choices that determine your ending, two of them in the same conversation. Mechanically, it's a lot of crawling around in oversized houses and the BARE minimum content one could get away with in a game (an 'Art' gallery near the end has around 6 copies of four paintings... which don't even add to the context of the story or tell anything about the owner, opportunity wasted). Reviews speak about the 'Neon Art' vibe, which may have its merits, but cannot redeem the game from a multitude of shortcomings, such as terrible sound design and the aforementioned barebones content.\n\nSummary: This would have been a great game in 2000, and is a good topic to build a game on in 2015, but it is not a good game today. Does this attempt to tackle a mature topic? Yes. Does it succeed? No.","December 9, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't mean that as if it's easy to just sneak around, but it's more challenging and in this game it feels like it's paying off.\n\nOne thing that I really liked is that there are levels that don't require you to sneak. Some places you can just walk around and admire your surroundings; Which, at least for my part, is almost like stretching after a long car ride.\n\nThe music is great and without it, the minimalistic approach probably would have felt a little bland.\n(I ended up buying the music as well)\n\nI really recommend it if you're looking for a stylish looking stealth game.

(advice: if you've played a Thief before, play one difficulty above Normal.)\n\nThe operative word here is "minimalism"... the levels aren't too big nor too small, and all the spaces have good logic to them. The whole campaign has a nice rhythm to it actually, alterating between mansion heists and small city hubs. There's also some nice bits where what you do in the towns seem to affect what happens in a mission, e.g. you carelessly talked to someone you shouldn't have, and they ratted you out, and now there are more guards, etc.\n\nThe soundtrack is 10 steps above most video game music. Like, it's actually listenable as real music that real people listen to. What's weird is that this game gets oddly quiet sometimes, like 50% of the game is pretty much just footsteps and no NPC dialog, which is a shame, I wish there was more to the NPC sound and world soundscapes, but I guess when you gotta ship you gotta ship.\n\nAnyway. This is a really nice homage to Thief / Deus Ex / some Shocks, and it respects your time. I recommend it.\n\n(disclaimer: I know one of the dudes who made this, and I presented on a GDC panel with him)","August 23, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alison/recommended/310740/","alison","alison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alison/","147 products in account","This is an entertaining little stealth game set in a wonderful cyberpunk world. It took me a while to get into it because it looks like Mirror's Edge meets Minecraft by way of Patrick Nagel, but once the story gets going it turns out that's a delightful aesthetic. At first i found the stealth very difficult, until i realized there is a little meter on the bottom of the screen that as long as you keep it black you are literally invisible to the bad guys, even when you are standing right next to them - then it became way too easy. You also get given a bunch of implausible spy gadgets, but much like Deus Ex i never used any of them. Anyway, gamey stealth mechanics aside, the story is a classic cyberpunk conspiracy yarn peppered with fun little conversations and easter eggs. And the music is insanely good, with shades of The Cure, Cocteau Twins and sweaty, dirty space disco. If you liked Majestic Nights, you'll love this. If you enjoyed Mirror's Edge or Deus Ex and you don't mind something a bit rougher around the edges, give it a try. If you remember the 80s fondly, just stop reading and get it right now.","December 25, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And fewer gadgets, no ranged attacks, no voice acting, more linear level design, less enemy variety, worse AI and a shorter campaign.\n\nAs NS is from an indie developer, I'm probably being harsh but considering that the only thing this game does better than the games it's emulating are its graphics (which, 15 years on, isn't difficult), I can't see any reason to recommend it to anyone.","January 20","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/310740/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","Neon Struct feels like a breath of fresh air. It is a stealth action game, reminiscent of Deus Ex and Thief. There isn't exactly an abundance of such games, and Neon Struct also manages to do its own thing.\n\nThe basic premise of each level is to get to your objective through the use of stealth and then leave the level again. There is a reasonable diversity of objectives to accomplish. and the fact that the game is not too long probably helps here. However, the biggest issue in the game is that going non full stealth is much easier than trying to stealth around the enemies. This is mostly due to the fact that enemies die in one hit so long as you sneak up on them from behind. And they also have quite short memories, so if you get found all you need to do is lay low for half a minute and then it's business as usual.\n\nBut I do kind of like the art style in the game, it is very minimalistic but remains distinctive and pleasant to the eye.There is also something I don't often say about video games, this one has an excellent soundtrack. Which is sadly only heard on hub levels, when you're not actually stealthing around, but merely trying to advance the story.\n\nNeon Struct is truly a great example of small indie team focusing on one aspect of gameplay and trying to deliver the best experience they can from that. I heartily recommend it to any stealth game fans.\n\n7½ / 10","February 6","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cyberpunk + low poly design + great looking set pieces. However, I know it's not for everyone.\n\nThere isn't much to the game. It's mainly exploration of levels and avoiding guards as you uncover a story of government conspiracy and omniscent surveillance. Think: Deus Ex meets Edward Snowden. The story itself isn't too groundbreaking, and it's told in a fairly cut-and-dry manner of dialogue, but it's enough for me to want to keep digging.\n\nThis is for the fans of stealth games like Thief and Splinter Cell. It's fairly barebones gameplay-wise and the level design isn't anything to write home about, but the atmosphere and dedication to stealth is what sold me on this game.","February 1","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
