The game let's you take the role of both Kyle and Mel as they venture through the world of superheroes and supervillains. The story is a bit slow on the build up but the actual plot is very unique and original. Each issue comprises about 3-4 hours of gameplay depending on how you solve the puzzles in the game. The puzzles are easy and you won't get off track much since Melvin is there to guide you when you don't know/forgot what you should be doing. The dialgoues and voices are great especially Melvin's british accent.\n\nPros:\n+ A great funny story plot\n+ Great voice acting\n+ Great Music (especially each character's BGM)\n+ Good Graphics\n+ Narrative guide (Mel gives you a hint when you get lost)\n\nCons:\n+ There's a bit of bugs whenever you make Kyle go to an obtacle-full area\n+ There are times that the voices become out of sync with the balloons/text that appear\n\nIf you're looking for a point and click adventure game full of humor, comedy, patriotism, superheroes and supervillains, then Supreme League of Patriots is a must try for you.\n\nI already finished all 3 issues and I just can't wait for season 2! :D","February 15, 2015","true","4.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Amusing dialogue, as long as you're not a right wing fanatic. Some small annoyances about how some items must be used/combined. Like you can't just use the item, sometimes you have to get the use option to show up in dialogue, sometimes you have to have the item selected and then click on another item on the main screen, sometimes you have to combine the items while in the inventory... Blah. But still, I had fun, probably so will you.","January 4","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first issue was an origins tale, and the main villain fought in the second episode was all the red tape you needed to slice though to become a fully licensed super hero. Ice Cold in Ellis deals with the consequences of some of the shadier short cuts undertaken along the way, dealing with relapsed super-villains and the continual harassment of that flamboyant guy with the pancake make-up and mini-skirt that doesn’t fit into The Patriot’s world view. It’s about pulling apart chains of command to issue dodgy orders across the entire police force that totally won’t return to bite you in the ♥♥♥♥ and kinda sorta undoing previous acts of damage by committing more offensive ones. Like curing arson by committing genocide.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12472/pc/supreme-league-of-patriots-issue-3-ice-cold-in-ellis/review.html","February 6, 2015","true","5.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Combing through the same old jokes searching for the branch to let you proceed forwards makes any jokes go stale very fast. Thank god you can click to fast forward dialogues, or this would have been some purgatory level $&#%!","September 23, 2015","false","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Δε θυμάμαι άλλο adventure game που να χαρακτηρίζεται από τόσο διάχυτη και καυστική σάτιρα επί θεμάτων που αφορούν την εποχή κατά την οποία κυκλοφορεί. Κυριολεκτικά καταπιάνεται μ’ ένα σωρό –ευαίσθητα- θέματα, προσπαθώντας να περάσει ανθρώπινα μηνύματα και ν’ αποτελέσει ευθεία και δυνατή φωνή ενάντια στην εκδήλωση κάθε μορφής βίας και ρατσισμού.\n\nCan't remember another adventure game that features such caustic satire on real life phenomena of the era it's getting released. It tries to send various messages in all directions and become a strong voice against violence and racism events.\n\nhttp://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/supreme-league-of-patriots-pc-review","February 7, 2015","true","6.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The achievements are virtually impossible to miss, although it does give you a nice warm fuzzy feeling when you realise you just got 100%!!\n\nOnce again, Kyle's powers were vastly underused - especially in the one bit I got stuck on. All I'm saying is the dude is supposed to fly and yet he can't get up a ladder!! Pros and cons are pretty much the same as the first two, except I have to add that I felt a tiny bit cheated on this game. I cannot put my finger on the reason why though, so I think I'll just have to pin it down to it being the easiest of the three (ladder notwithstanding).\n\nAlso once again, recommended as a great little 'filler', full of tongue-in-cheek humour (with just the right amount of crass) and well worth your time if you can handle point and click. I am looking forward to seeing what happens next in Kyle and Mel's little world.","August 5, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
