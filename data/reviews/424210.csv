"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cemeterygates/recommended/424210/","cemeterygates","CemeteryGates23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cemeterygates/","187 products in account","SodaCity is a small indie game that offers old-school gamers a familiar (yet distant) experience; one of the retro shoot-'em-ups, in classic 2D side-scrolling perspective with countless hours of fun distpaching enemies left and right and dying over and over again .\n\nThis game is pretty straightforward, very what-you-see-if-what-you-get.\nThe gameplay, as I described, is old-school cool that us adult gamers (at the time of my review anyway) will feel at home with, but it's also worth noting that once you've played a few hours, it's easily discernible that it's also deeper than it seems at first glance. Truly, each type of weapon offers very distinct possibilities, for example.\nThe graphics and visuals are retro with their peculiar aesthetic which I found charming and no doubt not everyone will necessarily like, but it's pretty neat and effective.\nThe audio is good too; there's clear cues for everything, distinct sounds and a simply superb soundtrack/score with music not only greatly done but also varied and fitting for each scenario and atmosphere.\n\nAlthough the game might at first seem to rely on repetition of a number of goals or objectives, after a little replay each area and each evidently has its own thing going on, its own flavor, and it's easy to recall them and formulate strategies for them. That should occur naturally after being beaten many times over the course of a level. That leads me to the point that this game is challenging, but I never found it to be excessively so or otherwise unfair.\nIt's also worth noting that the game does offer a fair amount of replayability, especially for those who don't mind grinding/farming a little bit to enjoy the benefits of fully upgraded weapons. That also begs the distinction that grinding in this game doesn't become much of a chore, it hardly forces the player to do so and those who choose so will have more fun than dull repetition in seeking to gain more currency for upgrades or better weapons.\nSodaCity, all in all, offers more than I initially thought and it will be a game to go back to every once in a while for sure. The fun is there, the appeal of a great game in a genre that seems long-forgotten in  the industry is there, the replay value of the game itself without the nostalgia attached is there.\n\n\nLast, but not least, I simply want to go over some of the details other reviews are criticizing which I found unfair, especially given how at the time of my review, those reviews have hardly two hours or less game time, and thus, in my opinion, extremely limited play to accurately judge the game as a whole. Here's what I think:\n\n-Some reviws call SodaCity out on the graphics... to this I ask, what is one to expect from an indie game from a small team? Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac, Terraria, Monaco and even better, Hotline Miami hardly offer much more in that department. None of them are AAA games, even if some did achieve similar sales, and that doesn't keep them from being awesome games.\n-Quick deaths/dying a lot... Let us remember that this game, by its very genre if nothing else, can easily be seen as an ode to old-time games, from consoles such as the NES, SNES, Genesis, etc... I never beat many of those games. Videogames back then used to be hard and you used to die a lot trying. Some modern games have even appealed to that principle, such as the illustrious Souls series. I find this more of a taste-type-thing than a fault within the game.\n-The aesthetic or lack of a deeper-developed story. As I mentioned previously, shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off soda cans may not be for everybody, but dammit if it isn't fresh and indeed silly! It's good stuff for those can don't need every game to be serious and have an encyclopedia worth of lore.\n\n\nSummary:\nSodaCity isn't a game for everyone, the genre certainly isn't trending the way near-future FPS or medieval-fantasy RPGs are. But for adult-aged gamers, there is a ton of appeal to be found here, and to anyone willing to give a fair shot, tons of fun to be had as well. I found the first few levels to be among the slower parts, but if you can play a little bit beyond that, I'm betting it can easily draw most people in and have them hooked for days.\nThis is a solid and promising start for a young development studio. Imagine a sequel with full miltuplayer integration on console... Personally, I'd buy that with no second thoughts! Very much a recommendable game. Hopefully one of indie game's next big titles.","December 14, 2015","true","10.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"
