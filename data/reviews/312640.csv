"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/312640/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","In the midst of a great war, humankind now hangs on the edge of extinction. All but one pilot representing the human race is left with nothing to lose, and a thirst for revenge. The story in Power-Up is simple sci-fi fare but is effective through its usage of snazzy dialogue and slick visuals that all give a nostalgic retro flare.\n\nAs the first stage starts the massive human vessel deteriorates in the background as I find myself dodging the pieces of its firey debris. The situation is intense and the narrative well thought out, pulling you into the role of this lone human pilot very well. When games were still all about the challenge, shoot-em-ups reigned supreme and Power-Up follows in that classic form. The game follows a horizontally side-scrolling view in the same vein as classics Gradius or R-type but with a visual style of its own personality.\n\nPower-Up gives you a versatile set of weapons displayed on a Gradius style weapon bar and include all of the classic variations you'd expect in  shmup arsenal. You've got your standard straight shooting pea-shooter, a spread shot cannon, side-shooters, a back-firing laser, and a powerful but short range plasma cannon. Most importantly is your ability to 'power-up' each weapon individually allowing you to strategically distribute your pickups between desired weapons for specific situations. Personally, I mostly stuck with a high leveled pea-shooter and the spreadshot, but there were still plenty of moments were the game throws situations that require the other guns at you forcing you to think quick and on your feet.\n\nUsing a fully leveled weapon is where the intensity begins and the action really starts to shine. The feeling of shredding through a crowd of enemies with a high-powered barrage of bullets is an exhilirating one, and even moreso when you face each of the huge and beautifully detailed bosses and their tricky attack patterns.\n\nThe retro atmosphere provided by the stylish visuals, detailed backgrounds, and heavy music are all the work of one man and obviously with a lot of love making this an even more impressive endeavor, as well as a seriously solid entry into any shmup afficianados library in its own right. Power-Up retains everything we love and remember from the classics while giving it a unique makeover, and is something I would deem a modern classic in a dying genre. For the incredibly low asking price this is an easy buy that provides more than just a retro throwback but a completely new experience.","August 30, 2014","true","8.6"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","33","48","0","3"

You are literally the last human alive, and you're fighting back against the alien menace. As they say, it's eye for an eye, or..13 billion eyes for 13 billion eyes? Whatever. All hope is gone, so all that matters is complete and utter genocide.\n\nThe ship you're going to be piloting is the ugliest thing imaginable. It looks like an electric razor. I mean really, did Gilette build this thing? Way to go humanity. While not aesthetically-pleasing, this ship isn't lacking in firepower. There are five weapons available and they can be switched between at any-time. This is important because enemies approach from all sides, and the weapons have specific angles of attack. Each weapon can be powered-up (shock!) several levels. There are more than enough power-ups to go around, so there's no reason to focus on 1 or 2 weapons. Bombs and a forcefield round out this arsenal.\n\nThe five stages are exactly what you'd expect out of a shooter. A legion of battalions will attack your ship, and you must cut through these overwhelming forces.  There will be quite a few close-shaves due to all the bullets getting thrown about as well. The construction of each stage is wave-based. For example, in one part of the stage you'll shoot down tiny dog-fighters, next up a crowd of flying laser cannons will approach, followed by some other ships that fire rockets, and so on. It's an organized rank & file approach, one that I'm not fond of. As the game progresses, the stages get longer, until stage 5 actually feels like it's longer than all of the other stages combined. At the end of each stage is a boss, but if you're sufficiently powered-up, they'll go down very quickly.\n\nDespite the lack of continues, this isn't a difficult shooter. The Norelco6948XXXL will breeze through the first few stages on the back of the spread-shot alone (with minor appearances by rear-shot). Stages 4 & 5 definitely step things up, but mostly they just test your patience, because they go on forever. Difficulty-settings are available, but they only affect the amount of lives.\n\nWhat's most likely going to kill you in this game, is when your eyes eventually lose track of the action. When a weapon is fully-powered, every shot creates a flash that bathes the entire screen in light. These weapons are firing several shots a second, which creates this disorienting strobe effect. It's possible to die, and not know what actually killed you. There was definitely a bullet there, but you probably didn't see it, because all of the flashing lights cause you to miss what's most important. This in my opinion is a serious issue.\n\nWhile the lighting is the worst aspect of this game and requires a fix, I'm not sure if it'd be enough for me to recommend Power-Up. In terms of mechanics this game is decent enough, and it reminds me of a less-restrictive Hellfire, which is neat. It's poorly-paced though, and doesn't really get exciting until the later stages. I especially don't care for enemies attacking in waves. It comes off as artificial, especially when the environments don't go through any real changes.\n\nOverall, I'm not a fan.","December 23, 2014","false","2.9"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","24","34","5","1"

Perhaps, it's not entirely fair of me to review a game like this since I'm just not a big fan of the genre and I've played too many of these kind of games.\n\nTruth be told, "Power Up" is not a bad game, it does what it has to do. It looks OK, some of the bigger enemies look kinda cool. I did not have any problem with the gameplay either; you kill a lot of enemies and try to pick up all the ... well... Power up's, of course, which increase things like your shooting power and shooting speed.\nYou are able to switch weapons the whole time like shooting backwards, shooting sideways or frontal shooting.\n\nI must say I did like the soundtrack, it doesn't get annoying like in many other games.\n\nOverall, Power Up is not the best game in the genre but it's not the worst game either. If there was an option between recommend and not recommend, I would've picked that option. Shooter fans will probably have a good time with this game, besides the game is fairly cheap, which is why I'm recommend this one.","May 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

And I'm a softie for any shmup that lets you shoot backwards when needed. And being able to quickly lay down an entire curtain of slow-moving projectiles for enemies to run into... is WAY too satisfying.\n\nAnd you know what?

I don't have much time in it yet, but I got far enough to have better than half of my weapons fully upgraded before running out of ships.\n\nTakes me back to the 90's.  You have several different weapons that are selectable on the fly with power-ups along way to make whichever one you're using at the time stronger.  Along with speed and force field power ups that can be picked up too.  Like the days of old you get a certain number of ships before it's game over, and there are no continues.  The game can be quite challenging, but so far haven't died because of completly impossible situations that couldn't have been avoided if I had been just a little faster or paid better attention (no bs gotcha's in other words).  Music and sound are pretty good and match the setting and style of the game (think retro but higher quality than 8 bit).\n\nDefintely worth the modest cost considering once upon a time you could blow $10 on a similar arcade in less than 2 hours and still keep coming back for more punishment.","August 29, 2014","true","13.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

That is a good thing. It's the first old school shmup I've played on Steam that actually feels oldschool without being too simple. While the enemies are fairly basic, they are better than similar games at this price point. The weapon switching and power up system is the highlight of the game design. They are well balanced for various play styles. Switching on the fly and strategizing is excelllent.\n\nDifficulty: It's difficult, but not that bad. It's much, much easier than something like Strikers 1945 or Ikaruga. Using no forcefields, on the first play through on the hardest difficulty (Psychopathic - 1 life) I made it to the end of the third stage. It's suitable for people new to the genre. Thankfully, it's not cheap.\n\nControl: I played with the keyboard and it was okay, except for when I got to about speed level 5 it became a hinderance. A slowdown button would be helpful for navigating bullet fields.\n\nSound: The music is good. The sound is decent, but occaisionally a bit repetitive. The voice samples for the weapon switching are at the perfect volume and sounded awesome.\n\nWhat is missing:\n* No score keeping? For a game that places quite an emphasis on score, it is a strange, glaring omission.\n* Slow down button.\n* A more difficult, extreme difficulty to satisfy the veteran shmup players.\n* Sound control. The laser effects can grate after awhile.\n\nWhat would be nice (but, hey - it's a solo developer):\n* Score-based challenges.\n* A few different playing ships.\n* Online score competitions.\n* More enemy types (down the road).\n\nOverall: It's good. It's not perfect, it's a bit clumsy. However, It's worth the pricepoint and a good oldschool intro to the genre for new folks. Support the dev and hopefully the game will grow a bit to meet it's potential.\n\n","August 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There's 5 stages.\n\nAs a kickstarter backer, I'm well aware this was entirely done by one person with little development experience.  With that in mind I think it's a great accomplishment that the game is playable at all, let alone enjoyable.\n\nBiggest qualm I have is, as another review mentioned, it's hard to see incoming bullets sometimes, especially due to the flashes of light from your own weapons.  That and no varying difficult based on number of enemies, only number of player lives.\n\nWorth it for the price if this is what you're looking for.  Also, I don't know why anyone would play these kinds of games with a keyboard, get a controller. I can't speak to the keyboard controls.","January 10, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, this is one of those no save games. If you run out of lives you go back to the start.\n\nIf you are okay with the above, then this game is fun. There are plenty of weapons that you can power up and the controls are very responsive (if you have a controller).","January 18, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bad mechanics.","August 29, 2015","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the good news.\n\nNow the bad news:\n\n- Resolution options?, ♥♥♥♥ them, there is none...\n\n- Control options, again: there is none.\n\n- Control explanaintions?, forget it: you are a mind reader, so starting the game you should be able to read the mind of the developers and know before hand the controls for keyboard...\n\n- Sound options?, who need them?. You will love that music, louder than the SFX!\n\nBy now you should see a patter here, as clear as day: there are no options. Well, almost, there is actually two options: keyboard or gampad, and fullscreen or window.\n\nTo me, this game is an easy 7/10 but until they add some options I will rate it 5/10.","January 6","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
