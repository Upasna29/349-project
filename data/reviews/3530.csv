Its a simple game that involve you looking past everything and just look for the little details of the pictures you are seeing. you have to find items in the picture that are listed on a list at the bottom of the picture. This game deals with traveling around the world and finding the different items in the vast places it takes you. Its a great game to start on if you are new to this type of gameplay.","March 28, 2011","true","5.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

To date they are my favourite of the genre.\n\nUnlike more modern HO games where the items are often practically jumping out at you, here they are masterfully blended and conspicuous (sometimes even a little too much so.) The whole scene looks practically painted.\n\nEach stage ends with a varied puzzle (crosswords, rotating tiles, spot the difference) that offers a little break and introduced the next level. And each level ends with a small informative blurb that I assume nobody will read, but it adds a bit of substance.\n\nMore modern HO games try to amp it up with plot and animations and a story and voice acting and what not, usually with bad results, because at the end of the day, it's a cheesy casual game and reaching for more just makes it awkward.\nBut this series focuses efforts on the mechanics of HO gameplay, and it shows in how well the scenes are made.\n\nShame about that low resolution though.","December 16, 2014","true","29.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/3530/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","I love hidden object find-it games, but this series by Popcap is terrible.\nPopcap have their fair share of fun games, but these are definitely not up there. The music for me is just irritating. It’s painful to listen to, it’s very repetitive and all sounds the same. It’s all in a low tone, and honesty I have to say it barely passes for music. Nor background ambience for that matter. It’s a horrible mixture of both I suppose. I turnt all the settings down so I don’t have to listen to it, but no audio at all makes it even more boring than it already is, so I played my own music in the background. Just to try and make the game a tad bit more bearable.\nThe gameplay is fairly repetitive, you play the same 5 scenes over and over and over again, and it feels as if it goes on forever. To complete, it’s way too long. Or at least felt that way. It just felt like a chore to complete. I made myself finish it because usually I want to finish games I’ve started before I can move on.(anyone that knows me will know my illogical OCD-tendencies when it comes to my steam library).\nLike most games, it felt so good to finish, but not in a satisfying way. Where you finish, reflect on the game and feel good about it. In a way that just made me so happy that I would never have to go near this game ever again.\nIf you enjoy hidden object games, don't buy these. There are much better ones you can buy. The "Midnight Mysteries" and “Samantha Swift” series were good in my opinion. I played through them quite easily. They actually have a story and is a lot more engaging. The time it took me to complete those series of games, was probably the same amount of time I spent dragging myself through this game.","April 16, 2013","false","19.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

WHY?\n\n*ahem*\n\nLet's do this.\n\nThis game is the 6th hidden object game I have played. Like the Mystery P.I. games that I have played and reviewed, this game was produced by Spintop and published via Popcap. The objects hidden in the scenes are almost all the same, and there are only a very few which would be different.\n\nThe flavor of story accompanying this game is finding a stone tablet, which will lead to the World Gem (which looks like a ginormous refined diamond big enough to be likened to the size of a toddler). Well. That's all of a story.\n\nI have played through the main game and the endless seeking mode for hidden objects, like I did in Escape Rosecliff Island and the four Mystery P.I. games I have played. Good Gods did that take some time.\n\nNot recommended unless you're a junkie for hidden object games and have the necessary patience and tenacity to find everything.\n\n...and there will be another Amazing Adventures game waiting for me. But this will be reviewed in due time.","February 6, 2015","false","13.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game features attractive graphics but an unfortunately low viewing resolution of only 800x600 stretched to fullscreen.  The gameplay is brisk, the music appropriate and their are both a collectible and bonus game added on to each one of the campaigns 25 missions.  Unfortunately both widescreen resolutions and the Steam Overlay are not supported.  Overall however, Amazing Adventures Around the World delivers what it promises, an entertaining albeit flawed puzzle game.","November 19, 2012","true","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

THEN YOU START THE OLD MAPS ALL OVER AGAIN!?\nThat's what made me quit the first game and this one too, the objects don't change in the levels so it gets boring.\nThere's also new mini-games like the classic word search, which you're able to pause the game and still look at the list and the game to find the words without the timer going down...\nThe soundtrack is different and pretty decent, although sometimes it sounds like someone is farting purposely in the game....\nAnyways, decent game for when you're bored and love iSpy!\n\n7/10","January 24, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But, for what it is - a hidden object game - it's alright.\n\nWouldn't recommend getting it at full price, but I honestly don't think I'd recommend that of any game on Steam given how often stuff goes on sale.","January 27, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one, again, sees you looking for a hidden artifact. Each screen has many items to find which then leads onto you solving a puzzle to get to the next round. The objects are very clear and very well drawn and this adventure takes you to many famous landmarks around the world. If you find the two special hidden objects on every screen then you are invited to play a mode where you can find every object on every screen. A very well implemented hidden object game that'll keep you amused for hours.","April 16, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No big story, no big adventure.  The "Around the World" thing is really nothing more than a simple theme to create a reason for having hidden object puzzles in a variety of international locations.  This is essentially the same as the Mystery PI series from Spintop.  Just fun, if you want to do one hidden object puzzle after another.  Highly recommend for hidden object fans.","March 25","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
