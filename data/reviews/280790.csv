You can of course rush things with their in game mojo points. When you run out though, despite paying 20 bucks for the game. It's either pay to mine or wait forever.

Before i downloaded this i knew without a shadow of a doubt i was gonna hate on it an rage about how this is just another rip off of the game the great lord Notch created. I start the game:\n\n1) Graphics are amazing! You will find yourself just walking around starring at the scenery. (willow trees are the best)\n\n2) Jump 2 blocks! Um thank you sir.\n\n3) Loads of blocks! You can't harvest much at the start but once u get the better equipment everything is yours! EVERYTHING. And it is a lot\n\n4) Many mobs. Some will make u run in terror just at the sight. Some just want to be left alone. I killed a baby crab. Felt evil. Was awesome.\n\n5) Combat system flows really well.\n\n6) Character isn't modable but thats ot a big deal. It could happen in future updates.\n\n7) The cave systems and mining capabilities are simply better.\n\n8) I do however wish it wasn't all server based. Local play would be a great improvement.\n\n9) The grinding element can be annoying but once you locate where certain items are found (aka which biome its in) you can link teleporters and quickly get around the world. The vastness of the universe is incredible.\n\nIn short Creativerse minecrafts better than Minecraft minecrafts. The creators are the new god. give up the throne Notch. I will shed some tears but i think I am benching Minecraft for a while.\n\nEdit: I know Notch hasn't had anything to do with Minecraft in a while. I know he sold Mojang to Microsoft for a pretty penny.","October 28, 2015","true","9.5"," 278 of 305 people (91%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","91","278","305","85","23"

What better day for them to transition than on Sept 11th? What better day?\n\nGamers everywhere, if you support this game you are not only supporting a downright evil company, you are the cause of the downfall that is video gaming. You need to pull your heads out of your butts and start opening your eyes. If you support these companies and these business practices you are the cause of the “Early Access” problems, the cause of “PTW/PTP/PTC” problems, and the cause of video game companies having the right to stifle freedom of information with censorship. You ARE the cause of gaming review companies, personalities, and publications going the way of the “sell out”, and why? Because if they don’t “sell out” they are “snuffed out”.\n\nToday, on Sept 11th, I have been permanently banned from Sell-a-verse forums. Was I given a warning? Nope. Was I talked to? Nope. And why was I banned? Here, take a look for yourself:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/517141624282545953/\n\nOh, and don’t worry. If they destroy the evidence and that link doesn’t work check out my blog, I have every screenshot needed for you to take a look at. (amenglishDOTweeblyDOTcom- go to game reviews early access)\n\nSo what happened? Someone (Will have to censor screenshots as to not get myself in trouble with Steam) whose first language is French, had a problem. You see he bought the game because it says “solo play” in the description and bought the game in a bundle and now finds out that the game is “online only”. He asked for help and doesn’t understand why the game can’t be played offline. I post a comment (in English and then I took the time to translate it into French for him) explaining how the game is going the FTP micro transactions *(PTW/PTP/PTC) route and that is why it will never be online. I also tell him that he should have read reviews before buying said game (hoping that he would do so in the future but also because some of us take the time out of our lives to try and help other gamers, the least you could do is read it and inform yourself). He then thanks me, first for taking the time to respond, second because I translated it into French for him to easily understand, and third for answering his question.\n\nWhat happens next? Enter Fan Boi (let’s call him “Bent”) Bent, he wants to turn the thread into how the game isn’t a PTW/PTP/PTC game, basically giving the middle finger to the person with the problem, and then reports me. Within minutes I am permanently banned for helping this French person with the problem. I get a message:\n\n“You don't seem interested in having a civil discourse with our community and seem to delight in spreading misinformation about our game and business model. We think you'd be happier spending your time somewhere else. Goodbye.”\n\nPlease feel free to read my older reviews for this game on my blog, check out all of my postings in the Sell-a-verse forums, please read that thread above (if they haven’t killed it) and you tell me if I have not been civil, if I have not been doing anything but spreading simple truths. I would be happier spending my time somewhere else, and I shall. More importantly, gamers, so should you. This sort of “people in power quelling people’s voices just because they don’t like what they are saying”, THAT is the death of gaming as we know it, THAT is the death of honest game reviewers as we know it, that SHOULD be the death of early access! Who is going to give an honest review when they get censored? Who is going to give an honest review when they will never be given early copies of games and/or have to buy every single one of the games they review? When companies start censoring conversations that scare them and then only give access to those that will say what they want to say what do you have left?\n\nIn my last review (which you can find on my blog) I pointed out that a lot of the reviews had tags/titles that read “reviewed with key sent by developers”, since that time they have all removed that tag. Every, single, one of those “given free keys” (hundreds of these reviews on Steam) was “positive”.\n\nOver the course of this game I have given voice to the thousands (literally) that hate the PTW/PTC/PTP game destroying features in this game, features including but not limited to this: http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/619573787463233789/\nAnd I have done so civilly and with facts.\n\nBottom line is this, you want to buy into early access and support this game YOU are the problem with gaming. And how does Steam respond? By putting reviews that get 50%, 69%, and 70% “found helpful” in the “most helpful” section because they are all “positive” reviews when all of the negative reviews are much, much higher. Tell me this isn’t censorship? Tell me this isn’t “buying away all the negative reviews so no one ever sees them…” If you have a brain, or if you care about gaming in the slightest, do NOT support this game/company or any like it.\n\nTL;CR\nLook, you can’t read because it will fry your brain but honestly want to know what this game is about, then go to Playfulcorp.com/candycraft2 and see for yourself. Honestly don’t know how long that will continue to be up on their website before they take it down, it is a PR nightmare.\n\n*Please don't bother commenting on review to let me know that "you ♥♥♥ need go die in whole yo!" because I will just delete it...\n**I suppose people don't even get this far in my review before posting troll comments; as I have said, please don't bother, I honestly delete them without even reading them. You don't like something down vote and move on, if you have a reasonable question I’ll try to answer it otherwise all other comments will be deleted. Ignoring this just proves you can't even read this far before having a fan boi explosion in your pants...\n***Older reviews of this game in their completeness can be found on my blog; address found on my Steam profile or by googling Ashley and Micah English.","December 14, 2014","false","84.1"," 2,644 of 3,383 people (78%) found this review helpful 235 people found this review funny","78","644","3","235","162"

It's a good game. It's visually more attractive than MC, but then, aren't they all? There are some interesting novel new ideas, in the arena of mineral extraction. The character avatars are currently limited to two congenital twin white people with the same armor/clothing. Here's to hoping they introduce more diversity of races, both real and fantasy.\n\nYou could spend a lot of time in this game, like Minecraft, just wandering around. They have plugged in more mobs, and the crafting system is more streamlined. One of their selling points in their own copy was "No more googling for craft recipes!" Ok, that's cool and everything, but not exactly original.\n\nWhat needs to happen is for the developers to COMPLETELY disavow themselves of the pay for content model. They need to make an original game that works, right now, that people will flock to, or else it's just another bloated dead beta corpse in the water. When they said they wanted to charge for content and upgrades and rushed completion of contruction (they were/are going to use a pay-to-hurry-completion model similar to every exploitative MMORPG ever), that really pushed them into the margins. It was a major PR messup.\n\nI know I'm probably not the first to suggest:\n\nNPCs that are actually interesting and contribute to the environment in an original way. Vendors are the first thing people make in sandboxes. Okay, what could be more interesting? NPCs that give you missions. Okay, that's great. That would improve the game. What else? NPCs  that form relationships with the characters, that can tell stories.\n\nThe mobs are more interesting in Creativerse than in Minecraft. They have "special moves" which seems to promise a lot of potential. Unfortunately, they're a little stupid, although seemingly more dangerous than in Minecraft.\n\nCreate features that are interesting to explore and interact with, not just showcases of a new graphical innovation or mob. Minecraft is minecraft. You can't compete with minecraft by being Minecraft. At this current stage, I see no major innovation in this game. No story, no new angle. Fun and playable, but nothing I'd buy again if given the chance.\n","February 11, 2015","false","33.4"," 711 of 898 people (79%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","79","711","898","28","9"

Creativerse, however, adds its own spin on the idea. I will be comparing this game to minecraft throughout this review. Lets go through some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nSame feeling of freedom you get from minecraft. Really do whatever you want.\nAnimal taming system is a really cool optional part of the game, that has been refined from the model that existed in minecrft.\nbiomes look beautiful, considering the limitations of block-based graphics\nServer system is much easier to manage than other games of the genre, with jump-in game worlds with user privilage settings\nFrequent updates are adding content and squeezing out bugs regularly\nFree-to-play model works great (Will explain below)\nCons:\nGame progression is slower than you'd be used to. It takes longer to get to the better tools than minecraft, and deeper layers are un-minable using older tools. Really don't like this feature.\nStill a bit buggy. Some instances of creatures spawning where they shouldn't and water not acting as it should.\nToo many block types. I will explain this below.\nSome block rarities need to be tweaked.\nReview\nFor some background, I live in a house with 6 of my friends, guys and girls included. Most of us are heavy gamers, and one or two are more casual. I downloaded this game on a whim and within a day the whole house was playing in my world. They had all built their own little houses and we had started organising larger projects and had delegated tasks to everyone. This. Felt. Great. It was a really cool experience that I personally never got out of minecraft, even when playing with friends. We all really love the features and look of the game, and the fact that anyone can drop in, work on the castle a bit or collect ore from the mines and drop out whenever they want. If thats the kind of experience you think you'd enjoy then this game will be a fun casual time sink.\n\nNow, the free to play model does have microtransactions. As far as I can tell, you can spend money on blueprints (large outlines of complicated designs that let you know which resources you'll need to build.) and consmetic blocks (recipes that unlock blocks with unique textures). Obviously, all of this content is completely optional and purely cosmetic. This is why I think it is a pro for this game.\n\nBlock types... There are hundreds of them. Trees drop different kinds of wood, stone is only found in the shallowest layer of digging, each digging layer is made up completely of different sets of blocks representing rock types. What's good about this is the cosmetic implications. You can pretty much find a block with the exact texture you want for the walls of your dungeon or treehouse. What's bad about this is your poor poor storage space. It won't take long for you to fill up containers of bedrock, limestone, dirt etc etc and it is often hard to tell the difference at a glance which is which. The majority of these blocks are used is at least one recipe. This makes the crafting system quite complex. If I want to make an iron mining cell for whatever reason, I still have to keep flipping back to the recipe page to check what I need, even though i've crafted dozens of them.\n\nBlock rarity. For the most part, rare blocks are very useful for specific recipes. An I tem called rockster rock is very difficult to find away from a beach, so I'd say its quite rare, but it is only really used in weapon crafting. Obsidion, which is found quite shallow under ground, is also rare. I cannot tell you how many times I found a lump of coal and got excited because I thought it was obsidion. Now, contrary to rockster rock, obsidion is used in a huge amount of essential recipes, including the recipe needed to harvest more obsidion. I spend far too much time just looking for obsision, because it is far too rare for the recipes that use it. Obsidion is just one example, it does happen with other block types, but that might ust paint the picture.\n\nAll in all, creativerse is definitely a fun game, Its free, Its not graphics intensive, It looks great, and its easy to play with your friends. It has its problems, obviously, but they are activley being worked on.

That said... Many games have followed trying to pretend it's not Minecraft, but really just a clone. When I first saw Creativerse, I thought Ok it's free for a few days, no harm... Few hours later... "PURCHASE FOR MYSELF"\n\nCreativerse, gave me a renewed interest in Sandbox Gaming, I love that it is in Early Access and the devs are actively working on taking the game to further heights. Love the graphics, Love the design, and the gameplay is very smooth. Your ability to create is nearly endless, and it makes you want to Play, Explore, Build, Survive.\n\nI love the way people are banding together, helping each other, building a greater community and relying on each other to grow. In our world: "The Era RPG Server" (New Server) we've actually built a thrieving socity based on rules and guidelines, professions, teamwork, trust and communication. We actual have character roles and play out our adventures together.\n\nExploration is very enjoyable, so many different and unique wonders to see, I was exploring and found a spot where 3 biomes met... Beautiful Canyons, Thick Jungle, and Frozen Snow... I was truly amazed at the possiblities of building in places like that.\n\nTheir are ton of mobs, ugly ones, really cute ones, to down right nasty looking mobs... I am excited to see what new functions for pets they will come up with. A few suggestions:\n\nA Pet Whistle to call your pet when they get lost, I like to let mine wander.\nThey should help you in combat, I mean they where kicking your butt while you where taming them what happened to the fight in them,\nA Pet Trough to feed your pets when your away, so when you come back you can gather from them and then give'em a little shower.\n\nCombat is simple Hack and Slash, point and click. For the stage it is, you wont need more than that. However I would like to see implementation of ranged weapons above throwing pinecones, a Bow or Crossbow, maybe the Water Sprayer can deal damage to enemies, implement a flamethower, I KNOW THE ANIMATION IS THERE... Those Firerats will mess you up. Perhaps a Block Button? Just a thought.\n\nHealth should, however slowly, regenerate over time, and recover completely when you sleep.\n\nCharacter Customization is a MUST, even being able to change the simplest details, Skin color(include green), Eye color, Hair color... Hoodie color.... (optional) Ears, Nose, Mouth, Hair style, Shoe color...\n\nA Trade Window, that allows you to trade with anyone in the world. The window pops up, you pick who you are trading to and the item your trading and a request pops up on their screen, they click ok, the trade window opens on their screen.. they add what they are trading, both parties hit confirm... Boom... and they can be anywhere in the world.\n\nThis game can easily set a completely new and different standard for sandbox crafting gaming.\nCreative has the Potintial to Surpass Minecraft in everyway with or without mods.\n\nDEVs PLEASE don't Give up on us! It would be a crime against Gamers... Keep up the Good work and I will play and promote till Creativerse 2!","November 7, 2015","true","335.1"," 123 of 137 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","123","137","10","0"

The monster models in Creativerse are very unique and stylized, and not something you could ever see in Minecraft.\nThe biome diversity in Creativerse is pretty good.  Biomes appear to at least match Minecraft in terms of terrain generation and fauna.  However I did not see any new biome types that Minecraft does not have.\nThere is a temperature mechanic in very hot and very cold biomes.  This could create some interesting gameplay mechanics, though I’m not sure how full featured it is or how it effects gameplay in the current build.\nRandom loot chests spawn in the world which is a fantastic reward for exploration.\nBuilt in player teleport functionality allows for easier travel and exploration far from your home base.\nCrafting tier system provides a feeling of progression as you unlock new recipes.\nCons:\nPlayer movement physics feels bad.  Jumping has moon gravity, and the player takes a moment to accelerate up to speed before moving. Running long distances feels quite quick and smooth, but small precise movements, like while exploring a cave for example, feel sluggish and slippery.\nLacks the random terrain and gameplay elements that Minecraft has such as Dungeons, Temples, NPC Towns, Chasms, Lava pools, etc.\nCrafting tables spawn randomly all over the world, which just look and feel out of place.  Why not just spawn the player with their first table in their inventory?\nLacks the charm and coziness of Minecraft.\nCombat is identical to Minecraft.  Just stand in one spot and click the enemy.  Would love to see something new added to make combat more interesting.\nNo Mod support.\nTrees are GIGANTIC, making them a major chore to chop down.\nI know it’s a sandbox, but somehow it just feels entirely purpose less.\nYou play as a cartoony gender neutral 12 year old, and I don't think player skins are currently supported.  It would be nice to at least choose from a few different player models or skins.\nCreativerse is going free to play soon, which will no doubt add some ridiculous micro-transaction scheme.  No thanks.  I much prefer to just pay for a full package game at full price, and have access to the full amount of content without pay gates or pay to win boosts.\nIn summary, Creativerse is not a bad game, and if you’ve done absolutely everything there is to do in Minecraft then maybe Creativerse could provide you with something new.  But honestly, Creativerse is just kind of bland and there are better options out there.  It just made me want to install Minecraft again.\n\nThe developer really has a great engine and base to build on here.

You have this nifty wrist gauntlet that will suck up blocks and put them in your inventory.  Your first order of business is to upgrade that gauntlet with a wood mining cell.  You'll need to check what you need to craft that cell and acquire the ingredients. So the game goes until you're completely outfitted with top tier armor and equipment.  While you do this, you'll explore many different biomes, and levels to get the needed ingredients.  Some people feel this is the end game, but for me the joy of this game has just begun.  Now You can get down to some creative building.  You can do this solo, or find a good server with like minded individuals and build to your hearts content.\nThere are also different multiplayer servers you can join, or start your own and list it in the Public Worlds forum for others to join.\nPVE-player vs. environment is the most common. You'll find your peaceful builders here.\nPVP-player vs. player.  The people who like to steal, loot, blow up stuff, and hunt you can be found here.\nRPG- Role playing servers.  These are very interesting and can be lots of fun.\n\nPros:\nGame updated every 2-3 weeks with bug fixes, and new content.\nProgressive equipment leveling up\nEnvironment exploration\nResource hoarding\nCrafting\nBuilding\nFarming\nTaming mobs for pets you can then feed and harvest from\nSolo or Multiplayer\nWonderful Graphics\nInteresting Mobs\nInteractive Development Team\nFriendly and helpful community forum\n\nCons:\nAll the cons I could talk about are being addressed by the dev team, and could very well be fixed by the time you read this review.\n\nNote on FTP and in-game store.:\nThe devs have decided that only cosmetic additions to the game will be sold in the store.  There will not be anything that is required in the game to level up, or advance in the store.  This means you can have the full Creativerse experience without having to buy a single thing.  On top of that, the game just went free to play just over a month ago, and the devs have already given out 450 free coins for the Winter holiday update.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want a difficult, mob killing game this won't satisfy. If you love sandbox games and building games this just may be your next great obsession.  The mobs aren't too difficult to beat, so it's great for kids, and casual game play.","December 31, 2015","true","695.7"," 85 of 97 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","85","97","12","3"

I don't know where to start except to say that within the four (maybe five) days that I've had this game, I've put in 60.2 hours.\n\nThat's both a pro and a con in my book. A pro because the game has me hooked, and a con because it has me hooked.\n\nNot a clean dish in the house, but do I care? No, because I finally found Lumite - dishes can wait. I mean. . . who needs real life stuff when you have Creativerse, yeah?\n\nBut seriously, this game is Minecraft * 1000. To say the game is good is like saying Oxygen is 'meh'. It's not good, it's fantastic.\n\nSo what do you do in Creativerse? You create your universe. Hit create world and jump in. Others can join it unless you password protect and/or turn pvp off, etc.\n\nWe had a troll come into our map (our being my family) and he IMMEDIATELY starts bombing my wife. I had pvp turned off, so it was a fail, but he soon found himself kicked.\n\nHe comes back and says "I came here will ill intentions but that was before I knew there was a kick feature. I'm sorry I won't do it again."\n\nMy response?\n\n/ban - check\n\nHe didn't come back. I couldn't hear anything over his QQ'ing and I didn't care, because my stomach was grumbling, couldn't find anything to eat on because all the dishes were dirty, but guess what? I found friggin LUMITE!!! Everything else pales in comparison.\n\nSo, should you get this game? Well, I don't know - do you fun? I'll let you answer that question, then click the play button.

Very similar mechanics to Minecraft but there are more RPG elements which make it enjoyable outside of just mining blocks and building things.\n\nThe crafting system expands as you create new objects and collect new materials.\nThe fighting system is pretty basic, you have a sword (you start out with a stick, however) of various materials which do more damage for each material type. There are health potions which you can make and are very useful because there is no cooldown to use them and they are pretty easy to make. Bombs are also a huge help with combat and if you've killed enough Keepa for gun powder, you should rarely run out.\n\nDeath just means you need to run back to where you were to get what was in your inventory when you died. All equipment and quickbar items remain equipped. Now that they've added a map, its a lot easier to find your way around as well.\n\nThe game looks pretty good, for a block-based world. All npc's have normal looking models, including the player characters. Easy to play with friends and have them join your world too.\n\nI am hoping the dev's continue to work on this game by adding in some boss type monsters or some other kind of challenges and building materials.","May 11","true","149.2"," 44 of 44 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","44","44","2","0"

This'll be a medium to long review.\n\nOkay, so first of all, I don't play alot of games like this. The only one I've played similair to this is Terraria.\nThat being said, I was drawn to it because it's free and it looked okay.\nI actually really like Creativerse as a whole, even though I've played for 3 hours total when writing this review.\nIt's open world is quite immersive, and it doesn't take ages to find other biomes and explore. Night-time is dangerous but the creatures look really awesome!\nBuilding/crafting isn't that hard and pretty much explains itself. Which is good in my book.. It's a good book. 'cos it's my book.\n\nRIGHT!\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Graphics: Smooth graphics and it runs rather smooth aswell. Even the blocks have detail! The scenery is often breathtaking even though it's made from blocks. It's beautifull!\n\n+ Relatively easy crafting:  As said above, the crafting explains itself. That being said, recources aren't that hard to come        by in early stages appart from exploring but I figure it'll get alot harder later on.\n\n+ Bestiary: Since I always want to read up on monsters before I actually encounter them, I came across a relatively large bestiary. From pig..things.. to  Things. It's pretty diverse and each spawns within it's own biomes and Lord help me if I find myself in a cave!\n\n+ Biomes: As diverse as the bestiary, as diverse are the different biomes to explore. Didn't take long before I found myself in a jungle.. at night time... getting nuked by creatures I was trying to run from. 10/10 would explore again!\n\n+ Mining: Okay, so it's not actual mining with a mining pick. Why not? Because that's boring. And who uses a mining pick when you have a cell-powered WABBAJA-  ehm.. MINING GLOVE! That's right! You just rip blocks out of their comfort zones and put them in your dark, dusty inventory only to be processed into more usefull things like rods or slabs.\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\nI can't really think of any major flaws. It's early acces, what would one expect? Goats stay on the ground? Wrong, I saw a couple fly into the air... Which was quite the hilarious sight, I might add.\nSo... so far so good! I hope the developers keep up the good work as I, and many others, would probably want to see more awesomeness!\n\n11/10 Would recommend to anyone who likes exploring, gathering, crafting, surviving, building your own secret laboratory and slap pigs with a stick! No pun intended.\n\n11/10 Would play again!

Creativerse makes it so easy for my wife and Mattie to play together on their Skype dates :)\n\nI personally play this game almost every day. I've been so impressed at how "polished" this game is and it's only in Alpha! The visuals are easy on the eyes and the gameplay is satisfying. The Devs are fairly active in the forums and come out with new releases every 3-4 weeks.\n\nThis game opens it's doors to many different play styles ie. builder, designer, crafter, organizer, miner, gatherer, hunter, explorer, etc...\n\nSome gamers think Creativerse is a Minecraft clone, well...

I've been playing Minecraft for over 3 years now and I got fed up a long time ago. Yet, Creativerse has a new and fresh look to it, which makes it super fun to play, for Minecraft players and for those who have never played Minecraft.\n\nAfter playing for 13 hours, here's my list of pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n- Amazing textures and graphics\n- Beautiful ambience and sounds\n- Large variety of mobs and items\n- Great amount of building blocks and possibilities\n- Complex, mysterious and very well made spooky cave system\n- Teleporting system\n- When you die, you don't lose all your stuff nor progress\n- Awesome crafting system, with recipes, challenges and more\n- Spawning of random chests throughout the world\n- Farms and plenty of cool contraptions to make\n- Easy to play with friends, for free\n- Plenty of furniture to decorate your home\n- Addictive and challenging\n- Cool GUI/HUD\n- Temperature system\n- You can own pets and take care of them, dress them and bathe them\n\nCONS:\n- The server side system makes it buggy, laggy and glitchy\n- The characters aren't (yet) customizable at all\n- Upon launch it will be free to play, which makes me afraid of seeing this game turning to the micro-transactions dark side\n- Still has plenty of bugs (most of the times are fixed by relogging, but still annoying)\n\nIf you are thinking about wether you should buy it right away or wait for launch, I would recommend you to buy it right away, these devs definitely deserve the support for such a great game.\n\nThank you!","September 30, 2015","true","98.5"," 66 of 80 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","66","80","2","3"

That being said I'm glad it was a gift from a friend and Playful was kind enough to give me a few keys for my son and some friends to try the game. As the game stands right now myself, my son and the few friends that did play pretty much stopped playing. If you're looking for more of a survival game experience then you probably will enjoy the game. If you're looking for creative freedom to build and explore maybe killing a few of the world's increasing variety of creatures then that's becoming harder to do with the latest updates. Totally put off by the new elemental damage introduced to the game. Forces you to micromanage more now because you need potions to counter the effect where before you could just explore and have fun as long as you stayed a few blocks away from lava or corruption. It takes the fun out of exploring for us. You now also take damage in cold and hot zones even when inside your own home?! No thank you. If you plan on doing little exploring and stick to the level mid surface ground then you'll be fine, bored, but fine.\n\nThe whole server only play isn't always great either. On more than a few occasions I've noticed clunky lag times when playing side by side on the same world with my son. Also you can't play if the server is down for any reason, but luckily that hasn't been an issue up to this point.\n\nWater physics still need work, but are improving. There are some times you need to fight to get out of water or you may get sucked into a pocket of water that's hard to break free from.\n\nUpdate R16 was just such a disappoint after so many hours playing. We went back to Minecraft for its ability to switch between peaceful & survival modes on the fly. Also the ability to have unlimited resources to enable the building of anything as well as all the great mods. Much easier to have creative fun specially for the younger kids playing. We've also started playing lots of Terraria.\n\nI'll keep checking on the game every few updates, but I'll not be playing like I was once. Wish them well.\n\nI recommend it to survival game fans when it's released as F2P or the early access is on sale next.","May 31, 2015","true","310.1"," 66 of 83 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","66","83","3","0"

It does not have any automaion/engineering ATM, NPCs, or Mods but a large chunk of what they dont have they know most of us want and are open to adding it if it wasnt already planned (Early Access still in development and all).\n\nIt is a pretty well functioning game, runs well and have encountered only one bug when my friend was declaring war on the terrain with explosives.  It is now F2P, with the only in game purchases being cosmetics (Different blocks) and fireworks.\n\nIm not really a huge fan of EA and all the downsides it entails but I am actually enjoying this quite a bit especially since you can make a private world with friends (All servers are on their end so that can be good or bad for you depending on preference).  The one absolutely huge thing that will keep me in is the friendly and helpful devs which are quite active in the forums.  Example, in the middle of the night for North America, servers went down and within a few hours they were posting on the forums and had them back up.  I also had my world go down for 50 mins once.  After 45 mins I finally put in a ticket, and even though the problem resolved on its own I had a dev come into my world and check to make sure everything was ok 37 mins after putting in the ticket.  They might not always be this fast but often they are and always working hard to find out what their players want.

Has features out of the box that Minecraft doesn't, like block rotation and mobs that can be tamed into pets. A lot of nice tweaks over Minecraft, that comes with the game, no mods needed. HD graphics out of the box, no special texture packs needed, in fact it's better than HD texture packs for Minecraft. Processing machines are better than vanilla Minecraft. Can put multiple stacks in at once. Recipes are easier. You just have to have the required materials, then tell the crafting menu to make it, no more arranging items on the crafting table. In fact there is no crafting table, craft at home or on the go!\n\nWill allow modding in the future with hopefully a better system than Minecraft offers. So far the game play is fun and just makes sense. However it is pretty similar to vanilla Minecraft, not a whole lot of tech machines and items or trains/tracks/carts, has it's own unique items though. It's still in development and could offer a lot more than that in the future through the game itself or when modding is enabled.\n\nIsn't a memory hog like Minecraft, though there isn't 50 mods loaded with it.

There was a decent spread between positive and negative, but most of the positives were pretty non-specific (" Oh boy! What an AWESOME game, blah blah blah")  while most of the negatives were QUITE specific and QUITE negative. A lot of talk about it basically being "pay to ACTUALLY play", terrible people online, no dev support, no single player (despite it being a listed feature), etcetera etcetera.\n\nNow maybe I shouldn't say TOO much, considering I've only played single player thus far (yes, it DOES exist), but I actually like the game a lot. I haven't encountered any of the negative stuff I read about and it's actually pretty darn good. The crafting feels a lot more intuitive and straight-forward than minecraft, plus you actually get RECIPES to work from (novel concept, right?), the graphics are a touch cartoony, but great looking nonetheless, and the way things like crafting machines and some textures look lend an almost steampunk-y/ torchlight-y feeling, which I really dig. Also, there is ONE thing you need to craft for ALL your mining/digging/chopping needs! Not a shovel...AND a pickaxe... AAAANND an axe AAAAAANND a hoe.... AAAAAAAANNNNDD shears.... aaanndd you get the idea.\n\nI have encountered a few goofy bugs, which, as annoying as they may be at times, are TO BE EXPECTED in an alpha. I haven't come across anything that either stopped gameplay or was a personal deal-breaker yet though. I also can't really give input on dev. involvement since I haven't had reason to try to reach them (yet, I'll remember to update this if I DO).\n\nCOMBAT! Now maybe it's only because I've been doing a lot of building and exploring rather than dedicated mining or spelunking, but it does KINDA feel similar to minecraft in that they've added some combat reliant things to a game that isn't really combat based. Let me try to explain that: monsters are scattered throughout the world, right? well some of them drop things you MUST HAVE for certain recipes. Fine. Great. The only hitch is that all you've got is a sword and whatever level armor you've managed to craft. Now, like I said, I haven't been super focused on rare resource gathering so maybe this is just my personal failing, but with 2nd tier armor (obsidian) and a 2nd tier sword (more of a stone club) I still have a good bit of trouble with even NORMAL daytime mobs, nevermind the psycho critters in the caves. Additionally, that sword and armor you burned resources to make is durability based, and each progressive tier seems to require a lot of the same materials as the prior tier, which culminates in a problem trying to move to the next tier because you keep having to use the same stuff you want to use to move up on replacements of the lower tier armor & sword just so you can keep going outdoors!! The only real plus I've come across in that respect is how they've managed deaths and respawns. If/WHEN you die, an urn with ALL your stuff in it appears at your spot 'o' death and, as far as I can tell, stays there indefinitely. This urn is marked on your compass and has a light beacon sort of deal shining up from it, which makes it pretty easy to find once you've respawned at your little spawn setting tile (which is move-able).\n\nSorry, little ranty, I know. That's just one of those things I've always found a little annoying in minecraft and was disappointed to find it here too, although Creativerse is not AS BAD as minecraft about it.\n\nSO, long story short? Good game. Single player anyway. Multi might just be hell, I don't know, but single player is pretty great. Good crafting, good atmosphere, good graphics, easy to learn, and FUN.","April 27, 2015","true","151.7"," 60 of 79 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","60","79","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xent1/recommended/280790/","Xent1","xent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xent1/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet's talk creativers, we all seen a lot of voxel games popping up after the big success of Minecraft, some are so poorly done you regret ever buying the game. With Creativers it's different, currently in early access it has already surpassed Minecraft in my opinion. With for starters having free multiplayer so no need to pay 60$ just to run a proper server. What got me interested from the start was the feature of having all recipes shown on the crafting grid so there was no need for Wiki to find out "how to craft a door". And finally the vanila graphics are much more easier on the eyes, a quote from Minecraft players that gave it a good description [imo] was, "It like running on a high definition texture pack with shaders"\n\nSo...? What is a Voxel game? The Voxel genre describes a world where you can alter your environment, every thing can be picked up and placed back again or used in a crafting recipe. In this game exploration is key, by doing this you are often rewarded with unique recipes and various items that you will need in your craft.The crafting system is based on progression, meaning that crafting one item wil unlock new items. The goal of this game is focused on exploring and creativity, having the ability too build anything you want and show it of to your friends or letting them join in and build something together. Griefing is one of the most feared aspects in this genre, you don't want people to destroy you creations. No need to worry there, the developers have this covered.\nIn Creativers you have many options preventing this, by means of passwords, make other players visitor by default, (meaning that when they enter your world they can only look and not interact), turn off/on pvp and disabling explosives.\n\nEarly access, i must admit it the most over abused features Steam has, 70% of the game never become what the devs are promising the game is gone be and as a player you feel cheated out of your money. With Playful and their game creativers it's different, The developers really are on top of this with good communication and a good ear to what the community has to say, on top of that every player has had there money back true ingame currency up to more then what was invested. The release of new things to do in this game is on a fast track, with only one month in between each new patch.\n\nFree to play. We all know this word very well, with most games it's a pay to win scenario or just a paywall all together. in Creativerse the developers only put decoration and blueprints of buildings in to shop and that's it really, of course people that bought the game in its early access state can already buy these object with there free ingame coins they got from supporting the Developers. On release Creativerse will become a free to play game, and with the money they earn from players buying from the shop they hope to further expand the game.\n\nIsn't this a copy of Minecraft? This question is in my opinion narrow minded, It's like Doom and Wolfenstein without them you never had Cod or CS. True that Minecraft was the first of its kind but the experience is different, Creativerse adds a lot of new features of its own to the Voxel genre and the Developers have much more in store for this game.\n\n*Let's talk downsides then, Because this game is still in early access there are still issues that need to be ironed out, that said, these issues are not game breaking and to be honest i seen non early access games come out with more issues than Creativers.\n*I think the biggest downside in my opinion will be for people that wait for this game to be released due to that by that time there will be alot of decorations you want out of the shop and it will set you back some money to have them, For people that bought the game this will be far less because at the  moment there enjoying free daily coins. And true that you don't have to buy anything from the shop, for a gamer like me the compulsion is great to want them all.\n*Last downside for this game is the need for internet access, even in single player your world is still run on a server, there free with no rent but for people that have no internet access this game can not be played.\n\nConclusion, Creativers is becoming a must have Voxel game if your a fan of the genre. With an ever growing feature list surpassing any other Voxel games, its worth the money invested in, and i will go so far then to say, "If your waiting for the Free To Play version? DON'T!!!", yes all the shop  items are decorations that you don't really need, in the end you want to have them all anyway. by investing before this game is Free To Play you not only get your money back in ingame currency but also get free coins everyday till the game is ftp.","September 16, 2015","true","463.5"," 75 of 107 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","75","107","5","12"

You pull blocks towards you using the Force and can jump 2 blocks high. Torches can actually set your thatched roof on fire. You 'discover' new blocks and recipes in a tiered system that means you don't ever have to remember recipes. You can even track required ingredients as you gather them. I enjoyed going through the levels of the earth, down to the 'corruption' level, which is essentially filled with Dark side energy that slowly kills you. SImilarly, there's mineral water found on the surface that gradually heals you, much like spring water from Biomes O' Plenty. There are fans that work like arcane levitators from Thaumcraft. There are teleporters and you can warp back to your spawn point at any time. Death statues appear holding all your items after you die, much like Openblock's graves.\n\nThe devs don't support modding as of yet, but I found that even I, as someone who loves mods in Minecraft, was satiated with all the different blocks and items in the game. Some of the blocks are gorgeous, like lumite and diamond glass. Some of the trees are so massive and impressive that you just have to spend 10 minutes climbing them. And no lag! The visuals are good quality even with an integrated graphics card.\n\nOverall, if you like the sandbox genre and Star Wars, you'll have a blast with Creativerse.","March 24","true","27.0"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","0"

All sorts of well designed creatures, as well as an amazing art-style, makes this game an absolute beauty. I was skepticle at first, but after only five minutes I could tell I was going to like this. On another note, the crafting is very complex and fullfilling, with a blockheads-type feel to it in terms of the tiering system for each item crafted. Anybody who has seen this and had second thoughts due to the fact that it came out at the same time as all the other sandbox surivival games (some of which aren't that great), download this game with now, it's free, and you'll get hours upon hours of intriguing gameplay. Only complaints are that online has a few minor bugs, and once you've played one game the next feel slightly repetitive and tedious.

For you to be able to create some items (mining cells for example) you need to create its less valuable counter-part. Which I for one really enjoyed on my first world because you don't know what you will unlock in the future\nServers/worlds The system in-game for the worlds in amazing in my opinion and have found it to be rather extraordinary, probably because I have not encountered this kind of thing before. Every world you/your friend creates will save and for example if your friend leaves the world he creates whilst you're both connected, you will remain in world and are still able to play-through the game as per usual. I'm not entirely sure how it works but I have found it rather handy for this feature to be in game.\nGameplay I personally was expecting this game to be a bit of a bum, probably because I instantly thought of the hundreds of minecraft rip-offs there are but my friend got it so we both decided to take the game "For a spin". Instantly we were both 'wowed' by the extensive world and great crafting system and number of new options available to us!\nGraphics There really isn't much to say about graphics but that they are very good for a voxel based game title, I was rather shocked with the detail of shading in some places and marvelled at the fab-u-lus view from my tree base. looking over the mountains.\n\n-Cons\nIn my opinion this game is amazing so I'm going to name a few improvements I think could be made.\n\nItems I personally believe that this game should have a few more weapon choices (ranged) and extra armour/clothing too, some rare gear/items could be placed around the world with a somewhat 'mini-boss' guarding whatever the gear/items may be. Me and my friend have come up with a number of ideas such as 'Goo-Boots' which reduce fall damage/make you bounce without a block being underneath you. Items like this would be rather nice and would seperate this game from minecraft and other voxel titles even further.\nCharacter Customization I positive this has been said before and I'm sure it will be said again. This game would be amazing with customised characters, I'm not asking for the 'skins' from minecraft to be put in the game but I would quite like an RPG style customization in-game, even if it was just complextion, hair, eye and voices even that would be rather nice.\nSounds I think it would be rather nice for your character in-game to have some voice emotes like laughing etc, this would again bring the game further away from other voxel based titles.\nAnimations Along with the voice emotes, visual emotes such as waving could be added or even combine the visual and sound emotes together for example with the laughing emote.","January 16","true","14.2"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","24","28","4","3"

The only difference between this and MC is the graphics are better and the game lacks the depth and multiplayer options of MC. I played it cause it was billed as MMORPG, this is flat out a false tag. The multiplayer is much smaller than MC and only exists if you have the friends to get together and play on a single server.

It so far is pretty amazing though and worth trying at least even if you don't want to buy it.(I'm writing this during free week)\n\nI'm not good at pros/cons so I'll just say my thoughts.\n\nFirst and foremost yes as i said it is a minecraft clone however alot of the extra stuff to make minecraft this you would need mods, which imo is great, but my friend gave some solid drawbacks of everyone must have the mod and some mods the admin has to place it all down, etc.\n\n1. Crafting so far is great, you have to find the materials  explore eerie places and you can't just take your friend's already made item to unlock the obejct's recipe however picking up items unlocks the next tier/new recipes to craft.\n\n2. Exploration is huge and immense extremely enjoyable\n\n3. So far building I wish took notes from trove where it predicted where you wanted to build and hold+drag to place multiple of the same block at once. Most definitely needs an improvement since I want to be able to build while surviving unlock minecraft where i have to go admin mode\n\n4. Weirdly moving you do not just move over 1 block automatically, I wish that was changed for more QoL movement\n\n5. Very artistic designs a plus for you graphic junkies\n\n6. I love that you can buy some stuff from the store and everyone on the server can help build it, to my understanding\n\n7. Combat so far since im still inexperinced: the enemies so far are pretty diverse and do many entertaining actions however I wish that as the player i had more than just a "homerun/swing and a miss" sword....\n\n8. Very friendly UI which can sometimes be overlooked in game making\n\n9. Character customization needs work, that's a must...and I kinda want more than a 12 year old even if they are great for a default design\n\n10.  Water logic is pretty boring you dont just sink which is true irl but I prefer minecraft/trove/starbound water to this.... water in minecraft/trove makes fun trap potential and starbound great for helping with exploring\n\n11. Taming monsters is really cool\n\n12. The fact that the game stays up, your world, friend's worlds, all stay open even while you're offline is a huge plus esp if some friends are in different time zones\n\n13. When you start out with a few recipes, every time you craft an item it unlocks the next tier however with every item crafted it's easier to build another item(so far most of the time it isn't the next tier but a different item type) this can feel a tad linear but to me it helps prolong your exploration since you have to take your time and discover all the secrets in the world instead of just digging through everything and reaching the core of a planet(i'm looking at you starbound) or just falling into the void(hai minecraft), or hitting a undestroyable boundry(you're lucky you have rpg  trove <3)\n\n14.I would love to see where they go with this because so far it does have huge potential\n\n15. They should also do like trove and say in the tooltip where an item mat can be found\n\nI might add more to the review later but I just realized I might be late for class wish me luck and carry on adventurers!","October 13, 2015","true","10.1"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","0"

Honestly I knew it longer but didn't want to spend 10 EUR for it. Now it's F2P and offers the whole content and even some free blueprints. All MTs can also be made with resources payment (zone claims, blueprint buys). Ofc comparsions to Minecraft can be made. But this game has primarly a focus on HiRes graphics and liquid animations of many different kind of specimen (overly cute comic style!). You'll be sucked in easily into this cycle of crafting & building, farming  crops, taming specimen and gathering minerals. The receipts are not too unfair. So you mustn't grind long for resources (except Iron ore seems pretty rare).\n\nLittle complaints about the graphics performance: sometimes you see through unrendered blocks down to lavaworld. Also the game seems to run in some Flash webbrowser mode. On my highend gaming laptop it has the same performance than on my old office notebook. And the RAM memory usage is constantly 1.5 gigs.\nAlso the melee fights (only swords as weapons) are pretty unsharp. Enemies hit you from far distance and even through cavewalls. Another thing is travelling the whole map shows you always the same bioms over and over again.\n\nBut after you crafted yourself up to the highest gear the game has still some more to offer. The building ideas are limitless. The first 100 hours went away very fastly. Still have something to build even after gathering Lumite from the Corruption ...","May 30","true","185.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","12","12","3","0"

From a first glance it looks a lot like minecraft but I really feel it doesn't play anything like that at all it has enough differences and unique features that Minecraft could actually get a few ideas from Creativerse. I've seen a lot of negative reviews on the game stating things like Pay 2 Win but how can you have P2W in a non competitive game? Additionally most of the complaints I see in the negative reviews seem to have been addressed and removed from the game or fixed since the game has gone free to play. Yes the game has an ingame real money shop but you start out with currency for it so if you really want a specific cosmetic block you can get it for free anyways, Play with a group of friends and you can all claim different things and you've gotten almost everything for free.\n\nPros:\n-Free to Play\n-Replay ability\n-All recipes are obtainable in game now without spending real money which was a common complaint I saw in other reviews.\n-Graphics look amazing\n-Multiplayer is set up amazing, Anyone can set up a world without fussing around with downloading server files because it's all hosted online for free.\n*Note* While I would like to continue listing things here I feel like it would just become a really long list of the games features such as Monster taming, The farming system, the Blueprints system and most of the other features in the game.\n\nCons:\n-No brightness slider, This may be a personal thing since none of my friends seemed to have any difficulties but when the game is dark it's very dark I couldn't see more than a few blocks infront of me if at all.\n-Very little character customization, you get to chose between male and female that's all for character customization.\n-There are premium items that aren't attainable to everyone, like a limited sword for people who attended Pax, As a completionist this type of thing tends to bug me but again it isn't really a con just my personal opinion.\n\nOverall I would give this game a full score 10/10 while the game isn't for everyone it is a great game to jump into with friends if you like other games of this type or have never played one but don't feel like investing this is a great way to try the style of play out, Don't think it's like the others though this game has a decently difficult armor and tools progression and a the art style is pretty nice to look at.  I would definitely recommend this game to others even if they are just looking for something to kill a weekend with.","February 28","true","40.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","16","20","4","0"

Sure the world is based in a blocky enviroment, you can mine and build with individual blocks, that is similar to minecraft, but it's also similar to every voxel-based game out there.\n\nI love the crafting system. Think of it like ARK: Survival Evolved, in which you need engrams to make the tools. You unlock upgrades by making the former item. Also, searching for materials does not get boring! It isn't hard to get the basic materials, but the ones later in the game? Yeah, those can be difficult to get to. Also, once you have a base of operations, it doesn't get repetetive, you still have to quest to get those items, whether it be 6 stone to make 48 stone rods for that stack of stairs your making, or the Feral Pigsy Fur for the Iron Sword- it doesn't get boring. (Well, the stone mining does- but that's besides the point!) Instead of making all your tools in one machine, placing all your items in one type of chest- you have different types of them. You want to make a door? Get a processor to process that wood. What was that? You wanted a bar of obsidian? Get that forge. Wait, what was that? You wanted to COOK an APPLE PIE? Get the Cooking machine for that. You need a better chest because the normal, 20 slot one isn't working for you? Get an ARC stone chest.\n\nGameplay: Now the gameplay and combat systems are alot like minecraft. It is a point N' click kind of game, no blocking (Yet), but it still retains a certain air about it that makes it original. You can't chose your game mode- it's already at the default setting- Life. Movement and all, it has a very nice flow. The animations are nice, You can run, jump- move about freely and as you wish, and best of all, you can seem badass by hopping from treetop to treetop.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are not like Minecraft. I mean sure- It's pixelated- but all games are pixelated. There's really not much to say about it, other than it has better graphics than Minecraft.\n\nOver all, I throuroghly enjoyed this game. I would recomend it to all those looking to take a break from minecraft and to refresh your senses, as I did. Oh and one more thing, just to let you guys know- I have played more than my fair share of minecraft as well... Probably over 400 hours of it. That will be all I will say on this subject, until (or if) I decide to revise this.\n\n[Unedited]","December 7, 2015","true","14.8"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","19","26","2","0"

Welp, this looks like Minecraft lol.. I've played a few Minecraft knockoffs, and this... This is not Minecraft. This is something else entirely. Yes, it's a sandbox game where you can pick blocks up and put them back down but the differences are huge.\nI started playing with buttons and quickly picked up which were the crafting menu and inventory, saw that I needed some initial resources to start crafting with. Instead of being able to craft anything in the game if you simply have the materials, you unlock newer, better recipes via crafting the first ones.. Alright, I can do this lol. It took me a good 30 hours of gameplay (mind you, I had started my own private world so I had no help) to dig down to the bottom of the world and craft the best armor and weapons. I had to traverse the globe in search of specific creatures in order to use their items to craft stuff in order to dig deeper. It is super fun figuring it out for yourself, as opposed to minecraft's 'start the game, dig some stone, build castle' it feels a lot more like an adventure and learning experience.\nThe game is unfinished, and is already stomping out Minecraft. The only thing I kinda miss is Redstone..

Mysticism mixes with technology as you use arcane artifacts to bend the world around you to your will.\n\nThat's just the aesthetic, though. The atmosphere is spot-on, from the music (that is, I'll admit, eerily similar to Minecraft's) to the guttural growl of the Miru outside your house as you hide in the light of your moss-burning torch. An eager chase after a nearby Keepa, holder of the arcstones that make such pretty little lights. The awe and shame as you accidentally light a tarpit on fire with your torch. It's all delightful, and it reminds me why I loved playing Minecraft years ago!\n\nI'll admit I'm not very far into the game at all at this point of writing.

I've tried dozens, and while a lot of them do build upon their own experiances and go their own ways in gameplay exploration, none have tackled what made minecraft so much fun to begin with.\n\nSo I've kept my eye on this title ambiently, and only recently realized it was finally open for free players. I was excited, but having known my past experiances, I wasn't overwhelmingly hopeful. Sure it looked cute, but could it scratch the itch?\n\nWell, it did. Within the first 10min of gameplay I was thoroughly impressed. The block setup is quite familiar but as far as crafting and mining goes, it actually improves upon previous title's attempts in very intiutive and creative ways. I adore the mining nodes. I adore the crafting stations and how you can build a mixed queue. I love how the combat feels a bit MMO-y but not in a terrible way. The animal and character models do seem "out of place" depending on your opinions on graphics, but they are none the less well designed, beautifully textured and wonderfully modeled and animated.\n\nIt's just a gorgerous game. And as someone who likes open world games for aesthetics, I was quite pleased with this. The trees are robust and you genuinely feel like you're in a dense forset. The other biomes, though I have yet do explore too deeply into them due to tougher mobs, are just as gorgeous.\n\nThe pacing feels a bit odd, but It's tier-based as I feel a craftlike should be. In this case, there's many different layers of underground rocks and you can only progress past certain layers if you have the correct mining tier.\n\nThere are some things that feel a bit odd, but because they seem more unfinished than anything. The pet system is really awesome and I look forward to tamed animals being coded to act as combat buddies and mounts (they are only livestock atm.) and the fact you can tame almost anything save for a handful of named special mobs, is fantastic.\n\nI'm genuinely looking forward to this title. I kind of wish it was a pay-for game, but I can understand their reasoning for micro transactions. And their micro transactions appear to be completely humane at this point in time as well, you are buying recipies for purely aesthetic building blocks, like tiles and carved stonework, as well as 3d blueprints to help you build a house if you're not the creative type.\n\nAll in all this is pretty dang solid. Eagerly looking forward to updates!\n\nps - I forgot to mention, this game is obviously heavily geared towards kids, but isn't dumbed down /at all/. Which makes me thrilled as an adult, and also thrilled that game companies catering to children are begining to understand kids aren't dumb as rocks and love challenges.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XDdrummer/recommended/280790/","XDdrummer","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XDdrummer/","165 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: I have many hours outside of Steam, as well.\n\nAlthough it looks like a Minecraft rip-off on the surface, once you start playing, you'll realize that it is its own game. Not all sandbox games with squares are trying to be Minecraft.. especially this one.\n\nThe Graphics: 7.5/10\nYes, the graphics are really nice to look at, along with the animations. The world comes alive much more than many other games, including Minecraft. However, with all that's going on - nearly everything is animated - it can get a bit laggy. Just because your PC can run games like Grand Theft Auto V at 60 fps on high graphics, does NOT mean you can run this game on high graphics - I know this firsthand. I have all my settings set to minimal. I can barely tell the difference between max and minimum graphics visually, but it does effect my FPS. Overall, really nice graphics and animations, but it needs to be optimized for minimal lag.\n\nThe UI & Controls: 9/10\nThe user interface is fantastic all around. It isn't the same bare-bones UI you'd expect in early access game (I see you over there, ARK), but is instead detailed and elegant. It could use some improvements, sure, but for early access, the UI is really nice and self-explanatory. The controls are somewhat familiar - if you've played Minecraft, there won't be a huge learning curve. WASD and mouse buttons are the same as in Minecraft. It has more controls, actually - and it still doesn't seem overwhelming even on your first time playing.\n\nThe Gameplay: 8.5/10\nLike most sandbox games, when you load up a world, it doesn't tell you what exactly you need to do. You start off exploring, playing with the controls, and seeing what there is to offer. Eventually, as you explore, you'll find a crafting table. Once you find that, it becomes self explanatory - find this, craft this, build this, do this.. it isn't confusing. However, don't mistake this for the game being linear. It is not linear at all - you can take your survival in many directions. Unlike many sandbox survival games, you have a single do-it-all tool that comes attatched to your character, and you simply have to upgrade it to break new types of blocks. This makes the game less confusing, but may even make it too simplistic. However, overall, the game is quite self-explanatory, but in a fun way. You won't run out of things any time soon. And if you do...\n\nThe Multiplayer: Your worlds are servers. When you create a world, it becomes public on the list of worlds - people can search for the name of your world, and (try to) join it. You can password protect the world, or make it so those who join can't edit the world, but anyone can view your world by searching the name of the world. This makes multiplayer with friends extremely easy. You simply tell them the name of the world (and password, if you set one), they search it, and they can easily join. It's fantastic. There's also a wide range of administrative tools for your world, and settings to make your experience easier or more difficult.\n\nThe Community: 10/10\nFantastic community. The devs replied to my problems within hours, and the community was equally ready and happy to help. This is not an immature community.\n\nThe problems:\nThere is no chat in the game, even if multiple people are online in the same world.\nIt requires a fairly updated graphics card - there's a good chance you'll need to do some updating of your drivers.\nIt can lag, even on great PCs... needs some optimizing.\nI'm a little worried about it becoming free-to-play at launch. I fear the microtransactions...\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\n10/10 would kill leaf creatures with a twig again.","June 19, 2015","true","2.2"," 51 of 87 people (59%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","59","51","87","18","0"

More are available to the player to use, craft with, craft, and decorate. Way more mobs and the mobs are significantly harder to take down; they also deal more damages.

Within the past few years, ever since that one day in my tech class in middle school, I have been playing Minecraft (It was 6 years ago, I was in 7th/8th grade at the time). More and more that game has been releasing updates, so many that I can't keep up with, and so many that it sort of just takes away the good old nostalgic times of spending hours upon hours a day on building, mining, and surviving. I loved that game, with all that I had of me. It's been the foundation for my most precious friendship to this day. Anyways, I have had lots and lots of experience of playing Minecraft, both with friends, alone, casually, competitively, you name it. I had loved that game. Then, one day, I am scrolling through the latest and greatest f2p games here on Steam (let's be honest, alot of em are either lazy works of disappointment, or just projects that just died out.) Well, I stumbled across this game, and I've only played about 24 hours of this msaterpiece, and yet I am more impressed and captivated than I am for Minecraft anymore. Something about this game gives me a tingling in my stomach, and with all the aspects and content this game offers, it's hard to put it down. Whether it be the looting aspect as many MMO's seem to have whenever you defeated a passive or aggressive mob, or maybe it would be the amazing feeling you get when you spend hours building something that looks amazing in your head from nothing into something, with amazing ancient technology and gear to help you along the way, or even just the simple, yet beautiful, artwork. Whatever it may be, I can honestly say that this game has brought me more satisfaction and fun than Minecraft has in quite a long time. Don't get me wrong, I love Minecraft, but the way it is now will never be the same, just nostalgic dreams drifting throughoust my mind from time to time. If you are looking for a great game to both enjoy by yourself and your friends, then I would HIGHLY recommend this great game. Even if you are new to this gamestyle, it's definitely worth checking out for even just and hour or two, or maybe more ;)","January 6","true","57.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I'm more into the exploration, mining and combat side of things rather than building although if I was I'd have gotten many many more hours out of this.\n\nIt does feel very similar to Minecraft but also feels very different. The voxel (cubes) design will obviously look extremely familiar and so will some of the gameplay elements such as farming. Although in Creativerse you can do other things such as tame animals, and not only that but mining can be a little more complicated requiring different devices in order to get deeper into the earth (mining cells, basically your laser mining pick ...who doesn't like lasers?!) and then on special blocks of ore you need to use an extractor or an advanced extractor to get a higher yield, and this can take between 20 seconds and 6 minutes per block, so get ready to defend yourself or atleast don't forget where the block is!\n\nThen you have to keep an eye on things like becoming too hot, too cold, and corruption. Once these are full you will begin to take damage! There are things in place and things you can build or do to yourself to defend against this. You can use potions, a healing beacon, mineral water or just ordinary water to cool yourself off, heal yourself, warm yourself up and to cleanse corruption.\n\nI would definitely reccommend this game, for a free to play title I got a good amount of play time out of it, although it's still pretty early in development they are adding much more (hopefully more layers to the world as endgame seems a little too easy).\n\n","January 24","true","7.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fragileteeth/recommended/280790/","fragileteeth","SamiSalami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fragileteeth/","42 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI picked up this game a few days ago and forgot about it. And then sunk my evening yesterday into it. For Minecraft players, they'll find this game familiar yet fresh and different. There are a few really minor thinga that make the play experience much nicer than Minecraft, for me. One major thing is jumping. You can jump 2 blocks straight up and you can jump across a pretty wide gap. The other thing is mining. Rather than stand there and swing your pickaxe like a fool, you simply place the gatherer, and walk away. Then when you come back when it's finished, and your ores are sitting there all nice waiting for you. Eating also isn't a necessity. Which I know will be a point of contention for some, but rather it's there to boost your play experience rather than hinder it. There are some other things, like falling damage, that are equally convenient but you won't notice so much.\n\nThere are also features you may notice from many popular Minecraft full mods. The death beacon is a major one where you can collect your items you dropped on death (but your quick bar handily remains on your person!). Equally convenient and awesome are personal and craftable teleporters. You can set teleporters to travel to eachother, and players in your world can travel directly to your person teleporter. This is especially handy when playing with a friend and you're able to explore without a concern in the world about getting lost. There's also many different overworld mobs with different varieties for biomes. And dozens of items to pick up off the ground you'll think you're chasing butterflies in Skyrim.\n\nThat said, there are a handful of things I find cumbersome coming from the super flexibile Minecraft background. First and foremost is recipe progression. Personally, I don't like having to 'find' recpies only after creating the items that are lower than it. Even though I can't create it, I like to see where I'm headded for eventually (a la Don't Starve). Also having to refine every item at the processor is a bit of a drag. It makes it so that your cave dives eventually have to turn back home or hole up and take a long pause while you refine the stone you need for more gatherers.\n\nI also found combat and taming to be quite clunky. I may not be getting the full grasp on how it plays properly but from what I gathered, you're pretty much guaranteed to take damage. The combat system heavily focuses on your gear rather than your ability to kite and hit. Taming falls on the same spectrum: while you're ringing your bell it seems like you just stand there and take damage. There are a few non-obvious ways to avoid taking damage, but I'd personally like to see it play a bit more 'obviously'.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It's a slightly different, yet familiar, take on the sandbox construction/survival genre and I think plays really well. It's a smooth experience that does a pretty great job of guiding newbies into it through individual tasks, though a wiki will still always be your best friend. It's a great early access game with a few minor hiccups (most of the stuff I noticed is graphical glitches) but doesn't interfere with your play experience.","May 23","true","7.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

To be honest when I first seen this game (and I know i'm not the only one) I thought this was gonna be another Minecraft clone but after looking more into it and playing the game it really is a different experience overall (other than it being blocky of course), like the glove with the mining cells that's used for block placing/breaking rather than individual tools, the different types of mobs with their own unique type of attacks (wait until you meet The Thing :3), unlockable and hidden recipes for you to find, a touchstone that you can use to set your spawnpoint which i'm very glad exists considering I can get lost way too easy, not to mention you can also craft teleporters for easy travel around the world once you set them up, and I also love how easy it is to setup a server as well, literally all you have to do is just start up a world and there's your server (Passwords for worlds are optional). Those are just a few out of the many things that I love about this game.\n\nNow yes as one would expect with it being in Early Access there are some annoying bugs, like crouching not always working when moving and you end up falling off, getting stuck in stairs or roof blocks, and one rather funny bug is launching yourself forward or backward with doors if you time it just right while running into it while trying to open then quickly close it, but I can live with that as it seems like the bugs are very few in numbers that I can remember off the top of my head.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game and this is just in Early Access too (currently on R14), who knows what will come of the game once the full release is out whenever that may be which i'm looking forward to. :)","April 28, 2015","true","700.5"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","25","42","0","0"

The better version of Minecraft!\n\nCreativerse is a free survival or building simulator (if thats what you can call it) and sky-rockets above Minecraft in a lot of ways.\n\nNow, before readers rush to hasty judgement, I am NOT saying Minecraft is bad. Minecraft was the spotlight of survival. But answer this: Is Minecraft really worth $20?\nCreativerse is free, I'm not going to put graphics into this review because who cares about graphcs? But in creativerse, it has better animation than Minecraft.\n\n\n-Decent animations! Enemies attack you, animals sleep, you actually look like you're putting some weight in swigning your sword\n-Same building style as Minecraft.\n-The world ADAPTS to your decisions! Thats right, the world will adapt to you! I won't spoil too much of it.\n-TECHNOLOGY! You don't have the same technoligical freedom Minecraft has (redstone) but Creativerse has teleporters, ark technology, and other machines. You alsohave bombs and TNT.\n-Multitude of enemies, the world adapts to you, which means it will introduce new enemies, as well as new enemies in different biomes.\n-Tamable animals. Taming animals may be a challenge, but you can tame animals as either companions or livestock, you don't KILL tamed animals, you feed them and collect their items.\n-There is no hunger or thirst meter, there is food though.\n-You cannot naturally regenerate health, you need potions or standing in w**** to restore health, this is NOT a problem, it offers a challenge.\n\nI have read several negative reviews, and yes, there is a coin shop... but I don't honestly see how this is a problem. The game needs to have support and it's not a competetive game, yes, extrating ores such as iron, coal, diamond, and obsidian does take a while. But thats why you UPGRADE YOUR TECHNOLOGY to reduce the time and obtain more ores. And also: It only takes about 2 minutes to get coal from a normal extractor. I believe the negative reviews may have overexaggerated when they said it takes "forever" for 2 minutes.\nAnd even then, the coin shop doesn't offer weapon or armour upgrades, it only offers blueprints for buildings such as castles...

Bought the game and can't connect to server at all. Aparently some North American client has this bug. I did everything sugested on their known bugs page and no joy. I paid for it and can't use it. Now, I can't give it a good recommendation, can't I? Too bad...looked neat on the screenshots.\n\nUpdate: Although the support section was kind enough to spend a couple of hours with me, the game still won't connect to the server.

This game will put Minecraft at a not-so-close second.\n\nFirst off, let me start by pointing out the developers are very active. The game seems to be moving quickly through the development cycle and there is already a LOT to do. I can see they're just getting started, and I cannot wait until even more things are added.\n\nThe art style in this game is phenomenal. There were a lot of great details thought out throughout the character art and the aesthetic of the environment. Not only is the entirety of the game breakable (i.e. Minecraft) but it's just beautiful to look at.\n\nThe one thing I love most: it's difficult. Expect to go through a few worlds of just utterly failing before you get the hang of it. Don't give up; it's worth it. The fact you have to work harder for results is so much more gratifying than the instant reward of playing Minecraft. You HAVE to find shelter if you want to survive; these critters involve a fair amount of skill to kill.\n\nI've played quite a few voxel games, and other than Ace of Spades (the original), they all kinda suck. Oort was a great idea but it has since been abandoned. This is the answer to the calling for a better voxel game. Crafting is pretty unique for its genre, but it makes sense and proposes a challenge that doesn't seem over the top. You don't have to travel too far to find what you need, but obtaining it may very well be a challenge.\n\nOne downside to Creativerse is that it isn't very Steam-coupled. Perhaps they intend to release this through other channels but to be honest they shouldn't. Games through steam that also house their own login/authentication system usually ♥♥♥♥ gamers off and cause fragmentation of stats. Please, keep it coupled, at least for users playing through steam.\n\nKeep an open mind with this one if you're skeptical. It's worth the money and honestly they'd probably do well to keep it pay-to-play. $20 might be a bit steep but there is an obvious amount of love that has been poured into this game. 5/5, will continue playing for a long time. It has definitely replaced Minecraft in my eyes.","September 24, 2015","true","25.5"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","2"

I'd say it's more like Starbound, whether it's in the greater variety of enemies, the crafting system, or the unbelievably awesome atmosphere it creates with the well placed music and sound cues. The difficulty curve is just sublime, in particular - it'll never force you into an area you're not ready for, and new enemies are just the right level of toughness for each layer.\n\nThe only thing I find "wrong" with it is the movement, but only the momentum issues with stopping and starting, and the fact that you just tumble down a cliff even when you're not holding a movement key, but honestly, these actually just add to the realistic quality of the game.\n\nAll in all, it's just brilliant, and I find myself always turning to it when I get bored of TF2 or PAYDAY 2 for a while.","September 12, 2015","true","14.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

This is a legit, quality product, and you have a very solid chance of enjoying it.\n\nLooks great, runs nice, plays great. This game is a winner.\n\nBlueprints are amazing..... Even those of us, who couldn't build a BOX, like me, can build a CASTLE, thanks to Blue Prints.\n\nBy Day 3, I had an ENOURMOUS Castle, nearly complete, that my girls and I, worked on together, using a Blueprint. Each of us, played on our own machine, and it worked perfectly. It took a labor of love, but, we got it done, and always knew what we needed to do, and how.\n\nYOUR WORLD IS IN THE CLOUD, so anyone you allow to access it, can access it, even when your not on. This fact, is vert important. Your world becomes a place that feels real. Where you can drop in, and discover things that your friends worked on, while you were away, or, JOIN THEM at any time. It's very very cool, and required NO SETUP.","December 28, 2015","true","155.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The systems, while some are fundamentally the same as the usual suspects, have flair to them that tell you "we're not a clone but a member of the genre."\n\nFirst, let's get it out of the way... the way you 'mine' blocks is awesome! Who doesn't want a gravity gauntlet?\n\nMe and my son started with the 'janky house'... building from the blueprint, slowly gathering supplies and learning the basic recipes. We didn't do a whole lot of digging, just enjoyed the scenery and got use to the mechanics. This self-imposed tutorial helped us shake off the MC mindset and get primed for whatever else CV had in store for us.\n\nFrom there I decided I'd start my own little slice of heaven. I made it public and unlocked... a brave move for a beginner. After about 8 hours of carving my house/mine shaft out of a riverside canyon, my first random visitor popped in. He looked around, made me really nervous (especially because I had to go to work... It felt like leaving a stranger in your house...). He must not have been too impressed, as he left without doing anything and only stole some leather before placing his touchstone and going about his business. I've since edited the world to force visitors to keep their hands to themselves.. and removed his foothold, but the concept really enticed me. This is the good stuff. Having people over to help you build, help you fight, help you shape the huge worlds you've spawned. A truly exciting multiplayer experience.\n\nI'm now well on my way to unlocking the secrets that are buried deep in Creativerse. I have my diamond mining cell and some decent armor, I'm using teleporters and freezing tar. I don't exactly know what I'm working towards, but the journey is fresh and I'm racing to get there.\n\nFor a F2P game, it's amazing. Anyone that likes to build or discover will love the work the devs have put in here. If you've been looking for a new way to waste a couple hundred, or thousand or hours, you've found it. Check out the discussions section for things I think should be added.. For as awesome as the game is, it has sooo much more potential!","December 7, 2015","true","767.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

With that in mind and this game being F2P, it definitely exceeded my expectations.\n\nBesides it freezing on me a couple of times and all your characters being the same if you do multiplayer, creepily staring at each other and glitching in strange ways if you compare them, the game is great (no, seriously). Plus, it looks like a game that will have character customization in the future. Right? Right?\n\nThe number of items and vast expanses you can find and explore are overwhelming... in a good way! There's always many things you can do--grind or don't grind. The witty comments and good art for every item make it worth it, anyway. As of now, I've only found maybe three biomes other than the starting biome and I'm still scuttling around trying to bohog all the resources that pop up in each place. And now I'm going on the hunt for the special holiday items...\n\nIt's a sandbox game, so of course it comes with a lot of freedom and I like that. Freedom. I do suggest that it needs a map that expands as you explore, but the lack of a map makes it more thrilling (unless you're a nomad, because then you won't care). It also makes the teleporters (and the beacons for that matter) have a use beyond reducing travel time.\n\nCreativerse is a great way to pass the time. Even if that means throwing water on top of a mountain until the amount of ice is so much that it slides you down the mountain. Ding! Dinner's ready. Then your friend shows up in the world the next day to realize the nearby mountain has an immense icecap. Forever a memorial of your hunger.\n\nI also took a peek at some negative reviews. (Someone noted that negative reviews were being "censored" because of the helpful rating, but negative reviews are very helpful when well written and their helpful ratings aren't much different from the positive reviews... Plus, it's not censorship by steam if we're the ones voting.) One thing I noticed is the top ones are from over a year ago. But another thing I noticed is people comparing it to Minecraft and mostly complaining about waiting-times.\n\nTo that, I leave you with this, because it has always confused me:\n\nWhen building a table, can you throw the raw materials on the ground and have the parts magically shape and form together? Does this process take a simple five minutes?\n\nCan you toss a seed onto the ground and be instantly blown away by its growth? Does it harvest itself?\n\nDo you have nothing else to do in your life but watch the table build itself or the plant grow?\n\nLike I said, this game lets you do more. So do more!","December 19, 2015","true","30.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I tried it during the free week, and from what I've read about it, it was a Minecraft clone with paying Early Access that would be released later as a free-to-play game with cash shop.\n\nStarting with the cons :\n\nAfter some hours I found out about the waiting game : want to convert some blocks into crafting materials ? You have to wait for a "processor" to do it. Want to extract coal, obsidian and iron ? You have to wait. And the more precious the material is, the longer you wait.\n\nAlso, you need to craft specific mining cells to gather blocks, one for each "level" ( stone, fossil, lava, etc. ), and each cell only permits you to gather a few hundreds blocks maybe, so you need to craft a new one every 2 minutes; And gathering the materials to craft those cells can be really boring, especially the flowers that grow on trees ( but there is an exploit you can use to get tons of them, even the devs suggest that you use it )...\n\nAll of this just screams "we're gonna make you pay to wait less, like any stupid facebook game", doesn't it ?\n\nSomething baffling too is that there is no portable light, so you have to waste a lot of ressources crafting torches or lanterns, or waste your time picking them up to place them elsewhere. And as their radius is REALLY small, you'll need hundreds of them...\n\nThere is also this stupid "super jump bug" people have been complaining since 2014. basically, sometimes when you jump your character will jump 50m high or more, and of course when you hit the ground again, you die, losing all your inventory...\n\nLast thing, it's about the monsters. They are EVERYWHERE ! You just can't dig anywhere without stumbling into a cave full of mobs. It's not really a problem in itself, the real problem is the sound : you will hear those monsters through the walls all the time, because no matter where you try to build your house, there will be a cave nearby. I've spend hours filling a entire cave with blocks to keep monsters from spawning under my castle, so I wouldn't have to hear them.\n\nNow the pros, and why I finally bought the game and recommend it :\n\nWell first, the devs put it for free for a week, so they are pretty confident with their product and know it's good.\n\nAfter the bad first impression with the waiting game, I kept playing, more and more. And the game itself is good. I never played Minecraft so I can't compare, but I played Terraria and Starbound, and I really prefer Creativerse.\n\nSure you have to wait to craft materials, but you just need to craft several crafting stations to speed up the process. Sure you need to wait to gather ore, but you can just put an extractor on the node and keep digging around, then come back later to gather the ore. In the end it's no big deal, if it stays that way.\n\nIt's still EA but the game feels finished, except for some bugs and poor performances most of the time ( don't know if it's a GPU, CPU or server lag issue, but I don't think it's because of my PC, I have a gtx970 and an i7 ).\n\nThere are really nice features, one of my favorite being "TNT digging", and you can also craft a device that just removes a big square chunck of blocks, it's really quick. You can also craft teleporters and configure them with "codes" by putting 3 objects to create the code; So let's say a TP has 3 stone blocks as code, and you build another TP, you put three stone blocks as destination and BAM, you're teleported to the first one. So you can really create a whole network of TP to fast travel anywhere, like, one TP on a beach to gather seashells, another one in the snow if you need snow or ice, etc.\n\nExploration is really nice, the world is big and full of different biomes. Caves can be really huge and take hours to explore, the atmosphere is really well done. Too bad we need so much torches to light up the path, because it's mostly pitch black, with ony some colored fog to highlight the cave at a distance.\n\nObjects and monsters design are nice too, and most textures are pretty good. However I find the building materials textures a bit ugly most of the time and it's hard to build something that looks good. I thought building an obsidian temple would look good, but in the end it's just a big, blocky, blue house...\n\nAlso the character can rust fast and jump high, controls are good too, and for once the UI and inventory are pretty effective ( compared to Terraria which was a nightmare to play ).\n\nAll this makes a rather enjoyable experience, so if you're looking for an almost finsihed game, just buy it. Or wait for it to be free to play and possibly destroyed by a sh*tty buisness model ( hope it won't be though ).","October 22, 2015","true","64.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Yes, it doesn't have as much content as Terraria, and never will, to be honest. But now it's blended the 2 most popular sandboxes, along with content not found in either, such as a tutorial.

It's reminicent of minecraft just with better graphics and a different crafting set up. While a few issue do arise with this game such as the night monsters being able to just phase through walls to get into my home and with the night monsters being extremely OP for beginners. However the good strongly out weighs the bad if you just make a pillar at night you can easily hide from the monsters or if you sleep....i think i haven't had a chance to place down a bed yet so i have yet to figure it out. Also when i made the extracter i couldn't place it in to my make shift home so i'm not sure what to do with it.

Just finished gathering all those blocks and then you fall off a cliff, no problem, you just have to find your way back and you've not lost all those items.\n- there's loads of other things, but I don't want to spoil too much.\n\nIt's difficult to talk about what I don't like as things may change and bugs will be probably be fixed, so I'll just say that as long as there are more of the same in future updates, then I'll continue to be happy.\n\n\n\n","October 19, 2015","true","52.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But even at this early stage its so much more fun.  There are way too many things to list but I'll cover a few of the basics.\nCrafting is very intuitive, their unlockable recipes are a creat idea.  No more searching Wiki's for ideas, once they are unlocked, you can see what you need to craft them.\nThe Graphics are beautiful, especially the creatures.  A little piece of me dies, everytime I kill a Leafi.  :(\nMIning is no longer such a chore.  Find some ore, set up an extractor, come back later and collect your goodies.\nExploration is easy.  Set up a teleportation stone in your home base and never get lost again.  Build more teleporters as you traverse the globe.  Set up new bases in different Bio's and hop to them quickly and safely.\n\nIf you liked Minecraft, then buy this game.

And let me tell you, it was insanely...\n\nFUN!\n\nI like the way where you have to work towards getting a certain thing crafted. Such as the bungalow walls. It makes it to where you can't just search it up and then be done with it. It adds a certain level of challenge to the game where you can't just make whatever you want in one hour, like in Minecraft, or Terraria. No, no, in this game, it'll take you DAYS to complete a blueprint you get from the shop.\n\nWould I reccomend it? Definitely. You can just wait for it to be free to play for good, like I probably will due to not having much money (most of my games are gifts), or you can buy it now to support the devs. Either way, you'll be able to play a really cool game with TONS of potential.","October 26, 2015","true","23.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've never played Minecraft before, which I suppose is the obvious comparison, so I cannot comment on how alike they are. I will say that this game visually appears similar. You gather resources, craft items, farm, fight/tame creatures, and obviously build stuff. Your basic sandbox goals. The degradation of mining utensils/weapons/armor is rather frustrating, but realistic I suppose. As with all free-to-play games (they are going f2p soon), there is a transaction store. However, that said, it only consists of pay-only building blocks and things called Blueprints (basically in-game building tutorials for certain structures). I quite fancy the blueprints actually, putting one together feels like a paint-by-number or something. Pretty much, even without paying, you can get where you want to be. The only exception would be if you really really wanted some block in the store for your build. I highly recommend this game if you like sandbox construction fun. Just make sure you protect your world from trolls (which is easy to do by checking the forums). 9/10","October 27, 2015","true","134.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Going out to explore is quite fun. Many different biomes, huge trees, canyons, caves, mountains, rivers, lava pools and jungles make exploration a real treat. Textures look quite good as well. Unlike some other people, I don't find collecting resources grindy.\n\nBut there are still lots of areas to improve. But I see that the game got better just in few weeks. The worst thing that bugs me is the constant need to jump. Also I would love to have corner blocks. But it seems wedges for roofs are added recently, so they might be in the development queue. Also it really bothers me that easiest way of filling your health is to suicide. Within 20 or so hours, I got best mining cell, visited every biome and built a house. So it doesn't take too long to see what the game offers. It would be nice to have some sort of additional progression. But you could easily go a head and spend your time building. After a while monsters becomes quite easy to handle. Also game could be much better if there were NPC's moving to the houses. Even if they won't do anything, it will definitely add some flavour.\n\nOverall: 7/10 Would die to fill my health again.","October 28, 2015","true","63.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You progress through the game by collecting stuff either by killing monsters or opening treasure chests that appear from time to time. There are mobs, but if you die you just go back to your teleport pad that you place (or should place) and that you start with.  You can go back and get the stuff from your inventory (Quick bar stays) and a Death Stone (permanent reminder of your embarrassment, which I proudly have 3 in my house). You also unlock more recipes when you craft ♥♥♥♥. This game is also small in size, definitely worth a try. Overall, a very good game so far, can't wait to see what they add nex.t","November 14, 2015","true","33.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Like it more than Minecraft. I love the possibility of jumping 2 blocks instead of 1, blueprints are fantastic idea and are nicely done, minions/enemies are cute but also scary when encountering them for the first time (especially The Thing) . Travelling using teleports is fantastic. No need to run for hours if you dont want to. You can play with friends right away on your own server that the games creates for you. Many small little things that makes the game different and better than other ones in this genre. And the dev team is releasing new content often, thats huge plus.

I mean that in a very positive way, if played right this could easily be the next thing. I'm just worried about the ability to mod it seeing as it mainly seems to be online. Minecraft vanilla has a lot to play with but what really made the game what it is, is the mods, so I really hope to see large amounts of modding happening with this game in the future.\n\nAs it is, if you like Minecraft even just a bit, good chance you'll like this.

I loved the first 15 hours of gameplay.  The problem is that in that 15 hours you can pretty much complete EVERYTHING the game offers.  You can go from wielding a wooden stick, to the best weapon/gear in the game with relative easy.  That wouldn't normally be an issue, if there was some reason to get those great items.  But there isn't.  There are no world bosses to prepare for... no dungeons to get stronger for... no Elite monsters to defend for.\n\nThe enemy variety is terrible.  Each biome may have 1 or 2 unique enemies... but most of the enemies are just recolored skins of enemies from other biomes.  You WANT to explore the absolutely huge world, but feel like it would be a waste because, with the exception of some cool randomly generated terrains, there is nothing new or exciting around the corner.  You can travel to the other side of the world, and the caves and mining nodes are the exact same as the ones in the biomes near your base.  There is simply no reason to venture off.\n\nNow, for the building aspect of this game... it's great.  If you want to come in, and just build huge structures and houses or whatever... you have all the tools to do so.  It's fun, and there is a decent variety of materials.\n\nThe UI is reasonable, and you don't feel like it holds you back.  The one area of absolute insanity on the part of the developers is the teleporters.  You can place "beacons" around the world that you can teleport to.  Now, a normal person would think that in order to teleport to a location, you click an item, select the location you want to teleport to, then POOF!  But nope, not this game.  Here, you have to place the teleporter, and then give it a code name which you create out of building materials.  Any time you want to teleport to that location, you have to input the building materials which you code named the teleporter.  Sound confusing?  It is.\n\nWhy is that a problem?  Because the game doesn't keep track of ANY of this for you.  You can have 20 teleporters across the world, and you are expected to remember the unique code combinations for all of them.  You know what that means?  I have about 17 teleporters out in the world that I will never visit again because I can't remember the code combination.  In order to make any of this function, you would need to keep a real life pen and paper list of all of your teleporters and codes.  That is such an overly complicated system.\n\nThis game has been in "Early Access" for two years now.  It boggles my mind that the game was playable two years ago... and yet still only has the current level of depth to it.  You would think there would be more to do in the game if it has been in production for 3+ years.\n\nTL;DR  - Fun for the first 15 hours or so.  Then it's just a build-a-block game offering no progression for your character.","June 5","false","38.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

I was wrong. Creativerse might take place in a world made of cubes, but the graphics, gameplay, and overall feel of the game is very different. From a graphical standpoint Creativerse uses higher res textures than the pixel look of Minecraft, and even includes monsters, characters, and items that are entirely a different style from the cube based world, including the playable characters. All of the worlds in Creativerse are multiplayer. You can join and be joined by friends and strangers depending on the world and settings.\n\nCreativerse feels like a sandbox game that builds of of concepts other sandbox games has, but still manages to feel all its own. I recommend it to anyone looking for a free to play sandbox game to try. Creativerse is free on Steam now so feel free to jump in and explore, play and do whatever in Createverse.","November 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I just started playing Creativerse and have been almost instantaniously gripped to it. It's an awesome game to play with friends. Seeing as Creativerse is still in "Early Access" I am looking forward to what the creators have in stock for the players. There is always something that draws you and makes you want to keep playing. The feeling of killing a monster you haven't encountered before and seeing what it drops is one that I don't really see in other games. This game is unique and is highly commendable. It deserves to start off with a bang. I honestly am very excited and have great anticipation for the future of Creativerse. I strongly recommend getting it. Props to the creators. I will leave the rest for you as the reader to figure out yourself whether this is the game for you or not.

There are a few microtransactions but they are just simple cosmetic blocks and some blueprints for people that are not really interested in creating builds themselves(which does not make a lot of sense considering that at least half the game is about building).\n\nAs an avid sandbox fan, including years spent playing that other big block building game and many other sandbox/simulation games, I have waded through the trash pile of clones and wannabes for a long time, hoping to find viable alternatives... I found that with Creativerse!\n\nThis game is different enough to make it stand out.  The graphics are superb, gameplay is smooth, mechanics are intuitive, crafting is simple and progression based.  You can make progression easy on yourself by making use of many mechanics for easier mob killing, or skip all of that and dive in with nothing but the clothes on your back and a wooden stick for protection.\n\nThe pet taming system is great and the animations are cute and smooth... well done!\n\nPlaying with your friends is super easy and quick to set up.\n\nThe only negatives are the little early access bugs that sometimes annoy but nothing is game breaking or outside of acceptable EA norms... I have experienced many more frustrating bugs with finished games than are present in this already very polished game.\n\nI would love to see more mobs, machines and blocks of course, but no matter how many they implement, I am sure everyone will always welcome more of those things.\n\n","April 6","true","170.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals are pretty darn good for a voxel, minecraft type world.   In terms of gameplay this starts off rather fun and interesting.  A lot of biomes to explore and find.  Building is intuitive for the most part.  The block rotation took a while to figure out and the method of spinning the blocks around is actually maddening.  If they had made it so holding down R locks your hud and only spun the block instead of your character as well, this would've been a lot easier.  Beyond that, the game sorta falls flat after a few weeks because of limited building capabilities.  One you get to the lowest levels of the map (corruption) and farm up a bunch of those materials and collect all the animals and things you want, there isn't much else to do but build.  And that can be gratifying for a while.  i enjoyed building little farms, collecting a bunch of animals and plant from different biomes, making a refillable refridgerator and lava producer, mob spawners and what not.  Bult some cool buildings and a boat and a bunch of other stuff, but after a while you hit a wall.  The types of blocks are not even filled out - for example you can make chairs and tables with wood - stone - obsidian - iron - diamond - lumite - the full material progression.  But then something like barred windows only goes up to stone.... Sorta weird.  Other things are like being able to make lumite walls but no stairs, roofs, or floors.  So, making high end buildings that are unified in theme is basically impossible at this point.   In addition, while this does have animal taming, block rotating, and a few other mechanics mine craft doesn't, it is dwarfed by minecraft's other content - There are no AI peeps, there is nothing like switches or rail tracks, etc. to give this game a lot of high end, end-game content to keep you building for years like the minecraft folks have.  There are no end-game boss mods other than this one Rockzilla thing you can spawn in.  And unlike in other games, your tamed mobs become basically farm animals.  Nothing fights for you.  No mounts.  They kinda just sit around.\n\nAnyway, fun to take for a spin, particularly if you never got into minecraft and this is your first foray into something like this.  If it weren't free, I woulda probably said it was a waste of time and money.","March 24","true","59.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At first, I thought it was just a generic mix of Minecraft and Terarria, or possibley a rip-off of Trove or Cube World, but it was something new.  The game starts you off holding your hand, but then drops you off, letting you do whatever you want-  that is untill you realize that the game's combat system sucks.  Combat from the begining to the end  consists of you and the enemy wailing on eachother untill somebody falls over.  You are expected to be physicly stronger than your enemy, not smarter.  You can't even avoid and attack once you initiate combat; the enemy's attacks just go on a timer.  It woulden't be such a big problem if combat was not such a big part of the game, but it is.  That is the number one issue with this game that games like Cube World and Terarria or even Minecraft do much better.  Also, the first few days, all enemys reck house and you have NO chance of killing them.  Apart from that, the building, exploring, and FANTASTIC multiplayer system works very well, with random treasure chests and a large ammount of areas to explore.  They nailed the underground caves and different mining system, as well as crafting, which is on a timer. The game also looks great for an early access and free game being on steam for only a few days.  I give this game a 8/10 for the faulty combat, and I hope they fix this issue in the future.","June 3","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

From earning my way to newer and better recipes to actually having to go above ground for some materials, it's kept me hooked. I also like the free servers and that you can set your world to just people you want to have in it--via password. I hope the free servers stick around and that when it goes to F2P the microtransactions don't hinder actual gameplay. This is a great game now and can only keep going I think.

So after a few hours of gameplay I can state the followings:\n1. The game is under development, and it needs patches here and there.\n2. The controlls in the game are simple, the movements and actions are smooth, the PvE combat is acceptable.\n3. I love the idea behind the game: every map is a multiplayer server too (as long as it works its awesome!)\n4. Truly free gameplay money is only for supporting (at least now)\n5. Is an enjoyable game so far\n\nSo if you've read this far, and you like Minecraft and/or any similar game you should give this a try too!

I can see the appeal of minecraft and enjoy other builders work such as you tubers like Sl1pg8r, I can see why people are still drawn to that game for the sake that it is the orginal Voxel builder. It does however have limititation and isn't perfect and this game is by no means a rip off minecraft it takes some of the best ideas from minecraft and adds its own. I couldn't get into minecraft due to it being a little tedious in losing equipment and having to find your own way around to your house and such. The crafting was also a touch lazy as you had to find out for yourself how to craft things, this may be part of the fun in minecraft and this game may seem linear at first but for the brief couple hours i have played I can see the advantage of the system of unlocking recipes. It guides the player through it all and when they are the knowledge it allows the player to become creative without the  fidn out for yourself learning curve which minecraft leads you down. Also the graphics major plus I had to combine 2 texture packs in minecrafts to make it look how I wanted this involved me selecing block by block from them both which took some time. I liek the fact that the mobs are more challenging and that adds to this game. I enjoy watching people who can build in minecraft but I can see myself actually enjoy playing this game. As far as the business model I feel at present that have it right, minecraft has yet to go free even after all the years of play and I have played other free to play games namely planetside 2, league of legends and dota 2 so I understand transactions are needed. I feel the transactions at present don't take away any fun from the game you still get access to the basic blocks and all the game, people who want to pay can buy pre made designs or more decorative blocks I feel this is just a bonus for the more creative people and doens't destroy the game for people who don't want to buy anything.

Oh, no, Creativerse is something grand in the making.\n\nIt feels as though the creators of Minecraft listened to every whispered complaint and then, BAM, Creativerse was born. It's (almost) everything you loved about Minecraft with better grapghics, and a more laidback, sci-fi atmosphere.\n\nCreativerse gives you:\n-Bigger pet selection (every monster is tameable)\n-Pets pay out (you get items for caring for these buggers)\n-Better water graphics (Physics? Not so much...)\n-Adorable pre-teen characters (though I wish you could change their appearance. Oh well, maybe in an update.)\n-No Creepers! (huge plus for me. No random, hard-work-destroying explosions)\n-Sci-fi atmosphere (Suck-arms instead of pickaxes and glowy machinery for crafting)\n-Teleportation (makes life easy. You can recall to wherever you place your pad using the 'T' shortcut OR create a numbetr of teleporters you can step through and link together via a nifty little menu where you place items inside it to attune them to one another)\n-Easy to navigate U.I. (Very intuitive. Bonus: almost all of the items you can interact with can be renamed)\n-Dungeoning (Plenty of monsters and dark pits to wander through with a torch, though the equipment selection feels a little sparce thus far)\n-It's now FREE TO PLAY.\n-Did I mention it's free?\n\nSo, yes, it draws a lot of inspiration from Minecraft, but it's definitely not a carbon copy. Definitely worth a play. Creativerse is far from perfect, but I'm looking forward to what future updates hold.\n","December 10, 2015","true","19.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

It is absolutely FANTASTIC. I played it for about a day and a half before I decided to pay for it, and I don't even slightly regret the choice.\n\nIt's still early access, and it occasionally shows, but this game shows an extremely high level of polish that i've not seen on some games that are even fully released. The bugs that i've come across are usually small, but pretty regularly re-creatable. However the depth and breadth of the game make them easy to overlook.\n\nMy biggest problem is with the combat, honestly. It's almost always a battle of attrition, and if you survive, you tend to end up with low health. At that point it's almost better to just kill yourself somehow and run and get your things. Dying is basically a part of the game, so it's good that there's no REAL repercussions for doing so (other than having to go pick up the things in your bag). Some creatures are absurdly difficult, and dodging is almost a complete non-factor. You can, occasionally, find a good spot to dance a circle around a creature and not get hit, but it's inconsisitent.\n\nMy 2nd largest issue is the durability of some items in the game compared to the amount of materials required to craft them. The mining cells in particular come to mind. There's one of two ways to solve this as far as I can see: Either make items with durability (like mining cells) last a lot longer, or make the odd materials to make them more readily available. I'm not saying I want my stone mining cell to last me through 18 hours of playtime, but I would like to be able to find 5 red flowers without running around for 20 minutes looking at every other tree I find.\n\nIn spite of this, the game is immensely fun, and you can easily find yourself sucked into it. Digging into your mine deeper, crafting your house to look absurdly awesome, or just exploring the surprisingly vast environments, you'll find yourself readily wondering where the hours have gone. I'd definitely give this game a 9/10, because it's technically not even finished yet. You should definitely check it out.","October 22, 2015","true","57.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Not only that, but they just made the game free, so there's really no reason you shouldn't at least try this game. Before I say anything else, even though this game is blocky:\n\nTHIS GAME IS NOT A RIP-OFF OF MINECRAFT\n\nSure, it looks similar, but many games share the same concept. That's why we have genres of games. If a survival game is blocky, that doesn't mean it copied minecraft.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, we can move on to the true review. This game is amazing, and I could play it for several hours a day. There's always a place to explore or structure to be built. The graphics are impressive, and the animations and models are great. In detail, here are my personal pros and cons of Creativerse:\n\nPROS:\n-Great graphics and models\n-Good framerate\n-Tons of biomes and areas to explore\n-Lots of unique enemies and items\n-Tons of decorative blocks and furniture to suit all your building needs\n\nCONS:\n-Fighting mechanics could use improvement\n-Block lag (blocks may take a second to appear after placing them)\n-Steep difficulty curve\n-Extreme item rarity (tourmaline)\n\nMost of the cons are not horrible and will most likely be changed. Overall I think this game is superb, and it's free.

A friend bought this for me after telling me about it and I was a bit iffy on the idea of another sandbox game similar to Minecraft. But, there is a lot of differnces between the two games.\n\nThe structure of the game itself gives a whole new feel if you are use to playing Minecraft. It's not as easy as chop some wood, mine some stone, then you're good to go. There is a lot of depth to just the crafting alone. While it is still fairly easy to find all the resources you need, you need a lot of them. Even after you collect them, you might need to use some tools to break it down into a different matterial. (For example, breaking vines down into twine.) Yes, you have wait times on crafting stuff. While it isn't too terribly bad, the times do get a bit longer as you start using more advanced materials such as Obsidian, Iron, and Diamonds. But in my opinion, it adds more to the game because now you have to wait 5 minutes to advance and in that time, you could go out and collect more resources or even go spelunking.\n\nThe creatures in the game is definitely unique. While some do remind me of creatures from Jak and Daxter (the night Pigsy's and night Leafi's), they still have a unique vibe to them. And they of course vary in difficulty. While a few of them have unique skills such as blinding you for a short time or spinning to do a lot of damage, there isn't a lot to worry about as long as you keep some distance.\n\nAlso, there is furniture. And to be honest, it actually looks pretty nice. There is also a lot of ways to customize and build your own house and make it stand out from your friends. You have different types of carpet, walls, and even slanted roof planks you can craft. You even have different colored lamps. You could use them like my friend does and make each room different colors. Though the blue sometimes confuses me because I never know if it is dark out or not. But it still looks really nice. Much like a room with a bunch of black lights.\n\nTo add on to the crafting idea to the game, you do not start off with being able to craft everything in the game. You have to work your way up and find the recipes. While some of them are scattered in chests around the world, you usually unlock new ones after you craft something else. Like weapons for instance. After you craft a wood sword, you unlock the crafting recipe for a stone sword. Which means you have to work to find better things, meaning you actually have a goal to work towards.\n\nWhile there is still some bugs in the game with it being early access, it still runs fairly smooth and it's easy to play with friends. No port forwarding or setting up custom servers. Simply create a world and set a password so your friends can join up. Even when you are offline, they can still join the world and continue which to me, is pretty awesome. I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft or sandbox games in general.

The game has its own way of playing and is honestly a little tougher. The enemies are creative, but I found that the fighting them was fairly annoying due to the fact no matter how accurate you are, you dont always hit them, and they will always hit you when your close. There is a ridiculous amount of things you can use to build, and even has its own system where it shows you how to build a particular building. The teleporters are extremely useful, there will be no losing your home with them. I really wish they would add a map so I could actually navigate a little better.\n\nOverall, its on par with minecraft, and is its own game with a ton of additions and differences that seperate it from minecraft.

It's rather overwhelming, and quite time consuming)\n- Interface needs improvement(As for now, you have to browse huge lists just to find that one thing you want to make. And the further you go, the bigger the lists become. Seriously needs a few QoL improvements there)\n- Monster AI is quite derpy, sometimes ignoring people completely\n- Once you got your basic set, the game isn't very challenging anymore(unlike items, it doesn't feel there are different many tiers of monsters out there(... yet?))\n- Standard occasional bugs(no major crashing yet, just a few silly bugs like being stuck in the ceiling after jumping on the bed x.x)(+ you can jump on the bed)\n- FPS drops a little when venturing underground(Nothing major, but slower comps might notice it)\n\nAs it is now, It's the typical Early Access game. It's playable, it's enjoyable, and it has great potential. There has been a lot of thought put into the game, and I appreciate it. The game isn't there yet, hence the EA status.

Most people say it just looks like minecraft, so theyd rather go play minecraft. WRONG. Sure it has taken a bit of inspiration from games like minecraft, but the game itself is nowhere near, the game has much to offer such as taming monsters, animals, throwing goo at your friends, mining, building, and so much more! It has a full on create-a-server with friend able to join you, descriptions and just flat out awesomeness! I have already created 4 different worlds just because its that fun!\n\nA few things though....\n\nThere is no main purpose to the game, nothing to lead up to. Its just a upgrade and have fun game. (Not saying that it is bad but it could be better)\n\nMaybe as a suggestion add a Main Boss or atleast a few Mini bosses to have a goal of defeating, The "Thing"(Hardest mob i have found) Is not much of a challenge when you can get it suck, tame it and just dismiss it.

I was genuinely not expecting a good experience due to past bad lucks with free-to-play-minecraftish-sandbox of the style, but Creativerse stunned me by being IT'S OWN GAME, and not just a mincecraft clone. Despite the lack of blocking during combat, and the need of more variation in biomes and monsters (simply have two or three models for each monsters with texture variants would help.), the principle behind it all is amazingly well executed.\n\nUp to now, one of the most robust early access indie games I've got to play in a long time.\n\nEDIT:\nWhile I still give this a thumbs up, the lack of frequent and robust updates drove me off.

After the first few hours of playtime, I realised that I was hooked.  My family and I have always loved playing minecraft together and this is everything we loved about that game and then some.  We can create, we can fight, we can BLOW THINGS UP!  It allows each of us to play in our own style.  The amazing part is that this is still being tweaked and improved upon to add even more incredible things.  There are only two things that I can see on the negative side so far and those are:\n1. There is no offline gameplay\n2.  Characters are not modable (but you do get  a choice between being a boy or a girl)\nThe fact that these are the only things that I and my family can find that are negative, says a lot.  In the future, these things could also change.  We will be playing this game for a long time to come so hopefully we will see it come about.

I had no desire to play it until my friend finally convinced me to, and I'm glad I did try it.\n\nDespite the looks, this game really has nothing in common with Minecraft besides the blocky graphics, which is a common look in many games nowadays. In every other aspect this game has more similarities with Trove and Terraria, and is really fun to play. The game is simple, but it challenges you, and you won't want to stop playing it.\n\nThe main issue with this game, is that the population of creatures trying to kill you is far too high and you do less damage than them, and essentially are weaker than them, which isn't so much of a bad thing, but since advancing in the game requires killing a lot of the same animals over and over again, it sometimes feels a bit repetitive. In this way, it is much like Trove.\n\nOverall, it's a fine game and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who was considering giving it a shot.","February 17","true","5.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is just like minecraft but with better graphics.  I have never played minecraft because I don\'t want to pay $10 out right for lame graphics, so I can\'t say what gameplay it has that is different but it is the same idea.  The developers are great.  The game has micro transaction but not for everything, in fact since I have started playing they made some things which cost money free.  You can still use coins to buy stuff but the blueprints can now be bought with mats.  That is a nice feature.  I don\'t mind giving a company my money in micro transactions but most games make it impossible to get items without paying.  Not only that but what you do pay for is a good price.  Even without paying for anything there is still tons to explore and build in this game.  The ability to create a pvp or non pvp world is great too.  You can create a world where you and your friends can just build and not have to worry about any danger.  Great for artists as well!  I have seen some amazing works of art built out of blocks.  All in all it is a great game.  Fight, explore,  and build.","June 1","true","97.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

We need developers willing to retread the same ground and try different paths if we are going to see better games in the genre.\n\nBut that being said, Minecraft is very, very good.  The bar can be vaulted, but it is set high.  And Creativerse makes some very basic errors in its early game that are going to relegate it to the dustbin of time if they are not fixed.  I don't usually write "first-person experience" reviews, but I think this will speak to fans of the genre.\n\nFirst thing I noticed is that even the starter recipes require many types of raw materials.  Forget about processed materials -- even turning wood into planks requires a device I would call "second tier."  I was fortunate, I had spawned into a region that was resource rich.  I can't imagine trying to play this game after spawning into an unfriendly biome (assuming they exist -- maybe you always spawn into dense forest?).  After some gathering I crafted up a wooden sword (three raw materials) and a wood power cell (four raw materials; used for mining stone) and struck out to find a cliff to dig a shelter into.\n\nWhat I discovered next was that the stone layer is extremely thin.  Maybe ten blocks from dirt to "bedrock" which required a stone power cell (five raw materials) to mine.  A stone power cell requires coal.  I wasn't lucky enough to find coal in the vicinity of my shelter so I made some more moss torches and went looking for a nearby cave.\n\nUpon finding one I discovered that while a moss torch is sufficient to light a 3x3x3 room, it really only has a functional radius of 2 blocks out in the open.  That's not a lot of light.  I should have known, considering they only required two separate raw materials to manufacture.  Still, I figured there had to be a lot of coal not far beneath the surface and descended.\n\nI could hear a monster, but I cowboyed up and kept going anyway.  I was still in the dirt layer, and was confident I wasn't deep enough to encounter anything truly dangerous.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nSomething green and  vaguely bipedal with about a dozen eyes surged up out of the darkness right in front of my face.  I defended myself with my wooden sword, and managed to get in about 20 good hits before it did me in with its blinding flashbulb and slam attacks.  That was it for me.  I quit to menu and exited the game.\n\nI don't want to be unfair -- I realize this game is free, and in early access besides -- but the incredibly high production quality throughout suggests that the developer is not an amateur, and yet the game balance leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThe crafting system in this game is very complicated and interdependent, and therefore early game success feels like it is dependent more on luck than it should be.  To get A I need B, but if B isn't readily available I need C to go looking for it and C requires A.  That's a tough pill to swallow.\n\nIt is nice that the game abandons Minecraft's crafting grid -- while a clever way to get more mileage out of fewer materials, the grid can be very tedious and is ultimately unnecessary, as both the XBox Live and Pocket editions of the game have shown.  All things considered, though, I'm not sure the dozen kinds of raw materials required for first tier crafting in Creativerse is really a viable alternative.\n\nCombat is my least favorite part of any survival game -- I feel like most of them are better without it.  But even considering my bias, an enemy I can encounter during the day in the dirt layer should not require more than 20 hits with a crafted weapon to defeat!\n\nSo, ultimately, no, I can't recommend this game, despite its price and despite its early access status.  I hope to see it improve, but right now the early game does not inspire confidence enough to warrant toughing it out to see the late game.\n\n","February 11","false","0.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","2"

I didn't want to buy it at the first. But for some reason it felt very interesting to me, so i was like "screw it, lets give it a try".\n\nThe game man ... Its hard to explain feelings when playing this game. It doesnt really matter what ill write or what anybody will read about this game. If that person is familiar with a minecraft, he will think that this is nothing more than a bad clone for the most parts.\n\nI played minecraft. And i mean i played a lot of modded versions of mc, because playing vanilla is like playing 1/4 of minecraft. And ye its amazing game but after some time it felt like it needs something new. Like mc 2.0? I dont know what exactly i would like. It just feels so old.\n\nCreativerse looks similar to mc but what exactly do you expect from building voxel sandbox game? Dont be crazy.\nI didnt expect much when i started to play this game. And i had "mc clone" in my mind too. But from the very start i just didnt believe what i feel. Everything felt so fresh. I dont want to say "new" but "more enjoyable to me" seems like better explanation. Also i didnt get mc in my mind a single time. And for early access its already so well done. I simple love it and thats it. This game still needs a LOT of content to be made but the game is still in development and what is important, everything it already has, works so well and is fun to play with friends.\n\nThe closest comparison for me would be - this is similar like LoL to Dota.\nYe, its clone. But you still cant just say that those games are the same. Playing both feel different. And both are fun.\n\nThat is how i see it. Not a single care given about any hard-core mc fanboys. Play your game you like. Leave a game that others like. I almost didnt even buy it because of them. I am lucky that i did.\n\nThat is all i wanted to say and share with others. I wish good luck for developers to make this game awesome.\nNow i have to go back to my fort.\nMy new friend Pigsy is waiting for me. =P","February 9, 2015","true","70.1"," 161 of 323 people (50%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","50","161","323","32","3"

After playing this game for 11 hours straight I can honestly say that although aesthetically similiar to minecraft, with alot of the same gameplay elements as minecraft. It is not minecraft at all. In the time up untill writing this review I have made a multilevel portal system using the built in nameable portals, created a chest based item sorting system using the nameable chests, created a medieval thatched cottage with a sloped roof(screw you minecraft stairs) and went to the depths of hell in search of precious metals while avoiding evil pigs, anglerfish, and other pokemon-esque monsters. True it is like minecraft in some ways but that is what makes this game truely awesome. It takes elements from a good game and goes a step up and kind of to the side. Minecraft was not the first of its kind, it helped make the genre popular sure, but this could be the next step in the evolution.\n\nSome points to note:\n\n-Being in early access means things can change\n-Your paying for early access, a chance to play it before it goes free to play for everyone\n-It has few bugs, but being in alpha it has to be expected\n-It has great Mechanics so far\n-A butt load of content(11 hours in and still so much I havent seen)\n-Runs so smooth, over 60 fps on the highest settings\n-memorable gameplay\n-Fun respawn mechanic (via a telepad that you can relocate any number of times)\n-TELEPADS! You can teleport to your friends, they can teleport to you and it doesnt ever feel like your cheating.\nCons: (Not included things that go along with any alpha)\n-No mounts yet (have already been hinted at though)\n-Besides combat, few survival elements, e.i. no hunger or thirst system\n-Slight learning curve(Although very satisfying when you do figure things out)\n-lack of explosion noises(Tnt makes tiny boom)\nOtherwise I personally love this game as it stands now. I also give it 10/10\n\nEdit: Now with many more hours under my belt I am happy to report that this game is very little like minecraft. I ran into what I would equate to the Nether in minecraft, I found that I could dig deeper still. Let me tell you, there are places and things down in the depths minecraft would have nightmares about ;) still loving it 10/10\nIf you guys have positive or negitive experiences you want to share to add to this review I really want to hear them.","January 15, 2015","true","88.1"," 239 of 481 people (50%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","50","239","481","33","34"

Sure, it's another Minecraft type game, but so what? That's a good thing. The way things function however, make the game play quite different than minecraft even early on, and from what I could tell it was only going to get more divergent on its own path.\n\nOne thing I can tell up front is this is more of an exploration based/combat game in terms of your delving down below ground. Sure, there are critters in minecraft, but no one really worries about any of the minecraft creatures. This game has things that will EAT YOU AND SPIT OUT YOUR EYES TO MAKE SOUP FOR LEFTOVERS ON THURSDAY.\n\nAnyways, I strongly recommend this game if you like building/open world/exploration minecraft type games, enough that I suggest you pay for it despite it eventually going free to play upon release.

Yes, it could be seen as grindy, but any game with a progression system can be seen as grindy by those who have zero paitence and less attention spans. The game is in the name "Creati - verse" ie go out and create your world. To do that you will need resources etc hence a progression system. One that actually works quite well so far as I can see.\n\nIf you have no desire to create anything then yes, this game will bore the pants off you and you will be as miserable as you expected to be, so, don't want to create anything? then don't play creative games. Really quite simple.\n\nMultiplayer with friends looks to be the best way to enjoy this game. If you have no friends who have the game yet, or worse, no friends period, then umm, yeah, this will be exactly like single player minecraft, fun, but to a point.\n\nThere is still lot that needs to be added to the game, but it is already value for money. I am however a bit worried about the in game store and how the devs are going to handle it and what kind of exchange rate they are planning on having. This could get very expensive for some people.\n\nI would rather this be a paid game than a free to play game, but I will hold off judgement until the game finally goes F2P and we see how the store is being run and what they are offering.\n\nBut for now, I do recommend this game as it really does have the potential to usurp minecraft..... its just that in game store... and how parents might perceive the idea of their little bundles of joy either draining the family credit card. Or being pestered the hell to allow little mister or miss sunshine to buy X, Y or Z so that they do not feel left out because all the 'cool' kids already have X, Y or Z.","October 17, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

They do a lot of subtle things that help the world feel more believable while still keeping the same blocky building construction that worked so well in Minecraft. I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but it appears from the menus that you will be easily able to join others' worlds. Also, each player has a teleporter built in making it easy to construct a base that you can return to.

I put quite a bit of time into it, could have spent more building, but I'm not really a building guy, I prefer exploration, fighting etc.  If you enjoyed Minecraft, thisr is an improvement.\n\n\nWhat I liked:\n-Graphics are nice, good lighting effects. I found myself stopping and looking around quite a bit.\n\n-Lots of the biomes are really neat, the swamp especially I enjoyed when I first discovered it.\nCanyons are also very cool.\n\n-Recipie discoveries - I liked that it was tiered so that was really good.  I didn't like that I had to build some stuff to open the other stuff though, was kind of a waste of resources, but whatever.\n\n-Difficulty - Tier by tier the monsters where pretty tough, so whenever I went into combat I was really careful because ya never know what was going to happen.  As I got better weapons the stuff above ground was pretty much cake, but down underground there was never a time when I felt comfortable or secure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n-You don't know what you don't know.  I'm still not sure how to get some of the items required to make some stuff.  I never saw an Egg the entire game.  I'm guessing you have to Tame something?\n\n- Some of the items required to make stuff was tedious to gather, especially potions at times.  The resistance potions where kind of annoying to make.  Not a huge deal, but maybe get a bit more for less resources?\n\n- Farming with the Hoe - This was way to slow.. I don't know if there was any other kind of item that made it faster, but tilling the grass/ground was 4 or 5 seconds per plot... it was time consuming.\n\n-Corruption mob density was a little high.  Because they had so many HP it was really tedious to fight because you got swarmed.  I was building terrain traps to farm stuff, I'm cool with that but it gets tedius when you want to explore but can't.\n\n\nSuggestions:\n-Combat - I liked combat, it was challenging.  I felt maybe a medium power range weapon would be a good choice, something to soften mobs up before engaging?  I know there's bombs, but they are somewhat expensive to make.\n\n-Crafting Tabs - Let me tab off stuff if I like, as per ARK.\n\n-Gathering Water/Liquid was kind of annoying.  I felt that if I sat there, it should maybe speed way up as I collect the resource?\n\n-Terraria, rare monster drops to summon bosses, etc.\n\n\nAnyhow, good game.\nFree week was awesome, I'll buy the game for sure when it's out.","October 14, 2015","true","21.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Didn't believe that it was "better than Minecraft", especially since it's free, but wanted to see for myself. Once it finished installing I thought I'd try it for a few minutes while some other stuff downloaded, and before I knew it I looked at the clock and it was 3am. I had been playing for 7 hours somehow and not once got bored or felt I needed a break. The game keeps introducing new items and mechanics one after the other, and I just wanted to keep going.\n\nIt hurts me to say this, but this is a better game than Minecraft. Minecraft is the one that started it all, and it will always have a place in my heart and I will (probably) never stop playing it, but Creativerse simply beat it at its own game. It's more polished, actually has some semblance of a backstory, and has all (or at least most) of those little features Minecraft STILL will not introduce. Ceiling lights, anyone?\n\nInstead of writing a long, detailed review, I'm just going to say to download it and try it yourself.

I like the direction it is going and hope it continues to stay different than minecraft.\n\nWhat I notably like is:\nThe crafting system - really interesting, makes me want to unlock all the recipes\n\nDifferent biomes - refreshing and interesting types of biomes even based off of seasons makes me want to explore around and see what I can find.\n\nFear of caves - don't dig straight down...\n\nCreatures - not the generic cow and chicken combos i mean there are chickens but they are more cocktrice like and more interesting than just a normal mooing cow, plus the night creatures look scary :D at least you can see them most of the time ^^\n---------------------------------\nWhat I find so - so\n\n-The fighting is lacking, kinda makes me feel like it's turn based like when I am not even close enough or behind it I still get hit by attacks while i try to maneuver and evade it.\n\n-Food is rare, so is health regen\n\n-Could add some more filler content or more visible goals. I know it's there but, as someone who started out some of the things are a bit hard to find and some items aren't readily accessable which drags the crafting system back when you don't have the proper item or tools.\n\nBut I do recommend it for people who enjoy Voxels and want something new and refreshing, maybe more for people who want to relax a bit. Not recommended for those who are hardcore or looking to 'conquer' land because it is actually a fairly relaxing game from what I can tell on the surface of the game itself and it's gameplay. I do look forward to see how it develops more!\n","October 13, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is 90-95% a minecraft clone. With that said, it's not a bad clone, in fact it improves on a few things over minecraft, it's combat has more satisfaction to it, though it is still VERY simple and nothing but an exchange of blows till one or the other dies. The graphics are a bit nicer, with much improved shadows and lighting over minecraft's godawful shadows, and the textures are better too.\n\nThe only major downside is that the game lacks content, and more importantly "difficult" content. In 13 hours I had built a massive carved limestone mansion, aquired every recipe, killed every creature in the game, explored every biome, and aquired the best equipment that exists. I had done everything that was worth doing. (And even a few that weren't.) And I did ALL of this, without dying, not even once, hell I didn't even drop below half health I think.\n\nTo sum this up, it's a minecraft clone with better graphics, a few improvements, much less content, and "FAR" easier gameplay. Why did I recommend it then? It's genuinely free to play. The game does have a cash shop, but I didn't see anything in it that either imbalanced the game, nor that I found even remotely interesting or worth buying. And a totally free game that I didn't instantly delete off my harddrive by itself makes it a recommended game.","January 12","true","15.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealRemedy/recommended/280790/","TheRealRemedy","† Angel †","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealRemedy/","36 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: Good game, a bit like minecraft but with better graphics (That means it kinda lags on decent or worse PCs). Everyone should at least try it, anyway its free.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW:\nIt's a fun game. If you like Minecraft there are 2 ways this can go.\n1. You will call this a copy of Minecraft and hate it.\n2. You can spot the things that make it good and enjoy it.\n\nI am rating it 6/10 ( It's still early access that means it will become better )\n\nAnd Here are some Pros and Cons from my experience so far.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I ONLY PLAYED SINGLEPLAYER FOR 70 MINS.\n\n-Pros-\n-ITS FREE\n-It's beatiful and cute\n-Some monsters are a bit creepy\n-Overall good models (except main character. I didnt really like it because it seemed really childish but thats my opinion only)\n-A huge variety of items even though its only early access\n-Huge world with a lot of things to discover\n-The teleporter (Well, its a bit cheaty but who cares?)\n-SUPER JUMP. I mean who doesn't love it?\n(That's only some of the things. I dont really wanna waste your time or take away the feeling of exploration)\n\n-Cons-\n-I have a decent PC and it kinda lags on the lowest (Fastest) graphics.\n-Sometimes it seems like a minecraft rip-off\n-Unavoidable enemy hits. You cant juke the hits of enemies and taming them is sometimes impossible (There must be a way but I didnt discover it)\n-It's easy to find your items after death. That way it's not that challenging. Actually you can set the teleporter when you are about to die and get the items when you respawn.\n-Tamed animals didnt really fight for me and that seemed kinda odd (Probably I did something wrong)\n-Some items are hard to find and there is only a little in-game help to find them.\n-And the worst of all: Every gamers most hated enemy. F***ing microtransaction. But i guess its free it balances the pain a bit. :P\n\nThat's all for now. Sorry if I made mistakes. I only played for 70 mins so I didn't really explore the whole place.","January 18","true","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Although i've only played for like 60+ hours, but i guess it's enough for me to finally make a review, since i've reached the deepest floor on  creativerse, and i kinda get the hang of the whole game. And this is my score for this game ( Please keep in mind that i have never played minecraft so i can't compare the 2 game) :\nGameplay : 8.5\nMusic : 8\nCrafting : 8.5\nCombat : 8 ( The combat is simple but the monsters and their unique spawn rate is unique )\nUnique : 8.5\nLongevity : 9! ( If you play this with friends!)\n\nIMPORTANT MESSAGE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW! SO PLEASE DO READ THE REVIEW THOROUGHLY :)))\n\nA bit of my story about the game :\nFor someone who has never played minecraft and stuff... For me this game is amazing,\nThis game has endless possibilities, I can do almost anything that i want in this game... The graphics is awesome, the gameplay is good on its on way, There are tons of unique monsters.\n\nThe first time i played this game... I was confused, because i have never played minecraft before, and there is barely any Tutorial for this game, but after playing a few hours, I'm starting to get the hang of the game and i really enjoyed it.\nI was playing with my buddy and at first we were building a small treehouse and stuff, and we thought that it was amazing... But then after a few days, we explored that this game has ( What we called it ):\n1. Spring Zone\n2. Summer Zone\n3. Autumn Zone\n4. Winter Zone\n\nAnd after we look around, we decided to move our house to the Winterrrr Zoneeeeee....!!!\nAnd then we build our own castle, WE DESTROYED THE WHOLE MOUNTAINNNN WITH A ♥♥♥♥IN BOMB LOLOL.... It was amazing xD... And we made our own monster breeding place, using the soil and the ecosystem based on where they spawn. so we basically dont have to walk to actually farm for the monsters.\n\nOKAY BACK TO THE REVIEW!\n\n~~~~~GAMEPLAY :\nThe gameplay for me is unique, simple , and fun ... It doesn't require you that much of skill to actually enjoy the whole game... And as someone who has never played a single sandbox, voxel based open world game.... this game is amazing, because i can actually do almost anything that i want. And the features in this game varies, and it never bores me.\n- You can suck the ground and mine the ore based on what layer of soil you are in... There are :\n------- 1. Normal Soil\n------- 2. Layers with Obsidian and a few useful ores\n------- 3. Layers with iron and a few useful ores\n------- 4. Layers with Mythril and a few useful ores\n------- 5. Layers with Diamond and a few useful ores\n------- 6. LAVA LAYERZZZZ\n------- 7. End of the world (?) Where you can gather Lumite...\nANDDD... each layers has its own unique monsters with unique drop for crafting!\nBest way to open the space for mining is using BOMBS!!! easy space lol.\n\nWatch this guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olRGrgYsV-o\n\nMUSICCC : The music is quite soothing and it's really enjoyable while playing the game ...\n\nCrafting : The crafting is quite basic, as usual... you gather stuffs and when you have enough ingredient , fuala~ you can craft those items...\nBUT... If you want to open the next recipe , you basically have to AT LEAST craft the recipe before it... Once\nSo basically if you want to open the whole recipe, just craft em all... although not all recipe has the next recipe if you craft 'em\nAND WHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE :\nThere are different processing machine for each kinds of crafting, and it's what makes the game quite unique, and you can multitask different craft in a different machine! and you can also make unlimited amount of that machine too! amazing right...?!\n\nCOMBATTT :\nThe combat itself is quite simple, just mash-click your button lol... But what makes it unique is the kinds of monsters and items that they dropped\nAAAANNDD Where they spawn! you can actually make an ecosystem just like where they used to live, and the monster itself will spawn! That way, you dont have to actually run from side to side just to gather those monsters item, since this game has limited amount of teleport machine, which is limited to one teleport machine for each players.\n\nUNIQUEEE :\nThis is game TO me is unique, because you can do almost anything, and it really differs from other sandbox game that i've witnessed from youtube and stuff... The gameplay and etc is much more polished than the ancestor... Minecraft, although there are some parts that still lacks of something...\nBut overall this game is fun, enjoyable, unique, and if you play this with your friends, this game is just amazingly fun in its own way lol trust me!\n\nLONGEVITY :\nThe game is very fun, it doesnt get boring fast, and even after 200+hours i would even still play this game and smile like a dork everytime i finished building something with my buddies.\nOne key to make this game longlasting ... Play this game with your friends... seriously... it gets really fun especially if you play this game with teamspeak or any voicechat program...\n\nSOOO This is the end of my review! I hope you enjoy reading my first...detailed review i have ever made.\nI hope it makes it easier for you to decide to play this game or not...\n\nAND IF YOU WANT TO JOIN MY WORLD ON CREATIVERSE... SIMPLY JUST ADD ME, AND CHAT ME WHEN IM ONLINE :)\nMY WORLD IS STILL RATHER SMALL BUT I BASICALLY HAVE COVERED MOST OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE GAME SUCH AS ORE MINING, MONSTER BREEDING, AND A MOUNTAIN SIZED CASTLE :)","December 5, 2015","true","121.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Playing with 3 friends is just perfect and we all did our own thing, here's how I would describe us.\n\nPotatoGod: Tames any new animal he finds and enjoys beating me with sticks for killing his pets and blowing up our houses. Also likes to masquerade as my abusive father as he beats me. (Notable feature; broke the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ocean with ice)\n\nPiecast: Builds things, mines, gets bored of said project and just moves on leaving half built ruins and if it breaks he just gives up...Such as creating a hole in the ocean while attempting to be my under the sea neighbor.\n\nHighlord90 (Me): Kills anything that moves, plays with explosives, wanders the world both above and underground and visits hell on a regular basis then decides to forsake company altogether, swims out to sea, and builds a house in the coral.\n\nThat One Guy: Decides to live in extreme climates and tames a Blizzard Chizzard which he dresses in a top hat and bow tie and calls him Donald Trump which is the most beautiful creature that has ever existed...Also broke the ocean with ice...\n\nWe've worked on 3 worlds already...\n\nWorld One: I destroy 2 houses, one to see how bombs worked and the other to try and get rid of the glitched green goo which used to be my bed. We move on after our house becomes a crater...\n\nWorld Two: We rebuild the old house and live in it comfortably. I ask Potato God to tame 4 pigs for a farm and he comes back with 3 undead pig skeletons and a corrupted pig which he names Optimus Prime, Bony Butt, Skeletor and Dr. Evil. I start a huge farm with real Pigs and eventually move to live in the ocean but delete the world when my friends troll me and break my house...\n\nWorld Three: Currently being used, building the tree house blueprint...\n\nSo yes this game is random, it can be funny, you will enjoy it alone but more with friends. 40 hours in and I'm still doing new things so get this free gem and just enjoy yourself, have fun.","January 28","true","47.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Since you are scrolling through the reviews, i suppose your interested in getting this game? Well i advise you try this game out for yourself first. But any ways, this game is in Early Access and it has a lot of room to improve. Such as making a much more wider range of creatiures, like horses which you can ride, polar bears, and so on. Maybe even bows and crossbows and if possible, guns. Adding taming and so on so forth. There is a maor problem however. The monsters in the night. They are wayyyy to powerful even for a stone sword. Maybe make them a bit easier? That would be great. Also, if you could add a modding community.... Amazing. But overall, the gameplay is quite challenging and fun in its own way. ( Loving the jokes in the items Devs, btw.)All these things would make the game better. So yeah! There's my review and I hope you hard working devs read this and take into account, my suggestions.

Sure, after hours of digging through dirt, rock, and siltstone you'll find some mysterious caverns and some monsters to kill. Play this on a late night while wearing headphones and it'll scare ye' more than a few times. Dig a lil' further and you'll find diamond and lava. Hooray.\n\nAs some point you'll realize that there is just not enough content, let alone a goal to reach for. Of course, building a house, office building, tower, or whatever comes to mind, is pretty amusing...until you realize that no one but you will actually see it. With everyone creating their own world there is no chance of interaction between other players. Oh how I wish there was just one gigantic world....\n\nAs for item creation, the list is somewhat bleak. It starts off with an alchemy-type process in which you need to find resources to unlocks a few items to create. Exciting. Later (but not much later) it ends with creating swords to create other swords and doors to unlock other doors....same with grenades... In otherwords, the list is unorthodox and has no definite clear order while ignoring the gigantic gaps between items.

It's not Minecraft.\n2. It's FREE.\n3. It's still in early alpha, so it will get even better.\nIf those three reasons aren't enough for you to try this game, then you can stop reading and ignore this review.\n\nThe graphics (texture detail) are really good. When I've tried Minecraft a couple of times before I always got a headache after a few hours, because of all the pixelated stuff going on there. It was hard to see and it was hard on the eyes. Even with mods that used 2x more detailed textures. This game is still a block/voxel based sandbox, but it's the first one that actually looks good. There are a lot of materials and resources, way more than your usual sandbox game. The crafting system is really cool and unique.\n\nThe game is awesome. If you like sandbox games you should definitely buy this one... Oh wait, it's FREE!","November 21, 2015","true","107.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Right now, it costs money to play as a way to help fund the developers during Early Access.  It's already in a playable state with a lot of content, but it will get a lot better from the looks of things.  I recommend this game as a future endeavor and hope you will check it out when it's done.\n\nCreativerse is a Minecraft-inspired building block game with very similar gameplay mechanics but also vastly superior graphics and input support.  It is already a very stable game build with a lot of content to keep you busy.  The in-game store also looks promising with some unique recipes, redeemable codes, daily free coins, and building blueprints.  I also enjoyed the game's crafting system and unique monster designs.  It also helps that the world is not entirely voxel-based and has beautiful art.  I look forward to future content but will wait for the game to go free-to-play so I can play the full experience.","October 17, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only thing I hate out of the monsters is that lava worm thing... not fun for me looking at that thing...  also you may have a chance of a white area. Haven't thiggered out how to fix it and have seen it in the game trailer above, lol. Only about 30 minutes playtime and this game is really fun.

I thought it was going to be another Minecraft dupe (yes, the terraforming and cubes are very similar) but it is so much more rich and complex. I love that there is so much to discover and collect. The graphics are beautiful (did you see the lighting? It's gorgeous). Another simple asect that I like is that you don't know everything you can possibly make, meaning that you have to make something first to see what comes next. I like that level of mystery.\n\nMy one complain is that no matter how low I turn the look sensitivity, it doesn't change. Not sure if that is a glitch or not but it drives me craxy. I also noticed that some parts of the environment are just gone. They are like uncoded, emptiness. I think it would be better if the environments were either larger or they ended with something that made sense; a mountain range, a cliff wall, the ocean, etc.","February 1","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoreDDD/recommended/280790/","CoreDDD","Core","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoreDDD/","102 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is an easy to learn building/exploration type game. And any similarities to other titels such as minecraft, rust, terr-.. THEY are all mearly happenstances:) The games greatest virtue is the strait forward and easy multiplayer setup. You just click multiplayer, write name and password, and then all your friends can join easily. You become the admin, but the searver is hosted by the game creaters, so any pc can host. Especially joining through steam is perfected. Additionaly the game has recipies for everything, and these recepies are displayed clearly and smoothly. While also not cluttering the screen. Recipies are learned many different ways, by killing, looting, exploring or in case of the most esecial recipies; by creating the item one matirial tier further down, or in case of multiplayer, by having it in your inventory.(inc. someone else made it) The game is artisticly beutiful, especially the mobs are highly uniqe, original and interesting. The only lacking part of this game is an option menue inside the main menue. Having to host a personal world if order to create a EU character before joining a friends EU server. And finally: The lack of content. 4 friends all working together and rushing finishing the game, not bothering to gather extra rescourses or building more than a big shack. Can finish the game in 8 hours. 8 well spent hours.\n\nMy advice, pick it for a LAN, host a server, get everyone on, and then GET the best extracter in the game.","February 2","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it was free, and I saw no reason not to try it.\n\nAfter fourty hours in the span of about half a month, here I am. It does have microtransactions, but nothing you need  to survive (I spent the gold they gave me on a treehouse, lmao). And it's far from a minecraft clone.\n\nIt operates on the same premise- Mine blocks and gather resources to expand your territory and better fight the creatures that come in the night. After that, though, it's got it's own really interesting spin- one that takes it to a new level.\n\nGameplay:\nLike I said, the premise is like Minecraft's. Mine blocks, defend yourself from hostile creatures, and expand your world. However, it's got its own system. You have a mining cell, fit onto your wrist to gather and hold pieces of the world around you. And you can craft anything, anywhere, with no crafting bench. So long as you have one somewhere and you've gotten the refined materials for it. To make food, you get a cooking station as well. And you forge ores at a, well at a forge.\n\nYour ores are much the same way. you upgrade said mining cells to dig deeper into the earth and gather more precious materials from nodes. However, to do this, you need extractors (and time). You attach it to a node, then it will break it down for you. At this point, it's gone, and you're left with everything you need to keep grinding your way down.\n\nBut the deeper you go, the more dangerous things get. The enemies get tougher and more vicious, and there are more dangers, lava, and after a while, even just being that deep starts to take a toll. You'll have a meter filling up, and when it's full, you'll take damage. Cute and fuzzy the creatures of the world may look, they can be bloodthirsty as all hell.\n\nBut that's what makes it really fun, the challenge. 10/10 would get mauled by adorable lizards again.\n\nStory:\nThere's not much of one, really. Someone left you out in the middle of nowhere to survive (or not) on your own. And through various journal scraps, you find out more about someone (or maybe multiple someones) who've been there before you through journal pages. Now, I love a good story. But I also love the freedom to make one up myself through bits and pieces. So for me, this one gets 7/10, would read way too much into random journal scraps again.\n\nOverall:\nThe game's simple to get into, the learning curve is tough, but not brutal, and it's addictive. Between expanding your base(s) and exploring what the world has to offer, you could lose a whole night playing this without even realizing. Having to wait a long time for some of the materials is a slight pain in the ♥♥♥♥, but it's nothing that would ruin the game.\n\nEasily a 9/10. I'd recommend this to anyone, at least to try out. After all, it's free, so there's nothing to lose (but time), and a really great new game to gain!","February 1","true","96.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Right now, it costs money to play as a way to help fund the developers during Early Access.  It's already in a playable state with a lot of content, but it will get a lot better from the looks of things.  I recommend this game as a future endeavor and hope you will check it out when it's done.\n\nCreativerse is a Minecraft-inspired building block game with very similar gameplay mechanics but also vastly superior graphics and input support.  It is already a very stable game build with a lot of content to keep you busy.  The in-game store also looks promising with some unique recipes, redeemable codes, daily free coins, and building blueprints.  I also enjoyed the game's crafting system and unique monster designs.  It also helps that the world is not entirely voxel-based and has beautiful art.  I look forward to future content but will wait for the game to go free-to-play so I can play the full experience.","October 17, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I thought it was going to be another Minecraft dupe (yes, the terraforming and cubes are very similar) but it is so much more rich and complex. I love that there is so much to discover and collect. The graphics are beautiful (did you see the lighting? It's gorgeous). Another simple asect that I like is that you don't know everything you can possibly make, meaning that you have to make something first to see what comes next. I like that level of mystery.\n\nMy one complain is that no matter how low I turn the look sensitivity, it doesn't change. Not sure if that is a glitch or not but it drives me craxy. I also noticed that some parts of the environment are just gone. They are like uncoded, emptiness. I think it would be better if the environments were either larger or they ended with something that made sense; a mountain range, a cliff wall, the ocean, etc.","February 1","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You simply exist to create and mine things as you please! It is in general very soothing to play (unless you're digging in the deepest layer, which is kinda dark) and, best of all, free! (Game is funded by optional microtransactions for special blocks and blueprints to make structures.)\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- Tons of blocks to decorate and build.\n\n- Different layers and biomes to explore.\n\n- Great graphics! sunshafts and high res textures.\n\n- Teleporting, so you don't have to walk back to places if you've built the teleporter.\n\n- Hotkeys can be changed!\n\n- Graphics can be lowered!\n\n- You can tame animals; farm them or just have them follow you around.\n\n- Great soundtrack!\n\n- Easy multiplayer! You can even keep it private by adding a password.\n\n- Friendly for people of all ages to play; very forgiving upon death.\n\n- the ability to claim chunks of land, lock chests/furnaces/extractors, and so on.\n\n- Rotate blocks with the 'R' key!\n\n-------\n\nEHH\n\n- Sometimes light sources glitch out and do not provide light; digging up blocks nearby fixes it, but it can get rather annoying, especially in the dark.\n\n- Pets set to follow do so very closely; they do NOT help in combat.\n\n- requires Wifi to play.\n\n- Lots of block variety can cause inventory to become very messy.\n\n-------\n\nOverall, very nice! Worth a shot to anyone looking for a block-y game or just wanting to kill time.\n","April 11","true","38.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its much more visually pleasing and colorful, not to mention you can turn any creature in the game into your pet and harvest necessary materials from them!\n\nSo here's my Pros and Cons list:\n\nPros:\n- Fun, easy to play, with a simple yet beautiful design.\n-You can tame ANY creature in the game, assuming you can survive its onslaught.\n-Tons of blocks and ores to uncover and use\n-Massive worlds with seemingly endless landscapes\n-Easy to get around with a map to let you know where home base is.\n-Directs you to exactly where you died to retrieve items.\n-Very few lapses in game play (Sinking into ground, walking through solid blocks, etc.)\n-Farming is actually enjoyable and serves a purpose other than feeding the player, but gives great buffs! (Can't wait until there's more to farm! So far it's just Turnips, Lettuce, Horned Melons, Wheat, and Beeswax <-- Not a crop but VERY useful!)\n-You have strong control over your world and who enters it, helps prevent griefing!\n-Taming and killing certain enemies actually takes some skill and strategy (i.e. killing Warmworms and taming Keepas)\n-Tons of customization of homes, blocks, buildings, etc.\n-Each location has different blocks and different creatures to fight/tame, very diverse biomes!\n\n\nCons: (Mostly Early Access Issues <-- Because it's still a newer game and buggy)\n-Digging takes a very long time and you don't really dig any faster with upgraded cells\n-No real character customization other than changing colors.\n-You have to use an Extractor to get ore... which is annoying because you have to constantly make them and you have to use an extractor to get obsidian for... a better extractor... kind of obnoxious.\n-Dug holes reset (I dug a super deep mineshaft to the lava layer, logged back on and it was filled in all the way to the surface even though I still had all the items from the expedition)\n-Fertilizing crops is difficult (When you right click there's a major delay before they fertilize, if they do.)\n-Too many necessary blocks without sufficient space to store them (The supposedly "Grand" Arctek chest holds as much as the regular model, so you end up with 10+ chests for all the items you'll need for crafting later.. a little ridiculous)\n-Wandering pets vanish (You have to set them to "Stay" even in a fenced in area.)\n-Iron hard to find (Diamond was easier to find... diamond! Also very small veins of everything including coal makes you mine for hours with little to show.)\n-Miru and Hot Foot (Hot Feet?) magically appear in your well lit mineshafts with a door on it (Miru are obnoxious creatures that blind you to make them harder to hit, Hot Foot (Feet?) light you on fire...)\n-A few surface creatures a little too overpowered (ex. Blizzard Chizzard and Boss Hogs are nearly impossible to beat/tame with anything less than Iron sword or standing on a ladder.)\n\n\nThere are a few bugs but it's an early access game so I can't really say much because I'm sure the devs are doing there best to fix all of them. This game is fun, highly addicting and I stand next to my high recommendation. One of the best open world sandboxes I've ever played! :)","June 2","true","14.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And when I say this is one of the few games ive played that have this, I mean that i've only ever played one other game with Dev's as interactive as this.  It is because of the Dev's willingness to interact and take critisicm from the players that I recommend this game.

So far it's just Turnips, Lettuce, Horned Melons, Wheat, and Beeswax <-- Not a crop but VERY useful!)\n-You have strong control over your world and who enters it, helps prevent griefing!\n-Taming and killing certain enemies actually takes some skill and strategy (i.e. killing Warmworms and taming Keepas)\n-Tons of customization of homes, blocks, buildings, etc.\n-Each location has different blocks and different creatures to fight/tame, very diverse biomes!\n\n\nCons: (Mostly Early Access Issues <-- Because it's still a newer game and buggy)\n-Digging takes a very long time and you don't really dig any faster with upgraded cells\n-No real character customization other than changing colors.\n-You have to use an Extractor to get ore... which is annoying because you have to constantly make them and you have to use an extractor to get obsidian for... a better extractor... kind of obnoxious.\n-Dug holes reset (I dug a super deep mineshaft to the lava layer, logged back on and it was filled in all the way to the surface even though I still had all the items from the expedition)\n-Fertilizing crops is difficult (When you right click there's a major delay before they fertilize, if they do.)\n-Too many necessary blocks without sufficient space to store them (The supposedly "Grand" Arctek chest holds as much as the regular model, so you end up with 10+ chests for all the items you'll need for crafting later.. a little ridiculous)\n-Wandering pets vanish (You have to set them to "Stay" even in a fenced in area.)\n-Iron hard to find (Diamond was easier to find... diamond! Also very small veins of everything including coal makes you mine for hours with little to show.)\n-Miru and Hot Foot (Hot Feet?) magically appear in your well lit mineshafts with a door on it (Miru are obnoxious creatures that blind you to make them harder to hit, Hot Foot (Feet?) light you on fire...)\n-A few surface creatures a little too overpowered (ex. Blizzard Chizzard and Boss Hogs are nearly impossible to beat/tame with anything less than Iron sword or standing on a ladder.)\n\n\nThere are a few bugs but it's an early access game so I can't really say much because I'm sure the devs are doing there best to fix all of them. This game is fun, highly addicting and I stand next to my high recommendation. One of the best open world sandboxes I've ever played! :)","June 2","true","14.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has its own unique feel as you "pull" the blocks, rather than simply break them. It also has a very advanced survival feel. In the beginning it is hard to start off, but that just gives you all the more "accomplishment feeling". This world has its own special critters and horrors, and adventures and discoveries. There will even be treasure chests that pop up with rewards or even mysterious notes and computer parts.\n\nThe side I like the most to this game is that you can join ANYONE'S world as long as you have the name, you can restrict who can join your world with a password.

My criticism is rather too harsh, considering this is a free-to-play game. Yet, this is my honest opinion, for people who might feel like I do.\n\nA couple of years ago, this might have been a solid game. In 2015 (almost '16) it just feels dated, unoriginal and bland to me.\n\nPersonally, I welcome that developers try to reimagine Minecraft. There's still a lot of untapped potential, many elements/features that were unpolished and limited by the hardware of ~2009. There's plenty room for significant improvements and refreshing gameplay elements.\nBut what I find shocking is the lack of imagination most developers are displaying through their creations. Taking the formula of Minecraft, adding more block types and simplifying the crafting process won't make me overlook the awful flaws that also made me stop playing Minecraft.\nIt's a bit sad that all Minecraft inspired games feel so much alike. It seems like none of the developers are even trying to rethink/reinvent the formula.\n\nAfter playing about 2 hours, here are the things I believe Creativerse does better than Minecraft:\n\n- Trees (they are bigger)\n\nYah...That's about it. Other nice features, like the faster movement and bigger jump heights, are enjoyable, but also make the game feel nerfed. It's just too easy to escape enemies.\nThe gadget for placing/removing blocks is a nice idea but in effect just adds a sci-fi flair. I didn't notice a substantial change in my gameplay experience with it.\n\nHere are the things Creativerse does worse or as bad as Minecraft, in my opinion:\n(I may have missed a lot of new features, due to my short time in-game. But I wouldn't pronlong a bad experience just for the mere hope that I suddenly start enjoying it, hours later.\n\n- Crouching (Just like in Minecraft, it's not "crouching", but just moving slower. Creativerse has elements like dead hollow trees, lying in the world, but you can never crawl through or hide in them. Your height is always the same. This would have been obvious potential for improvement! Actual crouching/crawling could do a lot to enhance immersion or add new gameplay elements.)\n\n- Limited visibility distance (The viewing distance is even worse than in Minecraft! When you climb a mountain/hill, all you get to see as you turn to enjoy the view, is a huge vast space of empty white. I'm not sure what the exact viewing distance is, but it feels like maybe 100 blocks. That is a flaw that kills a game for me, in 2015.)\n\n- Graphical blandness - World generation (Creativerse has a couple of biomes, but they hardly feel varied. When I move through Minecraft, I am still sometimes awed by the variety of visual impressions. Creativerse just seems "flat" in comparison. Its forests look nicer, due to the much bigger trees, but all other biomes can only be described as bland. If the screenshots don't excite you, don't expect anything better to come.)\n\n- Empty oceans (Just like in Minecraft, oceans are mostly empty. There are ocean-specific block types for harvesting, but I never spotted a single creature in the water. If you're wondering how oceans could ever be interesting, take a look at the game "Subnautica", available on Steam. The deep sea is a biome that should be really exciting, but I have yet to see a Minecraft-styled game that shows any care for that aspect.)\n\n- Mind-numbing combat (Same as in Minecraft. It's the most simplified combat you could code for a first-person game. Zero originality. No noteworthy tactics. No unusual combat maneuvers. No awe inspiring animations. Only the same generic old.)\n\n- Crafting without exploration, thought or discovery (Well, you do "discover" new crafting recipes, but without using your brain for it. Whenever you collect a new resource, the game gives you recipes for it. Some recipes need to be found in books. It's one of the things that made Minecraft exciting in the beginning - finding uses for new materials by experimenting. You won't get that here.)\n\n- Awkward creature design (That is an entirely subjective topic, but these "animals" don't do anything to make me feel immersed. It's the contrary. I feel remotely reminded of "Ren & Stimpy" characters, but the animations are just too stiff and rough. The same goofy motions over and over. The creatures never feel like anything alive, but just like objects inserted to annoy or be forcefully funny. Cartoony creatures of that type can be funny if placed within a story, through actions within context. In a survival game that I might play for weeks, months or years, the joke ends after a few hours, once I've seen all animations and actions frequently. After that time I'm left with nothing but the impression that all creatures are excessively ugly.)\n\n- Generic avatar models, designed for a non-mature audience (Two kids - male and female - with generic visual design.)\n\n- Artificial intelligence (Creatures either move around in very random patterns or run directly after you, when they spot you. There may be more interesting creature behaviour in caves, eventually.)\n\n- Bugs (A creature hit me through walls. I was in an improvised dirt hut, with no openings anywhere and got hit whenever I approached a wall. It's already a big flaw the creature even knew I was there.)\n\nCreativerse isn't bad, especially considering it's free-to-play, but I just didn't spot enough originality to shake off my Minecraft weariness.","December 26, 2015","false","2.1"," 27 of 56 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","27","56","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/playintosh/recommended/280790/","playintosh","Playintosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/playintosh/","648 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n* This textual version of the review will diverse a little bit from the video-version, since I wanted to make the video version as straightforward as possible. If you're interested in a TLDR thing, probably watch the video, otherwise scroll past it ^.^ *\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wFzYplXXr0E\n\nI will try to not to compare this game to Minecraft, or any other voxel based survival open world games, altough it is hard, since the features that the competitive games currently offer are in my opinion much larger than of this one, but this one is early access so remember, you are buying a game that is still undergoing its development and creative process.\nI have owned this game for quite some time now, I have seen it buggy as hell with hardly any content and recently coming into patches that added loads of new content, craftable items, new designs and very good UI changes.\n\nSo I would like to start by saying that this game is definitely on a very good track! And that the developers definitely deserve every penny you are willing to give them for this. The game receives constant updates, it is evolving, the developers are listening to feedback and adjusting the experience to it.\n\nAltough I do feel there is still a lot to be done. The overall experience right now is smooth and can entertain you for several hours,. There are in-game ideas that definitely add some unique thinking and provide rage-free gameplay (teleporters, death relics, etc.). As well as ideas that I can see to be used to request payment in the future (after the f2p model goes live), and I hope it will not kill the game. (task based crafting)\n\nThe task based crafting for example is a good example of a feature that does not have to fit to everyone. Having to wait for a set period of time for something to finish crafting in a queue might eventually become frustrating. I personally liked this function as it allowed me to multitask and I haven’t been bothered by it, but I can imagine it will bother some.\nWhen it comes to creativity and the overall design of the game, I have to put my hands down, open my mouth and look around. This game feels very, very smooth, every block in the game feels like it belongs there, everything seems like it has been thought through and the colour design is amazing. I always disliked minecrafts default texture pack for being too rough and hard on the eyes, but in the case of this game, it’s a world where’d I’d love to be in person. And everything is perfectly layered, it really feels like it’s one big connected world. Going from top to the very bottom is just amazing, and the creative minds behind this game really have some imagination.\n\nRegarding UI there have been some changes through out the development and I feel they were very good as well. I was skeptical about the UI in the past and felt like I’m a little lost in it. This cloud has been a little cleared, but I still feel a little of it floating around. I’d definitely welcome some in-game guide, more informative tooltips, or basically any other way of guiding my hand through the crafting windows and such, and once you’d get used to it, you could turn it off ofcourse. (Same goes for first game start, I’d like to see some guidance there as well)\n\nStory-wise I feel like this is the part of the game where there’s really.. nothing. I have not included this point in the video review since I don’t feel like it’s a priority for the developers. At least I have not seen any mention about it in the forums or on the store page. There are some in-game notes to be found containing some text, but there’s nothing more to that right now. I’m don’t deliberately need a story at every cost, but it would be nice to get to know something about the world I’m getting thrusted into, since it’s very colorful and nicely done in the fist place. I know the main selling points of this games are probably elsewhere, but it’s just something I’d like to see even if it would be in a very small way.\n\nTo cut the chase I’ll say that I think the main selling points of this game are the social features and the game design. It’s incredibely easy to start a multiplayer game, takes literally one second, or the blink of an eye. That makes sharing your world with someone very easy, showcasing your builds, or just generally derping around. As I recall from other similar games, I’d have to have a dedicated server application, sometimes even venture into config files, and other necessary setting ups, which is just awful, and I’m glad this game is doing it right. By game design I mean how things look, what items you can craft, how is it concieved. The entire game has a very distinct style, it’s a mix of traditional things with modern technology and possibly a little bit of magic here and there (or at least it feels like that). This gives a sort-of-a “steam-punk” feel (altough not entirely) and I definitely like that, it’s very different to other games where it’s the same thing all over again, just with different textures.\n\nHaving said that I think that the entire game is well designed not just by the visual means, but also the progression and game mechanics design. Crafting and getting further in the game feels natural and follows a nice expanding path, while it’s most of the time very clear what you need to create next, altough when starting the game for the first time it was very unclear to me.\nThere are definitely bugs right now, I’ve been able to pick-up my things when still being on the death screen, I can often see through blocks, the lighting system seems very fragile, I had invisible mob attacking me and some general multiplayer issues (latency, missplacement, etc.),. But that’s all expectable right now, and I feel like it will definitely get fixed, since already a lot of bugs did get fixed.\n\nI am going to say what I said in the video review, and that is.. If you feel like supporting the developers (whom in my opinion deserve it) definitely go for it, get the game, play it right away and address your feedback to the devs. If you feel like you can probably smash out more value and entertainement from other similar games (you are probably right) and you’re hesitating with the cash (I’m not surprised, Creativerse is not cheap) just wait and see, it can still happen that this will turn into an annoying pay2play title that will slowly die, as well as it can turn into a beautiful well balanced game (it’s heading there right now). Right now I feel it’s a little “dull” and for me it doesn’t offer that much replay value (my opinion), but I feel otherwise very positive and I can see how it will become great.\n\n\nBelow I’ll just put some Pros and Cons to have a brief overall review.\n\nPros\n(+) Beautiful Visuals\n(+) Easy to set up multiplayer\n(+) Unique game design\n(+) Natural progression\n(+) Honest, fair and hard working developers\n(+) Constant updates\n(+) Different approach to crafting (stations, extractors, etc.)\n(+) Task-based crafting (altough this might be a con for some)\n(+) Progression supporting features (teleporters, etc.)\n\nCons\n(-) Price (20 is a tad high, but its a support token)\n(-) Future f2p model (might go bad)\n(-) No in-game guidance system, player has to figure it out\n(-) No story\n(-) Bugs\n(-) No linux support (Win/Mac at the moment, absolute multi-platform would be nice)\n\n\nThanks for reading/watching this, or both, also check out my channel for some more reviews if you’ve enjoyed this one and/or other gaming related content.

Played during the free week, and I really like the look of the game. A little sci-fi mixed in.\n\nBut I can't recommend the game. The jump mechanics are bouncy, annoyingly so. Over all the controls could feel a little tighter and more responsive.  Usually a 1-2 second lag on selecting items and using them.\n\nCrafting is horrible.  Too many items required, for items that have so little durability.  1-2 hours of gathering to make an item that lasts 10 minutes.  Recipes are not given to you, you have to be luck to find some good ones.  Even then if you know how to make something you have no idea where to get the required items.\n\nCombat is who will survive the longest.  There is no way to dodge or get out of the way, so you button mash until they are dead or you are. Healing is a pain, gather a lot of items to make a potion that barely heals.  No regen.  I found it best to just kill yourself and start off with a full bar of health.\n\nWhile beautiful, and has potential. It feels like 80-90% of the game is mining rock and leaves, for the rare chance of finding that one item you need 10 of to craft the next item.

When I first played it, I did a let's try miniseries on my youtube channel of it. At the time the devs were clearly very commited and knew exactly where they were going to take this game. I loved it and in the end told my viewers that I highly recommended it. But after around 4 months hiatus, I returned ti the game for yet another video, this time to "Revisit" the game and re-review it. And to my dismay, dissapointment, and slight annoyance, it made me realize just how far things have fallen for this game. A game that had immense potential, especially with such once-commited devs, that actually truly listened to the community have let go. And it seems those that are still at least half-commited are lost and split on the direction they want to take it. The game also still lacks a creative mode which is easily my biggest peeve with this game. It actually does make me a bit maddened. So all in all, my love for this game and excitement are all gone. Washed straight out of me. However I know there is still great potential for this game if the devs get back to where they were priorly in the beginning, back to be energized, excited, commited, and community oriented. Knowing the exact direction they wish to take it. So for the time being, it's honestly a "I'll leave it up to you to decide" notion rather than a don't/do recommend sequence from me. And that's my actual true stance on the game currently. But since I had to choose yes or no on recommending it in order to post this, it's easily a no.","December 29, 2015","false","14.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","9","20","2","0"

It's definitely inspired by it, but also influenced by other games like Terraria. The whole genre of 3D block-based sandbox-games has been founded by Zach(tronic)'s "Infiniminer" though, and Minecraft too is just a successor of Infiniminer anyways.\n\nCreativerse looks really nice, has a pleasant atmosphere with creative weirdly-funny creatures, a touch of SF and great music. The gaming progress in the "adventure-mode" is rather fast, crafting, building and discovering the large game-worlds is fun. The starting tutorial is a rather new feature and needs a bit more love in my opinion, but even without it the game is easy enough to get into and won't force you to resolve to Wikis.\n\nIf you're a builder-type of player, then you might want to choose th "peaceful"-mode in the advanced options when creating your world. A "creative/creation-mode" is in the pipeline but not done yet (Creativerse is still in Early Access). Mind that this is an online-only-game with the advantage of enabling easy multiplayer-gaming together with (and/or against) friends.\n\nCrafting-recipes have to be unlocked one after another by taking certain blocks, crafting stuff and obtaining rare findings. However on your next world you can simply "carry over" the whole crafting-tree that you've already unlocked. Items or blocks cannot be transferred between worlds though. World-creators can use a number of commands to keep up law and order on their own worlds.\n\nHarvesting, mining and chopping only needs one tool - or rather 6 tools of different "tiers" that will fall apart after wearing out, so you'll regularly need new ones, just like sword and armor too. You can tame all creatures you will come across and feed them to regularly harvest their "drops"/loot from them as livestock - or fight them alternatively. You can also grow crops, cook tons of different kinds of food and claim land to protect your buildings.\n\nThere's a really large number of different building-blocks to be crafted including roofs (slopes), stairs and a bunch of furniture; plus rare ones collected from treasure chests or bought from the "store" for real money to support the otherwise free game. The store only features non-gameplay-essential blocks and blueprints for large structures that you can build together with your friends. And: nearly all blocks can be rotated into all 6 directions!\n\nLike in Terraria you can make specific creatures (and also treasure chests) spawn by creating artificial biomes. The deepest layer of all Creativerse-worlds is a vast corruption-layer (even though corruption nearly doesn't "spread" at all) and can be "purified" little by little. The game will feature NPCs and villages, also ruins and the like in the future, as well as an (redstone-like) electricity-/automation-systems, but does not yet. Character customization options and modding-options are still at their planning-stage too.\n\nThere are no typical railways (yet), but you can build a network of teleporters and also ice-slope- and/or ladder-"railroads" instead - which is just as fun. The game has a background-story that is as yet only indicated by cryptic notes that you can find and read. Environmental effects (heat, cold, corruption) are making the game positively tricky, also some blocks or liquids will react to these effects and change; which will also happen when you throw certain bombs at them...\n\nThe adventure-mode is rather relaxed; you can always get your stuff back after being defeated, while you'll even keep your equipment and everything that's in your action-bar. There's no "hard-mode" nor "survival-mode" (yet), eating and sleeping is not necessary, but just has specific advantages; food and the like does not decay. However every creature has their unique attacks and can only be found in their specific native biomes (or can be made to spawn on specific blocks).\n\nAs the game is still in Early Access here are lots of small to large features still on the to-do-list and on wish-lists of players too of course. However the devs are known for taking player-suggestions into consideration as soon as their time and internal roadmap allows, and they are planning for Creativerse to become the "ultimative sandboxgame" in time.","January 8, 2015","true","380.8"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

I would rather buy the game and then do dlc for the building packs so I can play offline instead of ingame microtransactions.

I had to run for 20min just to find sand to make glass! And things wear out WAY to fast, especially since you can not find any of the materials to remake them.  chest are too small, and the jumping dynamic feels very strange.  it s a yes/no for me.\n\nat first I gave this a thumb down but I am changing that to up.\nSTILL HATE the amount of time you spend mining stuff, but this is a good game and Alpha SO DEV"S if you read these please change the mining time seriously it is too damn long.  so still feel the same about chests, and thing wearing out.","May 23, 2015","true","81.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

Already, I prefer it to Minecraft, who I imagine will be its main competitor. The game is pretty intuitive if you've ever played anything like it, but it's cartoony charm is very unique. There's a wider variety of mobs than I usually encounter in these sort of games, and they all are needed at some point or another for crafting. Since some mobs are localized to certain biomes, theres actually an incentive to explore! In minecraft all I do is sit and build, because I don't need to do much else. But in Creativerse, in order to discover all the decorative walls I can make, I have to keep digging, keep exploring, and it has handy teleporters, beacons, and touchstones to help do so.\n\nMy only complaint is that some of the higher tier materials take quite some time to process/smelt in any quantity, and I have some concerns about the premium currency shop. However, as long as the items in the shop are purely cosmetic and offer no advantage (as many forum posts I've read have suggested is the case) I'd gladly continue you to play after release, and will likely shell out more cash to *ahem* pimp my crib. I would like to see some tweaking with some of the timers, but I can't complain too much, as they progress even if I'm offline. This makes it fairly simple to queue up high tier stuff before I log off for the night, and have all the materials ready when I decide to play the next day.\n\nTL;DR: This game makes minecraft look bad, the devs are wonderfully responsive, and on the off chance that you aren't sure you'll love it (you will) it'll be free to play at launch. I highly recommend this game.","June 23, 2015","true","32.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I don't play Minecraft anymore, and honestly I never could really call it my favorite, however it still had a moderate amount of features. As a game developer and somewhat game player, through seeing things in past experience, this game is uncomparable in terms of features to many other games I've seen, as in it has VERY, VERY FEW. As in:\n\nChops Tree\nGets Cragwood\nMakes big house in tree\nCan't figure out what to do in house\nStarts mining\nMines for 2 hours\nFind corruption\nCan't figure out what to do in the corruption\nGets diamonds\n\nAnd then there's pretty much nothing left!\n\nAnother large issue that I see, is the CHILDLISHLY, COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC entities. While I in no way am in favor of the realism in Minecraft, at least it has COWS, and CHICKENS, and THINGS THAT DO NOT LOOK LIKE THEY CAME FROM A SHOW FOR LITTLE GIRLS, while in Creativerse, the same "wth is this" message is constantly flitting through my head.\nPlus, it barely has any form of entity that is HOSTILE!\n\nA leafy? What's a leafy?\n\nI'm sorry, but a game that has been in development for 1 1/2 years should not have simple issues with even being able to get to the main menu, have entities that look like they were drawn by 4-year-olds, or be in a situation where the only blocks are completely useless and random and the only thing you can do is make a pretty house.","February 2","false","24.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't play Minecraft anymore, and honestly I never could really call it my favorite, however it still had a moderate amount of features. As a game developer and somewhat game player, through seeing things in past experience, this game is uncomparable in terms of features to many other games I've seen, as in it has VERY, VERY FEW. As in:\n\nChops Tree\nGets Cragwood\nMakes big house in tree\nCan't figure out what to do in house\nStarts mining\nMines for 2 hours\nFind corruption\nCan't figure out what to do in the corruption\nGets diamonds\n\nAnd then there's pretty much nothing left!\n\nAnother large issue that I see, is the CHILDLISHLY, COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC entities. While I in no way am in favor of the realism in Minecraft, at least it has COWS, and CHICKENS, and THINGS THAT DO NOT LOOK LIKE THEY CAME FROM A SHOW FOR LITTLE GIRLS, while in Creativerse, the same "wth is this" message is constantly flitting through my head.\nPlus, it barely has any form of entity that is HOSTILE!\n\nA leafy? What's a leafy?\n\nI'm sorry, but a game that has been in development for 1 1/2 years should not have simple issues with even being able to get to the main menu, have entities that look like they were drawn by 4-year-olds, or be in a situation where the only blocks are completely useless and random and the only thing you can do is make a pretty house.","February 2","false","24.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I couldn't kill most creatures because you need to kill creatures to get the loot they drop to make better weapons and armor to kill them. I apparently reached the end of the world because my game just stopped loading in the map when I reached a certain point and was just a vast white emptiness.

One action leads to a discovery, which suggests more actions.  Here's what happened when I started playing.  I pulled up a block and got a recipe to start crafting to find more recipes to get better armor to survive fighting the critters who have the ingredients to make the better sword to get the materials to make the better mining cell to get the ore to put in the forge to... what, it's 3 am already?

I'll leave that decision for those who decide to try the game.\n\nThe following is my Creativerse experience:\n\nAt first I was intrigued by it and wanted to see how it compared to other games similar to this that have come out since the creation of Minecraft. After playing for a bit I started to get a little more interested and thought it might be something I could have fun playing. I loved the idea of the blueprints system and was hoping to work towards building the fort some day. However I dont think I will be playing anymore after my short frustrating experience with the game. After gathering and crafting many materials I ended up losing everything after dying to a glowing crab that somehow managed to get into my "safe room". I had finally found some obsidian and the extractors take 5 minutes to gather the ore. This of course being 5 real life minutes and the in-game clock ticks by much faster. Being a new player I hadn't had much chance to make the nicer gear which is what I was working towards. When I noticed it was getting close to night time I decided to build a little wall around myself so I could mine my ore in peace. Just as the exctractors where almost finished thats when that pesky crab came in and killed me. I don't know if it glitched through the wall I made or dug its way in but if it glitched its way in that bs needs to be fixed.\n\n\nAs a side note although at the beginning of my review I said I would neither recommend or not recommend the game becuase steam forces me to pick one inorder to post this review I am picking not recommend.","June 1","false","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

By the time i finished my last piece of leather armour, my first two pieces were pretty much destroyed. Being unable to avoid attacks also made taming a pain since you had to hold the bell on a creature for 20 seconds while everything in the immediate vacinity whaled on you.\n\nBuilding a shelter required a lot of time and resources and night time creature are absolutely brutal. I was almost done my house by night fall and i died three times before day arrived and I finished my house. I was sitting in my house making more blocks when out of now where I died to a night pig. the second time I died was when I just killed the first one and a second one spawned behind me in my house. and the third time was when I ran around my house placing torches like a mad man (I think it was about 8-9 extra torches) and yet another pigsy spawned in my house and killed me. One other instance of brutal night creatures was when i was getting sand at dusk and the very second it became night three night rocksters spawned around me and murdered me.\n\nI feel there are a lot of good ideas here but a lot of changes to how the game works are going to be necessary before this becomes a full game.","March 17","false","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Although waiting 5 minutes for an ore to mine is just unacceptable, not implementing pickaxes and making people craft new thing to extract ore with every time they do is silly and bringing cash shop to a minecraft-like game is a cherry on top.","March 17","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"
