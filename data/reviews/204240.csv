C. Escher's nightmares.  Normally that would be a bad thing, but in this case, it's very good.  The Bridge is a puzzle game with a simple premise: Reach the exit door.  Your only tool is control over the direction of gravity though you can only change its direction slowly.  You will need to avoid deadly obstacles and obtain keys to unlock doors in order to escape.\n\nWhile a few of the levels require frustrating levels of repetition and precision in order to reach your goal, most of them are very enjoyable.  In total there are 24 puzzles and 24 mirror versions which add some elements of difficulty in addition to being reversed.  Strangely I found the mirror versions of some of the hardest levels easier than their normal counterparts.  Even if you aren't into puzzle games, the Escher-like artwork is worth marveling at.\n\nOne thing I found missing in the game is music.  It seems like a greatly missed opportunity for a unique and strange soundtrack to match the level design.  There is some music in the game but it plays rarely and is very quiet.\n\nThe other major weakness I found is probably not something many players will encounter:  The collectibles.  Some are absurdly difficult to find, and one even requires you doing something that the game constantly tells you doesn't work for the entire game.  When you do locate them all, the reward is extremely anticlimactic.  It's annoying but like I said, the majority of players probably won't bother with the collectibles and those that do will most likely use guides so they don't go insane trying to find them all.\n\nAs a fan of puzzle games, I greatly enjoyed The Bridge.  You will too!","May 24, 2014","true","6.5"," 135 of 142 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","135","142","0","0"

Just in case there's anyone else sitting on the fence about this, I thought I should add a note of caution. This is essentially a physics puzzler, which is ostensibly a genre I enjoy. In this case however, I think the the execution fails to live up to the ideas. For me, most of the challenge in the game came not through reasoning through the puzzles (though there were moments), but in wrestling with object momentum that frequently ended up being more frustrating than satisfying. At the sale price of $1 it's hard to argue that it's a waste of money. But I feel that personally for me it ended up being a waste of time. And that's something a low price does nothing to help. I see many good things written elsewhere about this game, so I may be in a minority in feeling this way, but I can't help but feel that there are far better puzzle games out there, despite the compelling visual style that I still find appeals to me even though it also triggers memories of annoying level design.","August 25, 2014","false","5.0"," 228 of 312 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","228","312","0","13"

This game forces the player to view the game in different ways. The mind-bending puzzles has the player's reevaluate the preconceptions they've had on physics and perspective of the world.\n\n"It is Isaac Newton meets M.C. Escher."\n\nThe puzzles consist of one or many intricate architectures where the player has to manipulate gravity to complete the levels. The levels of the puzzles gradually increase, leaving a sense of accomplishment after completing them. The beginning puzzles start out extremely easy, letting the player finish in a minute or two, but the puzzles towards the end can leave a player stump for days unless they look up a guide or have someone else look at the puzzle (a different set of eyes can look at the puzzle at a different angle).\n\nNot only is The Bridge a highly intellectual game, the artwork is something to behold. Many art enthusiasts would enjoy the game, simply for the art. The art style is hand drawn black-and-white lithograph. At first glance, the art did not appeal to me, but after completing the game 100%, I saw how beautiful something so simple can be.\n\nWith all that said, I dare you, reader, to complete this game 100%.

Both are certainly very solid: Mind-bending puzzles in a graphite or charcoal sketch style inspired by the works of M.C. Escher. Puzzles work by rotating the level and moving your character, and solutions often require managing gravities that work in several different directions within the same level. There's little not to love with that description, and that is ultimately what sold me on the game.\n\nWhat ultimately comes out of that concept, however, is little beyond an exercise in tedium. There are several details in the game's execution that leave more to be desired. (Full disclosure: I reached about halfway through Chapter 4 before realizing that I was not enjoying myself in the slightest.) First, and most noticeably, is the ambling pace of both the character's movement and that of the level rotation. Many times, I found myself just idly holding a direction for several seconds, waiting for the level to reach the desired orientation while my character impotently shuffled about trying to gain footing on the shifting ground. Or I'd end up dragging my feet along a "twisting" path -- which usually turns out to be ultimately linear -- to my destination, long after having worked out the solution. I appreciate a good, thoughtfully paced puzzle experience, but perhaps the motion of the level and character should actually match that speed of thought.\n\nPerhaps more egregious, though, is that the puzzles, while sometimes fairly challenging, never actually feel satisfying to solve. Unlike other more clever puzzle platformers, there were never any "Oh, yeah! THAT'S how I'll do it!" moments while playing The Bridge. Everything seemed to just kind of putt along, and reaching a solution seemed like a given more than an actual achievement. Perhaps it gets more interesting after Chapter 4, but that's the point that I gave up.\n\nOther objections could be made of how highly derivative -- downright imitative -- the game is of a certain other time-bending puzzle platformer. One could suggest that shoehorned time reversal mechanic adds absolutely nothing to the game experience other than harking to another better game. Arguments could be made that the narrative and level structures are almost identical to that one game with the timey wimey stuff. One could do all that, if one wasn't enjoying playing Braid so much more.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't personally recommend The Bridge, unless you picked it up on sale and don't mind tediously trudging through admittedly very competently illustrated puzzles for a few hours. I commend the developers and wish them the best for their future games, but hopefully next time they won't try to make Braid 2: The Rebraidening.","December 24, 2013","false","1.6"," 67 of 84 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","67","84","0","0"

By the end of the game, you really do deserve a medal, is the kind of accomplishment I'm talking about.\n\nThe game consists of getting the unnamed, old chap through to the exit door in each level, to advance. The game's puzzles, inspired by the Dutch artist, M. C. Escher, who plays a massive aspect in this game, as the world and its environment is shown in grayscale with beautifully hand-drawn illustrations. Obstacles such as voids, which can suck you and other objects into a swirly mess, ''Menace Balls'' that can roll around the puzzle world and flatten you to death. Even steep cliffs that could slip you off the world and fall to your death. With all these dangers aside, you can use this to your advantage by rotating the maze world around you as well as reversing the flow of time, to cheat your demise. Along with controlling the core of elemental physics and gravitational pulls, Isaac Newton, eat your heart out.\n\nI personally love the dark and rather gothic visual world this game sinks its teeth into. The world is truly a marvel to behold, not only for its diverse, colourless design, but for its ingenuity and artistic flare. You could literally stand there in a level, and just analyse every single little detail that had been hand-drawn and just get lost in the rich, beautiful and elegant designs. It doesn't just go for the levels, even the real world locations makes me feel as if I was reading a gothic child's book, what with its vague nostalgic environments and architecture.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is that it's incredibly short, when counting it has only 4 chapters, with only 6 puzzles each. But, with this game's cryptic puzzling, it will keep you stumped out of ideas, as you overcomplicate things and try to get things in the right motion. I'm guilty to say that I've got stuck on one tiny puzzle that left me clueless for over half an hour. Other than that, the controls can be a little iffy here and there, as the game only allows firm movements set in the right motion and time.\n\nDefinitely a recommendation from me, if you're the brainy independent-type. And yes, I'm not that independent, as I did use a walkthrough guide for this game. Ruined the experience, I know, but definitely pick up this game and don't look for outside help as it does ruin it!","September 24, 2014","true","2.8"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","40","45","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/204240/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Largely inspired by the abstract paintings of M.C. Escher, The Bridge is an equally abstract puzzle games which merges gorgeous artwork with an almost Marble Madness-esque tilt mechanic to create an original, evocative experience. It asks you to set aside traditional logic, and adopt a new mindset in a world created on and by its own unique rules, which prove harder to adopt to than you might think.\n\nThe constant flux of gravity is at the center of every puzzle, requiring you to rotate the entire level in order to make your way to the exit. New mechanics such as items which exist in opposition of your own gravity, ones which can only be used by inverting yourself, and other various means to hinder your progress, are introduced as you progress but the basic foundation that up and down are perhaps one and the same holds the game together as things become more and more esoteric in design. It's a very thoughtful game, even in terms of the controls that although sluggish at first, become an integral part of the contemplative pacing once you've adjusted to the relatively slow speed at which everything moves.\n\nUnderneath the puzzles is a story largely open to interpretation. There are hints at what the protagonist, a nameless but brilliant mathematician was attempting, but right up to the end pieces are purposely left out so as to let your come to your own conclusions. While this works fantastically for the narrative, when it begins to bleed into the gameplay the experience becomes slightly too obtuse and the end goal less and less focused. This is most apparent in the later stages where the difficulty is highest, but the rules as to how everything works still obnoxiously unclear. Even having completed them, I couldn't explain to you how many of the mechanics work, which I feel for the style of game is a rather big problem. Solving a puzzle should be something I can figure out on my own, not a random series of events that somehow allows me to arrive at the same conclusion, and yet this is exactly what happened much of the time.\n\nDespite the occasional frustration I had with the level designs, my predominant experience was one of continual wonder and curiosity as I made my way through the gorgeously drawn environments, accompanied by unexpectedly grand sound design and a reposed score that creates the feeling that something is amiss without the need for lengthy cutscneses or drawn out dialog.\n\nIt's an exceptionally artistic journey, but a short one. I completed the game in just under two and a half hours, and while this does unlock mirrored versions of every level (a minor switch that adds an unexpectedly hefty challenge), I personally didn't feel compelled to complete them. Regardless, if you were intrigued by the art design I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up. While it definitely seemed to lack...something....the end result is still a rewarding and highly intriguing game that kept me engaged and left many puzzles wonderfully open to ponder after I put it down. Though one can only wonder what he would think of such an unusual offspring of his artwork, I feel if Escher was alive today he'd be as impressed as I am with Ty Taylor and Mario Castañeda's strange creation, which might ironically get him some new fans of his own.\n","December 6, 2013","true","2.5"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","44","55","0","0"

Our hero--bearded, bespectacled, and dressed in a tweed coat--may fit the classic stereotype of a university professor, but everyone from students to deans will recognize his struggles. We find him alone in a black and white world that reflects the graceful simplicity of pure logic, and we watch him discard unsatisfactory ideas and leave eraser smudges as a reminder of his mistakes. It's a lonely world, fraught with many moments of frustration and suffering from occasional tedium, but every now and then it rewards you with flashes of insight that make the whole endeavor worthwhile.Every puzzle in The Bridge gives you the simple goal of walking through a door. A constant juggle of physics, gravity, and perspective complicates this structure, however, and the game wastes little time in delivering delightful challenges.This progression happens quickly, or rather, it does if you're mentally agile enough to get past the puzzles in a timely manner. Indeed, The Bridge is a short game if you judge it by its 24 short levels. The surrounding world is very alluring. The Bridge's aesthetic draws heavily on the perspective-bending work of M.C. Escher, and much like his art, each level unfolds in grayscale hues that evoke penciled illustrations.What's most refreshing, however, is the game's dedication to minimalism. For most of The Bridge, it's just you and the game, and no health bars or item counters mar that serenity.There's an intriguing story here, too, but piecing it together requires some of the same brainwork you apply to the puzzles. The narrative is not obvious, but it makes itself known in the details.Although rage-inducing difficulty spikes exist, The Bridge generally offers a middle path that should appeal both to newcomers and to expert puzzle solvers.","September 19, 2014","true","13.5"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

It's easy to jump into and get the hang of, and it does a good job of presenting new mechanics to the gameplay to keep things fresh as you progress.  There is an exceptional job done in finding a way to create challenging, thought-provoking puzzles without being overly frustrating.\n\nThe art isn't mind-blowing but it fits the atmosphere of the game very well.  The controls feel natural from the start, and that's important because there is a small amount of platforming required for some of the puzzles. Luckily it is nothing too over-the-top that it ruins the game for those who are trying to enjoy it as a puzzle game and aren't good at platformers. I should note, though, that I was using a controller; which I felt was more comfortable than the keyboard.\n\nAnd one cool addition is the time-warp feature. As with other games where time manipulation is a feature, it can really go a long way to ensure the game doesn’t become too tedious. If you make a mistake during a level you can rewind a few seconds without having to start all over.\n\nAll in all, I think The Bridge does a good job delivering what it intends to.  I believe a good puzzle game these days needs to find a way to be innovative and challenging without being frustrating and redundant, and this game delivers in that regard.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 25, 2014","true","6.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

For an indie game the developers should be proud of what they've accomplished. If there were a somewhere-between-thumbs-up-and-thumbs-down button this is the game I would most want to use it for.\n\nI leaned on the side of not recommending it though, for several reasons. This game is inevitably compared to Braid because it has an artsy style, time manipulation, and puzzles. But it's nowhere near the level of those other puzzle games I love, including Braid or Limbo or even Master Reboot. The reason is mostly depth and story. There simply isn't that much here. And what does exist is far too obscure and limited to be moving.\n\nBeyond that, the puzzles range from straightforward to extremely frustrasting. The difficulty never really flattened out: I either had a level figured out in the first minute, or could stare at it forever with limited success. A few puzzles required some split second timing, which given the controls and precision in this game (they're laggy and your character can't move fast at all) made them very annoying. It was essentially just repeat forever until you happen to squeeze by.\n\nThe black and white art might have actually hurt the game more than helped, as it could be hard to tell the difference between some things that were only separated by shades of gray. As for the music, I hardly noticed it, so it didn't leave much of an impact.\n\nMy final complaint is performance. This is a 2D game with limited effects, but even on an absurdly powerful machine it got extremely choppy at points. It was somewhere down near 1 frame per 2 seconds while I was in freefall. That's just not acceptable, even for an indie game.\n\nSo overall if you're itching for a puzzle game and don't mind the lack of story, and can look past the game's other flaws, then you can pick up The Bridge and it will give you what you want for a few hours. But personally, I won't be coming back to it any time soon.","December 29, 2014","false","10.6"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","34","51","0","0"

The difficulty rating will surely make it memorable for those who manage to somehow reach its end.\n\nLong version:Many things have been said about the Bridge. About the innovation of using puzzles based on impossible geometry (like the Penrose triangle). About the creativity of the hand-drawn black and white visual style. About the eerie, surreal story.\n\nAll of it is true. And all of it is (geatly) exaggerated.\n\nFirst and foremost: the Bridge is nothing more than a set of rotation puzzles with good friction and momentum physics. Some levels are good. Some require a lot of tiresome fidgeting around to find that roughly 0.01° window to pull off the solution.\nDon’t get me wrong: the puzzle design is great. It is also a little sadistic, especially in the second half of the game. This makes you to stop and think about the core of the problem instead of sheer trial and error, so it achieves that many other puzzle games could not.\n\nNext to the difficulty, the most memorable feature of the Bridge is the visual style, which reminds us to the black & white underground obscure graphic novels from the late seventies. Strange as it may sound, but this surreal imagery really fits a logic-based puzzle game.\nThis warped mindset carries itself through the story, or more precisely the very conscious choice of not having any form of story whatsoever. It is just a collection of surrealistic monologues that try to make the player think deeper things into the levels than what they really are: a set of good rotational puzzles with really high difficulty.","September 21, 2015","true","7.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

Escher painting. 11/10 life perspective changing.\n\nIf you like puzzle platformers, tilting the game world around, and M.C. Escher artstyle, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are very nice - everything is hand-drawn in black-and-white. The details in the scenery are good and varied enough to keep things interesting. The music is decent, but I quickly muted it in favor of my own.\n\nControls are simple and easy to learn - much of your playthrough will involve rotating the game world left or right. There is a brief tutorial and large tip popups are provided when necessary (like when you die). The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with platform puzzlers. I found most of the level solutions to be fairly intuitive and solvable through a bit of trial-and-error.\n\nGameplay involves you trying to reach a door to the next level. To get there, you will have to navigate through the level, most likely rotating the world in different ways to assist you. The door may sometimes be locked, forcing you to first obtain a key. As you progress through the game, new elements are added to keep you on your toes. Without wanting to spoil any surprises, some of the first additions include  a ball that instantly kills you on touch and a vortex that will keep anything that touches it suspended . You have the ability to reverse time as far back as you wish to correct any mistakes. Some levels require a light touch - you may have to slowly rotate the world to get things where you need them to be.\n\nInspired by M.C. Escher's artstyle, physically-impossible level layouts require a lot of world manipulation in order to navigate to the exit. For example, you may have to do a complete 360 of the world to manoeuvre your character through several flights of stairs/ledges. The store page screenshots can give you good indications of what type of levels to expect.\n\nOverall, the game is a fantastic puzzle platformer with a nice mechanic and a great artstyle. If you are interested in the genre, then definitely check it out.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","April 30, 2015","true","2.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","17","23","6","2"

As the games goes on more mechanics are added: locks, fast moving boulders, and so on. After the first play though you could always challenge yourself in the mirrored world (which is more than just inversions) or try to find all the wisps.\n\nThe art and animation are praiseworthy. Impossible architecture fills out the hand-drawn world. The M.C. Esher style is well done and makes this game stand out. Though I enjoyed the art, at times I felt like Air Force academies could use this game to train pilots.\n\nIn many ways this game is companion to Braid. Where Braid revolved around the concept of freedom in gameplay (running around and messing with time), while The Bridge seems to deal with restraint (physically limited and trapped in gravity). Braid's vivid water-colors also act as a counterpoint to The Bridge's hand drawn black and white style. Though I am simplifying, these differences (and many more) are interesting to note and for that I think the Bride deserves more attentino.\n\nThere is a lot of depth to this game (upon close inspection) and it is brimming with challenge.

Escher" completely literally and the result is as perplexing as it sounds. Natural gravity is disregarded and surfaces twist to bend back onto themselves. However, this is still a physics puzzle game and so paths and solutions have to be plotted out in a place where up and down are no longer locked in a single position. The black and white sketched out world suits this sort of experimental thinking and the dawdling, clumsy intellectual of an avatar does as well. But those same qualities - that make sense as a matter of theme - slow down trial and error investigation causing the game itself to become tedious and frustrating at times. Aggravating as it can be sometimes waiting for a puzzle to finish turning or the protagonist to get from one place to another, finding the solution and hearing that door creak open is always rewarding. This quality shines especially bright at the halfway mark, when the game revisits all the previous levels as mirrored versions of themselves. Along with flipping the level itself, many new obstacles are added, including a brand new timing element in some sections. Surprisingly, these levels feel only vaguely familiar instead of the lazy rehashes that tactic would expectantly yield. It goes to show how well-crafted the original puzzle worlds were and how great each individual, independent piece is.\nIt's a shame then, that the story doesn't fit together as neatly. It's only told through snippets or thought fragments, leaving most to the imagination. Due to how little material there is to work with, it's difficult to tell if there is a deep, compelling narrative to piece together or if it's positioned as deliberately obtuse in order to hide the fact that the game has nothing to say. The worst thing about it, or the best depending on your perspective, is that I can't seem to stop myself from coming back to it over and over again.","February 14","true","10.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It is not an absent minded puzzler, you really have to focus if you want to get through all the levels and enjoy it. Slow controls and giving you little introduction to the various mechanics are the game's way of trying to tell you that you should sit back and plan what you are about to do, rather than dicking about until something seems to click (Which is permitted by many games, and therefore is tempting, but will ultimately be frustrating and unsatisfying in this one). Like the mathematics this game's story hints at, if you do not pay attention you'll miss something, and it only takes missing one thing to be stumped completely. Once you get into your focus-groove, though, you'll understand the appeal. If you don't know what I mean by that last sentence, then this game is probably not for you, so get it for free or cheap if you get it at all.\n\nTLDR: It's a very good game, but different.","May 11, 2015","true","4.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The goal is pretty straight forward. Chapter after chapter you have to unlock and reach a door to advance further, by having you rotate the whole level in addition to moving your anonymous hero. Every so often it adds new obstacles or mechanics, introducing them in quite simple levels, slowly progressing to more complex ones.

It is divided into 48 levels with the first half requiring minimal use of logic and feeling like somewhat of a pushover; fortunately, this is mostly remedied in the second half—a mirrored version of the first with additional obstacles thrown in and where a greater number of puzzles actually make you think.\n\nThe puzzles start off easily enough, with simple gravity manipulation and key collection, then introduce additional elements consistently: deadly balls which roll as you rotate the environment and can adhere to their own laws of gravity; points which invert gravity and shift you between black and white dimensions where you may only interact with objects matching your current color; vortexes which suck anything near them into place and hold them there until deactivated; mirror images of yourself which require entering multiple doors or picking up multiple keys simultaneously to progress; and gravity curtains, where you may remain stationary while rotating the world to work objects into their desired positions relative to your own.\n\nThe Bridge features Steam achievements and some well-hidden collectibles to find.  Gamepad is natively supported and the controls are very simple, consisting of walking, rotating the environment clockwise or counter-clockwise, and rewinding time when you make a mistake.  It feels very reminiscent of Braid at times, but the puzzles aren’t as satisfying or clever as those in Braid and the overall difficulty curve should have been based on the second half of the game. Anyone who stops before the mirrored world is doing themselves a disservice and, if I had to judge the game based on the first 24 levels alone, I would have to judge it much more harshly. As a whole, The Bridge manages to be a worthwhile puzzle game and to feel very solid despite being made by two people.","May 21, 2013","true","10.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Many puzzles are very simple while others require some thought to figure out, and I enjoyed both.  Once you complete the game on normal mode, the game sends you into a mirrored world, which sends you through more difficult (usually) versions of each level.  I have 2 big problems with the game though.\n\n1. There's really not much in the way of a story, interesting characters, or anything else to give you some motivation to get through these puzzles.  If you're looking for something to keep you hooked other than just puzzles, don't get this.\n\n2. Some of these puzzles aren't so much puzzles as they are trial and error until you get it right.  There were several boards where I had to finagle the inversions and flipping of the level extremely precisely to be able to get into the exit.  1 or 2 of the boards had switches that you had to hit to get into the exit and I managed to slip in during the .1-.25 seconds that I managed to land the ball on the switch before it could roll off.  I made it all the way to inverted 4-6 (Last level in the game) before I just grew frustrated with the level and looked up how to complete it.\n\nCould be fun if you like puzzle games, but there are much better ones out there.

Besides basic movement, you can tilt the levels clockwise or anticlockwise, and are also able to reverse time. Unlike Braid however, reversing time isn't used for puzzles, only to reverse a game over. The tilting can also get annoying at times, feeling more like a precision game then a puzzle game at time.\n\nNevertheless, the game does try to spice the gameplay up by adding new rules as you progress (which isn't too much, only 4 worlds and 4 mirrored but a lot harder worlds) and with a very compelling artstyle. It can really make your head spin how you character manages to traverse the levels in rather impossible forms.\n\nIs it worth full price? Maybe.

The game follows MC Escher as he travels the world of his own mind, one containing geometric figures (seemingly) defying the conventional geometry of the natural world as put forward by traditional math and physics (Isaac Newton even makes a cameo). The thing Escher's work demonstrates is that it is infact possible in two dimensions to make figures that in 3-dimensions make no sense to the human brain and have it still fit logically with mathematical and physical theory. In this way, it is a triumph of logic and the physical world over the human brain.\n\nThe early puzzles are all sort of academically logic and physics based in that once you have it solved logically you don't need much timing or mechanical skill to solve them, you simply solve the puzzle. In this way, they are much like a math or physics problem. They appear complex, but once you find the trick, the solution is easily repeatable and quite straightforward to arrive at. In these stages the game manages to blend its theme and gameplay quite flawlessly.\n\nIn the puzzles near the end, this fusion of puzzle mechanics and theme breaks down. Here the puzzles require more timing, and even once you have seen the correct solution it may prove unnattainable due to lack of coordination with the keys.\n\nFor an experienced gamer, these reflex and timing based puzzles don't offer too much of a challenge. For me, the issue is that this sort of deviates from what they seemed like they were trying to do in the earlier stages which was make puzzles that captured the logically and phyically sound spirit of MC Eschers work.","July 31, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/204240/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","The Bridge is another entry in the physics puzzle-platformer genre, and a quite ambitious entry at that!\nIt focuses on its one main mechanic, which is simply flipping the world, and its gravity with it. However, the levels are designed from the ground up to support it with a M. C. Escher-esque perspective, leading to some twisted and creative levels.\n\nThe game has 2 main sets, the second of which is a rework of the previous levels, with added elements that you learned to overcome in the first set. It seems a bit like an extended tutorial, as half of each chapter is about exposing a mechanic to the player, not being too challenging. The puzzles featured here are, in my opinion, better designed, and not difficult to actually finish once you know the solution.\nThe second, however, has a more physics-driven design, very unlike the first. This might leave you hanging a bit in the first few levels, but it's not as hard as it seemed after you realize that you actually do have to be more meticulous with the physics.\n\nIt also features a few secret Wisps (which help you interpret the story) and Achievements that can be frustrating to do if you're not using a guide, or maybe discussing clues with your friends. But none of it is mandatory, so it's a fair addition to the game.\n\n\nThe artstyle of the game is most likely its main draw. It's certainly very unique and it manages to merge its visual level design with the gameplay mechanics seamlessly.\nIf you're familiar with Escher's work, you'll certainly see where the inspiration came from! If you're not (like I was) this is certainly an opportunity to look into it, if you find this game's aesthetic interesting at all. It's certainly a great selling point, and it's always great when games manage to teach you something as subtly as The Bridge did.\n\nThe music, on the other hand, was disappointing to me. While the game is full of twisted perspectives and characters who are near madness, the music felt a bit underwhelming as a direct result. It's not bad, by any means. It's fairly minimalistic, with a few dissonant aspects to it (which I like), but I feel like the game would benefit more from something darker and more disturbing.\nWith that said, it still did its job, and added to the atmosphere.\n\n\nThe game mechanics all come down to rotating the world around you. Your goal is to reach a door, that is often locked. It can be unlocked by picking up a key, or activating a switch with one (or more) boulder(s). The objects in the levels are also subjected to gravity, however, not necessarily the same as yours. And it's basically about figuring out which path will lead a certain object where it needs to go, in often mind-bending and maze-like levels.\nThere are vortices (deactivated by a pressure plate), a curtain that negates gravity (so that you can rotate freely and change only the other objects' gravity), etc.\n\n...I almost forgot! There's also a rewind mechanic. And, of course, it made some people say the game tried to rip Braid off. Well... no. Not at all. Braid used time as its mechanic, and something needed to finish the puzzles. In The Bridge, it merely exists as a handy tool to let you undo mistakes without replaying the levels from the start.\n\nThe game has 4 chapters, each with 6 levels (and then there are an equal number of mirrored levels, which are harder and provide more plot elements -- don't consider the game finished without these!). Usually, the first 2-3 levels are about introducing a new mechanic to you, and the other 3 will use them in different ways, providing more challenging puzzles.\nI'll admit that a few levels (especially later ones) proved to be a bit difficult. A problem I've had with it, is that it's very hard to actually visualize the solution to the puzzles. It came down to identifying different possible paths, and trying them out until I was close enough to the solution to be able to do the rest easily. I believe this is inherent to the level design, as everything is almost made to trick your eyes, making it a real pain to predict where each path will take you. Adding the fact that you're constantly rotating, which confuses you even more (and may provoke motion sickness, so beware!).\nAs I said, the later ones are more physics driven, and can be substantially harder if you're not used to it.\n\nAll in all, I actually felt somewhat rewarded for finishing it all without the use of a guide (except for the wisps). Some levels took me longer than I expected, but never being too frustrating.\nAnd it was unique, so you should definitely give it a go, if you're into the genre. If you're not, it's probably not your best choice to start out, as there are other games which teach the player its tought-patterns better than The Bridge did (at least for me).\n\n\nTo end it, I just want to make a comment on the story and characters. At the end of each chapter, you'll get a sentence or two to give you a better idea of what's going on. Basically, it's a story about Escher and Newton working together. Escher, an almost mad artist, constantly trying to overcome reality, and Newton, a genius physicist, both using mathematics in unconventional ways.\nIt touches on finally finding someone as absurd as him, sharing interests, and then pursuing the impossible.\nIt's all very open to interpretation, of course, but I really liked the way it has been done. The achievements also add a bit to this, specifically the names of the ones you get from simply finishing a chapter (Thinker, Academic, Scholar, Challenger, Heretic, Outcast, Hermit, Genius)... It's definitely not the focus of a game, but I always think it's good when developers spread various elements across the game (not just in the levels, or direct exposition, but on little things like this).\n\n\n\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, I definitely recommend this game to fans of the genre. How it bridges (heh) the visual and mechanical elements of level design is awesome, and it then coats it with interesting characters and themes that should make the player interested in knowing a bit more about what it's all about.\nI've certainly enjoyed it more than I expected, and makes me look forward to the developers' next games!","September 12, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is especially true with some of the achievements and mirror levels.\n\nThat said, nothing in the game ever feels impossible.\n\nMy one gripe is the addition of hidden collectables. They are few in number, most of them aren't hard to pick up, and the game actually does have hints to find them. I'm just not a fan as they force you to think in a way disconnected from the rest of the game to interpret the hints. Luckily, there are concise guides on Steam for those (like me) without the patience for a puzzle in a puzzle.","March 25, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is simple yet highly complex and can give you many hours of gameplay if you go after all the achievements. What I liked most about this game was the difficulty curve. Most puzzle games I've played are ridiculously easy and don't pull you in. The Bridge starts off this way but provides some genuinely challenging sections as you progress. The mechanics in this game are interesting enough that even non puzzle game fans would probably enjoy this. Not a strong story line and the character doesn't pull you in as much as other puzzle games on this level (like Machinarium) but still definitely worth playing. Personally I would not pay $9.99 for this game... rather wait for it to go on sale.\n\n8/10\n\n","March 26, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Arrow keys are pretty much all you need.  Don't let that fool you though; The Bridge is as difficult as it is entertaining.\n\nThe levels look like they were taken out of an MC Escher sketch book.  You spend a lot of time spinning the world around and manipulating the gravity in order to get through each puzzle.  There are times when your eyes will decieve you, as you get lost in the beautiful sketches that are each level.\n\nThis is one of those games that you have to try.

If their goal was to make it feel like you're inside an Escher lithograph, then the developers succeeded.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging as you go on.   Wish there was a hint system or something...

Esher and solving perceptual puzzles, this indie game is just your cup of tea.  The Bridge may use some of the tired old devices of gaming like doors for levels and the like, but still manages to feel fresh due to the captivating artwork and progressive difficulty of the puzzles that you encounter at each step along the way.  It is a great casual game to have in your game portfolio for those times when you want to take a break from serious, intense games.\n\nThe game works flawlessly with an Xbox 360 controller and the controls are elegantly simple.  Make a wrong move and kill your character - no problem.  You just hit the B button to go backward in your gameplay to a safe spot of your choosing and start trying to solve the puzzle again.  Bad solutions that kill the character show up on the screen as faint images of the character where he died so that you can remember where you got into trouble as you shift the mobius board left, right and around to use game physics to help your character through the puzzle.\n\nThe detail in the drawings and the background ambient music make it a pleasure to explore each new scene and find a way to the next scene in each chapter.\n\nAnd of course there are trading cards and some nifty backgrounds that look great on a player's profile.\n\n","December 8, 2013","true","5.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The controls are very simple, but the puzzles get quite tricky.\n\nOn a gamepad, the left stick controls your character while the triggers rotate the world. That combines with physics and perspective tricks to make for some good challenges. You may need to rotate a level enough to get around to one side, but while making sure a key doesn't fall off of the level from its precarious perch.\n\nThe controls for the character feel very slow, which I would usually hate, but I think that the ability to rewind when experimenting made up for the sluggish controls.\n\nI thought that the difficulty level personally was a really satisfying curve that kept each puzzle feeling like an accomplishment without getting too hard...until the last level; I had to actually look up that single solution. My girlfriend watched and helped with some puzzles, so it only took about 2 hours or so to complete the main game.\n\nYou should buy this on sale.","March 30, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I consider myself a good puzzler and I score high in spatial orientation tests. Still, this game was too hard for me. I like puzzles that are more elegant and requires more thinking than trial and error, so the experience wasn't all that great for me. Don't be overconfident in your skills--unless you're really good or willing to use walkthroughs (which I did a few times, especially later in the game), you're probably just gonna get frustrated. So I can't really recommend it (and I actually did at first, because I really wanted to), unless you're that specific player. If you are, go for it, it's a work of art.\n\nPros:\nBeautifully drawn 2D graphics inspired by Escher's work\nAwesome BGM\n48 levels, if I counted right\nVery challenging levels should please hardcore puzzlers\nI could still enjoy it even if I had to use the walkthrough quite a few times\nCons:\nProbably way too hard for most players\nRequires a lot of trial and error and ridiculous precision, which in my opinion is (almost?) never good in a puzzle game\nTerrible difficulty curve... you get hard levels, then easier, then even harder, then easier again and so on\nI felt dizzy playing this game after constantly turning the screen around\nMovement is really slow, to the point of being annoying sometimes\nIt should be a bit easier moving between level hubs after you unlock them\nStory didn't make any sense to me... I know there was one, but I have no clue what it was about\nHints for Collector achievement are insanely hard if you don't look elsewhere\nBought on / for: Steam Store for R$ 1,99 (US$ 0.87). Money-wise, it was worth it, considering it was fun to some extent, that it has cards and how much time I spent playing it.","August 31, 2014","false","11.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","5"

The puzzles are different, but there's a time-rewind mechanic in it, too. It's used to rewind time to undo your mistakes though and it's not actually part of the puzzles. And the way the story is told is almost the same as the way Braid told its story. Most of the puzzles can be solved by sheer luck.

The Bridge thankfully avoids these pitfalls and offers a genuine puzzle-platformer experience.  The gameplay involves rotating the screen while simultaneously moving the character towards their goal--an unlocked door.  Sound easy?  Well it is...at first.  This is one of the most challenging puzzle games I've ever touched.  Any frustration generated fades away instantly as the solution aligns and warm satisfaction carries the player to the next level.  While Braid was interesting and fresh, it became unnecessarily complicated in an effort to scale with the player's progression.  On the other hand, The Bridge is an exercise in perspective rather than a gauntlet of reflex-based challenges and quite simply a joy to play.\n\nThe Good:\n- eerie sound design that never becomes excessive\n- surreal art style that feels like the offspring of M.C. Escher with Edward Gorey's eyes\n- difficult puzzles (when I say puzzles, I mean actual puzzles not reflex challenges) that merely frustrate rather than enrage\n- time reversal element similar to Braid that allows for quick adjustments instead of forcing a complete restart\n- rudimentary story that allows the player to draw their own conclusions and never gets in the way\n\nThe Bad:\n- engine can be sluggish at times (recent patches have improved this somewhat)\n- clunky installation (I have yet to uninstall, so this may have improved since launch)\n\nThe Ugly:\n- honestly, nothing; one of the rare games that shines just enough not to create an unpleasant glare","January 16, 2014","true","12.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I admire the thinking required although thinking is not one of my strong skills. This game does require immense problem solving and quite often frustrating scenarios you can't just run through with no idea what you're doing.\nThe unique visual style was interesting and quite cool being an illusion of hand drawn sketching’s, all black and white based around a much older time than we are currently living in. While the movements are simplistic and understandable each puzzle has it's complications which get more difficult as you progress.\nThe musical score of the game includes an eerie but beautiful orchestra piece witch does a brilliant job at soothing your frustration as the levels become almost impossible to figure out.\nA problem I found with the game, mainly in early levels is the amount of times you could complete a level without knowing what you did. Sometimes randomly rotating the screen will lead you the way you need therefore you aren't thinking through the decisions you should be making to work out what needs to be done.\nI thoroughly enjoyed the game regardless of the time I spent not even knowing what was happening. The game can take a variety of different times depending on the intellectual skills or lack of (in my case) the player has. The game doesn't have much replay value unless you have Alzheimer’s and you can’t remember the puzzles.\nI suggest this game to other strategists with some time on their hands. Also making your friends play this game once you've completed it is priceless. If you are into puzzle games I definitely recommend it to you.

"Its meant to be a simple game! Its a thinking game!" I completely understand that aspect, it's just that while The Bridge tells you to do its excellently designed puzzles, it does nothing to keep you wanting to do the next thing, the storyline is little to nothing and the game starts off with you as an old man trying to climb up a hill which is the most boring intro experiences ever. "Its called minimalism!" I hear you say. I get that completely but while it accomplishes that goal it gives you nothing to hold on to, nothing to make you want to come back for more.

It's a puzzler, with a quirky but pleasing art style, plenty of content, and an appropriately large level of difficulty. I might even have recommended it a few years ago. But I've since been spoiled by puzzlers of tremendous quality, like Braid, Fez, Portal, and (more controversially) The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom.\n\nIn each of the above, the puzzles are soluble only with some kind of bright spark of an idea, with a relatively simple execution. In The Bridge, the puzzles often come down to trial and error, until eventually you arrive at a relatively complex execution. So, instead of a cathartic flash of inspiration at the end of a puzzle, instead you get a mild feeling of relief as the gauntlet is over.\n\nPerhaps if The Bridge had a more engaging style, like the above puzzlers do, its more grinding puzzles would not hold it back so. As it stands, The Bridge shoots for atmospheric, which it achieves to a limited extent. However, the atmosphere is too thin and too monotonous to really persuade me to come back to it. In the end, very little motivates me to actually play the game.\n\nIf it's on sale, you might as well pick it up. Like I said, it's not an incompetent game.

The problem is that this game's difficulty comes from fighting the controls and trying to make them do what you know has to be done.

This was awesome as a puzzle experience and equally as artistic, but lost some of the emotion that Braid made you dig out of yourself.\n\nIf Braid were a 10 on platformer puzzlers, I would rate this game at a solid 8. The artistic challenges and implementations were so well done I used it in a presentation for games, but it did not capture some of the loveableness of the Braid characters and did not connect you emotionally to the physics insanities of its levels. Braid made me care about the rabid rabbit lunging at me and also care about Braid unwinding the loss of his love. Bridge only made me want to read about M.C. Escher, nothing more.\n\nDefinitely woth challening you brain. The art is only a huge ♥♥♥ bonus.

Each level has you trying to find your way through a door which you do through rotating the level (like in And Yet It Moves). You also have the ability to rewind time should you die or make a mistake (like in Braid).\n\nThe Good:\n- I really loved the visual style of the game\n-The level design is really cool with each level having an abstract art look to it\n- The puzzles provide a decent challenge\n\nThe Bad:\n-The game doesn't feel very original having used ideas already used in other games\n-The second half of the game just features mirrored versions of the levels in the first half. While these levels are more challenging than original version it would have been better to maybe have added more original levels instead.\n\nOverall this is a pretty decent game and worth picking up if you enjoy puzzle games.

I really dig the penciled, black and white art direction of The Bridge, but the puzzles will make you feel more frustrated than smart.  It takes some obvious cues from games like Braid and reminds me of Monument Valley, but the easy to understand, reasonable difficulty curve of those titles are lost on The Bridge.  You move your avatar around and tilt the game world left or right while collecting keys and avoiding falling off the map or getting hit by a death ball.  The simple concept should lend itself to clean, heady puzzles, but fails as much as it succeeds.  The line art ends up getting in the way: it can be near impossible to tell what plane your character is standing or will end up while moving.  Many of the puzzles are also physics based and it's quite easy to screw something up by (reasonably) not thinking you should be finagaling the touchy objects as much as you have to.  This leads to frustrating solutions you'll most likely solve by endless tinkering and guesswork rather than looking at a level and feeling smart by reasoning it out.","July 15, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just don't have the motivation to play the game anymore. It's painful.\n\nSo heres my review for this game:\n\nInitially The Bridge might look interesting. The game definitely has that 'indie' vibe you get from games like FTL. However everything will eventually, and quickly become boring, painful sometimes. You're going to reach the point where getting the achievements is your only motivation. But for me, I couldn't care less about that anymore.\n\nSince its an indie-game there are little mechanics. The basic being 'moving time backwards' and 'rotating the area so the orientation of gravity changes'. However you don't really have full control of the rotation due to the limit of puzzles. So none of that creating looking stuff in Portal. The game tries to be fancy by adding annoying obstacles like the 'void', but after a level or two a new toy replaces it. It's like having your gum taken away before you could finish chewing all the taste out of it. In addition, the visuals are misleading. Am I talking about the inaccessible stairs or the obvious routes you are limited to? No. See the rain (gravity) they add in stage 3.\n\nThere's so little development, all those kewl new obstacles becomes repetitive quickly. This dude is just normal. Boringly normal. Song is boring. Literally the same stuff from stage 1 to the end.\n\nThe game feels more like a chore than an interactive piece of art. I literally cannot lower my standard anymore without trying to wake myself up from bordom.\n\n\nBut ♥♥♥♥ it was just 99 cents.","September 7, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In The Bridge you play as a man with no name. He is stuck in a world so the only way to get out of it is to cross the bridge, but before doing that he must activate all 4 relics before crossing the bridge. So hows the game ? The game is an amazing piece of work that must be played by everyone who love a great game. The gameplay consist of puzzles where you have to get to a door and leave to the next area. The puzzles get seemingly difficult almost like impossible until at one time you have the I got it moment. This game also adds things like vortexes to suck you in to make it more difficult. But theres a trusty rewind option so you can go back in time to the moment where you think you made your mistake. Overall this game is amazing and you need to play it no matter what i give The Bridge a perfect score a 10/10","November 11, 2013","true","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The art is gorgeous. The story is interesting, if a bit whimsical. I couldn't bring myself to play through the mirrored levels so perhaps the story gets more fleshed out later on. If you get the game for cheap you might just appreciate the art enough to find it worth the price anyway. I guess I kind of do. I've played through much worse games because I enjoyed an aspect of it like the music.\n\nMy biggest gripes with the Bridge comes down to basically two things. The controls are kind of clumsy, and everything is SO SLOW. It's hard to be precise, and many of the puzzles requires a fair bit of precision. I very much enjoy even very hard platformers or puzzle games, when the controls are tight and you feel fully, 100% in control of what's going on. Luckily you can rewind time in this game to try again, but it takes away some of the joy when you want to do one thing and the game disagrees. It's hard to anticipate in advance what might happen when you do one thing in the more physics-heavy puzzles, which lead me to my next point. Rewinding time is slow and takes you out of the game. Restarting a puzzle takes a bunch of time as well as I had to get into the menus every time. Your character walks super slow. Gravity is low, so it takes time for things to fall in place and you to see the actions of your thoughts.\n\nNew mechanics are introduced at times but are generally poorly explained. I enjoy finding out about things on my own! But not when it involves new controls that you only find out about through random button mashing or looking at the game controls again (for an action I didn't know how/where to perform it!). I was stuck on one of the simpler puzzles halfway into the game and had to resort to a youtube video only to proclaim "how was I supposed to know I could do that!"\n\nPerhaps I was hoping for more of a pure puzzle game rather than platformer. As it is I felt I spent too much time battling the intricacies of the game and tons of trial and error rather than thinking about how to approach things logically and figure out things in my head.\n\nI have no doubt many people enjoy the game, but these are my thoughts and someone may find them interesting or to be an influence in whether the game is worth a try.","February 1, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is no jump button and the character moves like a snail.\n\nSo it's all about the puzzles, primarily based on turning the screen to change the center of gravity. And... it is quite boring and the mechanics become so intricate it becomes a chore to solve the level. It feels so tedious that I quit half-way, when I noticed that the next chapters were the same as before, but mirrored.\n\nThe mechanics to spice things up are a big stone ball that kills the player but is needed to press buttons, a vortex to suck up anything that gets close, portals that make the player change color to interact with different parts of the level in a specific order of events, and veils to modify the... well it has never been very clear to me what they do.\n\nThere isn't even a key to reset the current level, the player has to do it from the menu.\n\nLastly, the story isn't compelling.\n\nThere are clear inspirations from Braid, but it is not an experience near as enjoyable or interesting.\n\nSo I don't end on a completely negative review, I liked the art and some of the musics.","May 29, 2014","false","2.9"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","16","35","0","1"

However, after completing the first chapter (roughly 6-7 challenges) I got completely bored of the instant repetitive nature of the gameplay. As you progress, The Bridge introduces a number of new elements of challenges - for example, a wrecking ball that kills you upon touch - but even these little details will not grab hold of the gamer's attention long enough to realise that the experiences you get out of your progression is not much different from your first 10 minutes of playing.\n\nBottomline: it's a nice experience but it's not worth more than a dollar's worth of your time.

You walk around, manipulating the gravity of the world, avoiding balls of death and collecting keys. Much like braid the complexity of the puzzles increase each level and there is often a new mechanic introduced.\n\nI would say that Either you love or hate this game, its very well done, but I am personally not the correct player for this type of game so I didnt like it very much after the first 3 chapters (each chapter is 7 levels).\n\nI kind of lost interest after a while to solve the levels, so I started looking at solutions on youtube for the final 2 levels and the mirror world levels, just so I could take the achievements. All in all I played 4.2 hours, but if you solve everything yourself then I wouldnt be surprised if it will take about 7-8 hours or more.\n\n\nGraphics is as they look like in the screenshots and trailers, personally i both like and dislike them, but they work fine for the purpose.\n\n\nTechnically the game worked fine, no crashes or anything, though it seems to run quite heavy, I couldnt play youtube movies in the steam overlay without them lagging.\n\n\nI would suggest buying Braid instead of this, better graphics, better music and better gameplay. Much less frustrating and more engaging story.\nIf youve already played Braid and want something more thinking-heavy, then you should get this. Beware of annoying deaths though.","August 18, 2013","false","4.2"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","15","34","0","4"

The puzzles here are really tough and the learning curve is steep. There's a good reason for this though - once you've worked out the puzzle, that's it, it's over. It needs to be difficult to be playable at all. Which is a shame, because a game that's too hard takes away the fun of playing it. I don't feel like there's enough novelty of what you can do in this game as far as input goes - most of the game is either played in your head or trial and error. Both Braid and Limbo are better games because of this.","November 30, 2013","false","0.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I played the first 3 chapters and enjoyed them immensely. The riddles make sense and are pure logic.\nBut with chapter 4 they introduce a new element that just does not get explained and suddenly it's just try and error. There is no help in the game that explains how elements are working.\nAnd then there are bugs - I got stuck at a level in Chapter 4, so stopped playing to continue the next day. But instead of loading the correct level it was loading an already completed level. And then it jumped the one I failed previously. Given how long the title is on the market a bug they could have addressed by now.\n\nSo if you like logic riddles the first 3 chapters are among the nicest I have played in a long time. But if you find it frustrating when games go from logic to trial and error you might not want to buy this.","December 11, 2013","false","8.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

The game's biggest weakeness is that the normal game is too simple, but what seems like the "real" game, the mirror levels, is far too difficult.  The normal games puzzles are fairly easy to figure out without too much difficult, but rarely feel as rewarding as a great puzzle game often does when solving a particularly good one.  The mirror levels introduce such a level of execution difficulty that even when the solution is known, the execution level required makes the game very difficult.  Not a good endorsement of a puzzle game, in my mind.\n\nIn the end, despite completing all the normal levels and multiple mirror levels, I simply can't say this game gave me the puzzles or the satisfaction I was looking for, even when it was challenging.  Some great art and ideas, but the execution is lacking, and the cohesive whole is good, but never great.

In this modern era, most folks flock in droves mindlessly to the next huge broseph game, super sharp graphics with a simple theme using the same old formula. *Yawn* Then games like this one come along, and deserves nothing but praise, but alas, becasue of a general lack of mainstream promotions remain a "gem" in the gravel mostly passed by those who cannot think for themselves and are unable to choose what is a great game via hype trains. This was a pleasure and a joy so far. It challenges people to use a tool mostly ignored in modern gaming. A brain. (Sick burn dude) With challenging puzzles, amazing themes and mechanics, and a beautiful art style, it was a pleasure. When a puzzle is moments from being solved, and you strike that "AH-HA!" point, it feels so satisfying.\n\nNothing but props for this title. Well made and whimsical, it is something i would recommend for everyone and anyone who is willing to challenge themselves. Achievements and Badge progress for fellow farmers and a atmosphere that can stand the test of time. Amazing all around.

Escher theme that suffers from three main problems, in my opinion.  First, each level consists of one puzzle to solve and there aren't that many levels.  Second, some of the achievements seem to be bugged or are very nit-picky to achieve (being silent on the library level especially).  And third, the game tries to double its length by making "mirror" levels, which are the same levels as the first half of the game, but flipped and with a bit of added difficulty.

The puzzles excel in requiring the manipulation of the player's perspective. And The Bridge excels when its showcasing these aspects.\n\nThe puzzles are short and tight, but by the end I felt they dragged a bit. It feels a bit tedious to push through the last 8 of the 48 total chapters. The story doesnt capture you enough to draw you into the game's conclusion. It's whimsical and vague. It doesnt tease you to draw you in, it teases you with the possibility of its existence. And ultimately, the lack of a story makes the last few levels feel like a grind instead of a reveal.\n\nAppreciate The Bridge's beauty and level design but quit once you feel like you've seen enough.","November 29, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a puzzle platformer with simple controls: you can move your avatar left and right, and rotate the entire level clockwise and counterclockwise—and that's it, but it gets a lot of milage out of those simple controls, with increasingly difficult puzzles that require you to understand the game's mechanics to make it to the end of each level.\nAfter 24 levels, I thought I'd reached the end, but it turns out that this was just the halfway point, after which you're required to return to a harder version of each of the previous levels. Maybe I would have kept playing if the controls didn't feel so sluggish, or if the music hadn't become so very tedious, but at this point I've had my fill.

First, you play through all the levels, then you play the "mirrored" levels which have extra things added to them which makes the puzzles much harder. It's a cool concept and gives the game some length by bringing the total number of levels ~40-50.\n\nIn the puzzles, you can control which way the world is tilting and which direction your character walks in. By doing this, you have to get your character through a door which is the exit. All the levels follow an MC Escher type theme with impossible structures everywhere. Trying to wrap your head around the fact that the levels arent flat is one of the hardest things in the entire game. The levels starts out simple enough but then you move on to adding death balls, inversions to different colors, and veils which allow you to control the balls. The additional feature is the space bar which reverses time (Braid style) so you can fine tune your movements.\n\nThe levels have a natural challenge to them as more levels get introduced. However, the last level in the main campaign has a ridiculous difficulty spike and the last two levels of the mirrored levels are insanely complex. The difficulty jumps but for someone who is really into puzzlers, you will love it. It's only 2-3 hours with me being terrible but it’s a good length for a puzzler\n\nThere isn’t much of a story. You meet a dude and he goes through the doors. But if you read the plaques at the end of each set of rooms, you will get a sense of a scientist exploring a hypercube sort of deal (which is the mirrored). It's quite dark as each time you die, you get a message which depresses you. The music is creepy and adds to the atmosphere quite well. At the end of both the normal and mirrored edge, you try and cross a bridge... and stuff happens. I'm not sure what. But something happens. Overall, there is a story but I can’t make sense of it. However, it creates a wonderfully creepy atmosphere\n\nOverall, if you like difficult puzzlers, have fun. Otherwise, it’s not really worth your time for 10 dollars.","October 31, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It certainly thrives in originality with it's escheresque rules of geometry. Gameplay-mechanics are limited to a few dynamics that all revolve around the change or mere direction of gravitational forces.\n\nIf i were to name a con, it would be that a lot of levels are solvable without really understanding the problem it sets out for the player. You basically just fumble your way to its solution. It wasn't untill the later levels, that the factor luck is minimised and you really have to wrap your head around the screwed up little universe that is the The Bridge. The game is at its best during those stages.\n\nWhen i finished the game in its entirety without resorting to any kind of walkthroughs i couldn't help but cheer for besting it. Yet i felt a kind of regret that as a result i am forced to leave its universe.

However, due to the puzzles being more about you manipulating the environment over navigating the environment, it doesn't have the same hook as Braid and won't have the same wide appeal. (There's no platforming element or need for quick reflexes.)\n\nThe Bridge's early puzzles are too easy, but by the third room in your house they are challenging. I think it wasn't until the fourth room that I really enjoyed them because they pushed me beyond tinkering with the world to actually plan ahead to solve the puzzle.\n\nAfter completing the main game, you can run through a "mirror world" that tweaks all of the old puzzles to be much harder than before.\n\nGood puzzle game that's based on thinking instead of doing.","October 5, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are simple: A & D move you, left & right arrows spin the world, W triggers doors and inverters.  Some levels take careful planning, and even when you see how to solve the level, working out how to make it happen can be tricky as well!  6 rooms in each of 4 levels, and then the same mirrored; 48 levels in all.  I thought the mirrored levels would be simple, but while the room is a mirror of the original, there are other twists to add challenges to them as well.\n\nThe game's artwork is again, simple, but genuinely good.  The levels are black & white, but animated in a similar manner as old cartoons; things like the shading of the doors changing from frame to frame, giving it a mild flicker.  It's delightfully charming and a nice touch.\n\nOverall, a highly recommended puzzler.","August 29, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Technically a No, but with a giant asterisk.\n\nI bought this game on sale for a dollar. I definitely got my dollar's worth. I think that if I had paid full price, I would have been disappointed, but only because of the glowing 9/10 reviews. Had I expected less, I would've been more satisfied with what I got.\n\nFirst, the puzzles themselves weren't great. There was no sense of build as I went on. I never felt like I was learning more about what it meant to interact in a world of impossible shapes. I had no "Aha!" moments where a shift in my thinking made the solution obvious. More than a few times my reaction was "Really? It was that easy?" The later puzzles pile on complexity but feel more like a slog than an intricate problem.\n\nThis is compounded by the second problem: The controls feel very clunky. It makes the exploratory / trial-and-error phase of learning about the puzzles more work than fun.\n\nIt's not all bad. The art and sound design are excellent. There is some fun puzzling to be had. It's just overall the game fails to deliver. I give it 6 misspent youths out of a possible 10. If you go in expecting 9/10, you will be disappointed.","August 30, 2014","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I bought this interesting game for just 70p to see what it's like. I was rather disappointed.\nThe game delivers a nice looking world with each level that is fun to look at as the landscape is very confusing, using quirky optical illusions to distort the map. This I really liked but in the way of puzzle gameplay it was slow and not very challenging. I found I could complete most levels through just using trial and error once or twice to get to the end instead of actually using my brain to figure out where I was meant to go and how I was supposed to minipulate the terrain (yes this can be considered a fault on my part and I respect that). The one time I did use my brain to track my steps through the puzzle world was more like going through a maze than completing a puzzle, not a very puzzling level.\nAnother reason I don't recommend it is the progression through the levels is not at all rewarding. The story was not at all interesting if at all existent, and the reason I say this is because at the end of each level there was a thought for you to read. It did not tell a story or explained why this was happening, it was just nonsense. This coupled with the very uninteresting new components added each chapter, left me with no motivation to continue through the levels to discover what was at the end. It also didn't help that the character walks the pace of a snail, "If you would like to get there this life time that would be great."\nWhat I did like about the game was the ability to warp back in time when you failed, instead of completely restarting the game. Having to restart every time I died, keys flying off the map, boulders getting too up close and personal, would of been very irritating. The map design was very clever with all the optical illusions and the confusing layout, with the added art form the maps where nice to look at and very unique.\nThe game is unique with map and puzzle design but not fun to play and gives no reason to continue playing.","August 28, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were a few times I gave in and looked up the answer... only to find out that I was on the right track anyway.

The story was not at all interesting if at all existent, and the reason I say this is because at the end of each level there was a thought for you to read. It did not tell a story or explained why this was happening, it was just nonsense. This coupled with the very uninteresting new components added each chapter, left me with no motivation to continue through the levels to discover what was at the end. It also didn't help that the character walks the pace of a snail, "If you would like to get there this life time that would be great."\nWhat I did like about the game was the ability to warp back in time when you failed, instead of completely restarting the game. Having to restart every time I died, keys flying off the map, boulders getting too up close and personal, would of been very irritating. The map design was very clever with all the optical illusions and the confusing layout, with the added art form the maps where nice to look at and very unique.\nThe game is unique with map and puzzle design but not fun to play and gives no reason to continue playing.","August 28, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought the mirrored levels would be simple, but while the room is a mirror of the original, there are other twists to add challenges to them as well.\n\nThe game's artwork is again, simple, but genuinely good.  The levels are black & white, but animated in a similar manner as old cartoons; things like the shading of the doors changing from frame to frame, giving it a mild flicker.

I thought a long time before I bought it and it was (and is) worth every penny. There is not so much of a story in the game so you shouldn't buy it because of a great mystery story or something like that. The artwork however is great and the riddles are clever, challenging and never unfair. You can try a dozen times and if you make a mistake you can rewind (like in prince of persia sot) and try something other. Mostly you can solve the riddles with pure logic - sometimes you will try and error over and over. The game still does not get boring because each riddle is another challenge with other problems. What I really like about the game is that at the firs minute you think "Oh, that is ginna be easy" just to be proven wrong a minute later. The first thing you have to do in each riddle is to figure out the mechanics (like in myst) only then you will have the chance to solve the riddle. It is so much fun and there are so many riddles (I'm still not through with the game after many hours of gameplay) and even the steam challenges are real challenges and (with one exception) solvable with some thinking. You will also fall in love with the beautifully handrawn black and white artwork and the minimalistic but fitting soundtrack. Buy the game if you like riddle games that really are challenging and really give you satisfaction after solving a riddle. The pure "Let's Play" hits on youtube should be proof enough that this game absolutely is worth it!","December 22, 2013","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Escher. If you don't know who that it is, it doesn't really matter as the game stands alone well enough. The puzzles are complex enough to be challenging at times but not in a cerebral manner. More often than not I knew what I was supposed to do to finish the puzzle, I simply had difficulty doing it because it required a precise maneuver. This became very frustrating to me at times as on some of the levels I ended up getting smashed by the little lion marble things over and over again simply because I couldn't fall or move precisely right. Having also played games like Antichamber, Portal and Portal 2, I found this games puzzles to be much more annoying than the puzzles which those games present (which wasn't a good thing) as the puzzles of those games didn't rely so much on that precision.\n\nIn many ways, the game is essentially a digital version of this little marble game I played as a kid. The game consisted of a marble which you had to guide (by titling the board) through a maze rife with holes. If your marble fell into one of the holes as you were tilting the board, you had to start over. The game was never a riddle as you knew you had to tilt the board to get by the holes, but it was difficult because of the skill required to move the marble precisely how you wanted. The Bridge is basically an updated version of this.\n\nThe game does boast a fairly unique build and look and the artwork at times is intriguing. There is little to no storyline however and what little they do incorporate is very esoteric. The game does feature an interesting soundtrack, but it is underutilized.\n\nThe gameplay was interesting enough to me to finish it (which took less than ten hours) and so I think I can recommend it if you can purchase it while the game is on sale. If it's not, you may not feel like you're getting your money's worth and you probably shouldn't buy it. If, in the end, you are an enthusiast of Escher's artwork and impossible figures and structures (such as endless staircases etc) then it may be worth the full price of the game, but otherwise just wait for the price to drop.","December 26, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's advertised as a strategy (puzzle) game and that's what it is (no problems there).  All the puzzles are interesting and involve walking through an environment, rotating that environment, and inverting yourself.  In general, each "level" consists of multiple "stages."  The early stages in each level tend to be easy and the final ones tend to be hard.  Again, no problem.  What I have issue with is that several of the puzzles hide the mechanism for solving it instead of just making the solution more complex.  Specifically, there are broken edges to the world that in almost every case, you can't walk/rotate around.  But, in a couple of puzzles, you can (and must).  There's also a problem with the velocity of the transit.  And then, there's the final Steam Achievement:  Collector.  It's pure gamification.  There's not a chance in the world that anyone could ever find more than one of these naturally.  The only way to find them is to do a search online.  Because of this unnecessary frustration, I was "this close" to rating the game down.  But, I did get several hours of thought out of the game.  So, I'm sticking with a Thumbs Up.","December 26, 2013","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a legendary puzzler, nor is it anything to brush aside. The Bridge has wonderful artwork, charming music, and a interesting story. But the level designs fall through after time. They become less of a challenge to solve and more of an art piece to admire and turn. Gameplay is also rather short. It might take you maybe one to two hours to complete the first world before unlocking the dark version of the game, which is about the same length. It's a very short game with not much to enjoy after. But once you start playing it, it's a delight.\n\n\nI do recommend this.

Escher's works. It's main feature is its crazy impossible space and really cool space manipulation mechanics. It also features some time-manipulation mechanic that reminds me of Braid - You can rewind time if you make mistakes, so there isn't really a "game-over" state.\n\nFor the most part, solving a level is just a matter of figuring out how to navigate the weird space you find yourself in. That is not an easy feat since you can easily get disoriented by the impossible geometry. In a few levels timing your moves plays significant role too.\n\nThere are 4 worlds with about 6 levels each. In each world a new gameplay mechanic is added making the game more complex the further you progress. After you complete the game, you can revisit each level in a 'mirrored' mode which features new and more difficult puzzles.\n\nDepending on your ability and on how much time you spend looking for hidden items and completing achievements, the game can probably take anywhere between 4 to 10 hours. It took me about 7; although I did use a guide to find in what levels each of the hidden items are located, I did take me a while to finish some of the harder levels.\n\n\nSo, if you like puzzle platformers and enjoy M.C. Escher's works, you'll definitely like this game!\n","December 26, 2013","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The premise is that you navigate a series of mathematical constructs based on the work of M C Escher. Each construct is a separate self contained puzzle where you must manipulate gravity by rotating the world and eventually reach the exit.\n\nEschers drawings were already a marvel to try and navigate in a visual sense and placing them into a game such as this now enables you to actually explore them! The art style also matches this concept perfectly by closely replicating the original Escher drawings and does not distract from solving the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves start off fairly simple and I was able to fly through the first three areas fairly quickly. Although, the difficulty really ramps up in the second half of the game. That being said solving the puzzles felt intuitive and I never had to resort to fast timing or twitch mechanics. That being said, once I had a handle of how all the gravity mechanics worked together the last few puzzles did not provide as much of a challenge as I was expecting.\n\nA few other features that I really appreciated were the ability to rewind time and the visual cues that were used to indicate how gravity applied to each different object on screen. The visual cues were especially useful late game when there were often multiple gravity effects in play at one time. Also, the ability to simply rewind time and undo mistakes encouraged experimentation and trial and error, which was perfect when I couldn't immediately see the solution to a puzzle. Although, I felt that sometimes I could just trial and error all the way to a solution without ever actually 'solving' it.\n\nAll in all I did rather enjoy playing The Bridge, the puzzles were challenging for the most part while not becoming utterly frustrating. Not as inspired as the likes of Braid but there were definitely some interesting mechanics. Would recommend for sure.","January 29, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is beautifully drawn and boasts a unique style of gameplay. A definite must for Escher fans. The nature of the puzzles takes some time to get used to and the first half of the game isn't too difficult. In saying that, I spent a good deal of my hours played on the last half of the game, when the puzzles proved a lot more difficult. This game is a workout for the brain. Not much going on control wise.... walk left, walk right, tilt left, tilt right. It's just when to do what and how much of it to do that really matters in this game. Too much tilt and you can find yourself falling straight off the map.\n\nI found this game challenging enough. Each puzzle could be solved within a reasonable amount of time and it did not make me want to throw my computer out the window....which is always a good thing. Combine the puzzles with the artwork and gameplay and you have yourself a very enjoyable game. I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games and give it a 9 out of 10.

If you like perspective and logic puzzles this is not to be missed.\n\nThe dreamy hand drawn and monochramic art style is full of great little details and the different level elements really come into prominence when you start rotating and using the stage. In one level I hadn't noticed that the 'log' on the ground was actually a lit candle when the stage was rotated 90 degrees and the candle was suddenly upright. Flourishes like how the character is sketched into each level, and the way a  'trace' of him is left each time you fail and rewind, lend a lot of personality to the game as well. It feels like an Escher drawing so it really does feel like we're in the playground of his imagination.\n\nI play puzzle games in small bursts but I can already tell that The Bridge is one of those special games where I will be eager to tackle and finish the puzzles and the game, but I'll also be hoping that the game won't end any time soon.\n\nGreat  stuff.\n\nA+","June 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But that one at least was fun.\n\nGraphics style is good.\nMusic is basically missing and the few chords get annoying soon.\nThe first three worlds are way too simple.\nThe fourth world gets interesting and challenging, but it never explains the gravity changing principles properly, you're likely to search for help online.\nThe last level and the following "mirrored worlds" are based on ugly gimmicks, like pixel positioning. Many parts of that are no longer a puzzle game, but something like a reverse platformer (try to hit that ledge with that ball by controlling gravity).\nYou never know what you can step on (and from which angle) and what is just decoration.\nThe loading times are terrible.\n\nBut worst of all, the whole game is unbelievably slow. All animations take eternity, the gravity rotation is very slow, the game time can't be sped up, and reversing time is tiringly slow as well (if you spent 2 minutes without movement just pondering about the level and then want to return past that point, you're going to spend a lot of time looking at a still character). The whole game is so lazy, that it took me all my will to continue with more levels in the mirrored worlds. It's just wasting your time instead of letting you play. And all of that could be solved so easily - let people skip initial level animations, and add a button to speed up game time.

The pacing is nice in the first half, but slows down later. Some players may find the obscure storyline annoying, but the story is mostly in the background. There's a surprising amount of puzzle variation for only having 4 real buttons for controls. Keyboard controls fine, nothing requires analog controls.\n\nI'm not really sure what to think of the game after finishing it. The story is interesting but feels incomplete. The second half of the game gets a bit busy with too many objects to manipulate. New mechanics are added for only a few levels, and are not cleanly introduced.\n\nI like the game, but the later levels became a bit of a drag, to the point that I just needed walkthroughs as I didn't want to spend a lot of time with uncompelling puzzles. So it's good early, becomes a bit too precision-based in the very end. Not too frustrating, but I've had better puzzles. It's good, but not a rush-buy at full price. I'd recommend the game to puzzle fans for at least 50% off, under $5 USD.","January 28, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thinking of it as a platformer. Don't even try to jump, and physics is most definitely not on your side.\n\nThe Bridge is an exercise in being both omnipotent and powerless. Omnipotent: you are the master of gravity. Powerless: Everything follows a rule. Clear-cut, and terrifying rules that force you to progressively learn on the fly about a world so infuriatingly similar to ours. Luck plays no part in The Bridge. Just as you are accountable for every mistake, you are accountable for every victory. Omnipotent and powerless. Challenging and satisfying.\n\nThough it is by no means unsuitable for hour-long binges, The Bridge is just as enjoyable, or even more so, when played one level a session. Do not be fooled; a level is not two minutes of jumping and turtle-stomping. It is, however, refreshingly perfect for a break from work.\n\nThe backdrop of simple grayscale colours on the marvellous works inspired by M. C. Escher (I tell you, art is better than drugs) are the icing on the cake. Not only are they beautiful, but they are cornerstones of the game's mechanics: black and white are not the same, and no shape or movement. is impossible.","September 20, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Escher. If you don't know who that it is, it doesn't really matter as the game stands alone well enough. The puzzles are complex enough to be challenging at times but not in a cerebral manner. More often than not I knew what I was supposed to do to finish the puzzle, I simply had difficulty doing it because it required a precise maneuver. This became very frustrating to me at times as on some of the levels I ended up getting smashed by the little lion marble things over and over again simply because I couldn't fall or move precisely right. Having also played games like Antichamber, Portal and Portal 2, I found this games puzzles to be much more annoying than the puzzles which those games present (which wasn't a good thing) as the puzzles of those games didn't rely so much on that precision.\n\nIn many ways, the game is essentially a digital version of this little marble game I played as a kid. The game consisted of a marble which you had to guide (by titling the board) through a maze rife with holes. If your marble fell into one of the holes as you were tilting the board, you had to start over. The game was never a riddle as you knew you had to tilt the board to get by the holes, but it was difficult because of the skill required to move the marble precisely how you wanted. The Bridge is basically an updated version of this.\n\nThe game does boast a fairly unique build and look and the artwork at times is intriguing. There is little to no storyline however and what little they do incorporate is very esoteric. The game does feature an interesting soundtrack, but it is underutilized.\n\nThe gameplay was interesting enough to me to finish it (which took less than ten hours) and so I think I can recommend it if you can purchase it while the game is on sale. If it's not, you may not feel like you're getting your money's worth and you probably shouldn't buy it. If, in the end, you are an enthusiast of Escher's artwork and impossible figures and structures (such as endless staircases etc) then it may be worth the full price of the game, but otherwise just wait for the price to drop.","December 26, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not comparable to Antichamber.\nGameplay: 9/10 - Clever use of grinning balls of doom, spaghettifying not-black holes, keys, sliding doors, and plain old gravity make this puzzle-by-puzzle game appealing. It could do with a little more explanation, though. The puzzles are deceptively simple in most cases, but nonetheless require a significant amount of brainpower. Don't expect to simply sit down and beat the game; breaks are mandatory.\nStory: 7/10 - You get doses of story at the end of each chapter, but there seems to be no way to go back and view them again, making it very difficult to piece the whole shebang together into some notion of what is going on.\nInterface and Graphics: 9/10 - The Bridge utilizes its own unique style of graphics, where black-and-white figures are drawn before you at the start of each level. The animations show stray pencil marks flashing in and out of existence around the characters, as if they are constantly being redrawn at 60 DPS (draws per second). The interface, and all text, all appears charmingly hand-drawn.\nOverall: 8.75/10 - Worth a buy, especially if you get it on sale. Not for the faint of mind.

The premise is that you navigate a series of mathematical constructs based on the work of M C Escher. Each construct is a separate self contained puzzle where you must manipulate gravity by rotating the world and eventually reach the exit.\n\nEschers drawings were already a marvel to try and navigate in a visual sense and placing them into a game such as this now enables you to actually explore them! The art style also matches this concept perfectly by closely replicating the original Escher drawings and does not distract from solving the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves start off fairly simple and I was able to fly through the first three areas fairly quickly. Although, the difficulty really ramps up in the second half of the game. That being said solving the puzzles felt intuitive and I never had to resort to fast timing or twitch mechanics. That being said, once I had a handle of how all the gravity mechanics worked together the last few puzzles did not provide as much of a challenge as I was expecting.\n\nA few other features that I really appreciated were the ability to rewind time and the visual cues that were used to indicate how gravity applied to each different object on screen. The visual cues were especially useful late game when there were often multiple gravity effects in play at one time. Also, the ability to simply rewind time and undo mistakes encouraged experimentation and trial and error, which was perfect when I couldn't immediately see the solution to a puzzle.

They do a great job with the difficulty curve: every level felt like it was just a little bit harder than the last one, and I didn't experience any big difficulty spikes.

The puzzles excel in requiring the manipulation of the player's perspective. And The Bridge excels when its showcasing these aspects.\n\nThe puzzles are short and tight, but by the end I felt they dragged a bit. It feels a bit tedious to push through the last 8 of the 48 total chapters. The story doesnt capture you enough to draw you into the game's conclusion. It's whimsical and vague. It doesnt tease you to draw you in, it teases you with the possibility of its existence. And ultimately, the lack of a story makes the last few levels feel like a grind instead of a reveal.\n\nAppreciate The Bridge's beauty and level design but quit once you feel like you've seen enough.","November 29, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some are comparing it to Braid, but the only part that's the same is that you need to rewind time when you die.\n\nThe reason for the low rating is because the puzzles are way too easy. Unless you're brand new to puzzle games, you'll breeze through the first half.

It certainly thrives in originality with it's escheresque rules of geometry. Gameplay-mechanics are limited to a few dynamics that all revolve around the change or mere direction of gravitational forces.\n\nIf i were to name a con, it would be that a lot of levels are solvable without really understanding the problem it sets out for the player. You basically just fumble your way to its solution. It wasn't untill the later levels, that the factor luck is minimised and you really have to wrap your head around the screwed up little universe that is the The Bridge. The game is at its best during those stages.\n\nWhen i finished the game in its entirety without resorting to any kind of walkthroughs i couldn't help but cheer for besting it.

First, you play through all the levels, then you play the "mirrored" levels which have extra things added to them which makes the puzzles much harder. It's a cool concept and gives the game some length by bringing the total number of levels ~40-50.\n\nIn the puzzles, you can control which way the world is tilting and which direction your character walks in. By doing this, you have to get your character through a door which is the exit. All the levels follow an MC Escher type theme with impossible structures everywhere. Trying to wrap your head around the fact that the levels arent flat is one of the hardest things in the entire game. The levels starts out simple enough but then you move on to adding death balls, inversions to different colors, and veils which allow you to control the balls. The additional feature is the space bar which reverses time (Braid style) so you can fine tune your movements.\n\nThe levels have a natural challenge to them as more levels get introduced. However, the last level in the main campaign has a ridiculous difficulty spike and the last two levels of the mirrored levels are insanely complex. The difficulty jumps but for someone who is really into puzzlers, you will love it. It's only 2-3 hours with me being terrible but it’s a good length for a puzzler\n\nThere isn’t much of a story. You meet a dude and he goes through the doors. But if you read the plaques at the end of each set of rooms, you will get a sense of a scientist exploring a hypercube sort of deal (which is the mirrored). It's quite dark as each time you die, you get a message which depresses you. The music is creepy and adds to the atmosphere quite well. At the end of both the normal and mirrored edge, you try and cross a bridge... and stuff happens. I'm not sure what. But something happens. Overall, there is a story but I can’t make sense of it. However, it creates a wonderfully creepy atmosphere\n\nOverall, if you like difficult puzzlers, have fun. Otherwise, it’s not really worth your time for 10 dollars.","October 31, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A must-have for puzzle game connoisseurs.\n\nA great puzzle game with a simple but interesting mechanic. The art style looks absolutely amazing, and the puzzles themselves are well-designed. The impossible architectures that are in the levels are intriguing. It reminded me a bit of Braid, mostly because of the art style, but The Bridge's main mechanic, the rotation is original, as far as I know. There is also a time-rewinding mechanic in the game, so you can undo your mistakes if yu happen to mess up, which is a nice addition, since you don't have to restart the entire level in case you fail.\n\nThere are many levels to play and collectibles to find, and after your first playthrough an alternative world is unlocked, in which you can play through more difficult versions of the original levels. I only had problems with 1-2 levels, the others can be figured out easily, or with a bit of thinking and planning.\n\nTo sum this review up, The Bridge is a very ambitious puzzle game with puzzles revolving around a simple mechanic, and with an amazing art style. I'd highly recommend it.\n\nEdit: paraghraps","November 1, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's advertised as a strategy (puzzle) game and that's what it is (no problems there).  All the puzzles are interesting and involve walking through an environment, rotating that environment, and inverting yourself.  In general, each "level" consists of multiple "stages."  The early stages in each level tend to be easy and the final ones tend to be hard.  Again, no problem.  What I have issue with is that several of the puzzles hide the mechanism for solving it instead of just making the solution more complex.  Specifically, there are broken edges to the world that in almost every case, you can't walk/rotate around.  But, in a couple of puzzles, you can (and must).  There's also a problem with the velocity of the transit.  And then, there's the final Steam Achievement:  Collector.  It's pure gamification.  There's not a chance in the world that anyone could ever find more than one of these naturally.  The only way to find them is to do a search online.  Because of this unnecessary frustration, I was "this close" to rating the game down.  But, I did get several hours of thought out of the game.  So, I'm sticking with a Thumbs Up.","December 26, 2013","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a legendary puzzler, nor is it anything to brush aside. The Bridge has wonderful artwork, charming music, and a interesting story. But the level designs fall through after time. They become less of a challenge to solve and more of an art piece to admire and turn. Gameplay is also rather short. It might take you maybe one to two hours to complete the first world before unlocking the dark version of the game, which is about the same length. It's a very short game with not much to enjoy after. But once you start playing it, it's a delight.\n\n\nI do recommend this.

Escher's works. It's main feature is its crazy impossible space and really cool space manipulation mechanics. It also features some time-manipulation mechanic that reminds me of Braid - You can rewind time if you make mistakes, so there isn't really a "game-over" state.\n\nFor the most part, solving a level is just a matter of figuring out how to navigate the weird space you find yourself in. That is not an easy feat since you can easily get disoriented by the impossible geometry. In a few levels timing your moves plays significant role too.\n\nThere are 4 worlds with about 6 levels each. In each world a new gameplay mechanic is added making the game more complex the further you progress. After you complete the game, you can revisit each level in a 'mirrored' mode which features new and more difficult puzzles.\n\nDepending on your ability and on how much time you spend looking for hidden items and completing achievements, the game can probably take anywhere between 4 to 10 hours. It took me about 7; although I did use a guide to find in what levels each of the hidden items are located, I did take me a while to finish some of the harder levels.\n\n\nSo, if you like puzzle platformers and enjoy M.C. Escher's works, you'll definitely like this game!\n","December 26, 2013","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It layers each of its mechanics slowly, and, before you know it, you’re stumped in a puzzle where gravity is sideways, alternate gravity is upside-down, the map screen is tilted at a 45-degree angle, and the Newton-wannabe that you control is falling off of the platform.  Luckily, when you die, you can rewind time in a very Braid-like manner to re-attempt the puzzle. The game is built on the ability to rotate the screen, changing the gravity for the protagonist and allowing him to access otherwise unreachable destinations. In each puzzle, you must get a key and go through a door. This simple goal becomes complicated when the Escher-inspired puzzles begin rotating.  As you explore more puzzles, other features are introduced: a white plane and a black plane, the ability to change or align these planes’ gravity, and a portal that flips the 2D puzzle entirely.\n\nI find the black-and-white art beautiful, but it’s distracting or obscuring in some puzzles. The story also takes a note from Braid: minor bits after a few puzzles, fed to you with a vague, heavy hand. I’m not sure where the Faux Newton plot is going, but I don’t care.

In saying that, I spent a good deal of my hours played on the last half of the game, when the puzzles proved a lot more difficult. This game is a workout for the brain. Not much going on control wise.... walk left, walk right, tilt left, tilt right. It's just when to do what and how much of it to do that really matters in this game. Too much tilt and you can find yourself falling straight off the map.\n\nI found this game challenging enough. Each puzzle could be solved within a reasonable amount of time and it did not make me want to throw my computer out the window....which is always a good thing. Combine the puzzles with the artwork and gameplay and you have yourself a very enjoyable game. I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games and give it a 9 out of 10. Points lost because it just ended all too quickly for me. I wanted more!!!","July 10, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Technically a No, but with a giant asterisk.\n\nI bought this game on sale for a dollar. I definitely got my dollar's worth. I think that if I had paid full price, I would have been disappointed, but only because of the glowing 9/10 reviews. Had I expected less, I would've been more satisfied with what I got.\n\nFirst, the puzzles themselves weren't great. There was no sense of build as I went on. I never felt like I was learning more about what it meant to interact in a world of impossible shapes. I had no "Aha!" moments where a shift in my thinking made the solution obvious. More than a few times my reaction was "Really? It was that easy?" The later puzzles pile on complexity but feel more like a slog than an intricate problem.\n\nThis is compounded by the second problem: The controls feel very clunky. It makes the exploratory / trial-and-error phase of learning about the puzzles more work than fun.\n\nIt's not all bad. The art and sound design are excellent. There is some fun puzzling to be had. It's just overall the game fails to deliver. I give it 6 misspent youths out of a possible 10. If you go in expecting 9/10, you will be disappointed.","August 30, 2014","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game works at your pace, with a huge diversity of puzzles, and potentaily hours of entertainment (it depends what pace you work at, of course).\nThe graphics are charming, and the controls are quite unique (though I always feel bad for the little character when I'm screwing with the gravity).\nI enjoyed the confusion other people seemed to have when I handed them my laptop and let them have a go, and I'm proud to boast that I finished the game having never looked up the answers ( I did need some help with the "collector" achievement, though).\n\nFantastic game.

Much of the game can be beaten with trial and error, and the answers generally unravel themselves as you explore each stage. More and more creative elements are introduced as you make your way through different doors. Once there are 4 or 5 new methods and tools for solving puzzles, the game gets interesting and is actually quite challenging at a few instances. I can say that I definitely had to invent a few rules reminiscent of right hand rules of eletromagnetism in order to keep track of which objects had which orientations of gravity. Cool concept, but not much more than a stage-by-stage puzzle solving game.\n\nThe artwork is very surreal, I mean, I'm sure if you're reading this, you can obvioiusly see pictures of the levels and things, and if your main concern is that  it wil not live up to what it appears to be, well, don't worry, its pretty much exactly how you imagine and will be fun if that's what you're looking for.\n\nThere are a second set of "reverse" levels that I haven't attempted yet, although, if I need a time waster and something to give me a bit of stimulation, I may play the harder reverse versions of the levels. As far as I can tell they are the same levels, in reverse, with more obstacles.

Took me under 3 hours to beat the main story but it has decent replay value with all 4 chapters mirrored once you're finished for a real challenge.","March 19, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However there is less of a curve, and more a random staggering of difficulty. The story (there isn't much of one) is absent from the early part of the game I played before losing my patience. Essentially the total lack of investment combines with one of the harder puzzles and it becomes pretty difficult to push myself to keep going or trying.\n\nOverall it's a decent game, but given its lack of any apparent narrative depth, and the seemingly random variations in difficulty; I can't recommend it at full price.","May 12, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rewind mechanic is one of the more forgiving aspects of this game, similar to the Prince of Persia's dagger, but without a time limit. The puzzles were engaging enough that I remained invested in playing through to the finish.\n\nCons: Puzzles range from really simple to extremely difficult. I didn't mind using video walkthroughs for some of them, but while some puzzles were easy enough once you figured out the trick, others I wouldn't have figured out without the walkthrough (i.e. using momentum).\n\nBottom line: I would recommend playing through it once, but for me it doesn't hold a lot of replay value.","June 26, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first it didn't seem as bad as advertised but at about an hour in things got real.

Levels are usually very easy or very hard, with not much inbetween. Within a couple hours you'll probably find yourself stuck. Puzzle games like this are a matter of patience, and I don't want to spend an hour solving a single puzzle. I don't get enough satisfaction from such a play session to want to have many more like it.\n\nI beat a bunch of the early levels really fast and then spent a lot of time on the later levels. A couple times I ended up using a walkthrough for help, but yeah, that didn't feel too good.\nAfter completing all 24 of the game's original levels you get to play extra challenging versions of those levels. They get new twists so you have to solve them in completely different ways. I beat a couple of the edited-version levels and then decided I didn't want to play the game anymore.\n\nIf you want a unique puzzle game and you have a ton of time and patience, and you're willing to spend half an hour experimenting on a level and still have no clue how to beat it, then this game is for you!\n\nIn all seriousness, this really is a well-designed puzzle game. I kinda feel bad for not recommending it, but the game just isn't for me. There is a small audience that will love this game, but make sure you think about it hard before deciding whether or not to get it.","July 1, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Regardless of a few smaller issues, there are still a ton of memorable maps which pay optical and physical illusions enough respect, while balancing player fun enough to mix good parts from both and make The Bridge an artistic puzzle platformer well worth grabbing.\n\nHighlights\nThe best parts of The Bridge are exactly what you see on the store front, a beautiful and imaginative art style that's unique and different enough to set this apart from others. The Bridge doesn't overstay its welcome, and the pleasant U.I. and ambiance serve to keep it casual and relaxing.\n\n* Each level feels new and is a pleasure to explore. The floating design on the distant background helps everything feel dreamlike\n\nMistakes\nThere are a few moments where you actively need to think about how to approach the landscape and physics represented in the level, and suddenly you'll realize how to approach it and solve the problem, but these moments are too few and on the whole you'll be wrestling with momentum or gravity to move your character to the correct position, which feels a little too cheap and shallow.\n\n* A distinct lack of music or even distinct ambient sounds is a loss, and would've worked to greatly compliment the art style\n* The collectibles add nothing to the game, and are frustrating to collect, but can safely be ignored\n* There's a ridiculous spike in difficulty on levels 4-5 that's very jarring\n\nRecommendations\nThe Bridge clocks in with around 4-5 hours gameplay and may feel just a touch too highly priced on Steam at £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 when compared to other entries in this genre which are available for cheaper. When viewed alone, it's still a very reasonable price, and if you're a puzzler veteran, you'll probably see this as above average value for money, especially considering it regularly goes on sale for -80% and -90%, leaving it at just $0.99\n\n* Due to the Developers confessed inspiration from, and love of the Braid game, and given the title of the game, it's possible that there's a subtly hidden story or message contained throughout the game and some fan theories make for some interesting ideas\n* There's a great AMA/Q&A with the Developers on reddit that's worth a read\n* There's a free Trial/Demo version of The Bridge available on XBOX Live[marketplace.xbox.com]\n* The whole of Chapter 1 can be completed entirely without walking","June 29, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
