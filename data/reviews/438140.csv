Both players always start with the same base cards and then buy other cards from any of the factions from the trade row, the goal is then to use your cards to eliminate all of your opponent's health.\n\nThe game is quickly learned and sessions can either be done very quick, or over the course of a longer period by playing with 48 hour turns. There are online leaderboards where your progression is stored and as you go up in rank you earn more avatars -- everything else in the game remains the same so you are only held back by your skill.\nThe free game already comes with singleplayer campaign that functions like a tutorial, but the full game adds online multiplayer, as well as additional campaign levels and increases the AI battles to three difficulty settings.\nOn top of that there are currently three expansions that change the game in various ways. By signing up for a Star Realms username you keep access to any expansions (including the full game) on all platforms if you buy them here, likewise if you already have any of the expansions you can easily restore them to the Steam version and keep playing.\n\nIf you like strategic card games, Star Realms is a really great entry. Give it a try and maybe we'll meet in multiplayer :)","March 8","true","3.8"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","41","50","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/recommended/438140/","stubar","stubar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/","1648 products in account","Star Realms is a self-contained deck-building game.  This is great news for me, as I like card games but the business models of some other deck-builders that can involve hundreds of dollars of investment generally puts me off playing this genre.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtdiNXhtDiY\n\nThe first thing I feel that needs to be addressed is the F2P status on Steam.  Some people seem upset that the game is displayed as "Free to Play" but in fact this gives you access to no more than a demo: you'll get the do the tutorial, play the first campaign and challenge the AI on easy mode.  If you want access to the other AI modes, the full campaign and most importantly the online play you'll need to buy the "Full Game" DLC.  Which costs £4 in my country, what's that?  $6?\n\nSo why has the developer decided to approach the game this way?  Well, the motivation is actually a good one.  Buying the game on any platform (mobile or steam) gives you access across all platforms.  So you won't have to rebuy the game on mobile if you enjoy it on Steam.  This is a refreshing attitude in an era where a lot of developers/publishers are cash-grabbing at every opportunity.  A lot of the negative reviews for Star Realms are due to the fact the game states F2P and really it isn't, but once you understand that you are getting the game across all platforms for one price I don't see any reason to complain!\n\nSo the game...  You have three stats that effect your strategy: damage, health and trade.  As the game progresses the key to success is balancing these stats as well as of course managing your deck.  Both players start with identical hands and deck management is achieved by buying new cards (ships and bases) through the trade you obtain and scrapping weaker cards via the special abilities on some ships or bases.\n\nThe ships and bases all belong to one of four factions (there is one exception).  Many of the cards have an additional action or boost to its stats if it is in play at the same time as a card from the same faction.  So collecting cards from the same faction will improve the overall power of your deck.\n\nA little bit of luck certainly helps whilst playing too.  Getting access to the right cards at the right times can make a big difference.  Understanding the game and being able to adapt your strategy is more important though.  So while a bit of luck can make a big difference, in the long run victory will come down to how good your strategy is.\n\nThe graphics are nice and clear and represent the game well.  It looks identical on smart phone and also plays identical.  One slight issue I had on my Z3 Compact phone that due to the display being fairly small it was tough to see the detail on some of the cards.  I can imagine learning on a display that size would be really difficult.  Of course this is no problem in the Steam version!\n\nI love the sound track!!  It may be slightly generic space music playing on a loop but it has a kind of epic feel to it.  Suits the game perfectly.\n\nThe online community is great too.  I've found I had to wait no longer than 30 seconds to find a match and most of the time I get matched instantly.  Obviously the benefit of cross-platform and a benefit of the aforementioned business model discussed earlier.  It would’ve been nice to have an in-game chat function, I guess this is one disadvantage to playing cross-platform to people on their smartphones without access to a keyboard.\n\nPlaying versus the AI's is really fun.  I'm not one for playing against bots, but I find the AI challenging and the biggest advantage is not having to wait for a human player to make their turn.  Although turns are generally quite fast in Star Realms, the length of time taken per turn generally increases as the game progresses.  This is due to more complex cards being introduced to the decks via trade purchases and players using the special abilities of their ships and bases.\n\nI was a little underwhelmed by the campaign mission I attempted.  The boss fight has special rules that removed most the fun from the game.  The core game is the 1v1 and that is where the game is at in my opinion, playing vs AI or a human opponent.\n\nBest thing to do if you are on the fence about whether to purchase is download the free version, play the quick tutorial and then practise against the Easy AI for a bit.  You'll soon know whether to invest a further £4 for the full game.\n\nThere is additional DLC available that introduces more ships/bases and also events.  I'm having so much fun in the base game that after 17 hours of game I really don't want to upset the perfect balance the base game provides!  Not that I honestly expect it to!  If you do play against someone online that has paid for the DLC you will also have access to the exact same cards.  So there is no P2W here.  Good stuff!!\n\nMassive thumbs up to Star Realms!!  Strongly recommended.","March 15","true","60.9"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","32","38","2","2"

It's a strategic deckbuilder game where being familiar with the cards is an advantage. Games are fast, and if both players know what they're doing, are very close.\n\nI had this game on Android and would play it all the time against the AI and real opponents.\n\nFirst few games should go like this:\n\n1st game, figuring out the mechanics, lose to AI.\n2nd game, try out some strategies, maybe spamming one faction, lose to AI.\n3rd game, realize how good scrapping and deck optimization is, lose to AI, maybe win a few games.\n4th game, lose to AI because it spammed bases, try out the strategy.\n5th game and on, at this point you're probably familiar with most of the good cards, have a few games with huge draw cards combos and fleet hq and completely overkill the opponent.\n\nIt really boils down to internalizing the relative value of cards and possible events.\n\nEDIT: People are being bitter about this game being marked as F2P. It's more like free to try. It says it on the page the full version costs $5.

It really is an engaging and accessible deck-building game with clever strategies and a beautiful science-fiction theme.\n\nThe premise is simple:\nYou and your opponent start off with the same basic hand, and take turns whittling down the other's Authority (health) from 50 to 0. You compete to purchase cards from the Trade Row (5 cards in the middle) to assemble a stronger fleet (deck) and then crush your opponent with it. Your hand will become unique as the game plays, hence the "deck-building" aspect.\n\nThere are some really interesting card combinations and great strategies which allow experimentation with the game's 4 factions. Each offer unique cumulative bonuses if you have more than one of the same faction ship in play.\n\nFor free you can skirmish with an easy AI as much as you want. The core gameplay is deep enough if you just want to play against an opponent. The expansions aren't really necessary, just more of the same cards types or new ships. You could easily have fun as it is.\n\nIf you want a beefier experience however, you can buy the full version with online multiplayer and a single-player campaign.\n-Campaign is essentially tweaked challenges for you to play. They alter the normal rules however so your enjoyment is based on whether you like fixed odds.\n-Online multiplayer is quick, fast and efficient due to the availability of players cross-platform so it's never troublesome to find a opponent through matchmaking. The game uses an account system so that you can link your purchase across your Android/iOS or PC versions.\n\nSo go ahead and try before you buy.\n\nOr buy the actual physical copy at a game store for two players for $12. it's self-contained and a great icebreaker at parties.","March 10","true","9.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

You are only able to do the tutorials, the first campaign, and play against 'easy' AI. I finished all the 'free' content (including all campaign challenges) in about 4 hours. That's not to say it's a bad game at all. In fact, I would recommend the free version to anyone who is a fan of card games and at $5 I think the paid version is a good value too :)\n\nThe game: Star Realms is a drafting game similar to Dominion, where you start with a limited set of cards and build your deck by buying new ones from a common pool. As the game goes on, you get more powerful cards that allow you to pummel your opponent until they die. There are four different 'races' each of which have their own gimmick. Red cards allow you to remove the bad cards from your deck, making it more efficient. Yellow cards cause your opponent to discard, Blue cards are the only way to gain 'authority' (life points), and Green cards...well, they're just really good at beating face.\n\nPros:\n*Easy to learn\n*Fast-paced gameplay\n*Free? (if that counts as a pro)\n\nCons:\n*The interface is pretty clearly designed with touch screens in mind. It's not too frustrating for a desktop user but things can be a bit clunky. Just adding a function for RMB would make control a lot smoother.\n*The basic set of cards are a bit repetitive. There's just not much variation between the playstyles of the different races. Plus the fact that the only way to win is by attacking your opponent means there's pretty much just one strategy.\n*The sound effects and music are uninspired and the art is pretty same-y. But now I'm just nitpicking.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this. It's F2P so there's really no harm in giving it a shot.","March 13","true","5.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metadigital/recommended/438140/","metadigital","Metadigital","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metadigital/","132 products in account","I bought this game in 2014 when it first came out. I still play it quite regularly.\n\nThis is a really god example of good minimalist game design. Though new mechanics are being added as (modular) expansions, the game stays very tightly loyal to its core mechanics. I don't feel like there is a lot of feature bloat here.\n\nThe base game, at $5, is a great experience. Each faction has a specific theme that's easy to learn over a few games, but takes a while to really master when combined together. Not all cards are equal, which is part of the learning curve. Less valuable cards are key to the design working, though, and there are ways to use almost any card (aside from the loathesome Viper) in your strategy. I played this base game for 2 years before realizing there were expansions because I had a copy of the game that didn't include any mention of them.\n\nI've since picked up 2 of these expansions and I've noticed that they've done a couple things:\n1) The new cards make both players more powerful overall, which means more stategic decisions and less universally undesireable cards.\n2) Gambits speed up the first couple of rounds, which helps the game's overall flow.\n3) The AI isn't able to keep up as well as you add expansions. This is both good and bad. It means that the game probably isn't so easy to calculate with simple algorythms as before, which means that human players will get more out of it. It also means that the vs. AI mode doesn't provide the challenge it used to, pushing players eventually onto online play.\n\nShould you spend $5 on this game? If you enjoy card games, it's a no brainer. You'll easilly get your money's worth.\n\nShould you invest in the expansions? You'll have to decide for yourself. They're more expensive than the base game when added together, so just balance how much you value your dollars to your time in game. It's certainly a better deal than any free-to-play or AAA game, so you shouldn't really worry too much over it.\n\nPersonally, I wished more games were modeled like this.

I hope this downvote might get the dev's attention.\nFirst of all, when playing multiplayer, you can only see the next player's moves after they've played instead of real time.  There is not even a time counter on multiplayer games, which is pretty dumb considering your only 2 options are a 48 hour turn game, or a 3 minute game.\nAnother problem is that when playing a 3 minutes per turn game, after you take your turn, there is no "next game" option, as there is with 48 hour turn games,  which begs the question, was this game even properly playtested?\nLastly, the games you finish stay in your online game pool, and there's no way to delete them, which is understandably annoying as ***k.\nSo if I would say buy this game, but devs, please.\nA few more touch ups which would be nice would be volume sliders instead of toggle, and maybe a variation in the music you play?  Also, the ability to sync your steam friendslist would be dope.  In any case, an actual friends list in the game should also be a given, as it's rather annoying to have to remember all of your friend's star realms names.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/438140/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Star Realms is a deck building card game which was originally a table top game that was published in 2014 by White Wizard Games. The PC version of the game was released onto PC on March 8th 2016.\n\nI am a huge trading card game fan, on a daily basis I play at least three hours of Hearthstone, and have played Pokémon and MTG in the past too. Star Realms is a game which instantly took my fancy from the screenshots. Once you get your head around how to play the game, which sadly the tutorial doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining things, it is a really simple yet addictive card game.  I love the deck building side of the game since you can pick and choose exactly how you want to build your deck depending on the type of opponent you are facing.\n\nYou start each turn with at least 4 or 5 cards in your hand; you can play all of your cards if you choose, this in turn gives you damage points, and resources to choose another card to add to your deck. Games start off quite slowly but soon ramp up to some pretty high numbers being thrown around.  It sounds really simple when it is explained properly, but somehow the tutorial manages to over complicate it to the point where it is almost as easy enough to teaching yourself how to play by just jumping into the game.\n\nThe game’s art style is in a pretty generic sci-fi theme. You can quite clearly see the game was designed for a tablet, as the UI is pretty poor for a PC game. The clunky designs of menus are a little off putting. The UI in the game itself is OK, you can see all of the required information fairly easily, but again it is very “tablet-fied”. The audio is pretty sub-standard too, sounds like some stock sci-fi music playing in the background with some fairly generic sound effects too. Although these aren’t all massive pointers for a card game, I would still like to have seen an average attempt at these elements.\n\nStar Realms is being advertised on Steam as a free to play title, but really, it’s simply a demo for the full game. The single player campaign mode is gated after the first chapter, which is only five levels itself and you cannot play multiplayer without buying into the full game. Alas I did actually make the purchase of £3, 99 to get access to the full game, because I was having a really good time playing and wanted to play more. Sadly after purchasing I was greeted with an error message of “401 Unauthorized” and no way to exit out of that screen other than ALT F4ing. A few people on the forums seem to be having the same problem too which isn’t too promising, so I have requested a refund until the developers can come back to me/solve the issue.\n\nIF the game can be fixed to let me continue playing, Star Realms is a game I can definitely see myself putting another 5-6 hours into, or at least completing the campaign mode.  There is a small online community with roughly 100 people being active at any one time, but I would personally only see this as a single player experience at the moment.\n\nOther than the technical issue I have had with the full version of the game, everything else seems to be running fine, and even has support for 4k resolutions too! For me the issue is with the game claiming to be free to play when in fact it is just a demo, which doesn’t sit right for me. There is gated content behind the paywall, which doesn’t seem to be working correctly sadly. I hope this can be fixed in order for me to play the rest of the game. Without the technical faults, Star Realms is a neat little card game, which any trading card game fan will enjoy. A game can last between 5-10 minutes, so has a very casual feel to it. At the moment I am purely going to just recommend this title and nothing more. I really want to be able to highly recommend this game, because I have had such a blast with it so far…. I will definitely be re-purchasing the full game if the developers can fix the issues and I will for sure re-visit my review in due course.\n\nEDIT - I am changing this review to a "Not Recommended". The only way you can get access to the full game AFTER purchasing the game through Steam is to create an account on their website and sync to your Steam account. If you are releasing a game on Steam, it should work completely through your Steam account, not jumping through hoops of the developer's own account system as well\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

I've played several thousand games against the AI and feel like I have a fairly informed opinion of the game.  I have not bothered with the campaigns and will not address them.\n\nThe base game is fantastic.  The balance is finely tuned and it is a marvel of card game design.  After you have played several hundred games, you become increasingly aware of just how tightly and carefully designed this game really is and I appreciate it for it's rapt craftsmanship.\n\nThe Gambit Set is designed to add some variety to the starting positions of either player.  You are granted two resource cards which can change your starting position by varying degrees depending on your luck and the line of cards available for purchase.

Absolutely.\n\nI've been playing Star Realms for a while now. I got it back when it was in The Humble Card Game Bundle and I got the physical deck with it. This game is an excellent deckbuilding strategy card game. It's complex, but very easy to pick up and understand. Many of my friends have gotten use out of the deck and it has been beaten and worn out.\n\nUnfortunately, the developers kind of shot themselves in the foot by labeling this as Free-to-Play. I'm guessing the reason they did it is for people (like me) who had previously paid for the game and already had an account with the developer.  So we didn't have to spend more money to get the Steam version, and rather than generating Steam Keys, they got around it this way. I don't think they meant to mislead anyone. The F2P version of this IS really just a demo, however.\nBut please, try out the demo, see if you like the style of play. If you do, spend the 5 bucks.

As I'm sure many people have said before, Star Realms is very similar to Dominion, but with a few differences. Since I've played both, I can't really review Star Realms without making these comparisons.\n\nSimilarities and Differences\nThe first difference is the win condition. Instead of accumulating a limited amount of victory points, you deplete your opponent's authority (ie. health points) down to zero.\n\nSecondly, instead of having a large selection of cards in limited numbers for purchase, you are limited to five choices per turn in what I'm going to call the "buy zone", one of which constantly replenishes itself (the Explorer), and the other four which deal a new random card to fill an empty spot after each card is purchased.\n\nLastly, you can, and often do, play all the cards out of your hand in a single turn. There is a convenient "Play All" button for this, though the game will not automatically play certain cards that have optional effects.\n\nOtherwise the two games play very similarly. You draw five cards to form your hand, cards go to the discard pile once played or bought, and you shuffle your discard pile once your deck is exhausted to form a new deck. The mechanic of "scrapping" a card (called trashing in Dominion, where a card is permanently removed from your deck) to gain effects is also present. Combos are essential for advanced play, and the various "factions" present in Star Realms echo the expansions of Dominion.\n\nPros and Cons\nThough Star Realms is the same type of card game as Dominion, I found it less enjoyable, as luck is more favored over strategy.\n\nPart of the problem is being able to play all the cards out of your hand during every turn. Because I never encountered a card that had a mandatory effect that also had a downside (ex. forcing you to scrap a card), there are no hard choices to make during a turn as to which cards to play. This has the ultimate effect of overemphasizing the "luck of the draw", as how effective your turn will be depends on your entire hand and how well it synergizes. This also makes the mechanic of forcing the player to discard their hand after a turn ends useless, because I never once encountered a situation where I didn't want to, or couldn't, play all the cards in my hand.\n\nThe random composition of cards in the buy zone adds an additional level of luck to the game. When building your deck, synergy is difficult to achieve. You can try and build the best deck you can, but you can't predict when the cards you need are going to appear. Also, there are many lower priced cards with effects far better than more expensive ones, and you never know when those are going to show up to replace what you just bought, leaving your opponent with an easy buy that gives them an immediate advantage. This is not mitigated by the fact that you can see the composition of your opponent's deck at any time, because any counter strategy you might devise is, again, solely dependent on the cards you need randomly showing up in the buy zone, which may never happen.\n\nAs for options, the basic game doesn't have many. Campaign play is locked after the first chapter, as are the higher difficulty levels, and the amount of cards is very limited. There are a considerable number of resolution settings, but considering this game could probably run on a potato, they are largely useless. By strange contrast, audio settings are virtually nonexistant. On or off are your only options for music and sounds.\n\nStar Realms does have its upsides. The game plays quickly, the artwork is good (if a little generic), the focus of each faction is easy to learn, and the total amount of money required to fully enjoy the game is low compared to other card games on Steam. Many people find it exciting and more fun to play than Dominion, but I didn't. It got dull too quickly, and the lack of cards in the basic game doesn't help it much, especially considering the base game of Dominion (which contains far more content and doesn't lock multiplayer behind a paywall), is itself now available as a free online game. Dominion's expansions are more expensive than Star Realms', but at the same time, Dominion offers more content with its expansions than just cards.\n\nTLDR; As a cheaper version of Dominion, Star Realms serves adequately, but lack of cards and poor rules make for a game where strategy matters less than luck. Initially intriguing, but didn't have the lasting appeal of its bigger brother.","May 23","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Good enough graphics/music, story for the campaign is more like abbreviated descriptions of a story.\n\nThere are three resources: Authority (player life; win by reducing opponent to 0), Combat (damage; cards you play can give Combat until the end of turn that you spend to reduce enemy life), and Trade (money; cards you play can give Trade until the end of turn that you spend to buy cards in the shared pool to improve your deck). Each player starts with a basic deck of mostly 1-Trade cards and you begin games by spending that Trade to buy cards from the central shared area. When you run out of cards in your deck, your discard/used card pile gets shuffled and becomes your new deck. Eventually your deck will be full of cards you bought and you can rack up nice Combat/Trade amounts if you draw the right combination of cards.\n\nThere are various mechanics to play around with. There are faction cards that do extra things if you play another faction card, there are ways make your deck flow smoother (draw cards, cards to remove unwanted cards), you can Scrap (remove from the game) some cards to activate their ability.\n\nIt's a card game so luck exists in what you draw, what cards are available to buy from the shared pool, and what cards your enemy can buy/draw. So one turn you can have a great multicard combo and the next a dud where your cards don't complement each other.\n\nI would've liked the option to automatically end turns (giving the normal warnings when non-scrap abilities are left unused) to take away an unnecessary click. Also, I would've liked an option to automatically assign damage when there is only one target.\n\nMy experience with the Steam version has been disappointing, but not really from the game itself.\n\nThey had a standalone PC version for download on their website but they removed it with the Steam release.\n\nI had an activation code from humble to unlock the standard full version (without DLC) and there is no way on the Steam version to enter the code (and there is nowhere on their website to log in to your account to edit preferences/add codes). I had to contact support to get a website address to enter it.\n\nI eventually registered for a Star Realms account with a legitimate e-mail address (which is required for multiplayer/non-Steam DLC access) but I used a "e-mail+label" format to automatically label and sort e-mails coming in. After playing around in the campaign to get the hang of the game, I went to try online multiplayer. However, despite allowing registration, they blocked my access to multiplayer because my "Email appears to be invalid." And since you are only allowed one account per Steam account (they're linked), I don't really feel like going through support again to gain access to multiplayer.\n\nMake sure to avoid the pitfalls I did and you can probably enjoy the game.

Your objective is to buy cards from a common pool (and building your deck with them) to attack your opponent until he is defeated. Physical and mobile versions of this game exist elsewhere and have been well received by critics; as of this review, it is the 65th best game on all of boardgamegeek rankings.\n\nFor the record, I have played many hours across the physical, mobile, and non-steam PC version of the game.\n\nAs far as I can tell this steam release is the same PC version that was available before from the developer and which seems to be a port from the mobile version. Although this is usually something to be weary about, the port is very good because the app also was good. Something important to note here is that the purchases are linked to your account, so whatever you buy here is available on mobile and so on.\n\nI have only played the full version, so I can't offer information on the free one offered here. The game is very enjoyable and offers a good variety of cards, so the gameplay remains fresh and deep for a long time. This version offers AI opponents, a campaign, online play, pass and play and a tutorial. There are sufficient settings for this kind of game, like fast animations, screen resolution, rudimentary graphics options.\n\nOne reviewer before me points out that card fonts are too small, however every card can be viewed in detail by right-clicking it (this is covered in the tutorial, of course), and the details are easy to remember since every faction has a very specific theme. Although subjective, this is a point to consider, even if it doesn't bother me at all.\n\nFrom me, this game gets high marks as it brings a lot of enjoyable strategic elements to a fast and well implemented version.","March 9","true","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

As someone who has racked up a lot of time in the iOS version (played on both phone and tablet), it really irks me that the EXACT SAME problems still exist in this PC version, and have existed without fix for years.\n\nThe main problem is that the cards are mostly unreadable at any resolution. Even with my nice big monitor I thought I would FINALLY be able to read those cards without having to zoom in but nope the text is still super tiny. They are really married to the idea that the cards have to look EXACTLY the same as the physical version with no thought to usability.\n\nThe other problems are that the campaign is mostly luck-based (prepare to restart a campaign mission thirty plus times to try for the "perfect start" and even then you probably only have a 10% chance of winning against some missions), and that the online multiplayer is at most functional, but with no extra features you might have come to expect from other, better produced games.\n\nEdit: Replying to comments:\nI'm fully aware that you can zoom in cards. I even said: "without having to zoom in...".\n\nThe fact that you have to zoom in on cards that, on average, contain between 1 and 4 words is RIDICULOUS.\n\nThis is the only card game I have ever played where such small amounts of text are illegible at the default card view. Sure, games like Yugioh or Cardfight Vanguard, which have almost a PAGE of card text on them, can be hard to view in their pc/mobile games, but Star Realms cards have almost NO TEXT and are still UNREADABLE!\n\nThe cards in the games are just scans of the actual physical cards and no one bothered to make them any more legible for the digital version of the game. And it has been this way since the digital version came out.\n\nJust look at the screenshots of the game on the Steam Store Page. Do those look like well done cards that are readable?","March 9","false","0.3"," 26 of 55 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","26","55","0","6"

So many strategies, and I hope that White Wizard continues to release the expansions in the forms of DLC for this great version of the card game.","May 22","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a singleplayer campaign which has you play in different scenarios, a mode where you can play the standard game against an AI opponent, and if you buy the full version, you can play online against other people.\n\nAs a fan of the card game, one of my favorite things about the digital version is that it keeps track of all your trade and combat for you, and it reminds you of any unused card effects before you end your turn - something that I tend to forget when playing the physical version.","May 17","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was dubious after a few plays: was this really any better than Ascension? It certainly wasn't as complex as Dominion or as thematic as Thunderstone. I wouldn't have belived Star Realms would become my favourite deckbuilding game.\n\nDominion is just as engrossing and if I had a chance to play it more I might prefer it. But here's the thing: Dominion has to work hard to be good. It has to have lots of cards with interesting mechanics and make the players track their turns carefully. Star Realms is just casually awesome. It is fundamentally more exciting in concept. There is anticipation in seeing what ships the trade row delivers (especially once you know what they all are), tough and dangerous decisions to be made in choosing what ships to take and how to built your deck, and tension in the direct competition of blows as you race to be the fastest to beat down your opponent — and pretty much nothing else to get in the way of those elements. If Dominion had cards as simple as Star Realms it'd be crap. If Star Realms had cards as interesting as Dominion it would blow every other deckbuilding game out of the water.","April 14","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
