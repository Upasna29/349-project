It's fun to play, has nice graphics and catchy music.\nHowever, if you want to finish this game, you better allocate enough time. It's not a lengthy game, but it still lacks a save feature. Which is a bit poor.\nAlso, don't be surprised if power-ups float by outside the "rail", quite often they're beyond reach and you can't get them.","March 3, 2014","true","1.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

You will have to disable a monitor to play.\n\nI suggest a 360 gamepad to play.","February 15, 2014","true","1.3"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

You're a stalwart human space hero fighting against the evil Skurgian aliens. Blow up enemy spaceships and enjoy alien warlords shaking their fist at the "pathetic human scum". Have I made my point yet? Great little game, takes about 45 minutes across nine levels, highly recommend.","August 17, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Difficult to recommend one way or the other. Poor resolution and gamepad support, but the basic gameplay is some fun starfox-like business. It's quite pretty, although the gameplay is not quite as nuanced as its contemporaries (sin and punishment 2?).\n\nStill, compared to Yar's Revenge, Aces of the Galaxy is good, and might be the best on-rails shmups on Steam, if that's your fancy.","June 22, 2014","true","1.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I have seen some people who seem to be able to get it to work, and I wish them all the best.  For me, it gets to the menu, I cna select a ship, but when I click "Play", it hangs.  Music still plays, but no game.  Worst of all, I can only kill it remotely, because it completely takes over the desktop - try to CTRL/ALT/DEL and you can't see task manager because the game is in the way.  Can't minimize it.  Can't ALT/TAB, because the instant you change windows, the game takes back over again.\n\nAnd the support.  What support?  Steam has nothing in the way of support for this game, so far as I can tell.  They say contact Activision.  Activision has no reference to this game on their site anywhere, and you can't submit a ticket for anything that's not on the site.  There is no generic way to contacxt support except Twitter, and so I am now engaged in a days-long Twitter conversation which has barely gotten past the "have you verified your game cache" stage.\n\nIt looked fun, but don't risk it.  NOT WORTH THE RISK TO BUY.","July 7, 2014","false","0.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","0"

Graphics are pleasant enough, but were stuck in 4x3 for me.  Overall this feels like someone tried to make a more arcade-ish Starfox knockoff, and in doing so lost all of the worthwhile elements of the source.","May 4, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/recommended/10120/","anterk","Anterk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/","730 products in account","Aces of the Galaxy is a competent game that gets on my nerves. Aces reveals console-port-itus by making it impossible to change the controls ingame, and if you have a 360 controller hooked up expect to get lots of rumble you can't do anything about.\nI was attracted to Aces because it looks and plays a bit like Rez HD. You can move side to side and dodge, but you have no ability to change your path. When executed well, this can be alot of fun. However, shooting in Aces is accomplished by clicking the mouse button instead of holding it. Within the first few minutes of play, I encountered swarms of enemies, and I do mean swarms. You can fire missiles by holding the right mouse button and dragging it over your enemies, but the recharge for this ability encourages you to click away with your guns, and this quickly becomes a pain.\nOutside of gameplay, two more issues quickly made the experience intolerable. Firstly, the majority of the enemies arn't well-differentiated from the background, the shots they fire back at you, or thier own vapor trails. The result is an incredibly busy, confusing, and deadly mess, and that's before you start adding your own shots to the mix. Secondly, I quickly encontered a piece of music that was ear-splittingly painful, and while I could certainly turn off all the music, I really don't see the point of playing a game like this without decent beats.\nThis is obviously a subjective review, so I encourage you to examine other sources.","July 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I had it plugged in for another game but obviously this game does not like that. I used my mouse and keyboard for this game.\n\nRecommend:\nNo. If it only had an autosave/save function then I´d would have voted positive surely.","December 21, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Certainly it's not the type for me. While there is something to be said for "On Rail Shooters," I cannot say that Aces makes the best of this particular style. In particular, Aces makes use of many many brilliant colors and explosions which happen in such frequency that seeing what is happening is a challenge.\n\nOverall, I can't say that I was enjoying Aces. Had it been a third-person version of Space Invaders, I might have had more fun with the idea, but the novelty of such an idea is hampered by the rail.","November 29, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
