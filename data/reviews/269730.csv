The game is easily the best golf sim I've played. The fact it has an unblievable course creator just puts it over the top. It's intuitive, fun and beautiful. You can play your course as your build it to ensure its exactly what you wanted. From placing objects such as buildings, trees, signs to sculpting a simple sand trap, you'll be in love with the ease at which it's all done.\n\nOntop of that the game is gorgeous to look at, runs great and simply the best representation of golf you can find on PC. With an interesting multiplayer aspect you can challenge your friends or take on their ghost ball of their best score.\n\nSo if you like golf, or golf creation and horribly written reviews, you should get this game.","April 17, 2014","true","92.8"," 284 of 340 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","284","340","0","12"

Very limited PC graphics optimization and horrible performance issues prevent me from recommending this game in its current state. With wonky putting, an unreliable swing mechanic, and lackluster ball physics (seriously the same bounce on every terrain except sand), you'd best save your money until this is patched.\n\nOn the plus side the sound design is top notch and the course creator is a great feature, however its certainly not enough to justify buying a game that feels like its still in beta.","August 19, 2014","false","20.5"," 216 of 289 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","216","289","0","4"

You are able to create and customize your own golf course - It can be fully randomly generated or you can hand craft all of the holes, bunkers, trees, hills, anything you could think of, and you can share it to the public.\n\nAs it is currently Early Access some game modes are not available as of yet, such as Tour's and Tournaments (These have a coming soon sign).  Stat tracking is also on the way.\n\nAs far as I can see, there is no online multiplayer, however you do get to play against other players ghosts and The Golf Club supports local Multiplayer.\n\nGraphics wise - Very good, very nice looking game.\n\nAudio is also nice and the commentary that is in the game is a little different from games such as EA's  Tiger Woods games, and that is a nice change.","April 17, 2014","true","4.9"," 106 of 136 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","106","136","0","4"

Luckily I got The Golf Club before it got too negative, because I personally have never had any issues with the performance of the game.  I don't doubt those who say they have, but I have had nothing but fun playing this game.\n\nOn the hardware side, my PC has an i5, and a GTX760, and the game runs very smoothly, with the exception of the rare course with massive amounts of trees.\n\nAs far as content, well, you play golf.  Some people appear unhappy that there is no career mode, and while that would be cool, it wasn't part of the game I bought, and my family enjoys just sitting down for a round of golf when we get together.  I guess a lot of people are looking for a replacement for their previous favorite golf sims, and they find The Golf Club lacking, but if all you want is to play a round of golf when you feel like a round of golf, then this fits the bill nicely.","December 22, 2014","true","103.4"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","47","55","0","3"

While the game initially fills void and you can play some video golf , it becomes increasingly frustrating the more you play it.\n\nThe user created courses are the heart of the game and it's fun to play others creations.   This is best part of the game.  Course difficulties and ratings help you find what you're looking for.  I love this part of the game and applaud the effort that a lot of users make on some truly creative courses.\n\nAs I put hours into the game my frustration level with wind and putting has increased to the point where I can't even finish a round.  It gets boring and repetitive.  Long drive, approach misses because wind is inconsistent, and 2-3 putts because the putting is next to impossible.  Approach shots become increasing difficult if you don't need a 100% shot.  I've played the other series for years and never had even close to this much difficulty.\n\nIf any game needs a putt preview, it's this one.   The "touch" required on putts took awhile to learn, but the aim will never be right.  If you think you need to aim the ball 5' right on a 15' putt, you better move it to 12' right.  Sometimes you won't even see the hole.\n\nFWIW, I'm using a Dual Action game pad.  I may be switching to other controls soon, but those don't sound like any fun to me (yet).\n\nOverall I'm happy the game was made.  I just can't recommend until the playability is fixed.

So those of us that thought we spend $20 on a golf game just found out that we have to spend more money to get the other half of the game. On top of which the game still has a lot of development left despite the current release status. I felt this information was foremost to what I had to say about the game play that I experienced.\n\nDon't get me wrong. With the demise of the Tiger Woods Golf franchise us fairway junkies have been waiting for a game to come along and give us our knee pant, 9 iron fix. This game will be that, one day. Right now the game is being updated side by side with the console build of the game. Very little effort has been put into the controls for mouse users. So you either need to play with a Xbox controller for the PC or struggle to figure out the who what where when and why of how the game registers your mouse movement. There seems to be no ability to control roughly how hard you whack the ball, I still haven't seen much influence from using the fade and draw features. It makes it hard to not want to break your digital club around the electronic trees surounding you on the course. That all being said the game is still in early stages, one day the game might be the next great golf game for both PC and console. One day. Right now they are putting too much into social features like friends lists and competative play, meanwhile very little into the ability to teach players how to use their control systems to get precise shots. I'm no stranger to golf games but I'm having a very hard time being consistant with this game.\n\nEdit/Update: I've had the chance to play a few rounds with an XBox controller, and I've found the controls equally as hard to master. I think the problem still lies in not having a meter system either in game or at least as part of a learning feature that help you adjust to the control scheme.\n\nAs for the rest of the game. A lot has been put into implementing the social features. The game has single, tournament and tour features. I really like the choice of play variety. However unless you happen to bring 3 other golfers in your bag at the bottom with the loose tees good luck. There is no match making feature that I've come across. So if you don't have other players to play with you wind up being matched with imaginary ghost players who represent some of the best players that have played that course. Talk about frustration. As I have said the controls will drive you batty, but it's worse when an imaginary player with a -7 is driving them right to the green, taunting you while you try to work your way out of the sand. The feature was so annoying the do now have a way to turn it off. So obviously this game does want to promote social play. But for those of us who don't have golf loving gaming buddies it would be nice to have a match feature to meet up with other single players for some rounds.\n\nI have not used the course making feature, but I've read that it too can be very difficult to use. However there are many well made player designed courses, that is a great feature of the game.\n\nWhile they are constantly improving the social features of the game, the frustration of the controls combined with the under developed ability to actually use the full social interface make all the implemented features still seem far off. I will revisit this game soon hopefuly after some more updates to see what they have done.\n\nFebruary 2015 update: I finally uninstalled the game. The last updates have seemed to revert the controls back to being wonky and unpredictable. Which is a shame because right before that I was finally have to have a full round with a negative score. The controls seemed to be getting better. That has seemed to change. I'll check back maybe in the spring or summer to see if after a few more updates if the game has made any improvements.","May 27, 2014","false","5.3"," 88 of 125 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","88","125","0","4"

This is almost that game.\nPros: Beautiful scenery, fairly natural swing control, solid in-game physics, wide variety of available courses, and a course editor that is a lot of fun.\nCons: Charging extra for a Season (Career) Mode is lame at best, any joy created by Season Mode is removed by fact that the software engineers chose to cheat the game horribly so their software would not "lose" - no regional Pro-Am EVER had a an entire top 10 at -11 in a single 18 hole round! Makes it tough to care about playing through it.\nOverall, I would give the game as it stands right now, 3/6/16, a B-.

Save yourself $9.99 and skip skip it.\n\nadded 3/7/16: Apparently the last update weighted all AI scores in all single player competitive events to the realm of absolutely stupid.

There is nothing in the way of a practice mode, or even a basic tutorial. You're thrust into the game, and left to figure out how to play on your own. I don't understand why there was such an oversight in this design, and the developers even acknowledge the lack of a practice/tutorial mode in a video on their own page.\n\nThat being said, it is great fun. The courses, while not real world copies, are challenging, and quite rewarding to those that take risks in their shots. The game mechanics are good, and the game is engrossing enough to have you looking for you club, when you've missed a shot by inches, and decide to throw it.\n\nThe bad is this. I felt like I've played this game before, at least, I've played PGA Golf Games before, but they felt like there was more to it. This feels less than, because it's more simulator, and less casual. Putting is challenging, and there aren't 15 different types of overlays setup for you to use. Instead you get a grid, and a camera you can move. It feels basic, but it's more challenging in the end.\n\nIf that is what the devs were going for, which I believe they were, then they hit the mark. This is not a Tiger Woods game, this is a Golf Simulator, rage included at no extra charge.\n\np.s. please add some sort of practice or tutorial modes. That's really a rookie mistake.","December 29, 2014","true","7.8"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

Otherwise, long ago I would have thrown myself in the nearest water hazard along with my clubs. Enjoying a nice day on a gorgeous course is enough. The Golf Club captures this essence in both the challenge of perfecting your swing and the pride of being able to create your own gorgeous courses. But, is that beauty enough?\n\nThe game's course creation tools are impressive in their ability to not only let you build detailed courses, but the scalability of the tools themselves. You can apply some macro-levels rules to shape your course with simple min/max sliders – like if you want your course as a whole to be hilly or have lots of water – or dive into placing individual trees, objects, and even whales. The menu presentation is straightforward, but there are times like placing water, for instance, where the macro and micro tools can cause confusion on how to exactly get what you want. Regardless, the game puts a lot of power in your hands, and with a little tinkering you soon learn how to efficiently work with the tools and start making some sweet courses.\n\nI was really impressed with the naturally adaptability of your holes in the broader context of the world's environment. Moving a hole en masse, rearranging holes' order, adding/subtracting holes, and even switching out the overall theme of the environment (you can choose from desert, autumn/forest, rural, alpine, and the wild Scotland-like links terrain) is well done.\n\nYou can also dive in and playtest your hole at any time; dropping your ball in a specific location or playing the whole thing. Finding and playing other people's creations is easy as well, and you can use them to put together your own tour of courses.\n\nThe golf gameplay itself is challenging and satisfying. The right analog swing requires precision, especially when applying draw or fade, and a minimal pre-swing HUD is hard at first. Gauging your swing power while putting, in particular, takes getting used to, but it won't take long to develop a rhythm and feel to your swing.\n\nAs well-crafted as the game is, it's missing a sense of progression that drives you forward. While creating the course of your dreams (or someone else's nightmares) feels good, I missed a larger structure. Visual or physical golfer upgrades, an overarching rewards system tied to your stats, or even a career shell are missing and there's lost momentum within the game because of it. Seeing what kinds of courses I and others could come up with and the challenges therein is motivating, but the sustenance it provides is impermanent.\n\nThe Golf Club delivers as a course creator, and it's no slouch swinging the clubs, either. What's missing is the personality: the larger career structure and personal investment in your avatar to spur players on and elevate the experience from a nice set of features to the complete package   9/10\n\n\nAppsy doodles","June 22, 2015","true","35.0"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","31","39","0","6"

Folks that are looking for an arcade golf game, probably won't like it, and will quit before they give it a chance.\n\nPersonally I really like the game.  Once you get used to the controls, it "feels" like you really are playing golf.  You have to concentrate on each shot, and not every shot is perfect, some are really bad, sometimes you hit it perfect...but thats how it is when you really play.   The point is, the feeling you get with the controller, is about like the feeling you would have really swinging the club, from the mental point of view.\n\nI'm not sure of the specs of the reviews I see that say the game is not optimized or runs slow.  It runs perfectly fine on my machine  and the graphics look beautiful.  Multiplayer works great also, a friend and I play together and take turns and it is quite fun.\n\nThe only cons I have is that there is no tutorial or practice area that I could find.  It would be nice if they at least had a tutorial in game describing the controls, and a driving range that you could click on and practice swings.   I think I eventually found this info on their website, but it was hard to find.   Also, a bit of advice, if you are using a controller, make sure you have an Xbox based one, not the older D based (Sony) kind.\n\nFinal verdict in a nutshell - GREAT game, very much worth it, IF you put the time in to learn it properly.","December 31, 2014","true","24.0"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

Eventually they dug their feet in the ground and decided they wanted 'realism,' which completely killed my desire to play the game.

At least for me (some may disagree).\nConsequentially, I felt like I had wasted my money, which inspired this less than positive review.

The main selling point of this game for me is the GNCD, the course designer. I have spent many hours on this and once you get the hang of it, your only limited by your imagination.\nThis is a worthy successor to the EA TW series and plays a lot like it too, well if you consider that most of the people that worked on that game are the ones that developed TGC. The good thing about this game is the fact that the developers are still working on it and fixing bugs and adding stuff to it all the time, once it’s finished then this will be a solid and enjoyable title for everyone to play.\nThe only real problem with this game for me is the graphics issue if you own an AMD Radeon card, especially the newer models, but I think this is more to do with the Unity engine than anything else, as playing this game with an Nvidia card seems less problematic and appears to run better.\nAlthough this game has been developed for the PC it still very much feels like a port, as its main focus IMO is for the console market, after all that’s where the money is.\nAnyway, if you’re in any doubt about buying this game, then I would recommend you do, especially if you like golf and have been looking for a worthy successor to EA TW series. There are also more updates coming soon, and with the number of courses made by the community, then its longevity is assured. It’s not quite the golf sim this has been hailed to be, as that title I think belongs to another game currently in development.\nAnyway this is money well spent on.\n\nUpdate:\nI can't believe that this game has now been out for over 20 months, it has had a lot of fixes applied to it and it certainly has improved since its early access days. Graphics wise this game is great to look at and I can’t fault it on that front, however the gameplay is a lot easier than it used to be IMO, it’s easier to hit straighter shots and plays more like an arcade game rather than an actual golf sim, even with all the aid’s turned off. This game still suffers with issues, originally with AMD cards and then with Nvidia cards, although fixes have been applied to fix the Nvidia issues, I wish the same could be said for AMD users, anyway putting those glitches aside, this is still a great game and I would still rate this up there with the likes of EA TW series. The games real selling point for me has been and will always be the Greg Normal Course Designer and the thousands of community designed courses out there, some of course (no pun intended) better than others. And the great thing about it is that they are all free to play, let’s hope that this stays that way.\nPlayer customisation has been cranked up and the variety of shirts and trousers available to dress your player up has increased, but I would like to see more with also some community made ones thrown in too. The selection of golf clubs has not changed and I believe that this is something that could certainly be improved along with the option to hit shots with more back spin etc.\nIf your looking for a game to play against AI, then you'll be dissapointed, although you can play against the "ghost" of other players who have played the courses, whoch is better than nothing I guess.\nThis game does not have crowds, as it was only ever inteneded to be a week-end golfer type of game and not a full blown EA-TW clone as it does not have the PGA logo or backing.\nThis game has only had one DLC to date, which the community was in arms about, but IMO you don't have to buy it, it wasn't like the game was unplayable without it.\n\n@King Kyne, for a while I did feel this was a good Sim game, but then I started to play PG and somehow the gameplay in that was a lot harder and felt more realistic IMO. TGC feels a lot more arcade-ish, and since the updates, hitting the ball straight has become a lot easier. The game feels like its holding your hand and not letting you make mistakes too much, it almost feels like its restricting you. I don't associate a SIM game with something difficult, far from it, a SIM should allow you to do your own thing, it then becomes as individual as you. I have played PG for a while now, and since they introduced the horizontal swing mechanics, I personally feel that the game has improved in my estimation, not because it’s become harder, but I can now shape the flight of the ball better, if only it was that easy in real life! The reason the mechanics in PG works for me is that there is an option to create a draw or a fade, make the ball go higher or lower, but it still depends on how you “swing” the club, so it’s down to the player’s skill rather than the settings that you dial up.\nPlease don’t get me wrong TGC is a great game, but it feels like something that you could pick up straight away, while PG is something else and needs practice if you want to get better at it.\nI guess that’s my definition of a SIM, it needs to feel natural and with enough practice you start to reap the benefits for all that hard work you’ve put in.\nI play with all the aids turned off in both games, and PG still feels more realistic IMO sorry to say.","February 28, 2015","true","689.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good solid golf game, but it's certainly not perfect. Probably easiest to sum up with a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros\nThe core of the game is rock solid and realistic. The feel of the swing, the look of the courses, the physics, and the action of the ball are all great.\nFantastic course editor - best I've ever seen in a golf game. You can play courses created by other palyers or generate a fresh new course with just a few clicks. You'll certainly never run out of courses to play. Very satisfying when you put in a good round because you know you earned it. :)\nSkill is not stat based. If your get better at the game it's because you've learned to play better.\nDevs are still improving the game. I've been playing since the first day of Early Access and the Devs have been communicating and responding - while still sticking to their gameplan. They haven't fixed all the quirks, but the game has seen steady improvements over the months.\nCons\nSome machines might struggle with the graphics. Seems to recquire more CPU/GPU power than you might think. Only a few graphics settings to adjust.\nThe swing controls can be hard to learn. I love the controls (I use xbox 360 controller) but some people seem to get frustrated. No option for the old 'three-click' method that is popular in other games. I think this is part of the 'level playing field' that the devs are shooting for. They have worked hard to make the competition skill-based and fair.\nThe interface is sometimes clunky. All the info and controls are there, but sometimes they are not intuitive.  Took me a long time to figure out what the two different distances on the putting green were (one is distance to the cup, and the other is the distance to your aiming marker). I still can't figure out how to properly show an instant replay. :)\nNo career mode or similar extra features. The Tiger Woods games were full of all sorts of extras and some people might expect them here. Presentation is somewhat sparse. The voicover/commenter is well done, but there is very little 'juice' or graphical embellishments to spice things up.\nFor me the pros definitely outweigh the cons. This is one of my most played games of 2014 and I expect it will be in 2015, too.","January 4, 2015","true","103.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

There is a trust factor that you hope the developer upholds.  Assetto Corsa, Planetary Annihilation, and now The Golf Club (TGC) have formed an elite level of Early Access titles.  These games exemplify building a customer-developer relationship founded on trust.  The quality that is already built into TGC has me feeling satisfied, and VERY excited for the future of the product.  I am amazed at the depth of challenge.  Right when I thought that I "got it", I played Coronaca against some ghosts, and the greens positively whipped me (not to mention the devilishly placed fairway bunkers!!).  This game has so much potential.\n\nI can't wait for tournaments!  Building in a course designer from the start was pure genius.  You have instilled a sense of value for me.  What I really want to compliment are the design decisions.  You are making really smart moves.  The ghost method of multiplayer suits me very well.  I don't have to wait for others, worry about lag/disconnects, or even if I personally run out of free time.  The swing method is awesome.  I love that it is based on the character model swinging, not some power meter.  It really makes the game a challenge and requires that I keep my head in it.  Once I start to get lazy, there goes a slice into the woods!  There are subtleties that I love too, such as you never cut off the guy doing the voice over.  Even if I quickly move through the scorecard to the next hole, he finishes what he is saying.  I like that.  It feels polished.\n\nThank you HB for getting me excited about a PC golf game again, and living up to expectations.  Job well done!  I'll happily continue to be a part of The Golf Club.","April 20, 2014","true","21.2"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

They opt instead to go for a meterless true motion swing that ends up being played best from a gamepad then a keyboard and mouse, if this bothers you then perhaps its not quite the golf game your looking for.\n\nI still play and enjoy the port of Golden Tee golf on the PC and for years there was no real suitable replacement and while there is no "replacement" for GTgolf, I do find this game just as enjoyable but for some very different reasons. The Golf Club comes into its own for the way it deals with sloping surfaces and also implements probrably the greatest putting grid known to man. It also happens to have some great 2015 graphics and where it lacks in flair it more then makes up for it with a very solid golf simulation.\n\nWhile it drops the ball in adding some excitement via sound effects and lacks more engaging commentary, it says nothing about the simulation beneath it, which is crisp.

Now there are basically The Golf Club and WGT. And between the two, I'll take The Golf Club any day.\n\nThe graphics are good - I won't say GREAT - and the sounds/speech is good (although the commentator gets a bit annoying after a bit). Mechanics are solid, certainly better than the ridiculous 2 click meter used in WGT. If you like real swing method using your mouse, rather than clicking on a meter, TGC is for you. It doesn't quite rise to the level of the swing meter on Tiger Woods - which I consider to be the best golf game ever - but it's not too far off. All in all, you can play 18 (or 9) holes and have a darned enjoyable time; for true golf enthusiasts, this is probably as close to the real thing as you can get without lugging your clubs out to the local links.\n\nA few negatives: the match-making. NOT easy to jump into a multi-player game against real people. The menus are not very easy to navigate, despite their initial appearance with large labelled icons. You have to click and click and click to find a course to play, set up the paramaters and match type and difficulty, then when trying to find opponents to play TGC will automatically locate "players" and fill your roster to the number you have selected (2, 3, 4, etc). The only problem - no guarantee you will actually get REAL players. Once the round starts, most of the time you find yourself playing "Ghosts" of the actual players. I.e., they are not logged in, but TGC selected them based on their skill levels, rating on the course you are playing, etc - and popped their "ghosts" into the game with you. Huh??? So, 8 times out of 10, you will find yourself playing against basically 2 or 3 other computer AI players. Needless to say, not a very social occasion. Try chatting with them. The ONLY way you can play against other REAL live people is if you manually select someone you have "Friended" and who you KNOW is in the game. If they aren't in the game, and you locate them by UserName, you will just get their "ghost" again. You CANNOT just randomly play games against other live players. This is one of the biggest faults in this game to me.\n\nI do find the game fun, but there is .... something... missing. Hard to put a finger on it. Individually, all the components of a great golf game are there. But put together, it falls a bit short, and I wish I could describe specifically what that is.\n\nDifficulty-wise, it IS hard to get below par (and I've played a ton of golf games for a lot of years, and consider myself pretty darn good). Putting especially is a pain in the butt. There is NO power meter. On ANY swing. So you have no real idea how hard you are swinging.  There is NO swing meter, so you have NO idea how far your backswing is. There are NO bars period. You just totally wing it. Most of the time just pulling all the way back on the mouse for a full swing works, but what about that sand wedge just off the green? It says it is 40 ft from the pin, and your wedge has a maximum distance of 50 ft, so you don't want to do a full swing - but how do you judge what the right backswing is? 80%, you think? OK - so how do you swing the club back around 80%? No meter=no way of knowing how far back you are swinging your club. Again - you just wing it, and 9 times out of 10 you will wind up doing a full swing even though you didn't want to. Or you overcompensate, and wind up doing a little 20% chip that sends the ball 2 feet. VERY annoying. I read all of the other reviews saying they LOVE this aspect, but they are "purists" who think that any kind of power or swing meter is "cheating." Whatever. If I want that level of realism, I'll go play real golf at the local course. For a game - I want at least some idea of how hard I am "swinging" my "club."\n\nAll in all, I give this a thumbs-up, but to be honest I have stopped playing it very much due to the swing mechanics described above. If they ever add a power/backswing meter, and if they make it so you can actually play REAL LIVE people randomly -  I will be reinvigorated to play, guarantee it. In the meantime, if you love golf and virtual golf games, you will definitely enjoy this game, even though it may not rise to the top of your "Favorite golf game" list.","November 21, 2015","true","958.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

I can't speak for whether or not it will satisfy hardcore fans, because I'm not one.\n\nSo, I've been looking for a good PC golf game for a while. I'm not a golfer in real life, nor am I a particularly hardcore fan of the genre. I just played Tiger Woods '06/'07 on X-Box 360 a while ago, thought they were fun, and have been looking for something similar. I stayed away from The Golf Club while it was in Early Access because, well, I don't do Early Access. And I kinda forgot about it for a while.\n\nA few days ago, Jack Nicklaus' Perfect Golf came out, and I thought "Hey, maybe this will be my cup of tea!"\n\nI honestly can't even tell you if it's my cup of tea or not, because Perfect Golf's UI/UX is absolutely atrocious. After 20 frustrating minutes of fighting against the game just to try and learn the basics, I uninstalled it and got a refund. Maybe there is a good golf game in there, I don't know, but I should not have to untangle a convoluted mess just to understand the basics of the game.\n\nThen I saw the Golf Club was out of Early Access, and I grabbed it.\n\nWithin THREE MINUTES, I had a handle on the game.\n\nNow again, I'm not a hardcore golf guy, so maybe there's a bunch of depth to this game that I'm missing. There probably is. I can't tell you the difference between a chip and a pitch, and I can't remember which side is draw and which side is fade, and I've never adjusted the point of impact on the ball. All of that stuff exists in The Golf Club, so I assume I still have a long way to go to mastering it. But unlike Perfect Golf, the basics here are simple and intuitive. Everything about the controls, the menus, the UI/UX experience, makes sense. If you put a controller in my hand and tell me to play a game I've never played before, and I've got the basics down in three minutes?

The gameplay,   and the course creator will keep this game growing for years to come.   There are some incredible course designers that put courses out on a daily basis so the replay value here is crazy good.    The devs are quick to fix things and add new features but they're a small team so you have to be patient.     The game has grown leaps and bounds within the last year and it's light years better than some of the current competiton in my opinion.\n\nA few cons is that they really need to work on the social aspect of the game so that it's easier to find multiplayer games.  They are lacking typical gamemodes that you expect to see and they don't and will never have a conventional lobby.   They basically just have you send an invite to a friend to join you a the course but only half the time it works.  You are constantly having to kick your friend from the game and re add him to just see him play.    Like I said,  it's still the best game I've played but the multi player taking a backseat to some of the other features has always left me scratching my head..\n\nThe course creator is revolutionairy,  it's just flat out amazing.   This game appeals more to the guy that wants a relaxing real round of golf without all the EA sports glitz and glamour.   This game can be played with a controller,  PS4 is what I use..  I own the game on my ps4 and PC,  and I get all the updates on my PC as soon as they're ready which is awesome.  Honestly though,  the game plays just as well on the ps4.  It seems to me that they've taken lots of time to optizimze it for the consoles and I can certainly undertand why considering that is the majority of their audience.\n\nI give this game maximum stars, even with it's issues...   Also,  if you play the a course insipred by the "Delta Theme"   I was the guy that named that theme!!!  I won a "name that theme"  competition and the boys from HBS sent me some cool swagg for my winning submission.\n\nOne of the big fish up at the golf club name is Anthony Kyne,  and he is a very likable chap,  who does live streams often where he takes questions from us mere mortals...

I wish I could get my money back for this turd but Im sure thats about as likely and hitting a hole in one.","October 12, 2014","false","10.1"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","30","49","3","0"

Been playing it for a while in early access and have enjoyed it immensely.  Now that the game's out, I have mixed feelings about it.  On one hand, the mechanics of the swing (I play with an xbox controller) are good and the way the ball reacts to the environment is very good.  However, something about it just seems rushed and unfinished.  I'll get hours upon hours of enjoyment out of it and hopefully it gets improved down the line because it's a good game, with the chance to be great.

What really brings out the glory of this title is the Greg Norman Course Design feature.  Creating your own courses is quite enjoyable.  Whether its for yourself with a local track, or its for the masses as a famous track or just something strait from your imagination.\n\nThe GNCD offers many different themes to choose from when starting out your course, and they keep adding new themes in on a regular basis, along with sew tools and "stuff" to use while creating your magic.  The good news here is,  the themes just keep getting better and better than the last, it seems the dev team is really taking note on the feedback from the community on what people want and like.\n\nOverall, I have been playing since day 1 of open beta, and after 1500 hours of game play time, I still enjoy and look forward to playing TGC.

While I realize this game is advertised as a sim, I wasn't under the understanding that sim implied 0 degree of consistency over the controls. This game seems to be optimized to use a controller as opposed to the standard keyboard mouse input of a typical golf game (non-sim) which is fine, but I think this game could do well to have some gauge that could be toggled on or off to show you at least somewhere in the ballpark of how hard you're hitting.\n\n"We’ve created and fine tuned a swing mechanic that is more about feeling and fluidity above the users’ accuracy of hitting a marker on a power bar. Whilst anyone will be able to pick the controller up and play comfortably, the best players on the global leaderboards will be those with the best feel for the different golf shots and who are able to take into account ball lie, weather and terrain conditions."\n\nI find the above to be utter garbage. The mechanic relies in NO way on feeling or fluidity, but instead an attempt to make visual placeholders of where a club is to indicate how powerful you're going to hit the ball. I also highly doubt most people will be abl to "pick the controller up and play comfortably." I only wish I hadn't believed their sales pitch, because it's anything but accurate. I can only hope it changes in the future, but I kind of doubt it, as the mechanic is already in place.\n\nI find the only way to fine tune your shot is to adjust the loft, which seems silly when normally one would simply hit the ball with less oomph. In short, the controls for this game, while refreshing and new, are in massive need of improvement/options. Had I known ahead of time what the controls were like, I very simply would've kept my $35. The big caveat to Steam is that there are no refunds, and now I'm out money for a game I likely will not play in the future.\n\nThat said, the game itself is beautiful, and the audio is crisp, if not a bit repetetive (the actual sounds you hear on the course ie.) your ball hitting the ground, seem to be one and the same.) making it a very aesthetically appealing experience. Unfortunately I'm a firm believer that gameplay > aesthetics.","May 29, 2014","false","1.7"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","34","58","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PaveMentman/recommended/269730/","PaveMentman","Pave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PaveMentman/","3037 products in account","Alright, since the game currently is more closer to "complete"-golf-game nowadays, I suppose it's finally a time to give an overview on this title.\n\nFirst of, what "The Golf Club" is:\n- "Bare-bones "just golf""-game with emphasis on simulation.\n\nWhat "The Golf Club" is not:\n- "Arcade-like"-golf game with "Career"-modes to become stronger, more "bling", or anything else similar: It's "Just-golf".\n\nI personally have nicknamed this game as "Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online "without gorilla-suit" and with perma-TrueSwing-mode"; not much else to comment about that aside that both games are / were quite well built into Unity3D-engine.\n((Those who are interested though, the "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 - Masters" is quite similar both the UI and the golf-play-wise, minus of course the (identical) "Greens Fee" and other things that were in "PGA Tour Online."))\n\nIn other words for the most part your avatar customization is mainly limited to "etique"-abiding outfits.\nAnd your golf-equipments are standardized performance-wise, meaning that there are no "power-golf-clubs". There might be more "style-suiting" equipment-options available in future (E.G slightly more wider+lighter-clubs to allow pitching from tougher spots with less "carry" due lessened-weight), but that's just one personal wishful-thinking.\n\n((Fair to mention that I personally mainly play with the least amount of "assistance-UI" as possible (green-grid, shot-direction-reticle, wind-indicator, and such), to which I base my overview on))\n\nAs hinted earlier, the players are also limited to "semi-TrueSwing" system, since it's by design that there is no "traditional 3-click-system" in-game to emphasis on more "feeling"-gameplay instead of being cold-hard-mechanical.\nUnfortunately at the moment, there is no "dry-hitting" so playing by just "the feel" alone isn't necessarily working for the favor of the players.\nAnd since the "hitting-indicator" isn't currently working exactly in real-time either (it appears only after the hit is done), the game turns unfortunately into quite fiddly "percentage"-game because players are semi-forced to number-crunch with the "lofts" of their clubs if they want to make more accurate shots. So in the end the hitting-game (currently) is mainly limited to adjusting the loft of the clubs and hitting with max-power, since for the most part the "fine-tune-club-action" seen in various other "TrueSwing"-game is quite non-existent.\n\nPoint being, the swing+putting-system could be better since it's currently heavily dependant on "power" only (indicated by how "back" you "Pull" the clubs). But it suffices, somewhat.\n\n\nAs for the courses (of the amount which in theory are infinite), I personally can only give a / some warning(s): Given that the major-amount of the courses are done by "everyday-non-pro"-players, there are going to large amount of courses not following the "official" (real-life) recommendations; This is very important thing to remember, especially if you're into regular tournament participations.\n\n- Especially before the "Out-of-Bounds" (or "O.B")-system was implemented in, there is large amount of "Trap-courses", meaning that if you are very unfortunate to hit your ball into one of the "trap-valleys", you're going to be guaranteed end-up getting that "+9" (or any other "max-hit"-amount set).\n\n- Since the game doesn't yet support the "cup-place-randomization", you're going to end seeing a huge amount of these placed in the middle of "spiral-macaroni"-greens.\nWhat I am trying to say is the a quite a little amount of course-designers follow the following recommendation: "A player putting from above the hole should be able to stop the ball near the hole." Okay, that is just one part of the whole thing....\nFor those who are interested for more info, here are few links:\nhttp://www.barryrhodes.com/2011/11/position-of-hole-on-putting-green.html\nhttp://www.randa.org/en/Rules-and-Amateur-Status/Guidance-on-Running-a-Competition.aspx?chapter=4&section=2\n\n\nIn overall, "The Golf Club" is a nice change in the golf-game scenery in which you can simply jump-in and jump-out freely without need of worrying whether your have enough good "gear" or otherwise "stats" to simply play both by yourself and competing with other players.\nThe issues mentioned above aside, the gameplay itself is pretty solid.\nAnd this game  isn't all that power-demanding alongside the game itself is being quite stable (at least on my quite low-spec-computer).\n\nOn a extra note, the game also features a quite extensive API for those people who'd like to make more organized leagues and similar organizations.\nThis allows websites such as tgctours.com to have more accurate data on the players themselves.\n\n\nWho knows though what the developers will eventually bring to this game; the possibilities are almost unlimited!","July 22, 2015","true","136.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","1"

And to be honest most of them become boring because they are way to easy to master. The golf club however always seems to have a new challenge up its sleeve.\n\nI have read many reviews slamming the inconsistency of playing with your mouse. My experience is that yes it is challenging but fair. I have played and struggled but learned with each round (Pro Tip, get yourself a proper mouse and a good gaming mouse pad I recommend a Gamdias Pad). Through practice and practice you can achieve amazing things and compete without a gamepad or building a swing rail(cheating in my opinion.). Now my in game handicap is at +9 and getting better(Just shot a 55 at Flathead).\n\nYou would think that if you played off a +9 you have mastered the game, but you would be mistaken. In elite tournaments playing on your handicap will only just get you in the top 50. Its all about the quest we as golfers share but never attain...Perfection.\n\nThe quest to be the best and the opportunity to really compete with thousands of other golfers is what makes the golfers club an amazing golf game.\n\nNow to the game play. Is it perfect? No, there are problems, especially regarding the rules. With rules I refer to the lack of dropping in the game when you are unfortunate enough to land in a water hazard of end up in an unplayable lie. Most times the re-hit option is enforced only on a rare occasion does the game will drop for you. As for the unplayeble situation, it play it as it lies(or restart ;-) ) There is no custom drop option which is annoying.(They have rectified the droping problem with the last update!04/05/2015)\n\nHow do you become good? Swinging straight is only 10pecent of the battle. You really have to think about you shot: Club selection, Shot Type, Height, Shape and the most important part of all, where do you want to hit the next shot from. Especially when it comes to where you what to putt from. Speed and rythm of your swing is also very important. Don't think a fast back and through will do it or get you more distance.\n\nThe Golf Club is an Awsome golf game and I feel it is one of my best purchases on steam to date. I can't wait for the Seasons DLC to come out. No problem with buying it as a add on. I feel I have gotten more that my moneys worth so far.\n\nHighly recommended!!!!! You get out what you put in just like in real life golf!","April 27, 2015","true","185.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhearMark/recommended/269730/","PhearMark","The Angry Hamster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhearMark/","329 products in account","The Golf Club is a great idea. Place a golf sim game on the PC platform when other developers refuse to and give it a course creator. What could possibly go wrong with such a strong idea? Many things.\n\nFirst and foremost this game does not run well. Even on powerful machines you will innevitably find yourself playing on Medium or lower settings just to get a decent and constant framerate. This is something that can be overlooked by many but still needs to be stated as it is important.\n\nBall striking is solid and good until you get close to the green. Due to the minimal control you have over shot distance anything other than a full 100% shot into the green is unlikely to land anywhere near where you intend it to. Putting is also a widely varying affair where getting correct distances is nearly impossible.\n\nThe course creator is one of the shining positives in The Golf Club. It has enough functionality and customization to allow for a large variety of course types and difficulties. However, more recent updates had altered some of the terrain functionality making it difficult to create smoothed surfaces with large scale changes. Still, the course creator is definitely a strong point.\n\nThe largest issue with this game currently is the seeming abandonment of the PC Platform. With their release on PS4 and XBox One, HB Studios have given continuous updates to both of the console platforms, yet have not updated the PC release with any of that content for 2 months as of this writing. ('Release was on October 8th, currently December 15th) This is the most diseheartening thing HB could have done. The console versions now have more HB created cources, 2 more course creator themes, and more bug fixes than the PC version.\n\nWith this last point in mind, I cannot recommend this game. It is a wonderful idea with a nice course creator that seems to have been abandoned before it could be made into something great. If you really want a golf game on the PC platform and have no other options then pick this up when it is on sale for 50% off or more, otherwise just steer clear. If they ever come back and give the PC platform some love, it may be worth the asking price, but as it stands it is not.\n\nEdit: As of 12/19/2014 the PC and console versions are finally on the same patch. Going forward it is difficult to tell if they will become split so disparately as before but this does not change the core idea that it is better to wait for a sale for this game than to buy it at full price.","December 15, 2014","false","121.4"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","29","49","0","2"

This game looks amazing... when the graphics decide to function correctly.  At random times they will glitch causing anything from horrific mutilations of the course, to blinding you, to preventing critical info like wind speeds and pin distance to show.  You CANNOT fix these issues, the best you can do is shut the game down and PRAY it works when you reboot.

It's a game that you're going to struggle with at first, but as you keep playing and practicing, you will get much better.  There are no special power-ups, pants, or hats, just an equal playing field where the individuals that are the most skilled, shine.\n\nThe creator is accessible to everyone.  You can have it design the course for you and automatically generate a course based on some random parameters you enter.  Or you can start with a blank slate, place the 1st tee and green wherever you want and draw the fairway in between and then plant the bunkers.\n\nThe creator may seem daunting to some and they may find themselves intimidated by all the features and controls.

It's a great looking game, and difficult without being frustratingly so. In fact, I only bought the game earlier today and I've already spent about six hours playing it, which in itself should indicate how much I've been enjoying it.\n\nSo far, I think the only negative thing I'd really have to say about the game is that the customization is pretty lacking. That is to say, relating to the amount of choice in cloths and accessories available to outfit the player. The course designer on the other hand looks pretty amazing.\n\nAnyway, I'm not one to ramble on so I'll cut this short.

The graphics are excellent on my laptop (i7 2.4, Geforce GT740 and 16g Ram) - smooth scrolling and sharp, clear detail. I found a controller the easiest / best way to play the game.\n\nIn my opinion, the game does not need a career mode as suggested by some players. Yes, it can be repetative, but so is the actual game of golf. There are currently in excess of 50,000 user created courses, some better than others. You can create your own course in five minutes if you like, or spend hours adjusting pretty much any aspect of each hole. Having access to user created courses, competitions and tours adds an extra dimension to The Golf Club that I have not come across in other golf games. I have no problem with the wind and find this fairly accurate, along with 'clubbing up or down' depending on the height of the green\n\nThe introduction of the Handicap system means you can continually try to lower your handicap on the handicap rated courses or simply play as many different courses as you want.\n\nOne thing I would like to see is a layout map of a course (like you get on the back of a scorecard) before I select to play it. Some more courses from the developers would also be good.........\n\nOverall, the best golf game by far - no gimicks, just as much golf as you want. I can see why some may not like this game because of it's simplicity - if that is the case, get yourself an old copy of Tiger Woods :-)","March 8, 2015","true","554.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

But until now I've not known a games company support their product like HB have.  It is still receiving incredible updates; so much so that it is almost unrecognisable to the original release.\n\nThe game has swallowed my life.  Buy it.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW\n\nI've spent a lot of time with this game now and I'm looking forward to spending more time with it.\n\nAt the time of review, this game is in Early Release.  But you wouldn't know.  If you pay your money now then you are getting a highly polished game.  If you like golf, you'll love this.\n\nThe game itself is immensely addictive.  It is much more of a simulation compared to the nonsensical arcade style of Tiger Woods (Hit a good shot, penalised because you weren't wearing a Nike wristwatch?).\n\nIt is easy to hit a bad shot on this game and putting can be difficult.  But hit a good shot and you'll be rewarded - just like real golf.  And that is the point.  It *feels* like real golf.  You'll get frustrated at your bad shot 'cos you know you can do better.  You'll stop and think on each of your shots.  A good round of golf *feels* like a good round.  If you've played golf games in the past then you'll know how much of an achievement this is.  And I've been playing golf games since NIck Faldo Plays The Open came out on the Spectrum in 1985.\n\nThe course creator is a real gem.  It is a beautiful tool.  Take a look at the game's forums and see some of the creations that have been put down by the community.  Many people have spent 50 hours + on their work - and it shows.  But the real beauty is the simplicity of the tool.  You can create a beautiful course in no time at all - and with little effort.  But if you put a bit of effort in, then you and others will appreciate the results.\n\nProposed additions to the game will make this even better.  Frankly, this is a must buy for anyone with an interest in golf.  You won't be dissapointed.","April 18, 2014","true","845.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","3"

I am thankful to the developers for a lovely game where I can play a large amount of golf between writing mission critical code and working on my software developments (relaxation much). What makes this game excellent is:\n\n1. The swing mechanic isn't newcomer friendly. The swing has a learning curve, you MUST pull your mouse backwards and then forwards to thrust your shots. This step done by you controlling your hand, wrist and arm need be precise for perfect shots otherwise you will inherit a large handicap. The handicap can be thought as a rank, the lower the handicap, the better your precision in this game I conclude.\n\nThe game plots a linear traversal of your mouse movement per shot, thus you can see if you need improve pulling back or pushing forward to maintain a straight swing of each club.\n\n2. Each club is distinct, each has its own feel and each has a distinct difficulty to master.\n\n3. The game is not arcade-like, it caters to a hardcore gamer. Thus it may be considered in time a golf variant eSports title, much like Counter Strike is to professional FPS players.\n\n4. MAPS! The game includes real-world golf courses thus adding more realism. The game also includes algorithms so that, a) other players can create courses and upload them for other players to play and b) you can play a new course in literally seconds thus new content additions driven by the community for the community.\n\nA sound financial investment for years of golf playing for those of us struck at our desk. Try it, when you get the hang of it, its fun.\n\n---\n\nThings I'd like to see in future.\n\n1. Graphical Settings, I would like to tweak all settings, my computer is a beast and I want to see what is enabled when I've set the game launch settings to HIGH.\n\n2. Frame Rendering when Window is Inactive. I play in windowed mode and not fullscreen, thus when I window switch to a work window, I want to be able to see frame updates in the game window (which is inactive) without having to click on it again. This is useful when in multiplayer, watching others play etc whilst I can write some more code inbetween my shots.\n\n3.

However certain types of games are well suited for early access, and sports games fall into that category.  Plus, I was really desperate for a golf game, so I took a chance and picked up The Golf Club.\n\nThis game has a ton of potential and is already in pretty decent shape, for something this far from being finished.  The game is very playable right now, even though many modes and features are missing, as is to be expected of an early access game.\n\nI really enjoy the mechanics of the game.  This is not your standard 3 click fare.  I have yet to play with the mouse, but gamepad controls work really well.  You aim with the left thumbstick and swing with the righ, pulling back to wind up, then pushing up to swing.  Hitting standard full power shots is relatively straight forward.  Intentionally hitting a slice or hook to get around an obstacle, or doing a 3/4 swing is much much touchier and riskier, as it should be.  There is also less hand holding than in most golf games, which is great.  You need to figure out effects of wind and such on your own.\n\nA highlight of the game is the course creation tool.  While it's missing some templates at the moment, as well as a lot of features, it;s already a really good and robust tool.  With a few parameters you enter the tool will procedurally generate a course in seconds, then you can tweak the course to your heart's content.  There are already hundreds of user made coursed published, some hastily slapped together or nonsensical, but many really beautiful and well made.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is already pretty good, and it will only get better from here on out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/269730/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","http://youtu.be/_ENz1NK4tQM\n\nIt's been quite some time since golf fans have been spoiled for choice. EA has dominated one of the worlds most regal games for more than a decade and those who play games on a PC in particular have been left with little to no choice in how they hit the links. Enter The Golf Club, a new Golf simulator from HB studios that doesn't boast PGA licensing or tons of product placement, but it does offer a massive game changing feature that is sure to land in the fairway with most virtual golfers: a course editor. Instead of shelling out absurd sums of money for new courses players now have access to a surprisingly robust course creation tool with Greg Norman's name slapped across it. So does The Golf Club burst on the scene like Tiger Woods circa 1997 or does it choke like Sergio Garcia on Sunday at a major?\n\nWithout PGA licensing, The Golf Club feels more like a virtual golf outing with friends than a tense and competitive sports simulation. There isn't a character creator, no RPG like leveling or character progression, no unlockables nor upgrades. The Golf Club also doesn't offer any alternative modes like challenges or mini games. You simply pick a course or a tournament and hit the links. Asynchronous play is generally the preferred play mode if you don't have good buddies available for eighteen since it allows brisk competitive play. Your competitors strokes are shown as you take your own and minimal load times keep the pace up and reduces the tedium present in other golf titles. A generic announcer provides the only semblance of professional golf tournament ambiance since galleries of spectators, scoreboards and tournament sponsor signs are all absent from the game's courses. The announcer does a decent job of reacting to your shots and making accurate assessments of the conditions on the course, but his personality is on par with a rusty, dinged-up pitching wedge. It's a shame that HB studios didn't utilize the freedom of not being a PGA licensed product to offer some more festive commentary a la Gary McCord at the 1994 Masters Tournament.\n\nThe Golf Club's bare bones feature set and lack of atmosphere and ambiance are not it's most prominent offense however, its the fact that the actual golf mechanics feel woefully underdeveloped. The game seems to favor a grip it and rip it mentality as any attempt I made to be clever with my shots ended in utter disaster with the exception of the instances in which the game decided to make some sort of idiotic club selection—teeing off on a par five with an 8-iron for instance. Speaking of club selection a clunky interface makes proper club selection tedious. Players must enter the scout camera mode to see where their ball may end up with a solid shot and if players wish to see where a different club might place the ball, the scout mode needs to be exited and a new club selection needs to be made. Spinning the ball or controlling draw or fade is slightly awkward with a shot modifier that needs to be dialed in before making a stroke. There is also very little feedback when trying to control the strength of your shots. Taking a few yards off of a stroke becomes an exercise in frustration since the difference between 70% and 100% power is a millimeter of travel on the analog stick and there are no meters or other visual indicators to allow players to get a feel for it. If there is another way to modify the strength of your shots I could not find it and a tutorial was not provided. The game's bare bones approach also means that you are stuck with a fixed club selection so don't expect to carry a hybrid or a long iron in place of your five wood.\n\nThankfully, the course editor in The Golf Club does not disappoint. Offering desert, links, alpine, rural and autum tile sets and a wide array of props, the course editor easily allows players to build realistic courses with few limitations. A number of sliders that populate the world with vegetation, water and hills automates some of the more tedious aspects of design. Bridges, wildlife, structures and props allow you to breathe life into each hole and imbue your course with some personality. Editing can be done hole by hole or freely across the entire course. Coupled with the game's mostly pleasing visuals it's exciting to turn your vision into a virtual reality and then share it with the world. It's just a shame that the frame rate can be slower than the senior tour—even on powerful hardware.\n\nThe Golf Club brings to mind all of those 1990's home designer software packages available in most electronics stores. Teeing off in The Golf Club is underwhelming but creating courses is any golf fan's dream. The actual golf is a bit clunky and in need of a swing coach with it's poor feedback, lack of club selection, and cumbersome UI. The lack of atmosphere and character progression do little to incentivize actually playing the game. While The Golf Club hasn't quite passed Q School, it's not entirely irredeemable. With so few choices for PC gamers, The Golf Club is worth considering for serious golf fans, those on consoles have a little more to consider but the course creator is quite compelling. In the end, The Golf Club logs a bogey on the score card.","September 8, 2014","true","11.7"," 41 of 75 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","41","75","0","2"

I love the game, but it's simplistic, basic, and lacks almost every option you can imagine. I am a casual video golfer, I want to hit most fairways, hit most of the greens and score better than par. It is pretty easy to do that in this game.\n\nRead the reviews and System Requirements, this game renders the whole course at once, so no load times between holes, but you need a beefy pc to play it the way it was intended and you MUST have version 11 of Direct X\n\nPros/cons depending on how you look at it:\n\nThere are basically no options in this game, I don't really ever see many options in its future, it is just a simple golfgame where you can relax and play a round of golf like an average joe on the weekend.\n\nEveryone uses the same clubs, you can only drive the ball about 270 yards without wind, but you will get wind as they won't give you the option to play without it.\n\nThe game currently has over 70 thousand user courses, but not easy searching for the ones you will enjoy playing.\n\nThe Greg Norman Course Creator is an awesome addition as I enjoy playing a different course every time I play, this is a good thing as very few courses warrant a second play.\n\nNo lobby for multiplayer, but you can play a friends ghost ball or play a live friend with almost real time results.\n\nPutter - Putting feels great\nWoods - driving is brainless, you can do it while argueing with the wife, if you can move the control stick backward and then forward you will be a star.\nIrons - I like them\nChipping and Flops is probably way too easy for most hard core golf gamers.\n\nRating:\nGameplay - 7/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nFun - 8/10\nGolf Options to make this a great game. 2/10\nManual or ingame tutorial - None - 0/10\nOptimized - Game runs on the Unity Engine, either the engine is weak or a bad choice to render whole course at once or their coders can't optimize it as they seem to dummy stuff down with each new addition, like the engine can't handle anymore or the code is running amok. 3/10\n\nI guess this game is a buyer's beware game, you'll either love it or it will run like a 2 legged dog.\n\nI really enjoy this game. Yes, I think it could be better with some freakin' Options, but that ain't gonna happen.\n\nMy overall rating would be 6.5, but I really enjoy this game and I have to play on medium with a Windows7 Home Premium, service pack 1, AMD FX 8120 Eight core processor, 3.10 Ghz, 8Gb Ram, 64bit OS, Nvidia Geforce GTX 560 2 GB card.\n\nOK. Now go buy this game, but don't come running to me if it doesn't run on your PC. I am a glass half-empty type person so your mileage may vary.","July 17, 2015","true","627.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The course editor is fair, although it too, seems to be lacking some. Having said that, it is possible to produce a nice course with effort.\n\nDownside is anyone and everyone can publish a course.  Some are great while mose are just Auto-generated with no real thought placed into them. Making a hugh library of crap courses.  Problem here is you don't know how bad they are until you play them.\n\nEven a few of the "HB Official" course are questionable.\n\nA course review by users would help determine which course would be worth playing. but, then you have to weed out the "typical" bash or praise user comments.  Ditto on the course rating system.  ratings are worthless without some sort of commentary to back them up.\n\nHowever, this is no reason to at least purchase the sim and try it yourself. It is worth the 35 dollars.  It does appear that HB Studios is working on continual improvements for the PC user side of the coin.  I'm not a fan of "console" sim games.  Console and serious "Simulation Games" and non exsistant in my opinion.  I know this is harsh to some, but being old school hard core computer geek.  Consoles will never match to power of a high-end computer sim.  Software companies save cost issues on coding for multi-gaming platforms and Console gamers make them the most money, so the PC user usualy is the Dinosaur in the room for gamers.\n\nI still think that in the end, if you're a PC gamer, this wll be a great sim after a few more patches and issues get resolved.\nGetting it now will allow you to get use to the gameplay and feel for what HB has done.  Graphics are great eye-candy, but can be taxing on a even a high-end video card.\n\nI still find this sim very enjoyable.

It only picks up halfway into flight, and sometimes flight is shown from the side (which I don't want). In recent years, most golf games (like Tiger Woods) follow the ball from the moment the club hits it, which gives a lot more visual excitement to a quite cerebral game. So I tried F12 to experiment with available Cam modes, only to find that the game gets confused and stuck, and options show weird POV's. After not being able to find my way back to my golfplayer, I have to go back to the main gamescreen and then choose Resume Game to return to a recognisable view.

I currently have devoted 105 hours playing it.  The sheer number of courses and various terrain really draws the player into the game.  Of course, it is not perfect.  First, you need to play the game with a controller to really enjoy the experience.  Second, the game is challenging like the game of golf.  Third, there is room for improvement and additions.

Many are complaining that it's difficult, other's try to compare this to tiger woods. The biggest complaint is the fact that this game is difficult, it has not indication of where the ball will land, you cannot change your power on the swing as effectively as in every other golf game. There is no 3 click swing option either.\n\nWhile these features are negatives for others, i find this brilliant. It's as close to a real golf game as can be. If you are a real golfer, you will know that golf, is part luck and part experience. In real golf you cannot really control the strenght of your swing, your golf club is designed for a set distance and momentum does the rest. You can adjust your stance and swing to give you an INeffective swing which is then called a chip, punch or a pitch. These types of swings are created by constraining the swing of the club. GC does the same. You cannot see where the ball is going to land IRL, you hope it's going to land where you want it to land, this is what GC does. It's not always possible to have a 100% power on swing in real life, this is what CG does.\n\nNow if these are going to change, i would not know, but it sure as hell stops the above avarage scores from happening less than often. Along with the course designer, you will always have to think to play and not run in like a pro and finish 24 below par. The game has some performance issues and there are a few hiccups, hence the ALPHA state. There are however a few recommendations that will turn this into the best Golf game i have played to date. Having a stamina meter or the option to play randomly created golf courses of your friends will really make this one shine.\n\nFor those seeking something easier, run back to your Mario Golf or PGA tiger woods games and stay away from this one. This is golf....in digital form, so SUCK IT UP and welcome to the real golfer's world.","May 24, 2014","true","207.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gaymersaurus/recommended/269730/","Gaymersaurus","Prometheus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gaymersaurus/","286 products in account","This game should not have mixed reviews as it has. It is an excellent game as it is today! Do not be fooled by the vague, "one dimension of the game earns it a thumbs down" reviews. Here are some things you need to know before buying it so you do not harp on the game for one single thing.\n\nThis is a direct x 11 game. If you do not have a compatible graphics card that can play directx 11 games. do not buy this until you do. It says that under recommended hardware  andunder the bare requirements for the game.\n\nThis game is best played with a controller. It does its best attempt for smart control on a keyboard and mouse but having a controller is should be the standard for you to enjoy the game. This game does not hold your hand.  The game play is a simulation of real golf and this game is a simulator without the licensed pros.\n\nThey have put so much into the physics of the game that you have to account for the environment as much as the consistency of your fingers playing it. All these people calling it inconsistent are really just having a hard time being consistent operating the controls to the game. It is not the game making the mistakes! This game is unforgiving and if only with the added handicap does it love you. So if you get it, practice, and look at the tutorials on their website explaining golf physics and information in understanding their game. You would realize it was you all along. This is not a simple push a button to hit the ball sort of game.\n\nIt also does not display the line of trajectory before you hit. This at which I think is amazing. Do you see the line of trajectory of your golf ball before you drive or putt in real life? NO! Can you imagine how boring the leaderboards would be if they held your hand to the top. A popular game called Dark Souls is so popular because of how hard it is. This game is the golf version of that. It is hard and that is why it is fun and also fair.\n\nNow with that there are a few things I hope change for the better to make this game even better with some suggeastions.\nA little more selection in the appearance and attire including colors of the golfers and clothes would be nice.\n\nI do not believe female characters tee off at the female tees. Not that they need to, but the ability to do that would be nice.\n\nMaybe you could come up with attributes for each person so one players golfer drives further, or pitches better. It seems fake that everyone can carry a ball if they perfectly control it and account for weather, hit 265 yards every time. So maybe have some diversity somehow, which would unfortunately mess with the balance of the game so it is tough idea, but play with it. Just something so that if all things are perfect, we don’t hit the same distance. Right now we have a few avatars who have the same muscle strength.\n\nAnother feature that would be nice, is if when you are looking for a course to play it would display if you have played it. The game does not immediately display if you have played the course. This game has so many courses and I forget which ones i have played. You have to click on the course and go to leader boards to see what previous score you earned to know if you have played that course. So maybe a quick indicator if you played, maybe even how many times you have played it and maybe even a score display since last time you played it.\n\nI know since this is a golf simulator most people would not go play golf when weather is bad and the conditions suck, but maybe you can allow rain and other features. Maybe bring the variable of temperature to the game and how it effects golf ball movement. It wouldn’t be the first time someone coordinated a game of golf with friends and by the time you reach the back nine a storm cloud emerged bringing lightning and thunder or if it is a cold day maybe a little sleet or snow came in with the clouds. Then maybe you can go back to the club and wait (pretty much skip bad weather) on take the challenge of playing in the even worst weather. Now gamers, don’t overreach with this comment that this would mean they have to simulate the golfers health if they get struck by lightning and maybe you should manage hydration and injury or your mood or your golfers social relations because your worried your wife is going to find out your cheating on her ;-) and that will effect your game. I doubt the creators would go so far, but that suggestion of even more varied weather might be a great additional feature.\n\nI hope they come up with more game modes to play on, Like foursome, scramble Ambrose, Texas/ Champagne  scramble, skins , greensome, patsome, chapman, better/best ball.\n\nThe amount of statistics the game provides is phenomenal. Add more if you can.  Like 3 days ago and yesterday stats.\n\nThe ability to play a course while playing other peoples ghost games is amazing. Also you can play your previous ghost games against yourself. See where you went wrong. Genius!\n\nThe graphics are phenomenal. This game is beautiful hence direct x 11 requirment\nAdd more subtle sound effects. Like a plane going by. Love it when planes go by. A golf course by my house is near a airport and i actually find that sound soothing lol. More ambience sound effects.\n\n\nMaybe, instead of using the course maker, actually make a driving range or putting, pitching, chipping range. Of course you can do this in the course editor with no tarnishment to your stats, but still.\n\nBy the way that course editor is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. The amount of options one can take and the amount of courses the community has made is gorgeous. You will almost never have to play the same course twice and if you do, play to beat your own records or beat someone elses.\n\nMaybe allow people to make custom clothes and clubs?\n\nAnyway, just an amazing game this is. All my suggestions and feedback should not be a list of disappointments the game does not have, but rather a fan boy going far and beyond.\n\nPlease do your research before buying this game to see if it is for you. They are not falsely advertising the game, you are just lazy. Do your research please! If i think of any other addons, comments for my review I will add it later.\n\nThanks you guys for the great game and I hope you are not done improving it. You have really made something special in this game","April 7, 2015","true","60.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Mates good naturedly sledging each other whilst playing a round at the local Golf Course is a strangely relaxing way to enjoy a day. Yep it is a game where “……….. you yell "fore," shoot six, and write down five”. ~Paul Harvey\n\nNo longer however, as HB Studio’s has recently released The Golf Club. This is a golf game based on that premise of it is you and your mates playing at your local golf club. There are no licensed courses, and strangely this makes little difference as there are more excellent courses than you will ever be able to play from the 1000’s already available.\n\nWhen playing these courses you will feel like a virtual champion, even by scoring +2 or -8 and for the majority of virtual golfers this will probably be around your score. That is exactly what makes this game so good, yes you will hit drives straighter, but still have your shanks; you will still have some tricky approach shots which at times will make you feel like a hero and other times like you are playing real golf; and the putting in my opinion is the best that has ever been in a golf game. The amount of putts I just miss, genuinely makes me feel like I really am out on the golf course.\n\nThe graphics are of a very good quality, you will not be disappointed by the look of these courses, though be aware there are a very few, that could make your system of choice chug due to the amount of detail that has been added in. HB Studio’s were on to this quickly though and have now placed a cap on the amount of detail that can be added to prevent this, however there is still plenty of room to create your course rendition.\n\nYes, you have read between the lines well from the odd comments in the last few paragraphs. This golf game also comes with an extremely good course creator. How good, well the Greg Norman design company now use it as a design tool for their clients, and there are many superb user created courses, some of which can be seen here on my YouTube Channel;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaQ9yFmYtTDa1Ln3hzklh6jeJMPz-m2uB\n\nIn conclusion this is a golf game no virtual golfer should be without in their collection. The course designer is worth the price of admission alone and well the game play itself;  “If I had cleared the trees and drove the green, it would’ve been a great shot ~ Sam Snead", will keep you coming back for round after virtual round.","November 5, 2014","true","543.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drumbolio/recommended/269730/","drumbolio","ars.vamperon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drumbolio/","185 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEven from the start of The Golf Club's early access campaign, the player had access to one of the best golf engines on PC since the Tiger Woods franchise stopped being developed for computers. The swing system demands a controller, and if you read the forums, you will see that people trying to use a mouse and keyboard are quite sore over the current implementation.\n\nHowever, with a controller (in my case, the XBox 360 controller for PC,) the swing system is incredibly intuitive and challenging! You never feel cheated off a bad swing, as the stick-based swing reads your pull back and push forward incredibly accurately, and if you fade or draw your shot, you know it was because you did not shoot a good shot! With an analogue stick controller, the swing system is the best, most challenging, but most rewarding golf simulation on PC right now.\n\nNote, as a design choice, the developers have already said that they will never develop a 3-click system or a similiar power meter. They feel that their swing system is incredibly important to keeping the simulation feel of the game, and they think that a power-meter system will cheapen the game. Please make note of this, and do not buy this game, if you are expecting a Hot Shots Golf or Mario Golf type system!\n\nAethestically, the game is a bit lacking. The game does not have any real progression for your character - you can play rounds, tours, or other competitions of varying length and difficulty the moment you boot up the game. The challenge comes from the rounds that other players have finished, and you are competing against ghosts of their low scores. This can make the game feel a bit lonely, but they have slowly been adding more functionality in, such as the ability to play your friends live if you both play the same course, and you can even switch on a turn-based system to make it feel like the two (or three, or four) of you are alternating shots. The multiplayer feels a bit patched together and enough features are missing that it still feels a bit unprofessional, but ever since launch they have been fixing bugs and adding new content. Once full-stat tracking goes live, the game will become much more interesting as you challenge your friends in a variety of skills.\n\nThe game includes a full course editor, and this is incredibly important, as the game ships with only a few courses developed by the dev team. However, playin custom made courses is an absolute breeze. You can view player-made courses just as easily as the developer made ones, and a 0.0-10.0 rating system allows you to mark your favorite courses, and see which tee's the Golf Club community think are top notch. Already there is a wonderfully recreated version of Augusta National, and I'm sure more PGA-tour courses are going to be developed by the community.\n\nThis is very important as well, as this indie, small-studio game does not have the PGA tour license. There are no professional golfers at all in the game - it instead makes you feel like you are a club or amateur player getting their turns on a huge variety of courses set in a huge variety of difficulty levels. As you get better you can choose to play near impossible courses where the fairways are narrow strips of land between two lakes, or you can choose to hone your short-approach and pitching skills on a variety of par 3 courses.\n\nAs more high quality replications of real life golf courses are added to the game, you will begin to see a product that more closely resembles the Tiger Woods games of the past. I read that this indie studio was originally contracted out to make the analog-swing stick system for previous Tiger Woods games, and their pedigree at making an incredibly well rounded golf engine shows. However, you can also see that they have very little experience creating the rest of the product. The UI is very minimal, the announcer volume is best turned to 0 after a round or two, and there is almost no flash or style in the presentation itself.\n\nDespite this, there are many other benefits than just the solid swing system. There is no loading time between holes once you load the entire course. Like real life, you can see the other holes around you when you're on the course, and as soon as the ball rolls into the pin, you are onto your next drive. They recently made shot adjustments more challenging - in early versions of the game, it would tell you exactly how many feet you were adding onto or off your shot by changing the angle of your shot higher or lower. Now, it only shows a percentage of your full shot power, making the system more challenging and realistic.\n\nIn the future, I would love to see some official branding, such as official golf clubs, clothing, and other gear. However, I know it is an indie studio, and at the end of the day, they have made an incredibly well rounded golf SIMULATION that is absolutely terrific at doing what it advertises - letting you experience rounds of golf on a near-endless supply of courses. The developers have been constantly tweaking, refining, patching, and adding new content into the game since its early access launch, and despite a few early stumbles, the game seems to be well on its way to being the best golf simulation on PC.\n\nIf you liked the Tiger Woods games, or if you think you would enjoy a golf game that challenges you to be perfect nearly every shot, like the game does in real life, this is a must-buy for you! Golf fans, please do not sleep on this purchase simply because it doesn't have the pomp that EA golf games have. As the community adds more high quality content and the developers further refine the game, this has the potential to be a long lasting success!\n\nAs of July 19th, I rate this game an 8.1/10.0\nGo buy it; I need more friends to compete with!!!","July 19, 2014","true","79.7"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","1"

What can i say? it plays a very good round of Golf!  Graphically there are obvious similarites to a certain game featuring The Tiger... but thats where it stops. ( same team see )\n\nThis is more about a relaxing game of golf, than all those tiresome silly special moves etc.\nI also really  like the stand in commentator on this early access version!\nI believe its one of the developers doing the witty commentary. You should go with him but give him a script! in the finished version.\n\nThe course content is phenomenal, due to everyone creating courses in the creator. Even if the licence was not available  or the actual real life  course is not in the game, theres always one been created by the community thats very similar.  Online multiplayer , ghosts and leaderboards are all there too. This is going to be such a great game.\n\nThe early access version is excellent as it is! so i expect good things when its released everywhere soon. The consoles are getting this game as well. And they do say that all created courses are available to play, on whatever version of the game you own!  so if i made a course on the PC, a console owner could play on it too. Exciting stuff indeed!\n\nIt reminds me of Tiger crossed with Links Golf.\n\nMy chosen control method is an Xbox 360 pad by the way.

In regard to PC it is still hard to go past PGA 2008, and The Golf Club unfortunately does not exceed that 6 year old package.\n\nPositives : Equal playing field. No body gets exclusive equipment, putt previews and all that cash content that ruined EA's PGA On line. The swing and putt mechanism are fairly good, and without previews the game is  harder than the last PGA offer.\n\nNegatives: Has the feel that it was once intended to be the package to end all packages, then was banadoned, only to be picked up and released with "what we have to date".\n\nLike PGA it is a brag session for good players, the scorecards does not list other players at my skill, only the elite.

Right now it just defaults them to (Name_1) not the name I've set for them.\n\nI also wish I could disable the ball following lines, and also speed up the ball when in mid flight.\n\nThis game IS GOOD though, I don't think it's exactly worth the $40 price tag, and the way they sell stuff can be a little dodgy, as the season mode is a paid DLC but they're minor, If you can get the game for under $30 it's well worth it.\n\nPros:  Amazing Graphics, Wildlife, And Plants\nGreat Simulation of a frustrating sport\nCourse creation is amazing, You'll never get bored playing the same 10 courses\nThe Commentator isn't generic and annoying like most games\nWon't cost you $50 for a pack of real balls to lose in the creek Cons:  Player Customisation is limiting\n4 Player mode should save custom players\nSome HUD options for lines etc would be nice\nPricing is a little dumb founding. (I believe in DLC, But for Season mode?) Conclusion\nGreat golf simulator, Probably the best on the market right now, I would highly recommend the game to any avid golfer or anyone who wants to play a golf sim, Don't look at the game though if you're after an arcade Tiger woods though. I'd also recommend the game be purchased under $30, But if you've got the money you won't be  disappointed.\n\n79/100","February 10","true","9.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

The Golf Club kicks off where the last of the good golf sims left off - probably Tiger Woods franchise in my eyes.\nThe physics and feel of playing the game is spot on and I found myself loving the gameplay within minutes.  Graphics are some of the best I have seen for golf games, audio is good but the commentary is an absolute treat!  From the witty remarks and subtle hints at conditions the delivery and tone of the commentator is perfect and only wish we could have more of it.\nNumerous options for games such as Teamball etc and Tournements plus Seasons gives you a career progression if you wish or you can just pick a course that you fancy and swing away.\nPlaying multi player works fine and there are several options to fiddle with if you want to watch each shot that your mates take or just move ahead and get on with the round.\nThe biggest win for this game is definately the amount of courses that are on offer, apart from the dozens of official ones form the developer there are literally thousands of courses that have been made by the community with the Greg Norman Golf Course Designer which is included in the Collectors Edition, some of which are better than the official ones.  Only negatives are the lack of customisable equipment such as choosing or upgrading clubs, balls etc.  You can change the clothes of your golfer but thats about it.\nHands down the best golf sim out there for PC at the momnet and I also have Perfect Golf - the best competition for this at the moment but by no means is it even close to the polished product The Golf Club has become.\nGreat game and a great community follwoing makes this a smart purchase at anytime.","November 12, 2015","true","47.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Couple that with an amazing course editor and we just might have the best golf game ever created.\n\nThis review is incomplete as the game is still incomplete and I don't want to take anything away from it with negatives that will more than likely get fixed as the development process continues till release. As it stands right now there isn't much in the way of features or modes other than the course creator and being able to play against other players ghosts (I find this feature annoying and usually always turn it off).\n\nI would like to see more graphics-type updates and/or options. Some sort of career and more custimization of your character would be nice too. Other than these (minor) gripes I think it's great.

Golf is an ourdoor game, and trees make for great challenges and good looking courses, but the game's AI tends to place them extremely poorly..... Such as in the middle of the fairway, immediately in front of the tee block, and most hilariously on the greens.\n\nNext up would be the coding for Fairway/Rough/Deep Rough/OMG WHY.  The colors of the terrain are a good indicator, but the game doesn't exactly follow them.... For instance i landed in the deep rough, bad me... Wait.... It thinks i'm hitting out of water?..... 58-68%, alright, i'll compensate..... swing... and 10 yards.\n\nFinally (and MOST aggrevating), putting.  The putting mechanics seem to scale your put based on distance, and from long range you have two options, 15feet short or 20 feet long.... But as you get closer the opposite happens.  I don't know how many 1 foor puts i've missed, sometimes three in a row.... Simply because the game thinks one foot away you still need almost a half swing.... Which in any other situation on the green will leave you 16 feet past.\n\nI've yet to determine what the difficulty on couses really means (i'm assuming tighter swing control since the red band view following shots is more narrow on difficult courses).\n\nAll in all a promising game, i hope it makes it to production and final distribution.... Though if you're looking to score -13 on every round, this game will be extremely frustrating.  As for the putting mechanics........ Just eagle it from 150yards out and save yourself the headache.","September 21, 2014","true","32.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's difficult to judge shots that aren't full shots, theres' no meter to show  your swing power, it seems like shot shape is totally determined by mouse movement tempo... get a little quick and you'll be hooking  your way around the course.  Tournament play is dull, I've only ever played "ghost" players.  There's no storyline style of play w/ some sort of career path or tour path.  There's no variety of equipment or ability to maybe get some "boost" going from an amatuer to say a pro where you swing a little faster and get more distance, etc.  Overall it's not fun enough to hold my attention for more than about 10 mins at a time unless you're designing a course and then you can spend hours tweaking it (which sadly I have) and I probably won't play it much in the future.","September 14, 2014","false","75.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Bit of a graphics hog but Hb Studios is still hevily invested in the community and keeps tweaking, updating and optimizing this wonderful golf game. If you like the feel of a weekend golfer type game without all the commercialism and unrealistic buffs and boosts then this is your game. Plus it comes with a nice course creator for those that enjoy spending their time making player created content.\nThe swing mechanic is done very well (sorry no 3 click here) as it was heavily worked on and tested during Aplha, Beta and Early Release. It' probably the best thing I enjoy about the game. It requires some time investment to get used to it but that is what makes it great. You'll find plenty of rewarding moments when you pull of some fantastic putts and shots.\nHB Studios has done some interesting and different takes on multiplayer and the social aspect of the game but that is what makes it refreshing and fun. You'll find some negative feedback but kudos to HB Studios for not trying to please everyone and sticking to their fundamental precepts about the game. If you do decide to buy take the time to read through the forums and give them some constructive feedback as to how they may improve the game. While you might not get what you wish for you will at least be heard and considered. I can't thank them enough as I and many others have been waiting for decades for a golfing game like this.\n\nThanks again HB Studios!","October 9, 2014","true","798.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Many have been waiting for a new golf game for PC and the wait is over.\n\nGRAPHICS\nGraphics are good, but the early release lacks advanced graphics settings so the quality is limited at the moment. With a bit of anti aliasing it would look great. Not sure if its just me but the sky and trees often 'flicker' during animations and transitions but small things like that are to be expected during early access and its by no means gamebreaking. Trees are reasonably good - a bit more variety would be good but they look nice.\n\nEDIT: Flickering seems to be gone.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay is heaps of fun, but I think it might get boring quickly as it's a little too easy. This release lacks difficulty settings and the current difficulty can be mastered in minutes. I'm not sure about the putting - judging power is very hard as there's almost no indication of the required power, it's just guesswork. But in saying that I feel that the difficult putting helps to make the game a bit more challenging. I have only used a controller which makes short work of hitting the ball. I feel that there needs to be something else in the swing mechanics - timing maybe. It's just a bit too easy to hit a perfect shot nearly every time. The physics is excellent - the ball spins as you would expect and interacts well with different surfaces.\n\nCOURSE CREATOR\nI have spent 3-4 hours in the course creator and so far it's great. I don't think there is an option to start blank (without generated holes) which would be great. It lags a little every time you make a change to the course which gets annoying - especially when adding trees. The edge of farways can sometimes get a little funky for no reason but it can be fixed with a bit of playing around. Other than that it's great. I've had a lot of fun playing peoples creations and there's heaps of variety in the user-created courses.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\nOne thing really lacking at the moment is customization and I'm sure it's coming in the future. You can currently choose between a few golfers and change the colour of your clothes which is fine for now. Hopefully there will be a store of some kind where I can purchase clubs, balls, clothing, etc. with money I've earned playing tours. Using the Imperial system is killing me - I can't find a setting to change to metric (tell me if there is one) which makes it hard for me to replicate local courses in the creator. I'd like to see an XP system implemented to increase your ability as you level up/gain XP.\n\nOverall, The Golf Club is an excellent golf game and it's only going to get better as new updates are released. Thank you for filling hole that was left after Tiger Woods Online shut down.","April 21, 2014","true","37.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

They have really improved this game. The mechanics are so much better than the last time I played, it is astounding.\n\nThe multiplayer is still a little weird, but it is playable.\n\n$30-$35 is pretty steep still, but if you can snag this game when it's on sale, it would be a good buy.\n\n***********************Previous Review Below*******************************\n\nUPDATE .51: As of this update, They have added turn based multiplayer which is a step in the right direction and I applaud them for this action. When your friend hits, you are still seeing them a few seconds late but I have hopes that they will improve this.\n\nThe only thing keeping my reccomendation a no is really the price tag.\n\nI think once the ingame issues are ironed out, it will be worth the $30 tag. But as of right now, it is not.\n\n***********************Previous Review Below*******************************\n\nAt this state, I would not buy it unless you are wanting to play this game by yourself.\n\nMy biggest reason that I am not recommending this game is becuase of the lack of structured multiplayer. I bought this game for that one purpose and I feel let down. The multiplayer it currently has, has you select your friends that are currently playing that course and that will allow you to see them on your scorecard. From there, you go into the game and your friend hits the ball and about 10-20 seconds later, you see their ball fly after they hit. It is very hard to Play a game with friends when you want to see their shots and want them to see yours as well. If you come from WGT, You know what I mean here. Your friend can finish the hole and move on to the next hole before you even tee off. It is not turn based which may be a positive if you don't like waiting but to me, I wanted to see my friends shoot.\n\nPROS:\n-Looks Great\n-Swing style like tiger woods\n-AWESOME course creator\n\nCONS:\n-Lack of structured multiplayer\n-Club/power/distance is off (ie 15% power with 100 ft putter will go 4 ft on flat green)\n-Current courses seem very similar to eachother\n\nAgain, this is in its CURRENT state.

It's menus and UI are ultra clean and the hole to hole commentary is my absolute favorite. It feels extremely relaxing while still satisfying. As far as the way other players and AI ghosts are implemented, I thought it was well done. The real time trails keep games moving at a quicker pace, and have enough visual cues to have me interested in the competition's play as much as my own. Those were the stand out positives for me.\n\nEverything the game lacks feels like that's because the project is a work in progess. The characters lack any sort of gear customization outside of clothing, gloves, and shoes. I found it difficult on occasion to drive the ball as far as other players and for a novice player, I felt I was lacking neccessary instruction on how I could improve my shot distance and accuracy. I felt that I either hit the ball with too low a shot power percentage or at exactly 100%, even if that's not what I wanted. Maybe if I can't pick up on the visual measurement for shot power a meter could be implemented like in other golf games. The game also did not show a guess as to where the ball could land, but just an idea of where I was aiming. In conjunction with the scout camera, I actually liked the lack of extra graphics on the grass, but at the same time, some of my shots suffered due to a poor understanding of where I had really aimed the ball. The game lacked the female golfer model, facial customization, and the games graphics, while suitable, need a lot of work done in regards to vegetation, trees, and their shadowing.\n\nAll in all though, I felt that my purchase has already been justified if it helps the developers reach the next patch/update. I am excited in the future of this title, because with the lack of a new Tiger Woods game, a lot is riding on this game to fill a gap for me.","July 2, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Would love an EA tiger woods (or as it is known a rory mac now) game for the PC, but this will do.  Putting is hard, needs a preview mode and sadly there is no computer bots to play against but if you want a multiplayer golf game to play at home with your mates or online I recommend it.  However, it does get a bit lonely by yourself, and would like a ball spin element to it too.","September 2, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It's menus and UI are ultra clean and the hole to hole commentary is my absolute favorite. It feels extremely relaxing while still satisfying. As far as the way other players and AI ghosts are implemented, I thought it was well done. The real time trails keep games moving at a quicker pace, and have enough visual cues to have me interested in the competition's play as much as my own. Those were the stand out positives for me.\n\nEverything the game lacks feels like that's because the project is a work in progess. The characters lack any sort of gear customization outside of clothing, gloves, and shoes. I found it difficult on occasion to drive the ball as far as other players and for a novice player, I felt I was lacking neccessary instruction on how I could improve my shot distance and accuracy. I felt that I either hit the ball with too low a shot power percentage or at exactly 100%, even if that's not what I wanted. Maybe if I can't pick up on the visual measurement for shot power a meter could be implemented like in other golf games. The game also did not show a guess as to where the ball could land, but just an idea of where I was aiming. In conjunction with the scout camera, I actually liked the lack of extra graphics on the grass, but at the same time, some of my shots suffered due to a poor understanding of where I had really aimed the ball. The game lacked the female golfer model, facial customization, and the games graphics, while suitable, need a lot of work done in regards to vegetation, trees, and their shadowing.\n\nAll in all though, I felt that my purchase has already been justified if it helps the developers reach the next patch/update. I am excited in the future of this title, because with the lack of a new Tiger Woods game, a lot is riding on this game to fill a gap for me.","July 2, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It'll get better but it is.... Unity... apparently. I was on the high settings so no real drama this early on.\n\nBut the golf. Ahhh... The golf.\n\nLinks 386. This is how far I go back in this genre so I can pretty well say I've been there, done that. Tried them all, even down to the Wii with my kids. Those bulbous heads and stupid haircuts really made me laugh. Really. This is *golf* and you look like an idiot!!\n\nOops... Sorry. I digress.\n\nThere's something very, very different about this golf sim. You need to actually plan and play your shots PROPERLY. Got that? PROPERLY.\n\nThere's no little swing indicators and clicky bits. There's no arbitrary line to STOP for "maximum power". This sim does require a finesse of stroke and practise regime like nothing I've ever seen. It's nice.\n\nIf you're a must.have.line.to.click player this may not be for you. You've been warned.\n\nBut... but.... this is easy to grasp. Intuitive even.  (although much harder to master if you want that tricky fade around those trees on the 17th).\n\nThe visuals in this are nice and no doubt the GPU issues will chill a little as optimisations go in.  It is early access at time of writing so I'm not going to scream agghhhhhh with my extra power costs just yet.\n\nThe commentary is sublime despite an obvious repetiveness if you play badly for prolonged periods. It's sardonic, 19th hole humour if ever. "John" has obviously played many a round with many a weekend hack... and it shows. Some may be put off by it. It's down to how you perceive it.\n\nI like this game but I suspect it will wear thin quickly. The scores are just arbitrary numbers and the stroke play, while intuitive is well... quite wrong. This is not 8-ball and yet I push vertical while I look at the green. I'm hoping some changes in the future might address this.\n\nWorth waiting until final release if you're squeamish spending. A must for golfers with scorecard phobia out on the real course.\n\nI'm sure casual golfers will find it pretty easy too - after a few rounds. It's not rocket science. Not on a computer anyway.\n\n8.5/10 - gg","April 23, 2014","true","33.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is a game I'd give a "meh" to more than  just Yes or a No, but considering the lack of development the last few months I'm giving it the thumbs down. That's mostly due to the launch condition of the game. There are some sins that should not be tolerated by the public and the launch of this game was abysmal.\n\nThe Golf Club is a pretty mediocre representation of golf with issues that have been around since it launched in early access - inconsistent swing meters, very poor performance, dull voice overs, varying object qualities, iffy physics, overpowered wind and a few other problems. Anyone who claims this is a "simulator" doesn't understand the meaning of the word. You can tweak your shot, but the shot mechancis themselves are uninteresting and (unfortunately for multiplayer) extremely easy to "cheat" with. Edging with the mouseswing is a common problem online and in virtually every match you'll run into someone who is using it to hit every shot dead straight.\n\nThe career mode was released later and is DLC, which didn't make me too happy considering the massive release problems. Customers should have gotten more for their loyalty and patience.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the game is totally horrid. If you're lucky enough that the game runs well for you, then you're less likely to run into the swing meter issues (they're often based on sudden frame rate drops). Get the right course at the right time of day and the game can be quite attractive. The course designer isn't as powerful as some, but it's quite easy to use and the pregeneration of terrain is something that is a great idea. It's a Power to the People course designer and you'll see lots of them, some of them quite clever.\n\nThe devs are hit and miss. They are not bad folks, but they knew a lot of these problems existed and rushed the game out the door to match the console release (and it's quite obvious this is a console golf game first and foremost). So fixing obvious problems like the green grid not working or being able to retract your course from the public (if you accidentally published it) have gone lacking. The short game is another place in this that the game is abysmal - forget trying to hit half or three-quarter shots because the mechanics don't lend themselves to doing so. Some of these issues have been subsequently fixed. Some have not.\n\nThe post-December patch seems to have improved performance. They've stoped farting  around with trying to boost the user ratings of their own courses. In short, they've made progress. This is the good part. However, it's still not a simulation and there's no way I'm giving this a thumbs up because of the horribly botched release and months of inaction of their part.\n\nHowever, the swing is still tempermental and relies on frame rate to achieve 100%. Turn the settings up and the swing meter goes wonky. And now there's too many really lousy courses to comb through, so finding something worth playing has become an exercise in futility. What's worse is that you can't even provide any kind of decent feedback and to rate the course you still have to complete the round. Who wants to complete a round on a course that sucks? That's both the good and the bad part of having a designer that will spit out somewhat ready-made courses. You simply get an overabundance of stuff to choose from but then finding a good course is like looking for a needle in a haystack.\n\nPersonally, I find that Perfect Golf simply "plays" a much better round of golf. Then again I'm partial to that Links 2003 style of approach to golf. YMMV but I'm glad this isn't the only PC golf game on the market.\n\nLong story short, good effort, mediocre execution, questionable development...equals thumbs down (or at least buy only on sale). I can't recommend this at full price.","September 28, 2014","false","26.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Playing with the mouse it's nearly impossible to control power.\n\nThe core issue is feedback. Sure, you gauge the size of the backswing, but there's a lag moment after you start the swing where the animation updates. During this gap you will be pulling back on the mouse and seeing nothing happen, then suddenly you are at 100%.\n\nDespite this glaring, house-on-fire design issue, I'm still giving this game a thumbs up because it's so good in nearly every other aspect.

I've only had it for about a month and we have already received 2 major updates with features and enhancments.  The DESIGNER is outstanding.  You can create your own courses if you choose....or play any of the 70,000+ courses that have been created by other users.  Yes there are some Auto-Generated terrible courses, but you can find some amazing courses that rival some of the best real world architects out there.  Forget having 8 courses to play on your new ARCADE golf game.  This is real world golf on super realistic excellently designed courses!  5 Stars from me.  Oh and if you want it on PS4 or XB1 it's there too.","August 21, 2015","true","784.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What I'm trying to say is that you have to have at least a little bit of an interest in the game of golf, and I believe that this game is perfect for the people looking to get into the actual game. As a simulator, The Golf Club is about as good as it gets with the technology and resources that the devs have. All I'm saying by this is that this game is obviously still in Early Access, so you cannot expect it to be a GOTY golf game right out of nowhere. If you do have a friend who is interested in the game of golf, introduce them to this game and see how they like the concept of the game first. Of course, this is still a video game, so it does not quite present the greatest representation of golf in reality. It does, however, have some of the qualities though. You have to judge your shots carefully and watch out for hazards. You have to read the break on the greens and also the speed of them. This game will definitely show some of the qualities of how a bad golf round can all of a sudden turn good and more often than not, a good golf round going bad. I usually spend hours on the course everyday trying to practice and get better and when I leave the course, I just want more and more. So when it's late at night and all you can think of is playing golf, launch this game and play the hell out of it. The course editor will allow you to have hours of fun creating the course of your dreams or even a silly, fun course that isn't fair at all. The online game modes are incredibly fun and will keep competitive golfers competitive at home. Just buy this game if you love or have an interest in golf. You will certainly put a few hours into the game.","July 18, 2014","true","54.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For hitting the ball, a precent gage someplace would be nice.  I have brought my stick back on my game pad to roughly the same area and have hit the ball from 100% to 80%. This is not very good in my opinion.\nThe putting grid, well, just needs to have more grid lines to it, the system, once you figure it out or watch the tutorial, is very good otherwise.\n\nIf these two where fixed, i think this would be a very good game.\n\n8/10\n\nI am recommending this game for those who like or love golf.  The game has it's issues, and may take from the game from time to time, but sometimes it feels a little real without going out to a course with clubs yourself.","December 25, 2014","true","17.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

I am currently playing the game windowed and on 1024 x 768 to acheive a decent frame rate with my measly geforce GT610 card. The course creator works really well and puts me in mind of the great Jack Nicklaus course designer of yesteryear. You can build a super detailed masterpiece or a quick knockaround course with relative ease and play at anytime to make sure it's what you want. The golf mechanics of the game itself are quite realistic but would still like to see some kind of gauge for the swing if only one that could be turned on and off at any time. Also many people still favour the old tri click method so if that was implemented it would give the game true flexibility. One annoying bug i have noticed is that when you start a game with either ghost balls or more added golfers if you then exit the round after a couple of holes it saves your progress automatically but when you return your single golfer self is now the only one playing. Anyway theres no other golf game that can really come close to this one at the moment it has flexibilty, great multiplayer features and a jaw dropping course creator.

It has been on my wishlist for quite a while so I was very excited to finally buy it today. After 5 holes I gave up and am asking for a refund after only 30 minutes of gameplay. I can't say it's a bad game but I think it would probably be better with a controller (which I don't use). I'm used to the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of golf games and when I got to the buggy mess that was TWPGAT 08 I had had enough. I bought this thinking it would be a great replacement but was sorely dissapointed. Everything seems to move really slow, the swing, the ball and the cameras. It was like trying to play in molasses in winter. As well the courses were not as realistically made either. The fairways were too skinny and the texture for them was not that realistic. TWPGAT 08 looked more realistic to me than this. I would have to say my biggest gripe is the swing mechanism. It just doesn't feel right. There was no backward and forward swing, just backward. It didn't feel natural not following your swing through to the ball, but I think that is the console port mechanics again. Like I said this is probably a different game if you are used to a controller, but I'm not so it was a real missed hit with me.","October 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","1"

The devolopers have promised throughout beta that they would continue to improve upon the game and actively work with players to create the best golf simulation they can.

U wont be dissapointed IF u can live with an early access version for now...\n\nOkay, lets get started with the graphics:\nThe graphics are nice but u need a rig which is potent. I didnt have had any big framedrops so far. Sometimes there were tiny  laggs because of 30 frames in a couple situations but a little tweak here and there and there will be no problems at all. I would say my rig is decent: 8GB, 7870 pcs+, i5 3570, bla bla bla ;)\nThe shaders were good, the lightning is good as well but can be a bit better. The detail modell is also good. Still looks better than any TW on console at least it will be if u dont agree...\n\nThe Sound:\nOkay, this one is tough. I like it so far but the commentator is a mess :D...Plz, get a second one with more emotions.\nSo far I turned him off. It would be great if there were some spectators around the course to create an atmosphere like u are at a masters ;). I hope something like this will be available for online tournaments, maybe as an option because of the overall performance...\nDriver, Wood, Iron, PW, SW, hitting a tree, hitting the water, the ball hitting the ground, it all sounds right. Could be more crisp sometimes but maybe that are only my ears which are used to the special sound overload with my last PGA Tour Title.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nAlthough this game is in early access i have to say it plays very nice. There is hardly no difference between PGA Tour and The Golf Club (Swing-mechanic). If u played with a controller and the right stick swing mechanic ur in good shape.\nIn my oppinion TGC is little bit more precise and therefore harder. For veterans its still possible to play huge rounds on an easy course when they play for the first time. The difficulties are the created courses and there are sick ones out there :D. Love it!\nMaybe the putting need some work. The way it is right now is good but if u have a long put u dont see the hole just the marker. The difficulty of putting, which is like PGA Tour, is that u dont have a percentage for ur swing. Because this game is more precise its difficult to get the right power for the putt. 21Ft put with a horrible break is a very tough one. Maybe its good like it is and i have to get the right feeling. An option for a scala in percent for ur swing still would be nice.\nThe one thing everybody is really complaining about is the swing. It doesnt look as smooth as PGA TW. For me its not a big deal but if u can create ur own player different swing versions would be nice. Right now the swing looks a bit stiff at the end but i think this will be better soon.\n\nThis is it. Just my two cents for now. I didnt test the editor but everybody says its the ♥♥♥♥, so i guess its good :D\nAs is said, its early access and there is much to do for the devs but its very much playable/ enjoyable.\nThis game needs no licenses for players, courses, etc...The community will build TPC Sawgrass..Put the work effort into the gameplay dear developers. Make the swing better, give some more options for the hud or the gameplay itself. Give me more freedom of creating my own player,not just changing the colour of everything. Let me plz decide if i wanna have more power, better iron shots, better putting or more accuracy from the rough, whatever...Make every created player unique in a way. Maybe its planned? I dont know but i like to know...\n\nQuestion: Is it possible to play with friends? I mean do i play against a ghost-ball or is there something like a spectator-mode? A specator mode would be awesome. I dont wanna play against ghostfriends all the time if thats the case...I wanna see him swing, follow his ball into the water or near the pin...Predict if its good or feel his pain.\nIn this times where lets plays are all over the place and everybody is watching them, a spec-mode is necessary ;)","May 15, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The go-to golf game for me for many years has been Tiger Woods 08 (I do NOT want to know how many beers my brother and I have consumed playing it over the years).   :D\n\nI am a big fan of "click click click". The Golf Club does not support "click click click" (at least, not yet/that I'm aware of?) but I have finally enjoyed a golf game that employs the use of a game pad. I just finished off a round and ended up one under par ...  which included a bogey, a double bogey and a quintuple bogey (nooooooooooo!)\n\nAmusement. I am very much looking forward to continued updates!

My first early access game and I am duly impressed. Reminds me of Links 2003 for some reason only much better. After not being able to get Links running anymore I started playing the EA TW PGA Tour games until they came to a halt. I'm still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at EA for dropping golf and hockey from the PC. I have been looking for a great PC golf game for quite a while now and I think I've found it.\n\nHaving read a lot of the reviews, I see that a few people want the old 3 click swing and the developers have said that they conciously decided not to put power bars, etc in the game, and I think that was an excellent decision. Must admit that I was a tad skeptical about using a gamepad. My performance on my first few holes was laughable at best, but I quickly improved as I got used to using my Xbox for Windows gamepad. I soon realized that this swing method is about as close as you can get to the complexity of a real golf swing, and it adds a bit of realism to the game for me. I have found driving to be the easiest, and although my short game and putting are improving, they still need some practise. So, I haven't even tried the KB/mouse method and I don't care about the 3 click swing - I'm good with the gamepad.\n\nGraphics are very good indeed, especially for an early build, as it currently is. The game runs smoothly on my system with nary an issue, although, I have recently upgraded my system substantially, so that could have something to do with it, from what I have read in the reviews.\n\nI have been recommending the game to friends and I most certainly recommend the game to those reading this. If you are into computer golf at all,  I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this game, and this is still an early build. So, a sincere thanks to the developers for delivering a 'top of the line' body of work, which has been a long time coming to the PC, and to Steam for making it available to us. And whilst I'm farting flowers over here, hats off to Steam - I have become a fan - it's a great way to game!","July 5, 2014","true","39.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

And, that is not the true golf always be. By selecting the direct, simulating swing by controller or mouse, I just feel I am playing golf. The controller will give you percise shot easily, and you will find mouse is closer to your swing in life. That struggle makes me feel great.\n\nIt is still developing, I want to see more game modes and customing clubs in future.

U wont be dissapointed IF u can live with an early access version for now...\n\nOkay, lets get started with the graphics:\nThe graphics are nice but u need a rig which is potent. I didnt have had any big framedrops so far. Sometimes there were tiny  laggs because of 30 frames in a couple situations but a little tweak here and there and there will be no problems at all. I would say my rig is decent: 8GB, 7870 pcs+, i5 3570, bla bla bla ;)\nThe shaders were good, the lightning is good as well but can be a bit better. The detail modell is also good. Still looks better than any TW on console at least it will be if u dont agree...\n\nThe Sound:\nOkay, this one is tough. I like it so far but the commentator is a mess :D...Plz, get a second one with more emotions.\nSo far I turned him off. It would be great if there were some spectators around the course to create an atmosphere like u are at a masters ;). I hope something like this will be available for online tournaments, maybe as an option because of the overall performance...\nDriver, Wood, Iron, PW, SW, hitting a tree, hitting the water, the ball hitting the ground, it all sounds right. Could be more crisp sometimes but maybe that are only my ears which are used to the special sound overload with my last PGA Tour Title.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nAlthough this game is in early access i have to say it plays very nice. There is hardly no difference between PGA Tour and The Golf Club (Swing-mechanic). If u played with a controller and the right stick swing mechanic ur in good shape.\nIn my oppinion TGC is little bit more precise and therefore harder. For veterans its still possible to play huge rounds on an easy course when they play for the first time. The difficulties are the created courses and there are sick ones out there :D. Love it!\nMaybe the putting need some work. The way it is right now is good but if u have a long put u dont see the hole just the marker. The difficulty of putting, which is like PGA Tour, is that u dont have a percentage for ur swing. Because this game is more precise its difficult to get the right power for the putt. 21Ft put with a horrible break is a very tough one. Maybe its good like it is and i have to get the right feeling. An option for a scala in percent for ur swing still would be nice.\nThe one thing everybody is really complaining about is the swing. It doesnt look as smooth as PGA TW. For me its not a big deal but if u can create ur own player different swing versions would be nice. Right now the swing looks a bit stiff at the end but i think this will be better soon.\n\nThis is it. Just my two cents for now. I didnt test the editor but everybody says its the ♥♥♥♥, so i guess its good :D\nAs is said, its early access and there is much to do for the devs but its very much playable/ enjoyable.\nThis game needs no licenses for players, courses, etc...The community will build TPC Sawgrass..Put the work effort into the gameplay dear developers. Make the swing better, give some more options for the hud or the gameplay itself. Give me more freedom of creating my own player,not just changing the colour of everything. Let me plz decide if i wanna have more power, better iron shots, better putting or more accuracy from the rough, whatever...Make every created player unique in a way. Maybe its planned? I dont know but i like to know...\n\nQuestion: Is it possible to play with friends? I mean do i play against a ghost-ball or is there something like a spectator-mode? A specator mode would be awesome. I dont wanna play against ghostfriends all the time if thats the case...I wanna see him swing, follow his ball into the water or near the pin...Predict if its good or feel his pain.\nIn this times where lets plays are all over the place and everybody is watching them, a spec-mode is necessary ;)","May 15, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The Golf Club does not support "click click click" (at least, not yet/that I'm aware of?) but I have finally enjoyed a golf game that employs the use of a game pad. I just finished off a round and ended up one under par ...  which included a bogey, a double bogey and a quintuple bogey (nooooooooooo!)\n\nAmusement.

This game actually does that pretty well. However this game is slightly more challenging than TW series. I would consider this more "sim" type and TW more of an arcade simulator. The part that stands out to be the most difficult is the putting. Which I haven't quiet nailed down yet and sometimes can be a little frustrating. That said I've played a few rounds on this game and have really enjoyed it. The graphics aren't bad but in this day in age could be a little better. It definitely has that Unity engine look/feel.

Unfortunately, they haven't.\n\nGOOD:\n\nCourse developer - It's awesome.  The addition of Greg Norman's team made a world of difference.  Cheers to the developer for putting out such a great tool kit.  The possibilities are literally endless, as are the number of courses.  I do wish the developers would allow us to insert interactive spectators/crowds to add to the realism of tournament golf.  If you're interstested in course design, this is as good as it gets at the moment.\n\nGraphics - When it's not having framerate issues (again, on the latest and greatest GPU/CPU on the market), it's a treat to look at.  Some of the greens appear to be jagged around the edges on high spots, but overall, they look good.\n\nBAD:\n\nFramerate - Nothing has been done to address the glitchiness/bugs in this game.  For instance, on many of the games courses (predominantly on Links or Desert courses), the screen simply stutters upon any movement.  On some courses, the ball or hole on the greens just disappear.  Try attempting to make a putt with no ball or hole.  The developer stated they were working on fixing these bugs over a month ago, however, it is quite evident they've done nothing to solve these issues.  That is extremely frustrating when some courses do not have this issue, are beautiful to look at, and run smoothly\n\nStats - This is supposed to be a simulation game, but the stats keeper makes ZERO sense.  Hey developer, golfers are stat freaks and are always looking to improve.  There's no way to compare yourself to anyone else playing the game when the stats/rating system are completely screwed up.  FYI - The developer stated they would address this in Aug too.  They haven't.  That's telling.....\n\nModes of play - A lot left to be desired.  I'm hoping in the next game (if there is one), will be interesting and keep the gamer engaged.  Maybe try getting the PGA Tour to sponsor a future game.  More game/match modes will people interested in playing your game.\n\nGame physics;\nPutting - It is what it is.  At best, it's inconsistent (at all distances) and there is a huge learning curve.  New players will either tolerate or hate it.  It will frustrate you, there's no getting around that.  It still needs work and fine tuning.\n\nDistance control - The best way to gauge distance is to adjust the percentance of the shot and swing 100% (not realistic).  Around the greens, it's terrible.  There's also no skill involved in hitting everything 100%.  From the get go of the game, everyone hits the ball exactly the same distance and your distance never improves with your player's career progress.\n\nGlitches - I've already mentioned the framerate problems, but there's other things that need to be addressed.  For instance, let's say you hit your driver or a low punch shot into the sand.  Congrats, your ball will be plugged everytime.....not kidding.  If it rolls in, you've got half a chance.  If your pitch/chip hits the pin (even softly), enjoy watching it rocket across the green behind you.  Great way to ruin a good round.  Lastly, if you hit your ball into the water, 99% of the time, the game makes you rehit for your previous location and does not allow you to drop on the line of the ball into the water.  The player should at least have the option.  When the games does drop for you, sometimes it puts you into the ruff.....\n\nControls - It's much easier to play on a keyboard then controller.\n\nPlayer model/swing - There's only one.  Why?!\n\nFinal verdict:  I love golf, whether in real life or on the computer.  However, this game leaves me with the feeling of untapped potential.  I hope, going forward, the developer gets it right and listens to its user base who want it to succeed (I do).  Unfortunately, at this point, the negatives out weigh the positives.  Yes, the game can be beautiful to look at, but the frustrations of the a faulty swing system and complete lack modes can not be overcome by a fantastic course creator.  With that, I'm putting my sticks away until EA Sports releases the next iteration of PGA Tour golf or The Golf Club 2 is released and it's a complete game.","July 11, 2014","false","405.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","2"

Even then nothing in the game tells you how to take a shot, you have to go to the community discussions and check the keyboard mouse faq, and there is no built-in option to change the controls.

I have played a number of other golf games also, but I always found myself going back to Links because of it feeling "truer" than other golf games. That is until now, and playing The Golf Club, chances are I'll never be firing Links up again.\n\nI have been waiting a while to play TGC, because golf is frustrating at the best of times, so the thought of playing a golf game in early access was something I was certainly not prepared to do. I can only guess that many people did play this in early access though, and that is where the negative reviews have come from. The fact that the reviews are mixed for TGC really, really baffles me.\n\nNow TGC is not perfect... The UI is a bit of a nightmare, making it feel like a console port, and no multiplayer lobbies for PUGS is a bit of a shame. Fortunately, TGC is absolutely fantastic when it comes to actually playing golf. The lies are great, the physics fantastic, and the graphics are beautiful. If you are a fan of golf, then this is exactly what you're looking for.\n\nI have seen criticism for TGC not including a three click. Well I have being using mouse and keyboard and if you set up your sensitivity to what is suggested then it feels great. Yes there is room for error, like golf, and this room for error brings such great satisfaction out of your good shots. It requires a learning curve which will not take long at all, and trust me, what you get out of this method is far greater than you will with a three-click.\n\nI will say though, that TGCTours.com has completely made this game great. Here you can register and compete against multiple skill-sets of players, in a real season, with all competions true to the regular professional golf calender. Also remember, every guy you're competing with has the same club bag, and swing, albeit controllers may be used as well as mice. Personally I like the mouse as it requires a more physical "swing" than pushing forward an analogue stick. However, it's nice to know that "three clickers" aren't dominating leaderboards.\n\nThe Golf Club is truly a spectacular golfing game, and the community (TGCTours.com) has absolutely rescued the lack of social elements for HBStudios.\n\nWow you've read this far? Go register for qualifying school, earn your card, and go compete. You will not regret it and you won't regret owning TGC.","February 28","true","180.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

I have been told by them everything from they are to busy but will look at the issue soon to the ball being in AMD's court somehow.  I have offered my time to work with them to fix the problem as I said I really do want to play this game in a working state but have been ignored.

Control over your swing varies massively from one stroke to the next and there's absolutely zero sense of the power you're putting behind any given shot. Putting is obnoxiously difficult for both of those reasons.\n\nAlthough one can certainly (probably) get used to playing it, getting to that point is not at all an enjoyable road.

The game is like a consol game but can be played with pc keyboard and mouse. Unfortunatly such games always feel like a consol game no matter what.\n2). The developers write on the forum that they will NEVER implement any kind of power meter that will allow you to view how hard you hit the ball.. Since computer golf is not like in real life where you can feel and easy adjust the power then the game is rather difficult to play since it is difficult to know if you example use 100% power or just 85%...  In the current state of the game it is like guessing and hoping for the best.\n\nThe positive..:\nWell I like the possibility to design your own golfcourse and share it with other golfers just like in "sim golf" from the 90's.\nYou can also play with your friends or play online turnaments and gain some kind of score in the future.\nBut they have no plans of making any real "career mode" like in Tiger woods golf where you start with handicap 54 and need to play to become a pro... However they maybe will implement a kind of money system so people can win some prize money in a turnament ( like a kind of highscore i think ).\nThe graphic is pretty okay but i would say 2010 graphic level, but it is not really a problem, and alos the game is not finished in development.\nThe greens are equal to tiger woods where you have a kind of net that show you the terrain and indications about how it will effect the ball like in all other golf games.\nIn general the game do have potential and are not that bad, but I did not want to own a game that do not have number 1 and 2 since that is features I belive every golf game need to pocess especially the power meter.\nShould you buy this game.. well maybe I would say but it is not worth more than 25 euro even when I imagine the finished product..\nI have personaly asked for a refund after 33min of playing time.","June 20, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

Nothing like tiger woods game where the game would basically show you everything, putt previews, before shot line of where it will go and much more non realistic ♥♥♥♥! The Golf Club will kind of show you where the ball will land (in a given area) but that can be toggled off.\n\nEasy to use controls and gorgeous courses!

I can't wait for different clubs and skills points to make golfers more uniquely skilled. I could care less about making my golfer look different or changing his outfit.

A few qualms. Not being able to skip through the entire shot animation is fairly annoying. After a while, you just get bored with seeing the post-shot animation or waiting for a ball to stop rolling. Also, the putting never feels quite right. It might be that it simply takes some getting used to, but there's not really much of a guide to it. I don't know what generates speed, pulling the putter back a certain distance or how quickly I shift to the forward position on the analog stick...or both. Just really confusing. Not a lot of clarification, making putting one of the single most frustrating things about the game...much like actual golf, I suppose.\n\nOverall, though...amazing game. For an early access build, the game reeks of polish. I would like some more options with shot setup, such as foot placement, pinpointing feel (pulling the shot back to the target and utilizing the percentage listed there to make the adjustment), and slope degredation from golfer to target would allow shot setup to be more user-friendly. Hopefully, some of these options will be available at retail, but if they aren't, it's still a great golf game...and it's on PC.

Everything else though looks quite sharp, bit more polish on the visuals and menu for any 'next/current gen' talk required for me. I also hope they can grab some licensing on this title, tournaments and players.

I couldn't start the game at all. After lots of searching and experimentation, I eventually discovered that the reason the game wouldn't start is because I had SLI enabled on my graphics card. It turns out that this game hates SLI cards so much that it won't even launch when it is enabled. If I wanted to play the game, I had to play it with SLI disabled (this is a big issue for me as I have a GTX 690 which is a dual GPU card meaning that I would take a massive performance hit).\n\nThe game seems unoptimised too. Using one GPU of my card (essentially a GTX 680 performance wise), the game, on its lowest settings with AA off, would rarely rise above 40FPS.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly fun but feels a little clunkier than the old Tiger Woods games especially when it comes to the short game around the greens. Without a doubt, the best thing about the game in my opinion is the course designer. It is just so fun to create your own custom courses and the sheer number of user created courses is staggering.\n\nProbably the biggest beef with this game however, is the putting! It just infuriates me.\n\nYou just don't feel that you are in control of the ball. And the worst part is that there is just no indication of how hard you are hitting the ball. You are just expected to judge power, but the putting feels very clunky so it is almost impossible to do. You always either hit the ball way too far or way too short. I just don't see why there isn't any sort of power meter.\n\nIn summary:\n\n+ Great course designer\n+ In most cases, fun and interesting gameplay\n+ Tons of user created courses to play on\n\n- Clunky feel when taking shots\n- Putting is pretty annoying\n\nOverall, 5/10","May 31","false","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Not to sure what happened with the latest patch but putting is way off now .  Really rough on the cpu .   I see lot of complaints about the performance but I haven't seen any resolution addressing that problem.  Why????   Love playing it but its a very fickle game.

I know you want a golf game, but trust me this isn't it.\n\nThis game runs embarrasingly inefficient. System specs:\n\ni7-4770K, OC'd 4.1 ghz\nGeforce GTX 770 (MSI TF n770)\n16 GB DDR3 ram\n3TB HDD\nZ87-g45 mobo\n\nI can't get better than 31fps. When the game was in beta, I could get 60 in windowed mode, and 30 fullscreen. I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, but it sure as hell isn't optimized. And even if it were, the graphics look kinda clunky, second-rate. The reflections off the water are at times glaringly terrible. These were issues that were easy to overlook during Early Access. You know, things you expect to be fixed before launch. Oh how wrong we all were.\n\nThis will be the last title I support in Early Access.\n\nThe controls are really bad. You have no way to judge exactly how much swing you're applying, other than 100%. The power applied during the swing IS NOT PROPROTIONATE TO THE BACKSWING. Meaning, if you take a full backswing, and apply slow pressure upward, you could swing 10%, 45%, or hell maybe 88%. It's all a crapshoot. Instead of using a visual meter, you're supposed to learn to "Feel" the swing and the club.\n\nSorry HB, that's not the way that games work. I'm not actually holding a club. I don't have Chubbs to show me the hip technique.\n\nThe controls are especially terrible in your approach game. Need 60 yards with your Pitching wedge? Sorry, the closest we can do is full blast at 120 yards, good luck estimating your power for a half swing because your backswing has nothing to do with the result. Again, no visual standard. Oh, you didn't want to hit it 85 yards over the green and into the water? Better luck next time, because that's all it is, luck.\n\nHere's some other thoughts:\n-Announcer is painfully annoying. You'll want to kill him.\n-All the players look like they could have had the same parents.\n-Course creator is okay, but the finished product always looks rough.\n-Cheaters are using "edging" techniques to never hit anything but a straight shot. Have fun with that.\n-You can count the number of songs featured in the game on one hand. In fact, roughly half of your hand.\n-No crowd. No atmosphere.\n-No player progression. You'll always drive 100% max at 265 yards with no wind.\n-No live multiplayer.\n\n-No reason you should consider buying this game.\n\nGive me Tiger Woods 2004 on the Xbox over this any day of the week. I wish I could get my money back for this. Don't buy it.\n\nI know, you're thinking, "But it's a golf game, it can't be that bad can it?" It can, and it is, because people like me saw potential and the developer did not live up to it. They still got my money.

There are no gimmicks here. I didn't even bother with mouse/keyboard. By this point every PC gamer should own a good controller (I have a flight stick too), invest in a XBox, PS3/4 or PC gamepad controller.\n\nThe way you set up is like in real life, you can choose draw or fade, high or low shots using the joystick. The putting seems really good so far too.\n\nI have not had any crashes or bugs. Yes it runs a little slow but my rig is modest and it is extremely playable. As for the lack of content reviews, there is a course creator in here. I have not tried it yet but that should be amazing.","April 17, 2014","true","6.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

I am actually making the one I work at in real life.\n+ Many, many different courses to try out\n+ Swing is just awesome! Unlike other games, what is unique with this one is: No power-meter! And no 3-click swing. Which gives great challenge! Exactly what I was looking for. It does not take many hours to get used to it and get your own feel about it.\n+ Good graphics, cannot really complain about this one.\n+ Ball physics is good\n+ Good community and good staff.

Graphics are okay but not nearly as good as Tiger Woods. Create a course is a very good idea but is not very easy to use and many of the courses I've seen created are very horsey in terms of their design and make it difficult to progress.\n\nCons: Nearly impossible to hit 100% shot without using your mouse. Many holes you get in a situation where you need to be able to hit 100% shot and if you do not, you end up in the drink. The game is lacking content in terms of campaign modes. There is no golf shop to get better gear. The create a golfer is not robust, leaving you with a very lackluster golfer that looks very bland with no characteristics.\n\nAdvice To The Developers: Please take a minute to realize that there are many holes in the games that require you to be able to hit 100% shots. I do not mind that I'm not able to hit 100% shot as I feel that adds a realesitic touch to the game but at the same time, it's very frustrating to reach a hole where you cannot progress due to the design of the course. Also consider adding more unique content such as a true campaign mode for us player who do not care to play tournaments 24/7. Perhaps even add in challenge style mini games to enhance replayability.\n\nRating: 2.5 stars out of 5","August 24, 2014","false","6.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","2"

Fire up a random course after you've worked your way through the fairly unresponsive UI;\n2. Wait 10 seconds for your golfer to do some random animation, while you can't actually do anything (great);\n3. Notice the 15mph blasting windspeeds;\n4. Make an unnatrural backswing;\n5. Ram the controller stick forward with just the right amount of speed and power;\n6. See your ball fly at 89% power;\n7. Wonder what the hell is going on;\n8. Restart the course.\n\nRepeat this loop for about 8 to 10 times, untill, by the grace of the Almighty, you finally hit your tee shot with 100% power, while you didn't really do anything different.\n\nGreat! Right?\n\nNope... Same thing for every single shot in this game.\n\nYou take your time figuring out how you're going to approach this green with 130 yards to go and 15mph headwind.\n\nYou club up, twice maybe, yeah that's about right.\n\nYou take that nice swing, everything feels great, the terrible backswing animation plays and you let 'er rip.

I know it's in its beta stage, but this is inexcusable. Tiger Woods PGA 2001 ran much smoother than this does...\n\nMy graphics card is able to support games like Skyrim, the Elder Scrolls Online, GTA 4, and Flight Simulator X on MAX settings with absolutely NO lag/frame rate issues. NONE. When I played this, I had to set the graphics quality to LOW and it was STILL laggy, so if its lagging on your end, trust me, it isn't YOUR card's fault.\n\nThis has a lot of potential, and I hope they fix it up a LOT more before the launch date.","April 27, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Being a PC gamer, I hadn't played a golf game since TW08 so I was excited for this game coming out on PC. I played it quite a bit at first, but have ultimately become bored with it and can't see myself playing much more (FWIW my actual time spent on this game is probably closer to ~40 hours than what is displayed on my profile). I'll start off with the good:\n\n1. The course creator. The course creator is loads of fun, relatively easy to jump into, and is capable of creating many different layouts. Camera controls, and the terrain tools (mostly the hill brushes) I found annoying at times, but nothing game breaking.\n\n2. The game looks extremely good visually. Furthermore, using the lighting options in the course creator, you can create some absolutely spectacular views on your course.\n\n3. Putting. Putting is very rewardable in this game making you actually work for many short putts, and making distance control a challenge for long range putts.\n\nAs for the bad:\n\n1. While the game looks good visually with high end settings, don't expect to actually be able to play with good graphics unless you have a good gaming computer. My high end non-gaming laptop, which does meet the system requirements, can only run the game smoothly on a 800x600 resolution with low graphical detail. Quite frankly, the game looks ten years old with these settings. From discussions on here and the HB website, the graphics card seems to be the problem. I have a GeForce 630M, so if your graphics card is comparable to that don't expect to be able to play with reasonable looking graphics.\n\n2. Single player lacks any sort of depth. Given that all you can do is play a round of golf, unless creating courses is your thing, don't expect much replayability. Don't know about multiplayer because I don't care about it.\n\n3. My biggest problem with this game is simply that it isn't close to a realistic golf sim. I easily hit over 90% of fairways, never unintentionally hook or slice the ball, hit probably around 80% of greens in regulation, hit clear over the green from the green side bunker half the time, hit a 75% shot anywhere from 30-100%, and despite putting being pretty good, I still hit a 5ft putt 20ft past the hole on occasion. This kills the game for me. I think a lot these problems come from lacking difficulty sliders, which in my view are essential for any good sports sim game. If you're expecting realistic results from this game, there is a good chance you will be severely disappointed.\n\n4. Mouse/keyboard controls are a nightmare. I gave up with the mouse/keyboard after a couple of hours, and borrowed my friends xbox360 controller instead. Would strongly recommend using an analog controller.\n\nI would recommend purchasing this game if course creation is really your thing, but if you are looking for an in depth realistic golf sim, I can't recommend The Golf Club.","July 1, 2014","false","108.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The multiplayer mode implemented in this is not exactly what you would expect.\nUnfortunately I acquired this via gift swapping, else I'd consider raising hell to get my money back.\n\nYou need to manually add up to three friends as "live rivals" and then enable "turn order" to get a reasonable MP experience (albeit with quite some shot transfer delay). Why they don't go for some lobby/party system and actual realtime MP is beyond me.\n\n\nThe jolliest feature I found was that F12, the Steam screenshot button, is by default bound to... ♥♥♥♥ing up the game.\n\n\nGamepad and keyboard controls are wildly different (unbalanced) beasts, and neither makes it easy to hit a controlled shot at less than 100% power. TGC can't really decide what it wants to be, with developers decrying dial-a-number golf games, but then offering much of the same in their loft/draw/fade "shot modification" menu and overly reliable 100% shots.\n\nOverall, I very much regret the acquisition. In the light of the price and the overall prevalence of negative reviews (with some additional complaints not mentioned here -- for example I did not experience forum censorship first-hand, having not ventured into this game's forum), I can't recommend it for anybody but hardcore (PC-)golf fans.\n\nP.S.: Interested parties can also observe cameos of some excellent Unity-style physics systems, like the ball being literally unable to stop rolling on various surfaces.

It doesn't make sense to not include at least some form of guage during swings, in this game you go in completely blind because the developer wants a more "realistic" experience. Well guess what, this isn't real life, it's a video game being used with a game pad or a mouse. In real life, I have the benefit of the tactile experience with the club, I have the benefit of knowing my own strength, I have the benefit of being able to modulate my swing based on my own body. In this game, I have no idea how hard a hit is going to be simple based on how far back the pixelated avatar's arms are back. There's no good guage or meter system. If they aren't going to include the 3-click swing, they should at least show how far each club would hit at full power, and then show the power meter filling up as you pull back the swing. Anyway, it's their decision to develop the game how they want to develop it, but they deserve their mixed reviews and I definitely recommend not buying this title. There's other problems too, but this is a quick and easy example of the developer's refusal to work with the medium and the control schemes in an intelligent way.","January 30","false","16.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","3"

The swings are dumbed down enough to teach a 3yr old to hit straight, and all the information you need, and precise loft control with grids and percentages is given to make a shot of any distance nearly effortless. This is dial-a-shot-golf, void of any risk/reward you may be looking for in a golf game. Putting, however, does require a special touch, but on an average course you have to mess up pretty bad or not be paying attention to be left with putts of any significant distance. It is not a stretch by any means to say this game would have been dead in the water if it weren't for countless community made courses because the gameplay is dull and unrewarding.\n\nSimply put, if you are here because you love golf and are looking for an authentic experience, I would turn away and look elsewhere.","September 23, 2015","false","168.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

This is the least fun golf game I've ever played. I wouldn't recommend it even if it were free. There were honesty better golf games on the sega genesis. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT STINKS. I won't buy another title from this developer. I disliked this game so much that I actually went through the trouble to contact them. I don't care if you remember if you got my contact or not. Too bad I played it for more than 2 hours so I can't get a refund. It was winter time and I couldn't play real golf, otherwise I would not have spent the time I did.\n\nFurthermore, this game is almost at the "negative overall" review threshold. He's basically begging people to change their negative reviews, but being pretty immature about it. If you are thinking about dropping $30 on this game, then I urge you to just take a look at the defensive and insulting way that the developer responds to people who honestly thinks the game is BAD. In my opinion, the lack of integrity and the way that the developer basically says it's the reviewers fault makes me throw up in my mouth a little.\n\nAbout the game...........The putting is bad. The physics are bad/unrealistic. It's easier to get good at real golf than it is to play this golf "sim". The graphics are "maybe" sega dreamcast level. In game, it doesn't look as good as the screenshots. It's just not a fun game and a complete rip-off at $30. I really hope the developer stops responding to negative reviews the way he is because it's really offensive. He should probably take it to heart and come to terms with the fact that the game isn't good and stop insulting people who think that The Golf Club delivers poorly as a golf simulation.\n\nI also don't care what awards you've won. All that tells me is that I should no longer trust those sources when determining whether or not to buy a game.","February 4","false","15.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

Unfortunately devs have taken a sledge hammer approach to the swing mechanics. You'll find most use a controller for this game - if you want to do that then you'll likely fare far better than struggling along with a mouse & keyboard format that's been forgotten by the design team.\n\nDevelopers offer little to no feedback towards any changes - stealth updates with no notes and stealth mechanic changes that aren't mentioned in major patches. Forum moderators can offer no information on developer progress towards updates which take weeks even on PC. Feedback feels largely ignored for the PC crowd, rather routine "dev" blogs focus on xbox and PS4 issues almost entirely.\n\nGenuinely sad writing this as I've plut hundreds of hours into it - it used to be great, wonderful, a really enjoyable test of skil.

I've run Titanfall, Arkham Origins, and Battlefield on very high settings without any issue, but this game slowly degrades and starts glitching out and artifacting all over the place.  The temps are higher than those other games.  I'm running a Radeon r9 270.\n\nThe swing/put mechanism is nice I guess, but it is certainly not inherently better than the more classic interfaces from older games.  One could argue that this introduces a realistic element of "skill" and "practice" but that would be neglecting to mention that not everyone has the same controller setup, nor do people have the same hands, nor do people have the same amount of time to practice.  This is a video game that people paid for so there really isn't a need to create a gap to simulate the fact that some people are just going to be bad at golf without massive amounts of practice.  At the very least, add in a more classical control scheme option for more casual players so that people who want a fun PC golf game can have it while the more hardcore golf fans can have their some what more sim styled game at the same time.\n\nThe courses are plentiful and you can edit and create new ones so there really is no point in rating those.  The course system they have is excellent, however and exactly what a golf game needs.  Kudos to that.  Another kudos is the way you play against ghost rivals.\n\nMinor annoyance:  Cannot name guest players in hot seat multiplayer.  Jeopardy on the NES lets me name each player.  No excuses.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot recommend the game for the current price at this moment.  I'll fiddle with the game a bit more to see if I can improve the performance, and hopefully future patches improve everything in general.  This has the makings of the best golf game on for PCs, and one of the best ever, but it definitely has a ways to go.","July 1, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I believe this is what forum people call rubber banding.) causing chipping and putting to be extremely difficult. (long delays in motions that are supposed to be ~1-2 seconds)\n\n2) The character is still doing pre-swing motions after I click and drag back to start my swing, meaning the mouse and swing have completely disconnected from each other.\n\n3) I played 36 holes before uninstalling, I turned the commentary off after 2.\n\nAfter reading thru a lot of forum posts to see if the complete lack of feel during the short game is just me or not, it seems to be affecting a lot of people using a mouse instead of a console controller. Sounds like a good game if you plug in a controller, I strongly recommend staying away from this game if you plan on using a mouse.","July 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The pros are that the game runs super smoothly, the courses are beautiful and the ability to easily create your own courses (although I've never made one myself - I have played a few created ones, and they were well done). However, the game is extremely inconsistent when it comes to gameplay. Most of the time, you need a club or less than the recommended club for a particular length. 170 yards on flat ground, no elevation change and no wind? Choose a club that hits 158 yards, or even a club lower. Use the club that's supposed to hit 170, and you'll be lucky if the ball doesn't go 190 yards.  Putting is also very inconsistent from hole to hole on the same course. Chipping is a freaking nightmare. If you have to hit a ball anywhere from 10-20 yards off the green, it's a literal crap shoot. What might send a ball 3 yards this time, might send it all the way across a flat green the next time. The wind is also a nightmare. A side wind of 10mph might send a perfectly hit shot 30 yards off course one hole, and the same wind won't effect the next tee shot at all. Another big con is that everyone plays with the exact same clubs; there is no variation, no upgrades, no individual style. Unfortunatley, there isn't much else to choose from in the world of golf games, and so I will continue to be frustrated playing this one for now.","July 6, 2015","false","37.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","1"

From playing I could immediately tell this was awful.  Using the mouse is like emulating an analog stick.  This is a straight console game, not even a port.  It's like a badly emulated console game.  Absolutely impossible to get any feel.  When you start to pull down on the mouse for backswing, your player has a delayed reaction, same with the downswing.  If you want to hit a 50% shot, good effing luck.  Putting is basically impossible since there's no feel and so much lag between what you do with your mouse and your characters animations on the screen.\n\nI immediately regretted my decision to buy this.  Should have just dug up my copy of Tiger Woods Golf 2008 or whatever year it was before EA messed it up.  Strong do not buy unless you like supporting console ports that are worse than your average Ubisoft port.

While the current PC controls are still more difficult to master, they seem to have reached a nice balance that is a reasonable compromise.  I'm glad to see that the devs were able to get things fixed up.\n\n\nPrevious Review:\nIf I were to have written this review a month ago I would have said nothing but positive things, but after the last update, I can't recommend The Golf Club at all.  Controls (I'm on a PC with a mouse) are distasterous to me.  Others seem to share my frustration while some have adapted to the changes.  They increased the wind factor and it seems every game has outrageous wind.  It's not adjustable at the user level (that I know of).\n\nIt's a strange thing when an early access game gets worse with time.  Maybe it'll straighten out - if so, I'll try to come back and update this, but for now:  Thumbs Down.","September 5, 2014","true","80.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eaglefan/recommended/269730/","eaglefan","eaglefan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eaglefan/","455 products in account","Has potential and will keep trying it now and again but it is unplayable as a PC golf game.  It has the absolutely worst mouse swing mechanics ever.  It is not responsive and spongy.  There is such a delay that you don;t know if it started to register your swing or not.  Putting is a joke as there is no feel for the putt and that mouse swing mechanic means that you will have no idea if your swing is registered until it's too late.\n\nIt looks nice, though it seems to require a NASA computer if you want any bumped up graphics at all.\n\nI'll keep playing it though, but it seems I get halfway through a round and give up because of the lousy swing mechanics (guess I am just wishing this would bring back that Links feel).\n\n(edit 4/18/15) - They have improved the puting as it now responds much better than the move the mouse and hope for the best approach initially.  Though I am having major issues with power for the other shots, seems like no matter how lighly I have moved the mouse forward when I don't want full power the shot still ends up being 90% or higher.  I can now tell the difference in force used for putting but it seems other shots don't have the same level of sensitivity.  I really suck at the game, which is okay, but I still don't feel comfortable recommending it yet.\n\nThe other issue that is more than a minor issue is that several times I have pulled back to start the shot, the player starts his backswing, I then complete my shot pushing forward and the player never shoots, he just re-addresses the ball.  Have had that happen multiple times and it is rather annoying as by about the 4th time you try swinging you really are just frustrated that the other swings didn't take and are bound to have a bad shot.\n\n(edit 8/16/15) - I have given up trying to use the mouse swing.  I have started to play using the controller and for a controller based game it is pretty decent.  I wish the mouse swing could be improved, that still has no feel at all, like guessing on every shot.  Still not sure if I can recommend it as a PC golf game, it's more like a console port.\n\n(edit:  8/18/15) - Starting to like the game now that I have given myself up to using a controller.  It is really growing on me.  This may become a recommend soon.  Wish there was a neutral option.\n\n(edit: 10/25/15) - I have changed this to a thumbs up.  While I seriously wish the mouse swing worked better, using the x-box 360 controller works quite well.  I still suck at the game itself but have found it enjoyable.  Using the controller I feel a better level of control of my swing and the graphics are good (though I have my settings turned down as it requires more power than I have to crank them up.  I recommend this only if you don't mind using a controller.  If you want to use a mouse swing, I would avoid the frustration.","September 10, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This addition has brought some more value to the game than it had before, and as a result, I am reversing my original "No" recommendation to a "Yes."\n\nThis game certainly has its quirks, but I am beginning to like it more and more. It still has not lived up to the hype, but I have changed my feeling on recommending this game to others. If you are willing to drop the money for the complete collectors edition, you will likely not be disappointed with this game. Make sure you have a machine that can handle the graphics decently, though, as these courses come out beautifully and you want to experience them as such.\n\n~~~~\n\nOriginal Review (November 2014):\nThis game is not bad, but definitely didn't live up to the hype. The lack of a career mode with depth features is a let-down, and the limited amount of character customization is one even more so. Also, it would have been cool to have some sort of earnings system or something of the like that integrates with a career mode to give it long-term replay value. Also, the lack of online multiplayer features is a bit frustrating.\n\nMechanics - keyboard and mouse gameplay is really, really not enjoyable once you have tried it with a controller. You will notice a ridiculous difference in your accuracy when using a controller joystick over a mouse for swinging.\n\nAll that being said, the course designer is cumbersome, and almost feels like the main attraction of the game. If you want to design a virtual golf course and have the time and imagination to devote to it, this game is for you. The course designer has a lot of options and - I would imagine - is unmatched in its genre in the scope of this feature. Also, the gameplay is not bad at all, but can be quirky. The commentary is really just downright annoying and repetitive after a while.\n\nOverall, if you are not big into golf games, avoid it. It's really unbalanced and does not have enough of the career and online features to attract a wide scope of gamers. If you are interested in designing elaborate and realistic looking golf courses and playing them for fun, it could be worth the 35 bucks, but I would honestly wait until there's a drop in price or a sale to consider it even if that is your MO.","November 25, 2014","true","60.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
