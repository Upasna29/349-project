There's not even any rhyme or reason as to WHY it could be crashing sometimes; it's just doing it because it has a burning passion for crashing and it's not going to let you or its parents or the town mayor tell it otherwise. It crashes at the start menu. It crashes at the loading screens. It crashes if you try and record it. It crashes when you enter a room. Let me tell you, if Case #8 could crash while it was crashing, it'd be all over that. There are people kept in padded cells and fed on a pole that are more stable than this game.\n\nWhich is kind of a shame because, honestly, Case #8 isn't a horrible game. 'Good' might be stretching it but it's at least average, bundles together a handful of decent scares and is fairly priced. From what I managed to play, there's nothing in the way of combat with the game wheeling out some basic puzzles and item collecting instead as you progress around the prison, gathering the odd piece of scattered lore here and there. It's pasted together in FPS Creator which might well be the source of its problems as this definitely isn't the first time a game from there has been spat out riddled with mystifying bugs.\n\nObviously, I can't recommend something this ridiculously broken at the moment, regardless of the game's quality. It's possible to shoulder your way through a lot of the crashes by reloading or relaunching but I reached a point after the third stage where it refused to pass the loading screen five times in a row and, with the gaming backlog I'm sure we all share, I had to ask myself whether it was worth the strife to persist with it. I settled on a 'no'.\n\nWhatever joy I managed to squeeze out of this crashaholic is below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l1PWCaeW3M","March 10","false","1.2"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","77","43","56","23","4"

My computer sucks, but its old school consistent and never has programs crash. This game with amazing accuracy will crash every 15-30 minutes for no apparent reason.\n\nYou are prisoner #8, and have allegedly killed (7) other people including your family. Something at the underground prison has gone ghastly wrong and an opportunity to escape has presented itself. You attempt to flea but soon realize things aren't going to be as easy as anticipated. You are not alone…\n\nOverall, the game is pretty average once you get past the crashes. Everything is just a little too bare bones for me to completely enjoy this one. There are no settings, no characters, little story elements and too few interactive elements.

I'd say it's a technically poor one, but despite the frequent crashes and bugs, it does get an acceptable framerate, so overall it's average for its genre in that area.\n\nWalk around a bunch of poorly lit rooms, pick up items and activate arbitrary event flags so that you can open doors and walk around more poorly lit rooms.  If that sounds boring as hell, don't worry.  The game also attempts a few jump scares, which lack any followup and thus end up being about as scary as a typical YouTube Poop.\n\nThe story is a different kind of bad in each chapter.  Chapter 1 sets up the bland "escape the place" plot common among amateur games.  In chapter 2 you have to glitch yourself through a door to get some dynamyte, which you then stand too close to as it goes off in order to set up the next chapter.  Chapter 3 is a clone of P.T.  I haven't played or even watched P.T., but I can still tell it's a clone because the level's Steam Trading Card is labeled "P.T."  I guess when you admit your game is a rip-off it instantly becomes an homage.  Finally, chapter 4 reveals that the player character committed the crime that the game said he committed at the beginning, and then ends with a "To be continued."  So in summary, the game goes from cliché storm to idiot plot to borderline plagiarism and concludes on an anticlimax.  What a great way to spend an hour and a half.\n\nIt's okay for the game to suck, though, because it's only four dollars, and everyone knows that MSRP is the only metric on which we should base our expectations.  Nevermind that good games like Ballpoint Universe: Infinite are in the same price point; if it's under five bucks, all standards go out the window!\n\nSeriously, though, ♥♥♥♥ this game with a red herring laser mechanism.\n\nUPDATE: Just noticed that the vast majority of positive reviews are blatant sockpuppets (no details, just "Good game", "Cool game", "Nice horror", etc).  Peace, this isn't the App Store.  You're trying to sell to people who actually enjoy video games; people who are more savvy than you're apparently used to.  This kind of behavior reflects very badly on you, so cut it out.","March 31","false","6.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

After giving the program admin privileges it finally started, showing me immediately the main menu. There's no logo, no title screen, nothing. Weird. And in the menu I've discovered the game doesn't allow you to change anything - not even screen resolution or mouse sensitivity.  That is absolutely unacceptable.\nThe game itself looks surprisingly nice for a low-budget title and the puzzles in the first level were quite entertaining. However, the game keeps crashing, for example when accessing the video terminal. This is pretty bad because it doesn't save your position in the middle of the level so the crash means you have to start over from the beginning.\nAnd then I reached the elevator, the game saved... and crashed again. And since then the loaded position crashed every single time, preventing me from ever seeing level 2.\nIt's a shame because the game looked promising. Right now I'm asking for a refund but if the game gets fixed, let me know and I may update the review.","March 19","false","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game involves some puzzles to complete in order to progress, I feel like this game has a lot of potential but for the time being it still has it's crashes here and there whlist your playing through the game.\n\nGameplayWhen you think of a typical horror game you might think of complicated puzzles that make the game string along a bit more and make your playtime on that game a bit more than you would of liked. Although, Case #8 has very simple and easy puzzles that you can get through fairly quickly. The hardest part about the game would be finding the correct equipment in the game in order to finish a puzzle. Even then though, thanks to the graphics it kind of stands out what you can interact with and where the tools could possibly be. This really helps the game as it does not try to make you have a longer playtime on the game from the difficult puzzles that are in most horror games. But would you would expect in a horror game would be, well, scares throughout the game to keep you on edge. But, unfortunatly there really aren't any scares at all which lets the game down slightly. There are no jumpscares, which are the most cheap and common, nothing that will really make you terrified or keep you on edge. There is no tutorial for the game to tell you what each of the controls are, maybe even a screen at the beginning of the game with the controls would've been nice. It's not exactly hard to figure out how to move and interact with objects and stuff.\n\nFor the graphics that are in this game, there's nothing that really seems to be good or to be a very high quality. Some of the walls look a bit bad, and since the game basically uses the same walls over and over you will have ti put up with it throught the game. The lighting of the game seems to be well done, as most of the lights are very dim which is what you would expect from a horror game. This really creates a nice atmospheric feel that there isn't any power through this prison and that there is obviously something out there to get you like in most horror games.\n\nOn the other hand, the sound effects of this game are very good. Each of the sound effects are very well designed, such as the doors opening when you unlock them and your footsteps when you are obviously walking. All the sounds that are produced are of a very high quality, and definatly makes you feel as if you are in the game and such.\n\nPros+ Very atmospheric\n+ Nice sounds effects\n+ The lighting is very nice\n+ Good price\n+ Trading Cards\n\nCons- The graphics are a bit off for the quality\n- There are no scares\n\nResult / Final thoughtsCase #8 isn't much of a scary game, which is a little disappointing for such a horror game that really sets up a tense atmosphere. The lighting is very nice, really seems like there is hardly any power to the areas, and the sound effects of the game are reallly good quality that also sets the atmosphere. For the price that the game is asking for, it's a nice horror game, just not many scares throughout the game to keep you on the edge.\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","March 24","true","2.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Still, I am actually impressed with what this developer did with FPS Creator to make this horror game.  While a lot of the game is cheesy, and the scares are nothing but flagrant jump scares, it's still kind of an interesting game to play.  ..It made me want to beat it, but I got stuck near what I believe is the end of the game.  You can watch the above video to see where I got stuck.\n\nKeep in mind before you buy it, that it is far from perfect, very far from a AAA game or even a $15 indie horror game.  This is a $4, beat it in a hour or two (with zero replayability) game.  And right now, it's likely to crash when it loads in new sections of the game story and you'll have to restart the game and load it from where it just saved before the crash.\n\nStill, for some reason.. I like this game for some reason.  Maybe it feels like the developer wasn't just looking for an easy buck and they put some heart into this little horror adventure game, I dunno.  It's not a masterpiece, and it's nothing to write home about.. but it's interesting and compelling enough, at least to me, to be worth it's asking price.","March 9","true","4.2"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","6","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/decreeb/recommended/448350/","decreeb","Fallout Boy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/decreeb/","192 products in account","Honestly the game is kind of interesting, but not really worth the price.\n\nThe graphics were nice, and the atmosphere was great, but the world still felt blocky, so adding more static objects or something to make it feel real and not square would be awesome. The walking felt really slow, but considering the first part of the game is set in a small area, it makes some sense if they want the game to play a tad longer, but even the running was barely faster than that and felt way too slow for a game. The puzzles I played were pretty bland, lack-luckster, and had been done countless times since the 90's, nothing really special there, although I didn't get the full experience as the game keeps crashing when loading the 2nd area. Sound effects were great, but the lack of music made it awkward. No, not tense, or suspensful. Awkward, and kind of distracting from the whole atmostphere.\n\nThe writing seems bland, un-motivated, and very simplistic. It's kind of obvious they were going off of nothing here, which isn't inherently bad, but it really didn't have anything special going for it. Bland "puzzles", bland writing, no music, and decent at best graphics didn't really give this game much to stand on.\n\nHonestly, not a bad game at all, the devs are off to a good start, but it doesn't seem polished yet. I can't say it doesn't feel complete, as I didn't get a chance to finish the game, but the part I HAVE played, the beginning, wasn't very polished, and the beginning is where you want the majority of your polish, since it's the first thing the player gets to experience for your game, and will form A LOT of assumtions and expectations for the rest of your game, so it's important to set that tone and atmosphere correctly, but who knows? Maybe it has better puzzles once you beat the beginning in 10 minutes!\n\nOverall has the potential to be a cool game, but right no it's not worth the money unless it's you have some extra steam-cash laying around. I think the developers have potential, FOR SURE! They just need to work on polishing their skills a little more and maybe communicating with others in their field to gather opinions and playtesters to REALLY polish the game and make it a solid $20 experience rather than a half-baked $4 one. Maybe do some more research as to the deep, intricate analysis of video games. Games aren't as simple as just making them, there is A LOT of thought that must go into all aspects of games, and that's something I personally find enjoyable to educate myself about, and is a necessity for any budding game-developer. Good luck to the devs and their future endeavours, and if you decide to buy the game, I hope you can actually load all parts of it!\n\nEDIT: As a side note, there are no options in the game either. No brightness, no volume, no resolution, nothing. Just "New Game", "Load Game", and "Exit". Don't expect anything else.","May 23","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also here exist a story with some puzzles for walkthrough.\nSome pluses:\n1. Atmosphere helps you to feel yourself alone and abandoned\n2. Low price and trading cards\n3. Not bad graphics and soundtrack\n\nAnd minuses:\n1. A lot of f***ng screamers\n2. No way to change any options\n3. Possible crushes, I have only one for the whole game","June 5","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
