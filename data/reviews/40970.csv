I suppose this justifies an actual review.\n\nWelcome to Stronghold Crusader, a game I picked up at a whim when I was 12 (actually have about 1,000 hours clocked in the disc version of the game; I was sheltered from Steam for a long time). I had, at the time, no idea what the game was about, I just knew that I was a huge medieval era fan and decided the game looked pretty cool.\nTrust me though, no matter of sweet, sweet disc cover could have prepared me for the fungasm that was Stronghold Crusader. Lets move on to an actual review now.\n\nStronghold Crusader is an RTS (real-time strategy) game based on the First, Second, and Third Crusade, not to mention the conflicts within Crusader states. As with all RTS', this means that you will have control of armies, workers, not to mention fortification and building construction in an attempt to outwit your opponent and kill their king.\n\nHowever, Stronghold does this better than even most current-generation RTS', in my opinion, including games like Starcraft 2.\n\nIt's hard for me to come up with a "pros and cons" list, because for me, this game doesn't have any cons; difficulty is to be expected as you progress in time spent in-game. Let me spend a little time bulleting what is so attractive about this game.\n\n-There is a multitude of units. You've got your various siege equipment (battering rams, catapults, trebuchets, you name it), melee units with their own unique advantages, ranged units similarly, various traps, MOATS (that's right nerdy kid who loves castles, moats), and chances are you will end up using every single one of these characters at some point during the game; which leads to my next point.\n\n-No two games are alike. Before anyone corrects me, I'm aware that there are (always have been) certain strategies to try and end games quickly; slave rushing; mercenary armies in early game, etc. That being said, these strategies are not always reliable and will leave you resourceless. The fact is that you are probably going to need a different strategy for each game you play, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer.\n\n-The game itself is rich in history, which I personally find fascinating. The single player campaign will have you drilling your way through multiple missions; these missions are based off the real accounts of the First, Second, and Third Crusades, as well as the intergroup struggles that grew in that time. You will command armies in historic battles like the Siege of Jerusalem, Heraclea, and Krak des Chevaliers. All this is accompanied by what I find to be a stellar set of voice actors and most likely the best squire a king could ever ask for creates an almost life-like representation of the era.\nYou know what, the squire gets his own bullet.\n\n-The squire; this awesome individual is your in-game guide/cheerleader/father-figure. If you play the game, you WILL learn to love him. The squire is a non-physical character who informs you of how you are doing, whether you are under attack, or if you are out of resources. He will sit and shout in your ear "WOOD NEEDED" or "THE GRANARY STOCKS ARE FULL, M'LORD."\n\n-Resource management. While not really a new feature to RTS', the resource management in this game will force you to think steps ahead of your opponent, or suffer the consequences; every resource is expendable. "Not enough stone to build your walls? Buy some from the trade post for gold, or trade your other resources to get that precious stone. Beware, though, trade too much of one resource and it may dry up and your stocks will quickly be depleted, which means you are screwed when it comes to anything that requires that resource.\n\n-Multiplayer. This is where 90% of my horus playing this game went. I could sit here and rant onward about all of my games where I had almost lost, but like the underdog of the story, I prevailed!\nHowever, I won't; as a matter of fact, I will make this really simple: take every bulletpoint I've created, and imagine what it'd be like to face another person. The campaign missions may not necessarily be the most difficult, but the multiplayer is where I am convinced Army strategists should be trained for real-life duty. How you act in a game, every move you make, every resource you spend/use, will affect the outcome and decide whether you are truly the king of the land, or whether you are a lonely peasant, not fit to lick the boot of your opponent.\n\nTL;DR:\nDespite not being the most "relevant" entry in the RTS genre, Stronghold Crusader still manages to remain an idol to be followed for other RTS games. If you are truly skipping my beautifully composed points above, just know that the game is wonderful. For the price it's listed at now, I would say you are criminally insane to not buy it.\n\n"Do you recommend this game?" Steam asks.\nMy response?\n\n"Of course, m'lord!"","May 18, 2015","true","1.8"," 154 of 168 people (92%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","92","154","168","81","0"

Today I keep it on steam to leave my old disc on the shelf as a momento of my childhood. SC is a classic with the perfect balance of light hearted castle sim charm and rts combat. Ive dumped easily 1000 hours into random skirmish matches against the ai lords over the years and this is one game that I can always turn back to at any time to pass 20 minutes to 2 hours and always have a good time. Learning how to balance your economy to support troop creation has a very mild learning curve but it takes time to master but yet is simple enough for even a 1st grader to learn as I did when I first started playing this game in 2001.\n\nThis game has aged exceptionally well and still has an active multiplayer community because anyone that ever took a bite of this game knows just how good it really is. I strongly reccommend this game to add to your collection as an old fan or a newby looking for a new toy to reignite your passion for gaming all over again. Overall, I would rate this title 11/10 as it really is a unicorn in the PC gaming realm.

Great.\n\nto the m'lord-cave!\n++ best "Stronghold"\n++ it's a classic\n+ one of the best RTS (in my opinion!)\n+ 16 different enemies with special tactics!\n+ many maps (whether balanced or not)\n+ historical missions\n+ 2 campaigns (2nd campaign is much harder!)\n+ skirmish mode! (80 missions)\n+ different modes: the peaceful and war path\n+ loads of playable options\n+ create your own maps!\n+ easy gameplay and easy to learn the mechanics\n+ no food? no fear! - beer is here!\n+ and it won't get boring - only harder :)\n+ you don't need a high-end gamer ultra 4k PC\n\n"buildings are in flames m'lord!"\n- HD? Just the resolution changed\n- ma' crusade ended 1781 AC (depends on how long you play)\n- AI won't build armies over 400 soldiers\n- The Kalif is an as*hole\n- what year is it?\n- campaign is less "personal"\n- got killed by 100 slaves\n- often you can easily rush the enemy in the first minutes\n- double rations\n- some people can't run the game! (you are warned)\n\nA little extra information: in "Stronghold Crusader Extreme" you are able to build armies up to 10000 soldiers... and the enemy too ;-)\njust an information if you would complain about the limited army size, like I mentioned before :-)\n\nThose negative aspects are just poop, so don't mention them.\nI can tell that you WILL have lot of fun. I'm through the first 50 missions and already at 35 hours! You don't need a sale to buy this, just 8€ and you recieve hours of fun. Don't mind the graphics, it's from 2002!\nBut remember - This is a recommendation for Stronghold Crusader and not for the whole series (sadly the game became more and more worse).\n\n"Do you recommend this game?"\n\n- "Of course, m'lord!" 9/10\n\n\n\n\nlittle update: I am through the 100 missions of the crusade and have about ~60 hours playtime (because of connection problems, my counted hours are false)... and I didn't even started the real campaign :-D\nI think if you play every mission, campaign and possible option you can reach 100 hours!\n\nSome people have the problem that the game doesn't start at all - maybe this thread can help you: http://steamcommunity.com/app/40970/discussions/0/361787186433062259/","January 31","true","47.1"," 61 of 61 people (100%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","100","61","61","8","0"

Some AI are REALLY slow whilst others are REALLY fast. This is both good and bad but it will keep you entertained for a good time. What makes this game so entertaining is that you must always keep your economy, troop producment, and other vital producments above your opponent.

Stronghold Crusader HD delivers this on every level. This game and I go way back, to 2006, My brother chose this game as a game that he wanted to buy from Target. At first I hated this game, mostly because I didn't try it. After I did try it one rainy day I fell in love with it. It does take a little bit to learn everything, but once you do it is one of the most addicting and fact paced Stragety games of all time!\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Simple but nice graphics: Sure they aren't amazing, but it has a disctinct art style that does help make you feel more a part of that world.\n\n+ Amazing strategic gameplay, It lures you in by seeming to be simple with a decent\n\n+The voice acting AWFUL, but it is the kind of awful that you and your friends can have a good hearty laugh at, and of course the quotes with the "voice actors" deliver really helps make this game feel all its own and have it's entirely own feeling to it.\n\n+ Fun Characters: the characters have their own personalities, and while some are addmitedly one note (the pig is fat GET IT!?) It adds more that subtracts from the experiance.\n\n+Great Map Selection (Some very basic ones and some really interesting ones, over 20! (Over 100 if you look at just the skirmish ones [Although I do belive they are exclusive to skirmish which I would like to see changed and probally there is a way to do it manually] And of coruse, you can make your own.)\n\n+ A ton of Gameplay types. There is, Custom Map Maker, 4 (or 4+) Campaigns, 3 (Including the Extreme Expansion) Trials (Which are linked matches between you and a bot, there are 50 on the original one. 30 on the Warchest one and 20 on the Extreme Trails) But, there is a major problem with the extreme trials (as of 12/30/13) it starts you at the final one for some reason) and of coruse Skirmish Mode (You can play what map you want with either friends, or solo and choose teams and such. oh and one more thing, Castle Sim Mode is just like Skirmish Mode, but without the batltes. ))\n\n+Fantastic Music! It is not only atmospheric but can also be catchy as hell and sounds natural helping the imersion of the game by a boatload! The game even changes music depending on the situation you are in, are you getting bombarded by a bunch of spear men? Then the game will switch to an intense battle song and fade out as soon as you (hopefull) defeat the spearmen.\n\n+The netcode is HIGHLY improoved in my experiances to the original, back in the original every game would be pleagued by the infamous "Connection lost, sending current game state" message, however  if I do ever encounter it in this version it dissapears in a split second!\n\n+This version is compatable with the original! So, if your friends computer can't handle the brand new resolution just install the CD version and you can play with the HD version (with GameRanger of course!) and this helps blend the line between the Steam players and the CD Players. The same can not be said about AOE2 HD or RON:EXE.\n\n+The game runs great on all types of hardware, from my ancient (Basically) 2010 Notebook to my modern computer (which I am writing this review with) and even my Aspire R14, the game runs without a hitch and surprisingly has minimal compatibility glitches [Not including the ones that were there]\n\nCONS:\n\n+Troops sometimes ignore orders, or take a while to do them. Sometimes you will tell it to do something and they will just wonder off which gets annoying especially in the heat of battle.\n\n+It's sometimes hard to see close into your castle with the brand new resolution, it would be nice if you could zoom into the map even further.\n\n+Some AI share the same animations (most notably, The Rat and the Wolf if you have them on your team.\n\n+Some Animation's are choppy (The blacksmith preview goes at about 20 frames)\n\n+When you zoom out all the way the FPS halves.\n\n+The AI is awful. They rarley (if ever) change up their attacks and do the same thing over and over again. Some AI is over protective making invading their castle a hastle [hahaha! GET IT!] to a point where I just save the game, quit, and never return to that saved game.\n\n+Balancing Issues: Little problems that they are you may have to (atleast in multiplayer) turn on the No Rush timer as to not allow people to bombard your castle with Assassins which are not only fast, invisible (unless nearing your men), and strong, but they also have a surprisingly large health bar which makes killing them annoying as they mow down even your strongest men and take out your king (how you loose) without a problem as early as the first few minutes. [They fixed this in the 2nd Game however that is a whole different can of worms.]\n\n+No proper Steamworks Multiplayer support, you must download a game client like GameRanger (which isn't bad, just inconvenient]\n\n+Awful expansion. Stronghold Crusader HD Extreme is the included expansion and adds some fantastic stuff [Maps, campaigns, 8 new AI Characters] but sadly starts to support castle hiding where you hide everyone inside your castle and let you generate stuff (yes this expansion adds a Mana styled magic bar that lets you create stuff and destroy your enemies castle with flying rocks that you spawn) which sounds badass. However, it throws all balancing and fairness out the window. Anyone can click on the rocks and click on the enemy castle to demolish it and make it ripe for the conquest, however what Stronghold Crusader HD (The base game) strives on is the ability to conquest the castle using your men that you build up which makes it imsenly more satisfying and more fair to put it bluntly.\n\n+Glitches. The main one that I am talking about is when you launch SC:HD Extreme for the first time and you go to the skirmish mission you get the due honor of skipping directly to the last level for no apparent reason, effectivly making the previous 20 or so missions useless.\n\nOverall:\nEven in the ripe year of 2016 Stronghold Crusader HD has surprisingly aged well. The problems (Some miniscule others annoying) really don't distract from the overall experiance as much as one may think. The PROS FAR outweigh the CONS in this situation and makes Stronghold Crusader HD (even with the Flawed Extreme expansion) a great time that is easily worth the 9.99 asking price. And even if you don't feel confortable about paying that much it goes on sale for down to 5 dollars sometimes so keep an eye out because I assure you, its a game that you will need to see to believe. [In a good way]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review you should check out my fellow reviewers at  Completing the Backlog","December 30, 2013","true","11.9"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/40970/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Stronghold Crusader skip to Results and read from there.\n\nFirefly Studies strikes again with the best Stronghold game in the series. Stronghold Crusader is a brilliant game that mixes Castle Simulation with RTS combat, and resource management.\n\nStory:\nAs the title depicts Stronghold Crusader takes place in the Crusades. You play through the Asia minor, The Middle East, as Europeans and Arabians alike. The story takes place across four campaigns where you start your journey as Emporer Alexus of the Turkish Army commands you to take ahold of Asia Minor. You spread European influence across the land, but it is short lived as the Salidan rises to power and destroys the settlements of the Europeans and claims back the lands. Unfortunately for him the crusades were not over, and the Germanic armies arrive deploying castles across Asia minor as they claim lay to the holy lands. Stronghold Crusader takes place across the first to third crusades and then creates an alternate reality that is the post-crusade wars that pit you against your worst nightmare: The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf.\n\n\nCampaign:\nStronghold Crusader has four campaigns which teach you how to play the game from the basics to the most advanced.\n\nThe Call to Arms\nCall to Arms offers five basic missions which although simple are in fact challenging in their own rights. The first mission encompasses basic castle siege, the second basic defense, the third resource management, the fourth resource massing, and the final one a more complicated castle siege. This campaign is a great way to start into the Stronghold Series as it introduces the elements of gameplay in an interesting way that keeps you entertained. Typical tutorials are rather uninteresting, but Call to Arms changes that by providing dynamic missions that introduce the game with diverse scenarios.\n\nSaladin’s Conquest\nAfter the conquest of Call to Arms you pick up the campaign as Salidan who is retaking the land stolen by the Europeans. All the missions in Salidan’s Conquest are sieges; these involve taking castles from the enemy. All of Salidans missions are rather simple, yet offer diversity in how you conquer your foe. You are limited on units and must use unique units to push through the enemy defenses.\n\nThe Kings Crusade\nAfter the Salidan has kicked out most of Europe the quest continues as the third crusade picks up and its up to the Europeans to hold off their fortresses from the Salidans onslaughts. The Kings Crusade mostly focuses on castle building and defense, similar to Mission 4 of The Call to Arms. Each level provides new features which give you a better mechanism to defend you castle and equip you against an ever stronger foe until you eventually must siege castle and rebuild it from the ground up.\n\nCrusader States\nThe campaign begins after the third crusade and is a fictitious rendition of what we expected after the Third Crusade ended. You play in the Middle East as lord’s squalor over various lands and it is up to you to defeat your foes. Your mission through the Middle East pits you against the foes of the past: The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf. The further you get into the campaign the more enemies you get pit against.\n\n\nGameplay:\nStronghold Crusader is noted as being the best Stronghold game; it took what was good from the original and expanded upon it beautifully. Stronghold Crusader is a castle simulation game, where you manage a castle politically, economically, and sociologically. You must maintain various food types, keep your people happy, while simultaneously ripping them dry for every penny they have. You need to build a well-oiled machine, but unlike most strategy games Stronghold has many resources. To build units you must obtain gold, you must build their weapons, you must provide peasant, you must feed them with various food stocks, and you must obtain the resources required to build those weapons. For all of this to occur you must keep peasants within your castle by making sure they are happy, once they start to leave your castle will crumble from within before your enemies even hit your walls.\n\nStronghold Crusader takes that and incorporates mercenaries, units which cost gold and require less work to obtain. Of course they cost almost triple that of a non-hired unit, but offer quick turn-around. Not only did they add mercenaries, but they included Skirmishes with AI, which allow you to play the game without playing the campaign. The AI is rather intelligent and will keep you on your toes, and not only that but the maps are designed to require intense combat. This game will make you fight over limited agrarian land and low wood stocks.\n\nHints:\n>When you start a map drop the gamespeed to 20, this gives you loads of time to set yourself up before the match really begins.\n>When playing the crusader states the game gives you sometimes up to 7.5k gold, if you drop the game-speed to 20 and place a market you can buy Maces and Leather Armor. Then quickly build an army of Macemen to take out your foes before the match can even begin. This does not work on all missions, but certainly helps.\n>Bread is the easiest food to build-up. If you are trying to optimize limited farmland use wheat as its easy to mass.\n\nResults:\nStronghold Crusader is the best castle simulation game out there right now. It offers the joy of castle simulation with the intensities of combat. I would recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about taking part in the Stronghold Series, it’s a great place to start as it will pull you right in. Stronghold Crusader is a fantastic game for castle simulation fans and real time strategy fans alike. I would recommend this buying this game even at full price, but if you can get it at a discount its worth every penny and you won’t regret it.\n\nPros:\n+Four amazing campaigns which teach you how to play the game without being boring or repetitive.\n+The AI has various levels of intelligence which makes them fun as well as challenging.\n+They added mercenaries which allow you to build emergency armies quick, but cost extraordinary sums of gold.\n+Finally Skirmishes have been introduced; you don’t have to play the campaign or multiplayer. You can just mess around by yourself.\n+New strategic limitations, such as limited grass for agriculture which makes you consider your strategies.\n\nCons:\n-I couldn’t minimize the game; it would minimize but not maximize (Windows 8.1)\n-When playing you could not open steam overlay, one of the commands for steam overlay is a command for the games GUI display.","August 10, 2014","true","18.3"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","34","36","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RebelDwarfNuts/recommended/40970/","RebelDwarfNuts","nix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RebelDwarfNuts/","63 products in account","Stronghold: Crusader is an RTS (real time strategy) game based in the Middle East during the Crusades, namely mainly in the third. Some parts of the game, however, take place before that. It's a kind of extension of the game Stronghold, which Crusader in many aspects resembles, but Stronghold is set in medieval England.\n\nStronghold: Crusader is Stronghold enriched with new mechanics, the most famous of these is the Skirmish mode, the heart of the game. It is a mode in which each player or computer opponent has one base on a map and they must develop, market, prosper and build castles and defense. Since all players are on one map, they can interact with each other, whether it's positively or negatively. Allies can trade with each other, defend each other and attack together. The game goal is most of the time to kill all the enemy Lords and not die in the process. The game balances the economy and the war very well. The player must develop their economy through taxes, food rations, trade and so on. They must seek to balance their popularity to not become unpopular, because in that case people will begin to leave the castle and it will severely impede the player's progress. If the player has a good economy, they can take up making a great army, which is usually quite costly. This is the way the game balances the economy and the war, and I like it. You should think about your tactics and castle management a bit and not just rush into war straight away - otherwise you go to your knees, whether you like it or not.\n\nThe main objectives of the game itself are the 2 Skirmish trails. They consist of a number of consecutive Skirmishes. In each mission the player has certain enemies, sometimes allies, a set map and everyone's position on it, and a set amount of money and resources. There are 16 PC enemies altogether and about 80 maps (citation needed), so with such diversity there is also an option to play your own game, where the player chooses the map, their allies and adversaries as well as everyone's money and resources. Computer opponents are also quite diverse: 6 Arab and 10 Crusader leaders, each of whom has different castles, different tactics, different personalities, and there's a lot to the game to keep you interested long enough.\n\nIn addition to Skirmish trails, one can play historical campaigns. They're based on specific historical periods and events during the Crusades. They are there to teach the player the game. The first campaign teaches the fundamentals of the economy, defense and siege. The second campaign teaches the player how to use unique Arab units. In the third campaign the player learns to defend against them, and the fourth campaign is already full-on Skirmish mode. In the first three campaigns the player doesn't have the Skirmish mode freedom because they either defend against attacks at certain intervals, while trying to achieve a set goal (Defend Antioch! Gather 300 loaves of bread!, and the like), while they often don't have access to all buildings - or they get a certain number of soldiers with which to conquer a city. This is exactly why a lot of people find these campaigns boring, tedious and difficult. In a sense they are right. These campaigns are fine, but cumbersome unlike the rest of the game. The game also includes a mode of free castle building without enemies, map editor and LAN multiplayer for 8 players.\n\nCrusader Extreme added a bar of (super)powers, which fills up slowly and over time unlocks the abilities for your use - such as a rain of arrows or rocks on a specific place on the map. It also added military outposts - buildings that relatively slowly generate troops for free. This allows all PC adversaries to be stronger than normal - for example the Rat, the weakest adversary, suddenly gets a huge army of swordsmen, pikemen, horse archers and seven catapults - and they're coming for you!\n\nOverall, I think that Stronghold: Crusader is an excellent game. Fun and fast paced with minor weak points and bugs, which can be overlooked. 9/10\n\nPS: The Steam version doesn't cooperate with Steam firefly fix pls","October 27, 2013","true","391.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainbatche/recommended/40970/","captainbatche","Batche","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainbatche/","85 products in account","Stronghold Crusader came out mid 2002 after the succesful Stronghold in 2001. Stronghold Crusader is set in the Middle East during the crusades rather then Europe like the first one, hence the name Crusader. This is a real time stratergy game with the focus of killing the enemy Lord/s. Careful though as he will be very strong and can take over 10000 archer arrows! don't worry it is done on purpose so you can kill him at a range, so best to send 10 plus swords men at him.\n\nIf you played the Original like I did many moons ago there are changes in this HD edition and NONE! are bad. There are 8 more characters to verus, more resolution sizes and graphics has imporved. Everything else is the same as the original which is amazing!\n\nSo the Pro's:\n- Personally the best out of all Strongholds\n- Unique RTS that requires not only military stratergies but also civil (do you make them drunk and fed or starve and whip them?)\n- Arabian units are an awesome edition giving alot more unit choice\n- Fire implementation in the game is great, see random guys on fire turn a city into a flame ball (happens more often then you think), yes this is a pro!!\n- Large campaign and a few side stories 'missions'\n- Great to plan with mates (LAN or over the net)\n- Replayability in custom maps or make your own which is easily shared to other pc's when trying to match make\n- alot of challanging Lords to play\n- Fun castle building and designing to fit all military and civil works in and around\n\nCon's\n- 400 unit pop count, may sound like alot but it isn't when you are trying to kill 7 Lord's at once\n- The Large map for 8 Players can seem very small in most instances\n- If AI Lords placed close together or near iron it is create holes or even block themsleves in starving their kingdom.\n- No unit or building healing (can repair towers and that's it)\n- Would be good to make AI even harder, they have Lords to difficulty but it would be good if you can adjust it more\n- Most of the time units will not attack the enemy until they are either told or the enemy are already bashing their face in\n- Enemy AI with their army can be very disorganized making them easy prey\n\nOverall I love this edition of Stronghold Crusader HD, I will continue to use it and LAN with friends. If you want a LAN game to kill some time this is great for you! (better to vs your friends for more of a challange).\n\nany questions don't be afriad to ask.","April 4, 2015","true","6.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","2"

Look no Further.\nThis game is the pinnacle of quality for the Stronghold series.\nThe first game lacks the depth that Crusader has, but is still very good.\nProblem is that every game after this one, in the Stronghold series, just doesn't measure up.\n\nThis game has a perfect blend of complexity and simplicity.\nThe game isn't so complicated that its hard to pick up or understand, but not so simple that there is a lack of depth.\nLikewise the play of the game is balanced between economics/resources management and Military strategy.\nIn some other RTS games it is absolutely true that whoever can rush their economy the fastest is the victor, and I would say that is not the case for this game. Speed is of course an important factor, but unless one player is particularly slow in comparision to the other, speed will not be the deciding factor. The ability you have for using your economy to maximize your military potential through any number of means, as well as your ability to strategically use your troops/resources to take advantage of your opponent's weaknesses are the most important factors.\n\nHowever, understanding your map placement while using this in your overall strategy, and your ability to build/defend your castle are extremely important. A player near less resources with a weaker economy can play more defensively, defeat an opponent's army who lays siege, and then counter attack before the opponent can recover from the losses to pull a victory. Or in the same scenario, the player in a weak spot can harass with the goal to destroy their opponent's economy, thus crippling them, then pressing the advantage. The ways a game can be played and won are vast.\n\nMultiplayer is where this depth of gameplay becomes most visible, but due to the direct IP connect multiplayer set up it is easiest to just use a service with lobbies to set up games with randoms. I recommend Game Ranger. The community isn't huge, but is still large enough that it isn't hard to find someone online to play with.\n\nFrom my perspective, this is the greatest RTS of all time.\nKeeping my personal bias aside, this game is very good, especially for it's time.\nI believe it is an under appreciated title worth picking up for it's price.\n\nTL;DR :\nGraphics are okay, not confusing or hard to look at, but not stunning due to their age.\n\nGameplay is not without it's flaws, but it is in depth and the application of strategy,\nawareness, and quick thinking are key. Making use of European and/or Arabic units is also an important element.\n\nMultiplayer is fun and much more in depth than playing with bots, but its better to\nuse an external program for matchmaking\n\nModes; there are a few to choose from, Multiplayer, custom game mode, there is custom map making which can be shared with other players in multiplayer, Single player has two crusader trails which set you up against bots in specific set ups, and a historical single player mode where you defend real crusader castles like Kerak de Chevaliers.\n\nSounds/Soundtrack nothing I would write home about, but its not hard to listen to either.\n\nShould you read this review, and then decide to buy this game and then\nwant to get in on multiplayer, feel free to add me.\n\n","October 22, 2015","true","24.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Easily worth the sale price.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nYes!! This was the strategy game of my childhood and still is. The game plays well and has a good economy and combat which means you will always be fighting or be close to action most of the game. (Obvious some exceptions 1v1 on largest map `-`) The game plays the same as the other Stronghold games but has a different food system where you can only have farms on grass. Take note the game is set in the desert. Skirmish mode is where the game shines since the AI is decent in giving you a challenge especially when you are against the odds. Obvious flaws in the AI play style exist but doesn't affect the game at all. I've had hours before buying the steam version and will probally sink some more in when I can. There is a good map variety and a decent amount of AI characters each with 2-3 different set castles they build and each have their own playstyle and unit variety. There isn't a difficulty slider for the AI apart from gold they start.\n\nIs there a campaign?\nNo. There is not a set campaign like other strongholds. The missions are just skirmish battles but pre set. There are roughly 30 of these in base game and 30 in expansion which is included in this. (I havn't played or counted all of these so don't hold me to numbers) These get more challenging and make some interesting battles if you get half way through.\n\nIs this worth it over the non HD version?\nTechnically no. All this adds is resolution support which makes it run somewhat more smoothly but doesn't actually change much more.\n\nSomewhat random review and will be missing alot of points but just wanted to post.","May 13, 2015","true","29.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This game is...amazing. Truly amazing. There are few words that are able to describe how crazy good this game is. No it does not have the depth of StarCraft, but its not designed to be a competitive game. Its a casual fun strategy, that you can play with you mouse. But dont let that turn you away from the game. There is plenty of challange for hardcore RTS fans like me. You can make the matchups very imbalanced, and there is not just one type of AI, there are 14 diferend adversaries, and no they are not just dificulties, they build their castels diferently, and use diferent types of army. There are historical campaings, but they are very underwhelming IMO.\nIf i have to rate this game it would be a 9/10. If i have to trust the biast nostalgia 17/10 :).

In this game you build a castle/stronghold and attack other castle/strongholds. Right now this game holds its place in my favorites catagory in steam along with Space Engineers, Just Cause 2, Elder scrolls Skyrim and Supreme Commander.\n\nThis game is in my opinion 10/10 for filling the hole of nostalga that Age of Empires could not fill.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuronMantlet/recommended/40970/","HuronMantlet","BrownGalil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuronMantlet/","67 products in account","Although, I haven't played this through Steam yet, this game is the greatest Medieval RTS game that there is. Besides the out dated graphics - if you're a veteran RTS player, you have probably played worse - this game is fantastic.\n\nThis game was the first video game I really got into on the PC. I played countless hours, and if I had to make a guess, I'd say well over 2000+. Since September 2004, this game has stayed within my top 5 because it is simply just that good.\n\nI always find myself coming back to this game, year after year, never being dissapointed in the challenge that the computer opponents offer. When I played this game day in day out and finally mastered it, I could beat all 7 wolves on a team on my own. Now I don't play this game as much, but I still find myself going back to it, whenever a friend wants to play.\n\nLets talk about what the game has to offer and compare to other games in it's series. Stronghold Crusader, many will say is the best in the entire series, and I'd have to agree. This game, is way cheaper, and rich with content, than it's sequel, Stronghold Crusader 2. Stronghold Crusader includes many different medieval units that you'd probably expect: Swordsman, Archers, Crossbowman, Knights on Horseback, Spearman, etc. But it includes many more like engineers, pikeman, macemen, horse archers, slaves, fire throwers... There are two types of troops: Arabic, or Crusader troops. Both similiar, yet both with their strengths and weaknesses. Some AI lords will use only Crusader troops, or only Arabic troops, while some will use a mixture of them both,\n\nLike I said before the AI can be pretty challenging. Of course, there are very, very stupid AI as well that you could beat no problem if you knew the very basics. But the Wolf, and Saladin are very challenging opponents that can take you hours to beat depending on the style of game you play. The campaign(s) are very challenging to beat and they offer you as little as possible to win...but you do get 3 chickens (passes) and once you beat a level you have already passed on, you get a chicken back.\n\nThis game can be played with up to 8 players/AI lords. It can be free for all, 1v1, 4v4, 2v2v2v2, 5v3 or any combination of teams you want. Online or offline. Play with friends and players around the world easily on a program called GameRanger. It works well for me and my sister.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot of fun, and not too complicated to understand. You have peasants that stay idle and are useless unless you provide jobs for them. Once you create say a woodcutters hut using the resources from your stockpile a peasant will walk his way to the hut and become a woodcutter. He will chop down the closest trees and deliver wood to your stockpile. You also need other resources like stone, iron, weapons, and most importantly, food. Without food, your peasants and workers will not want to stay at your castle, so they will leave. Make sure to keep the happiness/popularity above 50. Food, negative taxes, Ale/Inn, and large troop count will all be bonuses to popularity. If your king dies you lose. If all enemy kings are dead, you win :)\n\nTo train troops, you need to use your resources to build buildings to produce troops. You can go 3 routes: Crusader troops, Arabic troops, or both. Barracks will be required to produce crusader troops. But crusader troops require weapons to be made so you need to make weapon workshops. Arabic troops need a mercenary post and hence the name cost more gold, but they do not require the time, money and resources for workshops to create weapons. Engineers, a more advanced unit, needs an Engineers guild to produce them. They can be helpful by taking castle walls down using catapults.\n\nThere is also a free build mode, map editor, and custom scenario mode which offer even more fun with tha already addicting campaign, sandbox, and multiplayer modes.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and definitely if it is on sale.

This game though over a decade old, is truly still relevant within the same castle building rts genre today and for me is more than just nostalgia. It combines a somewhat historically accurate and entertaining historical campaign following the rough lines of the First, Second and Third Crusades and playable from different sides of the conflicts.\n\nThe AI can be rather easy to beat if exploited and with experience in beating the various AI lords you need to challenge yourself using the map maker and understanding AI play style to make winning the match a true challenge.\n\nI love this game and would recommend it to anyone with a historical inclination and an appreciation of rts games from the early 2000's. Hopefully someday they'll make a sequel worth playing.","December 13, 2015","true","60.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The simplicity of this game is one of its many charms. Don't let this fool you, there is still plenty to do and this game can be adjusted to match your playstyle. Casual gamer? Try out a custom skirmish game where you make the rules. Looking for a challenge? Why not head to the Crusader Trials?\n\nDespite its simplicity, the game can surprise you at times. The AI is pretty impressive (unless you ask them to defend you; they aren't the brightest bulb in the bunch when it comes to that respect), the different strategies you can implement to obtain victory never ceases to amaze me. Forgive my bluntless, but I'm willing to say that this game is one of, if not the best, RTS games to date.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dkyde/recommended/40970/","dkyde","[404] Dkyde | The Scatman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dkyde/","667 products in account","Imagine a real-time, fast-paced strategy game where you enter the Holy Lands following an unforgiving trail of fifty crusaders – each more difficult than the last; each with different enemies, different resources, different allies and different economies. You discover and master the art of defending and storming castles – planning your every move carefully while controlling armies of men, horses, portable-shields, catapults and more in the hundreds. Now, realize that the game in question, Stronghold Crusader, was released twelve years ago and that a succeeder is inbound Q4 2014.\n\nIn comparison to the original Stronghold, Firefly Studios significantly altered the dynamics of Stronghold Crusader in an attempt to increase the game speed – which unforgivably means the first few minutes of each mission are crucial. The changes includes the addition of a range of Arabian mercenary units, where especially assassins, fire throwers and horse archers introduces a range of new opportunities upon both defending your own castle and conquering others. The traditional military units are still more powerful however, but takes significantly longer to recruit due to the extensive production line. The player must thus analyze the enemies and starting resources swiftly – the sooner the production line can be started, the better. Similar, if the enemies appear weak during the early stages, a quick and silent attack gently delivered by assassins might be preferred.\n\nOne aspect is to defend your castle and attack enemies, a whole other layer of gameplay, which appears subtle at first glance, is the actual castle management. Stronghold Crusader introduces a range of buildings and techniques which allows the player to generate more money, extra powerful men or a harder working population, to name a few. Increasing your population’s happiness through religion or ale allows for higher taxes, crowding and even food shortages. Similar, increasing the amount of bad things (i.e. gallows, dunking tools or cesspits) in your castle makes your population work faster and thus generate a faster and more efficient money flow.\n\nSecuring a food chain is even more important than it was in the original Stronghold due to the deserted and rocky terrain which greatly limits the amount of fertile areas. These areas are therefore both interesting and important strategic points; take out an enemy’s food supply and you force him out of his castle. The gameplay thus consists of both castle management, fighting and survival throughout 50 crusades, four chapters of historically inspired missions and an extra 30 crusades introduced after the original release – in total well above 40 hours of campaign gameplay, excluding later free- and custom-play.\n\nThe RTS-genre has undeniably advanced significantly since the release of Stronghold Crusader on several fronts; including, but not limited to, the graphics (though, admittedly, the old graphics are charming), the audio, the interfaces and the AI. Especially the latter is easily noticeable if you have played any modern RTS-game – the AI in Stronghold Crusader is easily tricked, and once a player reaches a certain point in the map, winning ultimately becomes a matter of time due to the superior human player and the seemingly flat difficulty-level of the AIs. Instead, the game relies on quantity and starting perks such as six AIs with 20.000 gold each versus the player with only 3.000 gold.\n\nThat said then the game unfortunately suffers from a range of bugs and glitches, which unavoidably results in quite some micromanagement of the player’s troops to ensure they indeed are doing the assigned task accordingly. The path-finding system has a tendency to chose some strange routes, and can, on rare occasions, end up getting your men stuck. Though, remembering the age of the game then these issues are minor and certainly not game breaking – merely frustrating due to the higher focus on micromanagement.\n\nThe freedom in terms of building and designing your castle is intriguing and very unique compared to other RTS-games. Similar, the actual gameplay is extremely simple and straightforward, but due to the many layers of extra options and techniques during both fighting and castle management, the gameplay is yet challenging – and most importantly, fun. Ignoring the minor bugs and glitches, Stronghold Crusader is a solid game for any RTS-fan, and a great option for those who wishes to enter the genre.\n\nRead my full review here: http://212fahrenheit.reviews/?p=171\n\n","August 24, 2014","true","65.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Don't let play hours fool you, I've played the cd version on and off since I first picked it up with my dad at EB games! (yup that long ago, EB games!!) A great and worthy sequel to the orginal!\n\nPros\n-More awesome voiceovers, in arabic this time!\n-Good graphics for its time\n-Skirmish mode addon\n-New characters\n-Multiple campaigns\n-Arabic units\n-Desert theme\n-Same old game we love, they didn't ruin it, they didn't fix it either becase they didn't need to, it was perfect in its orignal release!\n-Historical missions\n\nCons\n-The campaigns are less personal than the orginal, no big story that is, hearing the villians plot their schemes, or fireplace cutscenes, just some back story on the time and event and a massive campaign that is a string of skirmish missions put together, its still fun to beat though!\n\nOverall\nA game that has and will stand the test. Definitely better than the awful Strongholds 2 and 3. Firefly seriously just needs to go back to its roots and expand upon this game within the 3d engine, not change everything, and have better quality control!  I digress, get the original for its amazing story, and get this for its awesome skirmish mode!\n\n10/10      Classic Castle Building Sim","November 12, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The economic system is brilliant, it is very realistic but at the same time simple and easy to understand. The castle and warfare mechanics are brilliant. There are numerous ways to build your castle and defend it, and a variety of options to defeat your enemies. While most strategy games tend to require the same tactics with just slight differences, this game takes strategical thinking to a whole new level.\nIn fact, a game of SC is not that different from a game of chess.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics, of course, this is an old game.","August 17, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game includes Crusader Extreme HD, with missions 'so difficult' (the first 14 missions took me 1-3 hours each, excluding some start-over missions because i failed) that you need to resort to a very defensive guerilla/ninja playing style to succeed. there's missions where u have to defeat more than 7 opponents on a single map, all by yourself. And everyone starts with the same resources.\n\nAfter some restarted missions and succeeding (im about halfway now i guess, at mission 14) i found out a strategy that works out for 90% of the missions. If you want to figure this out yourself do not read on, i will not mention anything new. but for those who quit out of frustration heres how you can do it:\n\n1. some missions involve defeating multiple opponents of which some are very closeby, even withing arrow range of your castle (you dont want that). use up all you money to build knights and send them in to kill the enemies close to you. in some missions, its possible to kill enemy lords before they have even built their castle.\n2. NEVER forget to build a market in the beginning. not all maps offer all resource types within range or within castle building range, which means e.g. if theres only quarry near the keep, you will have to put as any quarry miines there as possible and sell some of it to buy stone/wood.\n3. always start off building 3 more stockpile spaces (free), a market, 2-4 hovels depending on how much starting resources u have, and a combination of 5, 10 or 15 'good things' and a church (or 2, if u can),  and either a mercenary post or barracks + armory. buying weapons to recruit non-mercenary troops is usually cheaper. mercenary post recommended when u have a lot of starting money.\n4. build a wall ASAP around your keep with enough space to put in all your buildings needed to recruit ttroops and keep the economy going. set mercenary slaves or regular troops like spearman and archers at work to dig a moat on the inner side of the wall, then build another wall that will actually function as your wall. the first wall is just to protect them from harm while digging. if youre skilled at timing things and monitoring progress, you won't need to but if you have plenty of starting cash in some missions then this is a safe method.\n5. do not forget to build stairs at your walls. because it is not possible to build when enemies are close and then your guys wont be able to man the walls/towers you built.\n6. if you build a keep, always build a bridge at it right away.\n7. save up the rock volley to slowly kill off enemytroop spawn posts during missions. do not use it up for anything else unless you really really need it because you would lose your lord otherwise or enemy is about to breach walls.\n8. enemy knights are the biggest problem when they attack early in the game. therefore, just buy leather armour and crossbows and build crossbow archers or when low on cash u will need sligshot mercs who have strengths in great numbers.\n9. last but very important tip: if u wanna destroy an enemy castle, bring plenty of archers. like 50+ . and put them in a place where they can hit the enemies campfire where the peasants gather. set attack location instead of directly clicking a peasant cuz they will stop attacking when all peasants are down and hit other targets instead. this prevents them from building new troops while u are attacking, which was often the reason i lost all my troops cuz the enemy started building knights superfast and in the end i didnt have enough troops to get on top of the keep and kill the leader.\n10. Try to build a perimiter wall ALL AROUND buildings that involve a production chain. if it's not possible, put a big waterpot near valuable locations and station some archers that can easily kill off slaves who want to lit up your mines for example.\n\n\ni could give more tips, but these things i found out and used helped me through the first 14 missions fairly easy. you should figure the rest out for yourself through trial and error","October 15, 2014","true","89.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No 3D-graphics? Well, guess what... It doesn't need that to be good!\nHere you are, starting only with some wood, stone and gold. You build - you recruit - you fight - you win (?). It's a simple concept and a lot of strategy games follow this direction. In fact, Stronghold Crusader isn't really complex, so the first sight might give you the impression of a boring city simulator... For me, there's something wonderful about this simplicity.\n\nThe goal is to be the very best like no one ever was. Kill the enemy's king and get your well-earned peace while you defend your own crown-wearing buddy. Of course they won't invite you into their castle, so you have to invite yourself. In order to blast away their walls and towers, there are different ways, like hammering every single brick off the wall or dig a tunnel underneath it. They won't like you to be that rude, so they put archers on towers to keep your men away and you'll have to get rid of them first somehow! Either you ruin the towers with catapults or invade with own archers and fight back.\nThis isn't what makes Stronghold Crusader so enjoyable. The true entertainment is the possibility to be a rotten ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to them! Every inhabitant of the castle is a free-walking NPC which can be killed too. It is incredibly annoying when your enemy has posted some archers beneath your farms and keeps killing your farmers. Not only is it very time consuming to fight off those archers, but it's also very stressful for the castle's economy. Every killed farmer means a lost delivery of food, and without food your people will get very angry. Your people start to leave your castle when you keep being such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and soon you will only have three peasants left.\nIf this is still too weak for you, you can step it up and use dirty tricks to wreck'em! If you manage to lit an enemy's building on fire, it will spread out drasticly, burning down every house 'n' human. This could lead to a total destruction of the castle, making them to start from the beginning. Fire is a great element of the game, because it can turn a lost-believed battle into a success.\nOtherwise I'd say it's a classic RTS. Build, fight and succeed. There are  singleplayer campaigns, but the true enjoyment is the multiplayer with friends, because of the nasty actions possible. Sadly you'll have to fiddle around with IPs and networks in order to connect to each other. Because this game doesn't require alot performance, the connection is always stable (at least for me it always was) and free of laggs.\nAll I can say is that I've played this game for whole days years ago and I still enjoy this piece. The graphics may look very old and bad, but I think it only adds to the charisma the game shows.","April 3, 2015","true","36.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Then, it hit me; Steam is a place for (almost) all games! I searched up, "Stronghold Crusader" and was shocked to find out there was even more Crusaders  to be offered!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narnach/recommended/40970/","narnach","Narnach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narnach/","416 products in account","Stronghold Crusader had the best gameplay in the entire series, but the graphics were getting a little bit outdated after a decade. This HD re-release makes it look good enough to last another decade. Don't expect fancy 3D graphics, this is old-school isometric 2.5D.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. There are tutorials to teach you the basics and there are two "crusader trails" with about 50 missions each to give you a lot of different scenarios to play through. There are also campaigns with a story to them.\n\nYou play as a lord in the time of the crusades. You start with a small manor and a hand full of troops and there are enemies who want you dead. Build farms to grow food to keep your population alive. Gather resources such as wood, stone and metal. Build up a castle wall-by-wall according to your own design. Put down towers of different shapes and sizes: small tall towers to give your archers extra range, and big lower towers on which you can mount siege weapons. Have your population craft weapons to train soldiers or hire mercenaries with gold. Then try to invade your enemies' castles. Build catapults to destroy their walls, or use siege ladders to get your archers on their walls to turn their safe castle into a slaughterhouse. Beware of hidden traps like spike pits and burning oil.\n\nSkirmish mode allows you to pick from a few dozen maps, some balanced and some unbalanced. Want to play 4 vs 4 on a balanced map? Want a real challenge, then pick an unbalanced map and stack the odds against you.\n\nThe AI does not have traditional difficulty levels, but there are a number of AI personalities that have their own strategy. Fighting against the Caliph means you have to be prepared dirty tricks like waves of slaves trying to burn down your farms, and fire arrow archers trying to set the ground on fire when you try to take his castle. King Richard attacks with honor and superior force using siege weapons and heavily armored units. The Sultan is a dreamer who focuses more on building an economy than training a superior army. The Snake thows large numbers of archers and spearmen at you, favoring quantity over quality.","September 27, 2014","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is because I had to play it on Game Ranger and Steam did not record that time as playtime. I also put probably hundreds of hours into it before I bought it here.\n\nI have owned Stronghold Crusader for my entire adult life, and it was always one of my favorite games. When I saw that there was an HD version out, I immediately put it on my wishlist and eventually wound up owning it. Now, I have not taken seriously the idea that HD games are any better graphically than their original versions. I've played a few HD games and even in side by side pictures I have a hard time telling the difference. The main point to HD games, as far as I can tell, is that they are more playable on modern machines.\n\nWhile this game does technically run, it does so with difficulty. Generally windows behind the game bleed through somehow and cause disruption. Alt tabbing is possible but only with great disruption and it takes a good five to ten seconds to get back into the game. One nice thing about buying an old game on Steam is that you can usually have the Steam overlay and multiplayer with other steam users is quite easy. This game has no Steam overylay and multiplayer is actually extremely difficult. It took probably half an hour for two professional geeks to figure it out. That had a lot to do with us avoiding Game Ranger at all costs, but we couldn't find any other way to play it multiplayer. GameR anger it is.\n\nNow, I already owned this game. I have it on a compact disc downstairs. I got this game here because I thought it was something beyond the version from my late teens and would have some sort of advantage over that.\n\nDon't get me wrong. If you don't already own this game, do buy it. But not on Steam. Get it on Gog where you won't have all the drm. If you already own Stronghold Crusader, the HD version brings nothing new of any value.\n\nAgain, I can't speak highly enough of Stronghold Crusader itself, but you don't need the HD version and you get none of the regular Steam advantages by buying it here.","October 22, 2015","false","0.1"," 17 of 41 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","17","41","2","0"

I spent countless night playing this with my friends, those were the good ol days. I'm glad they made a HD version of this, but I reall hope they can remake the whole game with just better physics engine, 3d models/textures and stuffs like that (but don't make change to the gameplay, which is the failure of cursader 2). This together with red alert 2 are my favorite RTS games of all time (unlike SC2, RA3 is pretty good though). I definitely recomment this game--it takes some time to get used to its economic and population system, but once you get a hang of it, you're gonna enjoy this game soooo much.\nSome hints for new players:\nfor every mill you build you should build around 7-10 bakers.\nfor every stone mine you build you need around 5 cows to transport the stones.\nalways build the lumber hut and market first, wood is essential at the beginning.\nbuild a LOT of stone mine--easy money.\nthe placement of the buildings are very important to efficiency (e.g. by placing the bakers right next to granaries you reduce the time of a baker's travelling).\nhope this helps","January 5, 2015","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have normous ways to cripple the foes economy through seige, fire, and disease, "here comes the cow!." Numbers do not win in this game, a decent defense can be more powerful than a large offense. One word Market! You will find this build is key to winning a game more so than any RTS youve ever played.\n\nOne bonus is this game has a very great design where you dont focus on all the micro management, your role is to command the soilders and build a well thought out base that can withstand the many types of seiges. One mistake can end you : )\n\nEXTREME MODE: same as above but soley based on war and little defense tactics like buring everyone alive and choke points.

SC is one game I have loved from day one. For the first time I played a game that was so complicated it took me a few days to master the economy. I had dreamed of a game like this since I played Warcraft as a small child. A game so realistic you actually had to gather raw materials it was a dream come true. Games have come and gone but SC always remained it was the only game that continued to hold my interest through the years. Even my friends got hooked and my wife who is by no means a gamer. The graphics were subpar even for the time but the gameplay was so entertaining it didn't matter. The attention to detail was beyond compare the concept of citizens you could not control was genius. Every building was bustling with people doing work and sounds of every trade rang out in a crowded village square. I developed many working strategies over the years it was as if there really were no rules. You were limited only by what crazy attack you could think up and how well you executed it. But it wasn't just the gameplay that was exceptional the programming was amazing. The 2D drawing of 3D objects made the game tiny and playable on the oldest computers. I used to carry a copy in my mp3 player so I could play anywhere. It worked on any network without any errors ever seriously in 12 years! I swear this game would run over two tin cans on a string. At some LAN parties we didn't even bother setting up a network we just plugged all the computers into a hub and SC would work even when windows didn't show any other network locations. I still play my original copy and have only encountered a few glitches. I wish they would just remake this game with top of the line graphics. I'll be playing this game till the day I die -SEF","August 7, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/triasadi/recommended/40970/","triasadi","MLGesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/triasadi/","117 products in account","Stronghold Crusader mixes castle building, RTS, and resource management. The campaign will teach you most of the things from resource gathering, building and defending your castle, to sieging the enemy and defending your castle. Stronghold Crusader has 16 AI lords, each lord has different strategies and difficulties. They also have a different castle builds and troop choices. You can choose to use Arab or European troops or even all together. The extreme edition is a faster paced version of the game that you can play separately from the original game.\n\nStronghold Crusader is one of my favorite RTS games. It is very similar to its predecessor, Stronghold, but it has more content than Stronghold. I first played it since 2007 and bought the steam version recently. It was one of the best and most addicting game I played back then. The game is quite simple when you get the hang of it. The gameplay is still great till this day, even though the game was from 2001. And I really like the HD addition to the game, the max resolution used to be 1024x768 and after the HD addition you can play with almost any resolution. The AI is also quite challenging. The skirmish mode and custom games will add many hours to the game. The soundtrack for Stronghold Crusader is fantastic. I really like the soundtrack of this game. The voice acting is kinda bad, but it really fits with the game somehow. I really like how Arabian units speak Arabic. The integration with Steam Cloud is one of the reasons I bought the Steam version of the game.\n\nHowever, Stronghold Crusader has a minor flaw. The lack of Steam overlay. You can't chat with friends without alt-tabbing and you can't take screenshots via Steam too.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the game looks outdated, it truly withstood the test of time. Stronghold Crusader is still a very good game and will give hours of fun. I really recommend this game.","August 24, 2015","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are probably too young for not knowing this game because all  20's generation strategy gamers  know this game.\nDo you know the kind of games that you do not care how old it is and bad the graphics are according to the newest one? This is one of them that you will not care at all. I have been playing this game for about 8 years now and i still love the joy this game gives to me. And i often find myself in desire for playing it time to time. It is the kind of addiction that this game leaves on you.\nStronghold franshice has 4 or 5 games, Sronghold Crusader is the second one and truelly the best one. You may hear that from every Stronghold players. Everything about the game is unique and beautiful, the  way you build your castle is totally up to you which lets you to build strong castles against your enemies. While in this rush for building your castle and fighting against your enemies game's soundtracks will help you to relax. This game has amazing soundtracks that will give you the opportunity to experience the eastern musical instruments fascinating and exotic sound.\nIf you do not know about this game and love the games like tycoon/strategy please make yourself a favour and get this game.

THats and individual production.\nThen the wheat must go through a Mill and a Bakery, then to the Granary for the bread to be used.\nI automatically think the Anno series if i would compare the economic chain too.\nTHe amount of resource income you have is totally dependent on how much resources there are and how wisely you use the space. No assigning 20 villagers to 1 stone deposit. More like 10 Quarries which take 3 peasants each to run.\nStronghold Crusader is known mostly for its 50 mission Skirmish Trail, with just a Campaign based on historic events as more of a bonus feature. And another 20-30 Skirmishes in the Warchest.\nI for one love this, as SHC is just made for deathmatches of all sorts.\nTheres a couple hand fulls of opponents, each with a personality, castle build, unit selection, all which creates their difficulty. There is no selective difficulty.\nNote that the game and opponents is relatively easy, its the context in which you play that gives mission difficulty, as you will find out playing the Skirmish Trail.\n\nIt really is a fun game and one you will remember. It has a special place in my heart.\n\nRemember there is also websites and YT channels and videos (im slowly working on some myself) with walkthroughs and mission help, as quite often people need it!\n\nWorth $15, and on sale, an absolute steal.","April 19, 2015","true","55.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SC is one game I have loved from day one. For the first time I played a game that was so complicated it took me a few days to master the economy. I had dreamed of a game like this since I played Warcraft as a small child. A game so realistic you actually had to gather raw materials it was a dream come true. Games have come and gone but SC always remained it was the only game that continued to hold my interest through the years. Even my friends got hooked and my wife who is by no means a gamer. The graphics were subpar even for the time but the gameplay was so entertaining it didn't matter. The attention to detail was beyond compare the concept of citizens you could not control was genius. Every building was bustling with people doing work and sounds of every trade rang out in a crowded village square. I developed many working strategies over the years it was as if there really were no rules. You were limited only by what crazy attack you could think up and how well you executed it. But it wasn't just the gameplay that was exceptional the programming was amazing. The 2D drawing of 3D objects made the game tiny and playable on the oldest computers. I used to carry a copy in my mp3 player so I could play anywhere. It worked on any network without any errors ever seriously in 12 years! I swear this game would run over two tin cans on a string. At some LAN parties we didn't even bother setting up a network we just plugged all the computers into a hub and SC would work even when windows didn't show any other network locations. I still play my original copy and have only encountered a few glitches. I wish they would just remake this game with top of the line graphics. I'll be playing this game till the day I die -SEF","August 7, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Considering that more people were working on the music - which is one of the most significant part of the game - it's the best I've played with. Best strategy game, easily. I spent 2 summers morning till night while I was in elementary school. Not only teaches strategic thinking (you'll need a lot for the warchest trail's later missions), but also basic history.\n\nI was on the hil in my tiny castle. My troops of hundreds were awaiting my command to attack one of the three of the wolf borthers. First I ordered my archers to move forward and clear the path. As they were fearlessly marching towards the shooting range a bunch of catapult rocks bashed the ground. Right in the middle of the crowd. I've seen big losses, a lot of massacre in my time. I remembered when I was part of that crowd. Approximately thirty of my archers fell in just one counterattack the wolf responded with.\nHe didn't have a second shot though. My men's rain of arrows ruthlessly killed everyone in the tower. It was time to march closer. I ordered my mace men and knights to approach the back gate. I knew by the time they get there, there will be no troops on the wall to harm them. the assassins will have taken care of them by then.\nNot even a day past and the castle was empty. I ordered my archers not to shoot any civilians. I wanted the glory for myself.\nAs I walked towards the huge hole in the wolf's castle wall...through the countless dead bodies of my and his fallen men, I remembered. I remembered why am I doing this. Not for the Glory. The only reason is...\n\nThis is when the merciless message smashed my bubble...\n\n"Stronghold Crusader HD has stopped working"\n\nGreat times!","April 23","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andrewgeyko/recommended/40970/","andrewgeyko","Dr.Gordano Freemano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andrewgeyko/","225 products in account","Ah, Stronghold Crusader. I remember this game when I was maybe......6?\nThis game really brings back memories with the floppy disk games.\nAnyway lets review!\nNote: Buying the game will also include Stronghold Crusader Extreme but that is so terrible so I wont review it.\n\nTHE GAME\nStronghold Crusader HD is a castle sim with I think 4 modes.\nCareer/Story: Really just a set of tutorials and starting battles to get you ready to play the all grand skirmish mode(I think thats what its called) but never the less it can be fun but only sometimes.\n\nSkirmish/Battle: This is probably what makes this game grand. It puts you in a screen where you decide things like the map, how many players fight, where they fight, difficulty, starting money, etc. Then you start building a castle and an army to help you crush the other players while not getting recked yourself. THIS IS WHAT YOU GET THE GAME FOR. I bet it would be fun in MP but none of my friends have it :(\n\nCastle Builder- Just the mode if you want to build a huge castle, no enemies just you, your people, and that annoying flippin guide. (WHY?)\n\nMultiplayer- If someone wants to add me to play this mode please do ;_;\n\nAUDIO\nThe game has solid voice acting from every character and they talk to you at the right times sometimes indicating how you should prepare, like telling you "youre kingdom will get crushed" could indicating that they're lanuching an assault at you. The fighting audio is good but the people getting hit by arrows sounds like there coughing and screaming. Your castle based on how many people actually work it gets more or less chattery and theres less sounds of nature. The only REALLY bad voice acting is your guide, he doesnt change his accent when you change to like a british guy and his voice is just annoying but funny to abuse sometimes. Audio-8/10\n\nGAMEPLAY\nWell as I explained in the modes section you are usually fighting other players, but most of the time youre trying to get people in your kingdom and keep them in your kingdom by maintaning food, taxes, and atractions for your people (like a dancing bear strapped to a pole wtf). Gameplay 9/10\n\nSTORYLINE\nI really dont think i should rate this but I will. The game yes has a story mode but it's mostly a tutorial with basic battles. The games story really comes mostly from the gameplay. Think of games like dota 2, CSGO, and TF2 mostly the story comes out of what you do and see, not whats told. Storyline 7/10\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics would obvioulsy be outdated for a game as old as this but you can see whats going on and not feel like you cant see what that means or indicates. Pretty solid graphics if you look at its age. Im gonna count the score as if I was rating this in the year this was released. Graphics 10/10\n\nAI\nSince this is what most people have to play with ill make a section for it. As I stated in audio the AI will give you hints about whats about to happen but it might not always happen, making them pretty clever enemies. Each king has a different tactic. Some  build the castle a lot others go and start buiding an army, and some also try to build up they're economy so they could buy troops late game. But each kind changes his tactic depending on what he sees so the AI is different every time.  It could use polishing sometimes though. AI 9/10\n\nREPLAYABILITY\nAs I just said the AI's tactic always changes so you never have the same game twice. Also there are TONS of different maps. By tons I mean like 30 maps each ranging on how many maximum players there can be and I think you are able to get more maps (IDK though).

With its humble,vindicitve, or even annoying AI charecters each match has the chance to present a new challenge. Wether it is the wolf building his fortresses that take 30 minutes to destroy with catapults or the caliph constantly torching your goods.\n\nPros:\n70+ maps that will take hours to complete. The satisfaction you get when you complete the trail is great.\nGood simulation - You handle the basic necessities of your people and don't have to do silly redundant stuff.\nRememberable and Challengeing AI. On occasion my friends and i will say a quote from them, and all of us still chuckle.\nPeacefull map modes for those who wish to just watch thier empire strech across the entire map.\nEasy to use interface that allows you to build your castle, wether it is collapsing the map height to the ground or rotating the screen in just a mouse click.\nDid i mention CASTLES? Build your castle huge, small or not at all. Be  the lord you want to be.\nGraphics are really quite good for a dated game.( Over ten years ago) i still tolerate them, and i won't play minecraft because of its graphics.\n\nCons:\nKinda meh online multiplayer, it comes with a 3rd party client called game ranger that has a pretty decent sized community. But the games can be laggy/choppy depending on who you're connected to.\n\nCan't place that there my lord.\n\nOverall, i would recommend this game to any Castle Sim/RTS fanatic. A great game, which in my childhood i probably have over 1000k hours in. Watch your back future knights, don't trust the Caliph.\n","January 12","true","68.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One thing you should note is I dont play strategies, especially new ones the only strategies I ever played/play are Stronghold Crusader and Red Alert 2 and I JUST found out that SC is on Steam.....JUST NOW!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/triasadi/recommended/40970/","triasadi","MLGesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/triasadi/","117 products in account","Stronghold Crusader mixes castle building, RTS, and resource management. The campaign will teach you most of the things from resource gathering, building and defending your castle, to sieging the enemy and defending your castle. Stronghold Crusader has 16 AI lords, each lord has different strategies and difficulties. They also have a different castle builds and troop choices. You can choose to use Arab or European troops or even all together. The extreme edition is a faster paced version of the game that you can play separately from the original game.\n\nStronghold Crusader is one of my favorite RTS games. It is very similar to its predecessor, Stronghold, but it has more content than Stronghold. I first played it since 2007 and bought the steam version recently. It was one of the best and most addicting game I played back then. The game is quite simple when you get the hang of it. The gameplay is still great till this day, even though the game was from 2001. And I really like the HD addition to the game, the max resolution used to be 1024x768 and after the HD addition you can play with almost any resolution. The AI is also quite challenging. The skirmish mode and custom games will add many hours to the game. The soundtrack for Stronghold Crusader is fantastic. I really like the soundtrack of this game. The voice acting is kinda bad, but it really fits with the game somehow. I really like how Arabian units speak Arabic. The integration with Steam Cloud is one of the reasons I bought the Steam version of the game.\n\nHowever, Stronghold Crusader has a minor flaw. The lack of Steam overlay. You can't chat with friends without alt-tabbing and you can't take screenshots via Steam too.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the game looks outdated, it truly withstood the test of time. Stronghold Crusader is still a very good game and will give hours of fun. I really recommend this game.","August 24, 2015","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SC is one game I have loved from day one. For the first time I played a game that was so complicated it took me a few days to master the economy. I had dreamed of a game like this since I played Warcraft as a small child. A game so realistic you actually had to gather raw materials it was a dream come true. Games have come and gone but SC always remained it was the only game that continued to hold my interest through the years. Even my friends got hooked and my wife who is by no means a gamer. The graphics were subpar even for the time but the gameplay was so entertaining it didn't matter. The attention to detail was beyond compare the concept of citizens you could not control was genius. Every building was bustling with people doing work and sounds of every trade rang out in a crowded village square. I developed many working strategies over the years it was as if there really were no rules. You were limited only by what crazy attack you could think up and how well you executed it. But it wasn't just the gameplay that was exceptional the programming was amazing. The 2D drawing of 3D objects made the game tiny and playable on the oldest computers. I used to carry a copy in my mp3 player so I could play anywhere. It worked on any network without any errors ever seriously in 12 years! I swear this game would run over two tin cans on a string. At some LAN parties we didn't even bother setting up a network we just plugged all the computers into a hub and SC would work even when windows didn't show any other network locations. I still play my original copy and have only encountered a few glitches. I wish they would just remake this game with top of the line graphics. I'll be playing this game till the day I die -SEF","August 7, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is beautiful and very atmospheric as is the in-game speech from your foes and allies. The graphics are ok but honestly it is not that type of game.

Crusader is a 3D effect 2D title with basic graphics (good for it's day) and superb gameplay.\n\nThe title has been remastered slightly to allow for more modern display resolutions (hence the "HD" in the title) as before you were limited to 1024x786 on your shiny 1080p screen!\nNow you can see a full 1080p so play on huge TV is even possible!\n\nThe aim of this game is simple, start mission with barely any resources but usually enough to build the basics and start your first line of defence, your castle!\nOnce in full swing you'll have peasant turning into bakers, diary farmers, pub landlords, woodcutters, stonemasons and many more to build your stockpile and granary. You'll need to balance these carefully as the more peasants you have living in your castle the more food they need.\nOnce your resources are taken care of you need to build an army.\nBuilding an army is done of in one of 3 ways, either supplying the armour and weapons (making these from iron, leather etc) and combining these with jobless peasants to create a mega army, making an army from mercenary posts (not as strong as a self made army but a quick way of buidling numbers) or relying on a outpost (disabled in some missions).\nYour objective from this point is clear... destroy your enemies.\n\nWhy is Crusader special? It's got a certain charisma and charm, it just feels right. It's very easy to pickup so great for beginners and advanced gamers and will keep anyone interested for many hours!\n\nDid I mention the castle builder and map creator modes?\n\nCastle builder is for those who just want to create a castle and be left alone for hours on end until it's self sustaining.\n\nMap creator is for those who want to (let's be honest now) create a map with an unfair advantage to the other players.\n\nSystem requirements are so low you could run it on anything from a super low spec Intel Atom to an 16core Xeon.\n\nOverall I'd say a solid 10/10 and a must have for anyones steam account.\n\nI hope there is a Crusader 3, but I strongly hope they base it on this title rather than the other Stronghold series.\n\nAlso, if reworked slightly for Linux compatabilty, perhaps getting it to run on a Raspberry Pi 2!","January 3","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the best stronghold game.  Everything after, while sometimes good, failed to measure up.  And Stronghold 1, while perfectly fine, didn't have the added depth this game has.  While this game lacks a proper story mode, it focuses on what there really is to love about this game - the gameplay.  There's a main campaign which consists of 50 skirmish matches against progressively harder scenarios, and another 20 in the "expansion" that comes included with the HD version.\n\nThere are a multitude of different computer opponents to fight as well, and they can range from comically inept to frighteningly capable.  Maps have a wide range of setups, from the vanilla "everyone starts with the same basic setup and resources" to the maps which have no farmable land, to the maps that give one player every resource and all the others very few at all.  The game is fun, and there are so many different ways to play that it will continue to challenge and entertain you.\n\nOne of the only real downsides is that there are still times when you watch and wait as your economy chugs along and your opponent builds his army, and there's just nothing for you to do but wait.  Firefly did a good job of reducing that so it isn't as stark and noticeable as it was in Stronghold 1, but it still happens.  A fast forward option would have been nice.  Even more so if you like using swordsmen in sieges - you will legit wait five to ten minutes for them to get from your stronghold to the other guy's stronghold.  Still, this is a very minor complaint in an otherwise flawless game.\n\nThere's a strong online community creating more maps and scenarios that can be downloaded and played.  The addition of the arabic units with all their unique traits gives Crusader even more depth than before, and really just rounds out an already fantastic game.  This is one of those games I've kept coming back to over the years, and probably will continue to do so for another decade.\n\nBottom Line: Absolute recommend","December 29, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With its humble,vindicitve, or even annoying AI charecters each match has the chance to present a new challenge. Wether it is the wolf building his fortresses that take 30 minutes to destroy with catapults or the caliph constantly torching your goods.\n\nPros:\n70+ maps that will take hours to complete. The satisfaction you get when you complete the trail is great.\nGood simulation - You handle the basic necessities of your people and don't have to do silly redundant stuff.\nRememberable and Challengeing AI. On occasion my friends and i will say a quote from them, and all of us still chuckle.\nPeacefull map modes for those who wish to just watch thier empire strech across the entire map.\nEasy to use interface that allows you to build your castle, wether it is collapsing the map height to the ground or rotating the screen in just a mouse click.\nDid i mention CASTLES? Build your castle huge, small or not at all. Be  the lord you want to be.\nGraphics are really quite good for a dated game.( Over ten years ago) i still tolerate them, and i won't play minecraft because of its graphics.\n\nCons:\nKinda meh online multiplayer, it comes with a 3rd party client called game ranger that has a pretty decent sized community. But the games can be laggy/choppy depending on who you're connected to.\n\nCan't place that there my lord.\n\nOverall, i would recommend this game to any Castle Sim/RTS fanatic.

Considering that more people were working on the music - which is one of the most significant part of the game - it's the best I've played with. Best strategy game, easily. I spent 2 summers morning till night while I was in elementary school. Not only teaches strategic thinking (you'll need a lot for the warchest trail's later missions), but also basic history.\n\nI was on the hil in my tiny castle. My troops of hundreds were awaiting my command to attack one of the three of the wolf borthers. First I ordered my archers to move forward and clear the path. As they were fearlessly marching towards the shooting range a bunch of catapult rocks bashed the ground. Right in the middle of the crowd. I've seen big losses, a lot of massacre in my time. I remembered when I was part of that crowd. Approximately thirty of my archers fell in just one counterattack the wolf responded with.\nHe didn't have a second shot though. My men's rain of arrows ruthlessly killed everyone in the tower. It was time to march closer. I ordered my mace men and knights to approach the back gate. I knew by the time they get there, there will be no troops on the wall to harm them. the assassins will have taken care of them by then.\nNot even a day past and the castle was empty. I ordered my archers not to shoot any civilians. I wanted the glory for myself.\nAs I walked towards the huge hole in the wolf's castle wall...through the countless dead bodies of my and his fallen men, I remembered. I remembered why am I doing this. Not for the Glory.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StealthRazar/recommended/40970/","StealthRazar","StealthRazar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StealthRazar/","83 products in account","This game is perhaps overlooked by most people these days, considering there are others out there, like StarCraft, Age of Empires, Civilization, and plenty of lesser known RTS games.\n\nYet, this game has a certain charm to it that I think can't be found anywhere else. It's set in the Arabic desert, where you must fight for survival by mastering as many factors as you can, including some staple RTS features, like economics, resources, troops, and workers. This game also features two main ways to determine whether you succeed or not. This comes in the form of managing how much gold you have to buy troops, and how much food you have collected. Running out of food will cause your castle to start losing happiness, and people will begin to leave if it gets below halfway.\n\nSince the food plays a major role in your economy, lacking it presents a severe problem of unbalanced gameplay; people won't be able to keep your economy going if they leave, which means that, if you don't have enough gold to buy food, you're basically doomed. You can't buy troops since you don't have gold, and if, by some chance, you happen to be out of other supplies, it's best to give up if you don't have any allies. Even then, the allies aren't guaranteed to help you, especially if they're A.I players.\n\nThis is where the unbalanced issue comes into place, because not everyone is good at managing their economy, and pitting people with little to no sense of economics against people who do know means that the latter are going to win. Every single time.\n\n\nThis is still a great game, though.  If you are willing to learn how to manage economics, I recommend this game.","May 14","true","40.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
