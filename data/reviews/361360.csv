It boils down to a basic adventure game that doesn’t offer any special gameplay mechanics, but is fundamentally well-executed. And anyone who grew up as a fan of the books, or TV show, will enjoy an added nostalgic charm. So it is worth consideration for anyone who really enjoys the genre or who is an avid Goosebumps fan (or was as a kid); but anyone on the fence may find the experience lacking.\n\nAs I said, the game itself is just a standard point-and-click adventure. You will gather many inventory items and use them with your environment to progress the game. There aren’t any minigames or any defining features outside the standard mechanics. It is also pretty easy, and there are in-game hints; so it is perfect for casual, relaxing gaming.\n\nBut while the gameplay may be extremely basic, the fundamental aspects of Goosebumps: The Game are certainly well designed. The music and art style are pleasant and are well aligned with the soul of the game. There is a nice amount of room to explore, and you can pack your inventory with numerous items, many of which you don’t even need to progress (which isn’t a common mechanic in this genre). The narrative flows naturally and the pacing of the game is spot on. There is a solid game here, even if it isn’t extravagant.\n\nAll of that said, the overall experience is yet quite charming— especially for anyone who is a fan of Goosebumps. Throughout the game, you will encounter myriad references, cameos by characters, and running themes that define the Goosebumps universe. There is a definite air of nostalgic charm to the game.\n\nEven if you didn’t grow up on Goosebumps, you may still enjoy this game if you generally enjoy casual point-and-click adventures and are seeking something new. But the main target audience for this piece is those of us who will revel in the nostalgia. If you don’t feel like you fall into either of those groups, you may want to let this one pass; but if you do, there is a good chance you will enjoy Goosebumps: The Game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","January 26","true","2.9"," 84 of 89 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","84","89","0","2"

"Most people don't know that.” ― R.L. Stine\n\nGoosebumps: The Game is an intriguing little adventure game, based on the popular book series written by R.L. Stine during the 90s. I remember reading a couple of Goosebumps books when I was around 10 or so - and unfortunately those would be the only ones that I'd be reading due to them never getting translated into my native language aside a handful (6, maybe 8 books) and me being understandably unable to read the originals around those ages. Needless to say, aside their worldwide success, Goosebumps has been an intriguing yet short lived experience for me in my childhood and I was quick to forget about them. I've never watched the TV series either - them being never aired here back in the day - so I never even thought about them until I saw the game title here on Steam years later my brief experience. Curious, I decided to gamble on the opportunity.\n\nHere, we are an ordinary child attending an ordinary school, getting done with our ordinary day and going back home - Yet, something is not quite right. As we leave school grounds, we start encountering odd business here and there - like some unkempt stranger with a greenish hue on his skin; hanging around the forest short cut, a talking rabbit that would have an opinion or a two about manners, or a psychotic vampire poodle almost ripping off our face! Something's definitely not right! Above all else, we come back home only to realize that the house is shifted into one creepy ghost ridden alternate version of what it should have been! We are to brave the horrors of our own home, discover the culprit behind all these monstrous events and put a stop to it if possible... Welcome to a day when all spooky campfire stories actually became true!\n\nAside all the air of mystery and horror, there is nothing actually scary about this game. Sure it is a bit creepy and unsettling at times due to the concept, but it is safe to assume that the whole setting is actually kid friendly. Fine, let's say pre-teen friendly. Anyways, the environment is a cartoonish gothic hybrid arranged to feed into the imagination of anyone growing up in 90s. All kinds of eerie yet entertaining anecdotes and reference characters taken out of Stine's books thrown around for your discovery, combined with the good balance in narrative between the nervous and the humorous promises you a good amount of basic fun for 5-6 hours.\n\nThe gameplay is quite basic. You are given an inventory on the side - in which you can keep stuffing nearly anything that you come across - and expected to walk around, overcome challenges of different monstrous creatures with your puzzle solving to save the day. The game world isn't quite linear: you can wander around in 3 different environments to take on different fright challenges. The story takes interesting side turns depending on some of your choices - including countless demises at the hands of different monsters due to not so wise action choices - so it is possible to finish the game with alternative paths. Yet, the main story and the final showdown never change. A bit cheesy, somewhat unsettling yet nothing ground breaking.\n\nIf I'd be a bit more familiar with the original setting of R. L. Stine's exciting book series, I'd probably be more qualified to write a rich and deserving review for this game. As I am, I can only discuss the elements of the game itself and hope to make justice for the title. Speaking from my own experience, I can at least assure you that it is not mandatory to read the books for you to enjoy this game. It is an interesting and challenging puzzle adventure as it is, but maybe it could be a better idea to grab it on sale considering the full price for this cute and casual experience being a bit of an exaggeration.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 28","true","6.1"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","33","33","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/recommended/361360/","littlequillybunny","♫Quilly Shiba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/","4306 products in account","OverviewGoosebumps: The Game is a point and click adventure game, set in the universe of R.L. Stine's works. I loved the books when I was younger, and the game has many many elements that make for a nostalgic, creepy experience. Due to it being many years since I read the books, I certainly didn't recognize some references to some characters in this game, but that did not take away from my experience at all - even if you hadn't even heard of this series, I think you would also enjoy this point and click game.\n\nThoughts, game play wiseThe game play is pretty typical of the point and click adventure game genre - explore environments, pick up items, figure out ways to use them, solve puzzles. In recent years there have been some changes in this genre, for example a more streamlined inventory system and moving away from illogical puzzles from the past. Goosebumps: The Game knows this, and also knows many people playing this game would be those that have also played older games in this genre. It keeps many elements of the nostalgic games. Here you can pick up many items and simply put them into your bag, and the game will humorously point it out, especially when they are bigger items.\n\nWhile keeping the nostalgic game play elements, this game certainly didn't keep every element. Puzzles in this game make sense, and even some "combining items in inventory" puzzles are logical in a good way (I used to hate those if the game made it purposely difficult). Another thing this game did well was the balance of optional items and puzzles, I finished the main story in about 4.5 hours, but there are definitely many more things to do in-game if you are not in a hurry and like more of a challenge. So whether you are an achievement hunter and want to see more of the universe, or just want to experience the story only, you can enjoy the same game in different ways.\n\nThoughts, story wiseYou come back from school, and things feel weird. You will run into ghosts, your house turns into a ghoulish version with past residents... And of course, you, the main character, have to find a way to save yourself and make things right. The story itself isn't actually very deep and detailed, and I would describe the focus of the game as the experience and puzzles while the story is more just a reason for the game to progress. I wasn't being nit-picky about the story as it did serve its purpose, but if you are looking for a deep and fleshed out story, you may have to lower your expectations a little. It kind of makes sense due to the source material - the Goosebumps series were aimed towards children (but anyone can enjoy them).\n\nOne bonus thing in this game - people actually use technology and you can charge your phone!!! However there's still many good ol' things from the past such as cassette players... This aspect of the game kind of reminded me of the nostalgic parts of Gone Home, wandering through a house (though this one is actually haunted) and checking out items. For those who grew up in North America this definitely adds a valuable sentimental layer to the game, and for those that didn't, I guess you get to check out what it was like.\n\nFinal thoughtsFor a point and click adventure game, I found Goosebumps: The Game quite enjoyable. There were times I genuinely felt my heart racing, and the atmosphere and pacing of the game is well executed. It felt like reading Goosebumps again when I was younger, and the story while not as dark and deep as adult horror, made for a good experience. I recommend this game to people looking for an interesting point and click game.\n\n~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the Completing the Backlog curator page, for other nice reviews by me and others!~","December 24, 2015","true","4.2"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","35","38","0","5"

From cover to cover in one go. My favorite books were Haunted Mask and Say Cheese and Die, looking forward to hearing which ones you loved. I haven't read them all though, but I can safely say this game is full of references and even some original cover art retouches. The game is a reminiscence from a childhood, both fun in its cartoonish dialogue and scary when it comes to showing off its hidden nook dwellers and whatever scares people. I had to stop playing, because it's morning already and I really want to chill my bones after dark with no lights on! The point and click aspect is well-done so far, with only real complaint is lack of screen resolutions in settings, so you don't have to play with black bars up and down the screen.","October 13, 2015","true","10.6"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","46","57","3","7"

Much to my surprise, it was actually fantastic.\n\nThis may be the cutest game I've played for a long time, and has earned a spot in what I consider to be the 5 best games I've played this year(so far). If you grew up reading some Goosebumps, or watching the T.V. show, you should probably give this a shot.\n\nThe art style is wonderful, the music is very atmospheric and engrossing- and very enjoyable (we need more of Chad's theme). The writing(while seemingly dull at first) shaped up to be really fun, there are a healthy amount of references to lots of other games and it just works well. If you like memes, we got memes too. Wayforward really outdid themselves here.\n\nIt also actually gets a bit spooky at several points (albeit a bit cheesey). I find myself wanting to play this again, right after I finished it.\n\nOn the downside, the length leaves a bit to be desired. Especially for the price tag, it would have been nice to get more out of the dollar to hour ratio. I had written this off as a game they quickly pooped out to compliment the anticipated movie coming out soon, but I was mistaken. If you're on the fence about checking this one out, go ahead and take the plunge, you won't regret it.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, check out my playthrough if you're still curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H01gryd9jbU","October 15, 2015","true","5.8"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","29","31","2","0"

Whether you're a fan of the books, the TV show, the movie, or all three, I guarantee you'll find something to like about this game.\n\nNow, with that said, I do have a few minor faults to pick out, one of them being the difficulty. If you're not familiar with point and click games, this one's going to be a doozy. It intentionally throws you for ropes, and some of the puzzles are real teasers. Now, as a veteran point-and-clicker, I found the steep curve to be a welcome challenge, but I really feel like a warning is in order for anyone coming into the genre as a fresh face.\n\nSecondly, I have to nitpick the story. Now don't get me wrong, I certainly found it enjoyable, but if you're going in with high expectations, you're going to be disappointed. In my personal opinion, the storyline was shoddily thrown together as an afterthought, and there are many, many questions left unanswered by the time you reach the end, and that's coming from someone who has put 19+ hours into the game, on multiple playthroughs.\n\nAnd thirdly, the price. Honestly, $20 is asking far too much for what amounts to around 3 1/2 to 4 hours of gameplay for your average casual gamer. If you can get this one on sale, I highly recommend it, but you're better off spending that $20 on a game with more content per dollar.\n\nNow for the pros! Nostalgia. Absolute, unmitigated nostalgia. You cannot beat this game for the sheer amount of Stine references, some of which only you veteran Goosebump kids are gonna get. This baby also features 40 achievements, some of which are quite challenging, and all of which are genuinely fun to nab! Also, as someone with a lot of time invested, I can say I encountered only a single glitch, which was very easily remedied by a simple reset.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a personal 7 / 10. A must buy for any Stine fan, and a fun introduction to those new to the scene. Just don't pay $20 for it.

It has many of R.L. Stine's most known works in here, such as Night of the Living Dummy, It Came From Beneath The Sink!, and Monster Blood to name a few. Unfortunately, the story kind of wanders off in a couple of different directions, until finally coming to a half-making-sense ending. Nevertheless, I did enjoy playing this from what time I did.\n\nIn addition to this, I'd also like to add this is not a hidden object game as I innitally thought it was, it's more of a point-and-click where you find and use the objects you need to complete tasks, it's a little different.\n\nIf you're interested in a walkthrough/guide of this game, I made one which can be found here.","December 22, 2015","true","3.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I find it a bit weird how calm my character is able to stay, even though he is seeing ghosts, and random people in his house. I feel like I would call the cops, but who am I to judge! I also like that if you die, you literally just respawn in the previous room, without having to replay a big portion of the game.

I needed a strong dose of childhood nostalgia and lighthearted horror and it certainly did not disappoint.\n\nPROS:\n-Fantastic artwork, really makes you feel like you're living in a Goosebumps cover\n\n-Music provides good atmosphere (my favorites being the first track you hear when standing in front of the school, and, of course, Chad's theme.)\n\n-Abundant book references (as the case should be)\n\n-Plenty of charming ways to kill yourself! (be careful around the women's clothing section, scared the crap out of me)\n\nCONS:\n-Length 2 1/2 - 4 hours depending on if you know what you're doing, leaves me wanting at least one more small area for the price tag\n\n-Puzzles can be vague at times (though this also may be because I'm stupid)\n*(Note: having some knowledge of the series definitely helps when dealing with certain creatures)\n\n-Tons of useless items which you cannot remove from your inventory. I personally like when you have some items to throw you off in these kinds of games, but not when you have 7-8 pages worth if you pick up everything\n\n-*(Note: this may be an issue with my machine, but putting it just in case)\nFreezing and lagging! at certain key points, upon finishing a puzzle, I was greeted by a stuttering music track and frozen screen, which, thankfully, I regained control of after about 30 seconds or so. Also some animation skipping and flubs with a certain character at the end of the game\n\n\nIf you're a Goosebumps fan, or just want a new point and click game to try out, I'd recommend checking this game out!","October 19, 2015","true","4.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

The title revisits many of the more popular books from the franchise, such as Night of the Living Dummy and Beast from the East, and even pays further homage through the 40 available achievements.\n\nThe painted landscapes are pleasing to the eye, and there are many to view throughout the course of the game. The coupling soundtrack is also decent, though the tunes do get repetitive and boring by the end of the time that you will be spending with the game. Especially when it comes to the song that always plays when Chad (your brother) is around. The written dialogue is also exceptional, although the fact that some form of dialogue has to appear every time you transition from one scene to another can get quite annoying.\n\nThere are dozens of objects to pick-up and interact with, many puzzles to solve, and a multitude of ways to die. The good thing about death in this game is that it isn't punishing at all, and starts you right back from where you left off on. No need to reload your save, or hope that you had saved recently. Goosebumps really has a minimal frustration level, which is great for casual players or those who are not too keen on point and click titles in general.\n\nThe biggest drawback to this game is the enormous price tag. At best, getting 100% achievement completion which requires you to find all items and die in every way possible, this game will last roughly 3 and a half hours. A single, full play through will run about an hour and a half. $21.99 CAD for 3.5 hours of play time is absolutely unacceptable, and deplorable. While most point and click titles do not make it over the 4 hour mark in general, they are typically listed around $10.99 CAD or lower. Whatever you do, do not shell out that kind of money for this game. Wait for a sale, or for it to appear in a bundle. I lucked up on Goosebumps: The Game for $2.00 in an Indie Gala bundle.\n\nAt a heavily reduced price, I do recommend this game for everyone around my age who grew up reading Goosebumps and watching the show on TV. It's an excellent throwback to when times were more simple, and scares came more easily. Now, I'm going to go dive into my weathered collection from the 90's.\n\nRating: 4.5/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","December 22, 2015","true","3.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I’ve gotten into almost half of the game in a debatably short amount of time. The length of the game is not much of a concern, if anything, I prefer a game that’s short and sweet, something that I could spend a consider amount of time to play before and after work.\n\nAlthough I’m not recommending this game, don't get me wrong, I like the game, it was decent. I still remember back in the old days when I was still in middle school, I would pick up one of those Goosebumps books and read them for an hour or two before heading back home. Even when I started high school, I would spend hours reading them in my school's library during lunch breaks.\n\nI've scrolled through the reviews, read a bunch of positive and then some negative reviews, but what got me to purchase the game was because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Now, I did not expect a horror experience from this, after I've scrolled through a couple of reviews and judging the game based on the provided trailer and screenshots, but what got me was the missing opportunity of mystery. The Goosebumps series has always been about the spirits and creatures of the unknown, it was the same aspect that got me hooked and proceeded to read one book after another, while this game seemed to be lacking.\n\nThis game gave me the feeling of cheering for Batman in The Dark Knight Rises, then getting to know what the Dent Act did to the prisoners that Bane freed. It was the same feeling that I've gotten from this game, that "oh" moment when I couldn't help but noticed that something was missing for a potentially better Goosebumps game.

It was really fun, it had the right atmosphere, and it referances the books rather often. Someone who grew up reading the books or those who enjoy point and click adventure games will probably enjoy this game a lot due to the game's feel. A few problems I have however are: It's too short of a game, some of the puzzles are rather cryptic and you wouldn't know the solution unless you think critically about it for a while, It's lack luster story (I have not yet seen the acompanying movie, so I don't know what context it gives this game), and finally it's price tag. This game is not worth $20. If it ever goes on sale for $12 or less I would advise checking it out. I had fun during the 5 hours of gameplay, but a lot of it was wandering around, picking up seemingly useless items, and stumbling onto puzzles taking a while to solve. With that in mind, I'd give this game a 7/10. Good, especially if you know the franchise, but not great.","October 20, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the puzzles aren't terribly hard, but a few are frustrating for various reasons. The graphics are cartoony, but can still be a bit eerie in line with the book series. The music can be a little bit more melancholy than spooky. There are lots of appearances from classic monsters, as well as some that must be a bit newer because I didn't recognize them. Plenty of fun achievements to get that will take a couple play throughs (I will have to go back and get them) It's not groundbreaking or anything but it does things pretty well and I think if you like Goosebumps whether you're 8 or 30, you should probably give this a try.","March 8","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It will take at least three playthroughs to get all the achievements, but it's totally worth it. I really enjoyed being taken back to the '90s when I would stay up late and scare myself to death, reading Goosebumps books. Now I get to scare myself to death by choosing to taste the sinister green goop, to touch the weird purple "taffy," or to drink a bottle of purple stuff.

Yes, part of it is the "Goosebumps Nostalgia"--but unlike when I rewatch the TV series or films now, and find myself semi-bored and unable to deal with the poor quality, this game holds up. (So far at least.) Art and graphic style is pleasing but also doesn't take you out of the feel of Goosebumps. I've run into plenty of identifiable objects/mysteries so far (though haven't solved or used a bunch of them... yet!). But if you're not familiar with them, I don't think you really lose much either.
