The  SURVIVED (i.e. You Win) screen  tells me I played for 114 minutes and died 433 times, but it honestly felt a lot longer than that.\n\nThis is one of those twitch/punishment platformers, though it's not exactly a platformer since you control a floating ball that can move about freely without worrying about gravity.  The goal is to make your way to the end of each of the levels without dying.  There are no checkpoints, and but the levels is pretty short.  Unlike other twitch platformers, you have a healthbar and most hazards will not kill you in one hit - being squished between moving walls/ is the common exception.  Your health also decreases over time, so it serves as an implicit time limit even in the relatively few levels which don't have a huge moving wall (or Boss) chasing you.  Boosting (i.e. "running") makes the health decrease much faster, so it's best used only when needed.\n\nEach level has collectible "krebs", and getting all of these greatly increases the challenge, but they are only useful for high scores and achievements.  After the first few levels, I stopped even trying collecting them all and focused instead on just surviving.\n\nThe game is HARD, and controls take a lot of getting used to.  The keyboard offers the most precise controls, but unfortunately a bug keeps you from being able to boost (speed up) while moving diagonally up-left, which makes a few levels impossible.  So yeah, that's definitely a minus.  But the rest of the game makes up for it in my opinion.   The gameplay, though frustrating, is still fun, I found the retro graphics quite nice, and the soundtrack is great.  After finishing it, I spent some time going back to a few levels to unlock some achievements, and see myself coming back over time to unlock more.","September 3, 2014","true","4.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's not that the controls are atrocious or impossible to master but rather the fact that the whole game revolves around avoiding monsters and obstacles with the only option to speed up, if the controls are not well adjusted and feel bulky players will turn their heads from the game and never look back. If the controls are to stay as they are then the game should take a different approach and maybe have less envirenmental hazards, more ennemies and a way to fight back.\n\nSomething else that I personally find undesirable is the visual style. The graphics give the impression that they didn't put too much efforts into the character design and the monochromatic abuse just underline this lack of savoir faire. Some games can pull this kind of stunt admirably and end up being enjoyable and fun to play ("Don't Look Back" or "Today I Die" are but two exemples of this) but with Krunch it just force me to look twice at everything and I end up wondering "Why is my character's vision so impaired... is it because he's some kind of robot?" or "That message was important but it looked just like it was part of the environment... who wrote it?" and I have played the early games of yore on my pc junior and my atari 3600 and never have graphical limitation been excused for poor visuals and a great exemple of what i'm saying would be "Out Of This World" since the game was limited in term of graphics like you can't comprehend and they still managed to deliver something that you can fell conected to when you play it to a point that you actually want to finish the game. Krunch visuals combined with the poor controls just make me want to never play the game again.\n\nThe game developers are relatively new in the game making business so, if you're listening... Egoraptor youtube channel, go watch his SEQUELITIS videos. You might learn a thing or two.","October 16, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Shouldn't happen here, but I've always been one for both consistency and efficiency.\n\nGameplay: Krunch is one of those games which you can pretty much sum up all of the gameplay in a serntence. It's a game where you have full vertical and horizontal control of a sphere in which your objective is to get to the goal without dying. You also have a run button, but this should only be used sparingly or whenever you are confident in your current health, since "running" consumes HP. After a set point of HP loss, you can't run anymore, so you need to use it intelligently.\n\nIt's also rather difficult to talk about the levels without an initial comparison to Super Meat Boy, since the levels are pretty challenging and pretty short. While the game doesn't immediately show you initial times after you beat the levels, they are visible once you go to the level select screen, so it's not too much of a hassle. Also within these stages are Krebs, or what are basically coins that you can collect for additional score. They aren't necessary and are only there for the challenge, but I can appreciate it nonetheless. Regarding the challenge of the levels and also comparing it to Super Meat Boy, the game starts off at roughly Light World Hospital and ends up about halfway through Light World Hell. So basically, the game is challenging, but never to the point where you'll want to stop playing. Much like Super Meat Boy, there are plenty of obstacles within the four worlds and are generally used pretty creatively without ever really feeling cheap.\n\nOne of the things that a reviewer complained about in this game is the fact that once you run into a wall, you bounce off of it. I don't have a problem with that, as it encourages precision gameplay over reflexes. That's not to say that reflexes aren't useful, but the game does force you to play a little more carefully than you may expect. The only thing that I can kinda complain about is that the hitboxes sometimes felt a little finicky, specifically with the bombs. Other than that, pretty much every death in this game will be your fault. Just the way it should be.\n\nOverall, I can see a lot of both replay value and speedrunning potential for this game. Even for a normal person, it's a nice time killer. $10 may be a bit much given the fact that it can be beaten in an hour and a half, and I do somewhat agree (I picked this up in a Humble Bundle a while back), but on sale for something like $5 and I'd definitely say this game is worth the asking price. 8/10.\n\nStory: There really isn't much here, but the comic you do get with the Digital Collector's Edition is quite nice. Not worth reviewing.\n\nGraphics: A lot of effort has been put into this game, and it shows. The graphics style is basically if you take a Gameboy game and apply different color filters to it. The pixel art is great and has a great deal of detail, the boss design is great, and the game just looks all around great. In fact, my only gripe is that level names can be hard to read at times. That's really it. As far as the technical things go, the game launches in a 1280x720 splash screen and then fullsizes to your native resolution. You can play this game in windowed mode if you're into that sort of thing simply by pausing and pushing Y on your 360 controller (don't know the corresponding keyboard command, although I'd imagine Alt-Enter would work just fine). Overall, there was a lot of work put into the graphics for this game, and it's one of those games that just looks good irrespective of the visual style. 5/5.\n\nSound: Pretty much just music here, and I've gotta say that the music is pretty rad. A couple of standout tracks are the Boiler track (Ignition) and the last track of the soundtrack (ESCAPE). I'd give these a listen on Youtube beforehand to decide whether or not you'd be interested in giving the five dollars extra for it. I find it hard to say, since I once again got it in a Humble Bundle. However, irrespective of what version you get, the soundtrack is pretty good with more than a few pretty memorable tracks out of the bunch of 11. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/0/5/4; cumulative score of 8.5/10. A pretty rad game overall, although the price may be a bit steep for you. Just use your discretion, folks.","July 28, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The reason that "Super Meat Boy" (Krunch often getting compare to SMB) is so damn good is because the controls are incredibly presice. I can't say the same for Krunch. The control of your character is very, keyboard very, floaty. Your chatacter has too much weightlessness and momentum. making precise turning and timing way more difficult that they need to be. IE in SMB if you fked up it was your fault because you have such clear control over your character. Here not so much. Also SMB have very clear and obvious hitboxes on the traps which men't you could avoid them. Here the spining saw traps (that are circles) have square hit boxes so you can be quite clearly not touching them and get bounched back and killed for no good reason.
