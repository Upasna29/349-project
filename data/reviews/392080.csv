Keep in mind I am slightly bias as this game is both of my favorite gernes combined ( Space Exploration and RPG/some sandbox elements), but I am still fair and wont leave out any cons I experience as I proceed to play the game. =)\n\n\nShort Version  ;  Free form space sandbox with a semi-procedural universe and complete freedom to do whatever you'd like. There are unlimited enemies generated, and gameplay is enjoyable to the extent that it may quite literally provide endless hours of entertainment. There is space combat, mining etc\n\nRating: 8.7 / 10    Will be 9.5/10 if the dev's fix the bug that causes some crashes here and there.\n\nPro's and Cons\n\nPro's\n\n* The game is massive. Look at the map and scroll out, you'll be surprised at the potential this game has.\n\n* Research system that allows players to obtain blueprints and spend some resources to unlock new parts to use.\n\n* Challenging AI  ( The ai will take advantage of your weak spots, and out manuever you if possible. Especially the flanking fighters. )\n\n* Great soundtrack.   Sometimes I'll just explore new areas just to hear a new track.  ( btw, music is blusey with an outlaw vibe, perfect for exploring dangerous new areas and engaging in combat with tricky enemies that keep you on your toes.\n\n* Great combat system.  I love using 220mm cannons to disable vital parts of ships ( Like engines and weapons ) to then move in for the kill when a ship is vulnerable. There is a major strategy element involved with combat. For the love of god please do no just rush in towards a bigger ship and hope to win xD Flanking and dodging are key. ( and shields, that works too)\n\n* Not just a space game. You can walk around as a human player, mid combat, and repair damaged parts of your ship.. Put out raging fires before they suffocate you,.. Engage in combat with enemy crew and take their ship for yourself if you're successful... Explore your space station, or massive ships ( which are huge btw ).\n\n* Humor .. Lol.   The Dev's have a great sense of humor, and know just how to balance jokes with useful information. Don't skip Dialog =P\n\n* Great Visuals. Ships look great and the background nebula's/art have a really nice depth.\n\n(The edits below are after another 15 hours of gameplay from the original review)\n\n*EDIT*  - Some ships have a Mining bore. This allows players to mine asteroids via docking after launching the bore at one of the literally almost infinite asteroids within the game. You can also add a mining bore to custom designs of your own, I believe.\n\n*EDIT*  - You can farm ( literally place plants in a garden of sorts ) and watch as they accumulate worth over time. I don't know too much about this game mechanic, It may still be a work in progress, but I do know that you can stumble upon new planting items on asteroids that you mine on.\n\n\nI Could ramble on more but it's time for some cons\n\nCONS\n\n* Some bugs are prevalant in the game. One of these bugs can cause crashes once every hour or two of gameplay. Be sure to save frequently until this bug is fixed. ( watch the devlog incase the Dev's fix this and I forget to update my review) The other bugs are minor and is exactly what you'd expect from an Early Access Game.    ( Ex: fall out of your ship but still be alive without the graphic of your player ) Stuff like that.   =)\n\n* Could use more items to build with at start. (Such as having Hallways and Corridors / the basic building blocks of a ship unlocked ) as well as maybe a tutorial on building ships. ( Could also use some smaller structural pieces but i'm not too experienced with the ship builder just yet. )\n\n^^^^^ * EDIT * A Dev has mentioned they are planning on overhauling the research system eventually so that progress will be more streamlined and natural.\n\n* Slight Delay when traveling at warp speed and entering a new section of the universe. The game universe is seamlessly connected but I think when enemies are spawned around your section of the universe, they freeze the game for a second or two. A very minor annoyance at worse.\n\n*Game can be punishing to people who are careless. This can be taken as either a pro or con depending on a person, but the difficulty of the gameplay is entirely dependant upon the player and where they choose to go.\n\nConclusion and a Story/Glimpse of gameplay.\n\nCONCLUSION: I was first introduced to this game 2 days ago and now have 15 hours.  *  EDIT*   (I now have around 28 hours of gameplay only a few days later, and I do not afk to gain hours. Still enjoying the game very much. ) I have a job and work 6-9 hours a day. To have 15 hours already tells you that this game delivers pretty well. There are some bugs in this game, but surprisingly not too many compared to many other early access games. This game is worth the money IF you know you like the space sandbox and combat / space exploration gerne. This game is perfect for the many of us out there that like the abstract feeling of being adrift in space, space combat with some elements of realism to it, and those of us with creative minds whom like to build and experiment with designs. This game has an extreme amount of potential, and I for one would very much like to see it reach it's peak.\n\nI say give the game a chance if you are considering it. I know I wasn't disappointed.\n\nNow for a little story that shows a little piece of this very big game.\n\nI once captured a ship four times in size compared to my own, and the excitement was exhilarating. I took out its manuvering engines and flanked from the left until I punched a hole in the ship that leaked oxygen, which in turn, nullified the crew inside. I have armor which provided o2 so I could breathe in the newly vacant ship. I proceeded to patch up the holes and repair what I could of the ships turning thrusters so that warp speed would be a bit easier to travel in. As I made my way back to my space station, I was attacked by some friendly neighborhood pirates ( We pirates attack our own sometimes ) So, fighting for both my dear crew's lives, as well as this behemoth of a ship ( relative to what I was flying, I bet there are ships 4 times larger than this ship as well, lol.) I managed to fend off the attackers and warp out of there. On my way back, I grazed an asteroid and lost a part of the ship.. I left the pilot seat and ran over to the gaping hole in my prized ship.. I was filled with regret for being clumsey enough to run into a stationary hulk of rock.\n\nI repaired what I could ( Thank god my suit had oxygen attributes, I would have suffocated otherwise.) and somehow managed to very slowly make my way back to my home station. After I repaired the ship and scrapped/researched it, I was able to eventually create one in my home base and retrofit it more to my liking. I now prowl known space as a king.. but something tells me I am but a pawn compared to whats really out there =P\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This is literally what you will experience quite often. At the original time I've reviewed this game, I only had 15 hours. Now That I have closer to 28 hours, I have seen new game mechanics. The combat does not get boring, infact, I believe the more one has progressed in the game, the better the combat will be considering bigger / higher tech ships (which at this point, you're able to customize to even deeper depth) have more options to utilize as they engage ever more powerful enemies.\n\n\nI have many, many games in my steam library. Of those near 100, I have chosen to review only 6-7 games. This game is obviously one of them.   I decided to review the game on my own behalf; I have not even had a discussion with a developer and it was my choice entirely to review the game to this extent. Just wanted to make that clear =P","February 13","true","34.8"," 56 of 63 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","56","63","5","0"

FEB 2016\n\nShip combat is really fun. Initially you are shooting blindly at enemy hoping to hit and do some damage. Over time you learn how to properly lead based  on your weapon and you will know where to hit to take out ship systems (reactors, engines, manuevering thrusters...). Cannons are reliable for close quarters combat, rockets are great for long range skirmishes (my favourite part). Missile tubes are really strong, easily disabling smaller ships in few hits. Beam weapons are still WIP, but are present in the game.\n\nShip designing is great, its complex but not difficult. You have put on lot of engines, fine now you need some reactors, now it flies forward but doesnt turn, slap on some thrusters. Dont forget to forget them to connect them to reactors (drawing little paths from power conduits is equivalent to high tech cable management :) ). The reactors will blow up easily without some armor. Now its good, but its not flying well, ah.. i forgot reactor cooling....\nAnd then you add bridge, corridors, weapons and dont forget cargo space to hoard your loot somewhere.\n\nCons:\nOccasional crash\nGameplay content is limited\nAI is in its early stages (ship combat AI works well)\nSimplistic infantry combat (for my taste)\n\nPeople who like this game should suggest to the devs various missions and events which would happen in the world, because the game is currently lacking them (except the tutorial).\nI would like to see improvements in the world desing: Station dwellers could do some meaningful tasks around stations, ships could come and go from and to stations. Ships in the world could have their destinations and tasks.\n\nThis game has big potential, hopefully the development will go well.","February 15","true","30.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","21","23","2","1"

You can cut an enemy ship in half and it will be forced to fight like that. You can also learn weak points in the designs and aim directly on the bridge for a quick kill, or you can aim at the engines, board the enemy and take his ship with you.\n\nUnfortunately...\nIt's hard to recommend as there's not enough content yet, there's a few bugs and crashes are being reported. Price tag doesn't help either.\nUnless you are REALLY into space games or supporting the development of a open-world action FTL inspired game, it's better to watchlist the game for now to prevent disappointment.","February 12","true","12.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

Although the game is obviously incomplete, I've already spent over 100 hours playing, according to steam.\n\nPro's:\nExcelllant ship customization.  You start with a basic template of a ship you've aquired by either starting with it, or capturing it.  You then swap out components, reroute wiring, place power supplies and capacitors, hallways, airlocks, rooms, special modules, etc.  The customization is pretty much endless. This is by far where I've spent the most time in the game, trying to squeeze in one more turret or optimize the power flow.\n\nLarge Map: Currently the vast majority of the map appears to only contain asteroids and empty space, but zooming out, you can see that there is a vast galaxy to be populated as the game becomes more complete.\n\nGood ship to ship combat:  Able to board enemy ships and stations and wipe out their crew via a bit of gun play. Knowing the enemy ship types matters in a fight and will help you find weak spots to concentrate your fire on. The biggest guns don't always win a fight, though it sure helps.  You can out maneuver, and disable bigger ships with some skill and knowledge.  This is where your ship customization skills really show.\n\nForgiving death mechanic:  Well, you get cloned every time you die and start back at your base station. Not a big deal since you only lose the ship you were in at the time and any cargo in the hold.  The game appears to expect you to die often.\n\nMining: You can mine asteroids with the right equipment.\n\nPsycho robot advisor.\n\nCons:\nNot a finished game. The game is playable, but what content they have is a bit repetative. The basic game play is solid, just not much to do except kill ships, design ships, capture ships, hunt for blueprints.\n\nResearch:  The research kind of ticks me off.  A large portion of the fun in this game is designing your ship. The only problem is that you have to find blueprints for every peice of hallway, doorway, etc. before you can remove or install it on a ship. You will end up with half baked ship designs because you couldn't remove half of the hallway or door tiles somewhere in the middle of a ship.  After over 100 hours, I still haven't found half of the components, so I can never fully redesign any ship template.\n\nBugs: There are a few annoying bugs, but nothing I wouldn't expect from an early access game.\n\n","April 9","true","272.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Is it possible to encounter a game breaker or even a corrupted save???\nAlready answered that one it's Early Acces an no different form most EA...\n\nI'm on win 10 good gfx card and a nice 24 g ram and on my system the game works mostly flawlessly, yes I had some minor crash, had a save file corrupted too, but I played for almost 8 hours straight (looking through the forums I know Devs are already investigating and they seems very present in the forums answering questions etc)\n\nNow the goods!\n\nThe ships are nice and original to me, I wish I knew a bit more about the ship editor connecting things and all seems pretty unfriendly, but at the same time it gives you the posibility to redo completely or even partially the inside layout of your ships, with huge amount of details like you need something for air ,electricity, docking or even just move your cockpit in the middle section of your ship so its safe from getting wrecked.. things like that\n\nI like the fighting , you can shoot every component on the enemy ships example you blow the air generator they will have to repair it in the heat of battle or suffocate to death, best part if it's a lone pilot he won"t be able to fight back if he have to repair something important, or ultimatley, you can board their ships, just watch out somethimes they won't let you get away with it :P\n\nI really enjoy the ships fight as I like fighting on foot, both feel good and responsive, it's pretty nice to be able to gear your characters a bit rpg style.\n\nGFX are what you can expect nowdays, space backround,  planets and such are nice, Lots of ships that looks cool and are very different one from another even the shapes suprised me, and the amount of things to make it work inside its so awesome, you can interact with those parts like repair them ect and the process, although slow, is very nice, or they can catch on fire etc..\n\nMY CONCLUSION: Right now you have to be very in that kind of game to enjoy it, Starting can be hard, I got grinded by about everything at first instead of me grinding. Once you know the qwerks it's pretty enjoyable.\n\nI saw some complaint about having nothing to do in the game, well right now you have endless ships fight, endless boarding (ships and station) ya it can get repetitive fast for some but I must be part of those who like grinding ^^\n\nI have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of EA that I ain't sure about, this one just can't fail to my opinion the core to awesomeness is there!","February 15","true","41.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

In fact, this review is more like "Positive - In the way I really like this Early Access game" review. I'll provide what the game currently offers in its state, my opinions in various points here and there, and the "Negative" do not recommend conclusion.\n\nLet's begin.\n\nSo what does the game have currently?\n\nWell previous reviewers have stated the same thing over and over so I'll reillterate and do the same with a bit of addition.\n\nShip vs Ship firefights\nBoarding Mecahnics\nClose Quarters Combat\nSmall guns\nBig guns\nVery Big Guns\nLasers\nCrashing into Asteroids at Mach 20\nBugs as in Alien Bugs\nBugs as in Game Bugs\nExplosions\nUnique Ship Design System\nGetting Spaced\nSeeing people get Spaced\nFalling into Space\nSuffocating\nSeeing others suffocate\nSpace Stations with bugs\nSpace Stations with people\nSpace Stations without people or bugs\nMining\nMarv the Bipolar Psychotic Serial Killer\nInsulting AI\nFarming\nMassive Universe\nScreaming\nDying\nAnd Crying\nAnd more\nSo - What is the "Negative" part?\n\nThe price mostly.\n\nThis is mainly, or rather, the only reason why I will put it as a "Negative" Review. $30 is a very daring, and if I may say respectully, an idiotic manuver for an Early Access game. It is very overpriced and it screams "Stay Away!" price. Now don't get me wrong - there are various Early Access games that are far overpriced for the quality they currently are in, but also there are Early Access Games who's quality is justified to the price tag they have on them. Games such as "Kerbal Space Program," which is quite successful and started out with an $11 Early Access price, but also "Naval Action" who started off with a $40 price.\n\nI'm not saying that WTF: Zero Falls quality sucks donkey balls, but I'm saying that the price it has is not an appealing price for a lot of people - even when it's on sale. It's a unique game that brings new and fresh mechanics to the table. However it is only being developed by Three People.\n\nThey even stated this and I quote Originally posted by Developers: This is not a "get the game for less money because it sucks" sort of deal, it is a "I think these guys deserve to feed themselves while developing their game" sort of deal, and we appreciate your support.”\nWhich it brings to remind ones-self that Developers are human too with human needs. However this also reminds that this game is unfinished and needs proper and refined reports and suggestions to bring out the potential that this unique game has.\n\nWhich, somehow I would anticipate, the $30 price would warn individuals who are just here to play the game to stay away for now and draw individuals in willing to take the dive and aid in developing a game to its full potential.\n\nWhich is the reason why I place this review as a DO NOT RECOMMEND to buy. It is not recommended to buy this game if you're just willing to play it like its a full game, because its not.\n\nLet me just underline that for you.\n\nIt is not recommended to buy this game if you're just willing to play it like its a full game, because its not.\n\nThere has been many reviews plauging potential games such as this with reviews aimed like its a full game. Stupid reviewers. Ya'll should be stoned. And spaced.\n\nSo let me just say that again so I won't get misquoted - I do not recommend this game if you're just gonna play it without aiding developers. Get the game ONLY if you're gonna play the game AND faithfully assist in AIDING developers to develop a game that You and the Developer want. That is the whole point of an Early Access.\n\nBut what do I know - I have 30 hours in and if I may just brag I already have more hours than 90% of the reviewers here.\n\nThat is the end of my review and I'll update it down the line if something happens. Like the universe explodes or something.","February 17","false","32.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","2"

Good gameplay, frequent updates, and lots of loot and explosions, and death. As well as a persistent character inventory. Aka keep what you're holding on death, lose everything else in your ship if you casn't get back onto it.\n\nThis review won't be taken seriously since I have almost no steam-time logged. That doesn't mean don't read it as I have played for years.\n\n[Edit No, steam kets have not gone out to people who have bought from the online store. Just be patient and you'll get yours]\n\nBias Disclaimer: I have been playing this game for like 2 years, when the original "Wayward Terran Frontier" was nothing more than a ship editor, and only like 300 people in the world (or possibly far less) even knew it existed. I have been in contact with the developer many times, and helped provide input that helped change the games development with the many other people providing bugs and such. I have also played this on my channel, and continue to, claiming to be "Youtubes number 1 place for Wayward Terran Frontier Content", because to date I have played it the most out of anyone who is covering it on youtube. This is not a plug, it's part of the disclaimer bias. I am biased. I love this game. The copy is my own, I bought this game a long time ago, and was part of the Zero Falls kickstarter for whatever little I could offer. I was not paid in any way, nor will i ever be. Onto the actual review.\n\n\nWayward Terran Frontier, now known with an additonal Zero Falls, has come a long way. From constant crashes, and saves that don't carry over, to being controlled by the AI faction and having to delete your own save files and restart. This early access review is for the steam launch. Version 0.3.3.14.\n\nWith the 3.3.14 launch, many many many of these issues that persisted over the last few major updates have been fixed. We'll get to that.\n\nWhat is Wayward Terran Frontier: Zero Falls? Other than a huge name i've come to enjoy quite a lot... It's a top-down space sandbox rpg.\n\nYou fly/ walk in 2 dimentions even though the game is rendered technically in 3, and play in a top-down perspective. Your only goal is to fly through the universe, fighting, mining and pillaging your way to loot. Lots of loot. From randomized stats on armor, clothes, nanite orbs, and other augmentations and most importantly... Blueprints.\n\nBlueprints spawn as items known as "Data Cores". Data cores can contain any kind of blueprint, or garbage, depending on it's tier pool it draws from when opening 1 of 3 different tiers of Data Cores. Data cores are the reason no 2 blueprints will spawn twice, because the game now realizes what you are opening, and remoiving that from the pool once learned (hopefully this system works even if you die before learning a blueprint, but AFTER discovering it).\n\nFeatures:\n\nBlueprints- Contain modules, rooms, ship weapons, improvements to ship weapons, and many more things. Find blueprints to unlock the different components to building the interior of ships.\n\nPlayer weapons - Rifles, SMGs, Machine Guns, Miniguns, etc. All with random stats. Explore the cosmos and kill for better loot, with a bit of luck.\n\nStations- Derelict stations to explore, raid, fight through, conquor. Currently no way to hack a station to make it usable for yourself. I know nothing of intended future features, so I'm just hopeful of this one someday.\n\nShips- Holy mother of pearl, there's lots of ships. You have 3 factions completely independent of you (no faction diplomacy or anything). I think they're civilian, military, and pirate. Ships can fly around in convoys protecting supply ships, some ships are neutral until provoked, most ships are immediately hostile - and ALL ships can be docked with, assuming you havent destroyed their air lock/ docking bay.\n\nSpeaking of ships, you can repair in the game, and if you repair a ship you fought and fly it back to your station, it can be reverse engineered to be built and modified for yourself, assuming your station reactor has enough energy to spawn it in. Every ship can be captured, and engineered for yourself. All of them. Some take far more skill than others.\n\nThe game can be punishing, whether it's because of some of the more... Quirky early access bugs, or because you don't have the knowledge of ship layouts to know where to strike them to disarm them or whatever. But if you trudge through it and take the time to learn as you play, the game is seriously rewarding. Editing existing ship designs to your liking through researching components/ weapons, and taking on ships that used to give you trouble with a little more knowledge and winning is such a nice feelings.\n\nOh, and did I mention asteroids? Those buggers will pop out at you in the middle of Travel Drive, and you'll be space toast. The burnt kind that smells like smoking metal, except there's no air in space and you're dead. This is a good thing. They're stationary, btw.\n\nMining- There IS a mining system, if you get a ship with a mining drill you can launch it at an asteroid and dock with it, allowing you to mine the inside of the rock like walking around a ship (you can't mine ships). This can give you means of expanding your farms, and growing crystals that can be thrown in the furnace for mass (the in-game currency), as well as finding ores which equal a LOT of mass when thrown int eh furnace. You also get mass from looting ships and stations in the form of 'Scrap'.\n\nIdk what else I should say. This is whats in the game, with a side of sass because I personally enjoy it. Is the price steep? Sure, to some people I guess. The game is worth $29.99 USD, and george has gone on record to say that the game will be on various sales many times during development.\n\nWhether you pick it up, or you follow the games development and get it down the road, it's super worth your time. And it only gets better as days pass. The small dev team updates the game once a month on average, if not sooner than that. They're also frequently patching bugs and letting you in on the development process, and frustrations.\n\nCons-\n\nThe only cons in my opinion are the bugs that comne with early access and the inconstancy of when the saves break. BUT supposedly this has been mostly fixed with the current steam version, because they wanted some persistance in their save files for steam. I do NOT have the time to play this at the time of writing the review, so I can't say with certanty that the issues are fixed. However my previous version successfully converted, and I can play the same file since the release, which is a good sign.\n\n9/10 becuase I'm a critic.\n10/10 because this small indie team is proving remarkable, compared to my many previous early access purchases.","February 11","true","46.4"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","6"

A game about flying a ship in space, looting others, Finding bigger and badder ships to take over, or smaller ones if you prefer. When looting there is a chance you will come across researchables to build up your ship. you can’t remove corridors or ship pieces right away, you have to find these while looting first, research it, then you can place an remove all your ship pieces. However once you have researched enough ship pieces, you can customize your ship anyway you want.\n\nYou will die, there is no avoiding it. But how often you die is determined by how skilled your weaponry and piloting are. There is also going into other space stations on foot and attacking aliens, the storages, and bringing home the goods. I wished there were a faster speed when walking around however.\n\nYou can fly your ship, or you can go inside the ships interior and walk around. When your ship is damaged, parts are destroyed and you have to repair them. Sometimes you can’t reach area to repair things, so it’s important to build your ship strategically so you can reach areas that will need repairing.\n","February 18","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has some rough edges, like any indie dev game can but also it has brilliance.  The very sort of brilliance you can't find in AAA titles because no committee will ever agree upon things that are controversial.\n\nWhile I wil admit there are some design choices I strongly dislike and that I think will inhibit the game's ultimate success, these are details and not reflective of the systems in the gameplay.\n\nSpecifically first the game forces a save on death, which is problematic since there are a lot of ways to 'die' that feel arbitrary or are the result of bugs or a lack of indicators - such as a lack of oxygen on the player's ship while flying, or walking over nearly-invisible damage on a ship's tiles, or just randomly dying while going through an airlock.\n\nNow add to this, the numerous legitimate ways to die including taking on something tougher than you are or running into rocks and you have a lot of sudden deaths.\n\nCombine that with the lack of any remote places to respawn, and it ends up being a 'fly back to the spot' simulator at times, which is super not fun.\n\nSecondly, the way loot is generated is awkward.  You can loot 'blueprints' for ship parts, however these blueprints aren't final until you 'reveal' them, and at that point they can randomly be useful, or junk.  If they are junk, you can alt-f4 and reload the game and try again until you get a result that is non-junk.  I don't know about you, but knowing this I am forced to save scum, and I find this method extremely unsatisfying.    I'd prefer less loot and have it all be real, personally.\n\nThat aside the engineering parts of the game are great.  Designing ships is a lot of fun, and using your own designs in combat is a nice experience.  There are a lot of emergent systems that reward careful and intelligent design.\n\nThe price is a touch high for the amount of content available, but the game was worth it to me because I've wanted to play a game like this for a while.\n\nI have to admit, though the devs repeatedly deny it - I still hold out hope for multiplayer, and most certainly more crew options for the player.\n\nAll that said, if you are an engineer like myself, this game is a strong recommendation.","February 23","true","146.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

It's very reminiscent of FTL, just with less features in its current form. Don't even get me started on Marv...

Encounters never go past finding a ship that will shoot at you. zombies will never infest on your ship no one ever boards, and crew will never get bigger then 1 person who does nothing.\n\nI would recomend but the game doesn't offer enough for its price and the devs cant be trusted they've failed a kickstarter this game is literally the remnents from a game that will never be completed..... which makes me wonder will this game end the same way, (will be forgotten and never leave alpha)\n\nP.S. the game this is from was supose to be multiplayer but was ditched this is the same game but was promised no multiplayer .........\n\nDon't waste more then 15$ on this game only buy if on steam sale for 15$ or less its not worth it\n\nHonestly even for an early access game this crashes WAY TO MUCH the overhead is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n9/10 you will blow up because of an insta kill roid and there are ♥♥♥♥♥ lots only way to find the damn things is to zoom out and even still there are tiny roids that you will never see when you are zoomed out.\n\nWay to many bugs that break the bug, game save doesn't function all the time there are times when the game will not save forcing you to save twice and pray you dont click save and quit.\n\nUntil bugs and constant crashes are fixed im going to say no, and unless this game goes multiplayer it will never be worth 20$ let alone 30$ the current content in game x3 isn't worth 20$ let alone 30$\n\n\n\nPros\n- game play "reminds me of FTL on its first release with the added free roam"\n- Exploration and game progression is great " not for the faint of heart though"\n- Great radar system "could use a bit of touching up hard to see small asteroids\nwhich is my only problem with that"\n- The combat system is amazing "Its what gives me the FTL feel with for freedom"\n- The ship customization is great "still feels like something is missing for it"\n\nCons\n- Can't revisit any tutorials\n- Game crashes way too often even for EA "Early Access"\n- The galaxy has many stations that remain empty and serve no purpose.\n- The stations offer no trade system would be nice.\n- The game starts to feel very empty after a few hours of game time.\n- There are no audio cues when you start losing oxygen, burning alive, or being attacked in general.\n- The grinding is a real and tidious thing. The worst part is when you crash before being able to save the game after awhile of gameplay.\n- The game currently and will probably be the ame after its done is way WAY too over priced $30 :/\n- The A.I. now this is a big one their is one crew member who just sorta chills around and doesn't do anything\n- Lastly the game save function, there are times when the game will crash as you save/load the game. It gets old very fast.","February 19","false","56.6"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","18"

The refund button still works.\n\nCrashes at almost every screen change. Didn't start off this bad, it has gotten worse. The game is unplayable at the moment. I would wait until it can actuallyt remain stable for periods exceeding 20 minutes.\n\nI know, I know early access......it is just your access, while early, is limited to spurts of 20 minutes.\n\nCheck out the forums, on the first page of this game are ALWAYS at least 3 threads about random crashing. Have yet to see a dev respond to the fact that the game crashes at random times. Reinstall, reinstall DX, Reinstall whatever you like.....many have.....it isn't YOUR system it is their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nUpdate: Now it won't even resume game or start a new one without crashing immediately. I read on forums where people have uninstalled EVERYTHING and reinstalled....and still not working for some people. For others like the sycophant smart ♥♥♥ below it seems to be working fine. I see this pimple in the threads telling everyone it is their system....likely it is but the cause is still unknown.....it could be that all of these people have SOMETHING that is a conflict that should not be installed on their machines.\n\nAgain no dev contact. Save yourself the money and hassle and pass on this one.","February 14","false","2.0"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","6","19","0","3"
