Devs seems to be very responsive and eventually we will have a game with fully PC capabilities, but for now you will have some weird things like tutorial referring to drawing your fingers or tapping buttons.\n2- This is a very puzzle oriented RPG. If you are not good at puzzles or donÂ´t find them funny -as is my case- do not buy this game. The puzzles in 7 Mages are more about experimenting and looking carefully -as in classic adventure games-  than resolving geometrical riddles or having good timing and reflexes, like LoG.\n\n-Apart from this, you have a classical grid-based RPG with turn based combat. The combat has some innovative approach: you can split your team and distribute each mage tactically on different squares.\n-All your 7 characters are Mages but this does not mean that they can not use a sword.\n-Another good novelty is that you can directly move from the map to another square previously visited and not blocked.\n-Beautiful graphics, better, to my tastes, than most grid based RPGs like LoG or M&M X.\n\nTo conclude, an eye-candy decent grid based RPG, very puzzle oriented, responsive devs and a lot of fixes pending.\nIf you like old school RPGs with turn based combat and grid based movement, I would try instead The Quest.\n\nNB:\nSorry for my english. But, when the game is very niche, reviews in other languages than English are almost useless.\n","March 18","true","6.2"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","0"

There hasn't been a game quite like this in many years - since Wizardry 8 or maybe even David Bradley's last masterpiece Wizards&Warriors. And the good news is that 7 Mages lives up to its pedigree, featuring great level design with creative puzzles and interesting combat encounters. Despite being a mobile port the game is perfectly playable on PC even in its current state, and doesn't require too much tweaking to make it feel like a native PC title.\n\nSome assorted impressions:\n- Even though it's been optimized for mobiles, the game is beautiful - the art direction is top notch and each location feels very unique and atmospheric. It's already miles ahead of Might&Magic X in that department, and with all the graphical enhancements the PC version will eventually get it will rival Legend of Grimrock 2, and maybe even surpass it.\n- The perspective doesn't change in combat, but in structure the game is closer to Goldbox games or Realms of Arkania than pure first-person RPGs like Wizardry. In combat each character is a separate entity, with their own action points pool and initiative rating. You can split the party out of combat too, and sometimes have to do so to solve certain puzzles.\n- Speaking of puzzles, 7 Mages is extremely puzzle-heavy. If you hate puzzles in RPGs, this isn't the game for you. In its puzzle density it's close to Legend of Grimrock, but the approach to puzzle design is very different. Unlike Grimrock, where every puzzle is built from the same building blocks, in 7 Mages each dungeon features its own set of unique puzzle mechanics, and many of them are inventory-based like in Adventure games.\n- Level design also influences combat mechanics: in one dungeon you can't wear armor, in another one you can't rest and have to keep your characters grouped together, yet another starts your party scattered around the levels etc. Enemies are also fairly varied and able to stun or poison you, summon help or avoid ranged attacks etc. My only gripes with combat is that each dungeon only features two enemy types (with one exception) and most of the time they are much fewer in numbers than your party.\n- The game is very old-school in that there is no hand-holding. Don't expect quest compasses or NPCs helpfully giving out directions and puzzle hints. The game is also not afraid to let you screw up in various ways. Got locked in a dungeon level with no food? Well, tough luck, unlike Grimrock you don't find it lying around in the dungeon.\n- You generally don't find a lot of things lying around in dungeons, most of loot comes from enemies and it's mostly only good for selling in the town. But you can't carry out too much, the inventory is extremely limited. Initially you only get a handful of slots, ater you can buy bags and chests that expand that space. Moreover, potions and food don't stack, and you always need space for quest items.\n- The in-game economy works quite well: even if your characters have good Charisma, the prices for good items are quite high and you never run out of money sinks.\n- Character system isn't terribly detailed, this isn't Wizardry. There are no races or classes, you get four main stats (improved on level-ups) and skills for each weapon type/magic school/musical instrument (improved with use). On the other hand, there is quite a bit of depth behind this simplicity. There are no dump stats and almost all kinds of builds could work if you know what you're doing. If you don't, however, it's quite easy to make your character severely underpowered.\n- In the first half of the game the world is quite open, you can visit many areas right off the bat - provided you can survive them. The second half is strictly linear. There aren't any sidequests, but spells are often hidden off the main path, behind a difficult battle or puzzle.\n- The starting town is fairly large but most of the buildings and NPCs are just props, you can't enter/talk to them. Most of the dialogs boil down to clicking the only availible options, when there are more it usually involves some sort of service (training etc) - but, well, it's a dungeon crawler, they aren't exactly known for deep dialogs. Some options are locked behind Charisma checks, others require having a certain character in your party.\n- The dialog part brings out my main gripe with the game: the English translation is terrible, I do hope it gets redone for the final PC release. As is Russian one, but Russian game writing is always terrible, so there's no surprise in that. German one seems to fine however.\n\nBottom line: if you liked Grimrock titles, or older dungeon crawlers like Wizardry 6-8, or RPG/Adventure hybrids like Quest for Glory series, chances are you'll love 7 Mages. If you think that the main purpose of an RPG is to tell a story, you should stick to Bioware titles and JRPGs.","March 19","true","26.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

This game definitely takes a thing or two from its older brother and improves the features for the current gaming community. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n+ Wonderful graphics\n+ Combat system\n+ Interaction with the environment\n+ Thoughtful puzzles\n+ Character progression\n+ Great soundtrack (instruments required!)\n\nOne thing I really like about 7 Mages is the freedom of your character progressionWhile you only get to create your own avatar and the remaining 6 party members come with pre-defined statistics, there are options to remodel them to a different path in a timely fashion. For example, you can make your 7 Mages into Strength-heavy armored melee-only group and actually make it work. Or a no-weapon only caster group. And either path can complete the game.\n\nAnother great addition for me was the introduction of music as a form of combatYou can equip your characters with actual instruments and use them at any point during your gameplay to gain various benefits like healing or mana regeneration, useful buffs like speed or extra XP gain and the game even lets you manipulate your enemies, for example there's a song that will make enemies afraid to walk into melee range, another song will make you always go first in the turn-based combat.\nCombined with the different elemental spells and weapons, it brings lots of variation and offers the player a multitude of choices on how to play the game, as well as providing great grounds for replayability with self-imposed rules for hardcore players\nAlso the music that your characters actually play is really nice and the more instruments you put into a song, the better it sounds.\n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles is well balancedThere are buttons, levers, trapdoors, teleports but also not so general stuff like making a temporary bridge out of lily pads to cross a swamp or redirecting the flow of the wind with statues to prevent it pushing you down from a mountain ledge. There is also a lot of interaction between stuff, like using a shield to redirect a beam of light or shooting a cannon to remove a thunderstorm. If you get stuck, there's a spell that gives you hints. I got stuck only twice on puzzles during my playthrough, first time I missed a teleport hidden inside a destroyable tree and second time I kept going in circles inside a teleport labyrinth, but after I drew a map I was able to make it work. And if you really get stuck after the hints, there's always the option to ask others for help.\n\nNow for some negatives.\n\n7 Mages lacks in the story departmentDon't get me wrong, the story is decent, but compared to Gates of Skeldal, the dialogues are very straightforward, there is usually no choice in a story-related dialogue. Also there are no out-of-story moments, no sidequests and no ability to chat with random NPCs or between party members. For example, Gates of Skeldal had the option to talk with the Librarian or the Priest in town to gain some insight into the game lore and even these unimportant NPC conversations had dialogue options with consequences (angering the Priest by insulting his gods). You also had option to refuse party members as you go, which is not possible here. Considering that the 7 Mages are random people who grouped together for a common goal, some witty or sharp-tongued dialogues between them could be fun and I would definitely welcome those. I believe that's a missed opportunity in 7 Mages.\n\nAt times, the dialogues are weird..well, if you consider the emoticon of a Fireball between sentences weird. Smilies are also included in the main storyline dialogues and to top it off, some lines didn't even make much sense and you have to consult your Log book to make more sense of it. I played the game in Czech as well as switching into English and it seems the translation is not at fault. Luckily, these will only affect your immersion, but not the actual gameplay.\n\nThe combat is easyThe difficulty of combat is rather easy (I played the highest difficulty, mind you). I often ran into situations where the enemy couldn't deal a single point of damage to me. The game gives you a sort-of combat check in the form of a Troll quite early on (can be seen in the video on Steam store). If you can deal with the Troll without looking at guides, you will probably be able to handle any combat situation in the game. Luckily, the change of pace between combat and puzzles alleviates this issue.\n\n----------\n\nA final note about the controls - it might feel a little clunky due to the fact that Early Access version is a mobile port, therefore some actions require you to hold your mouse button pushed and involve some portrait juggling for party management, but those issues will be gone when a full PC version comes out.\n\nAll in all, I will definitely recommend the game to anyone who likes dungeon crawling, puzzles or turn-based combat. Buy it and enjoy it, it's worth the money. Plus, you get a full fledged PC version later when it comes out.","March 20","true","34.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/446590/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n7 Mages is Napoleon Games debut game on Steam. Itâs an old school dungeon crawler that was first released for mobile devices but fans of the game took such a liking to it that they literally demanded that the developers port the game over and onto PC and thus we have arrived at the early access. Napoleon Games was founded way back in 1994 and is based in the Czech Republic. They currently have two other games on iOS and Android in The Gates of Skeldal and Fish Odyssey which appears to be a basic type of runner or lane racing game.\n\nItâs going to be more than a little difficult for people not to make comparisons to Legends of Grimrock given that the two games look so similar in appearance. However, donât let that be considered a disappointment as the game looks like it could be very promising. Itâs not without its faults but those faults are somewhat acceptable given that the title just entered early access and I believe that the developers are working hard to improve the game and to have it realize its potential.\n\nWhenever a developer states in their description that the game was originally developed for mobile I worry that either the port is poor or that not all of the mobile interface has been removed from the game. In this case, the port thus far the game runs smoothly and I have no qualms in that respect but the devs really do need to replace the mobile interface especially throughout the gameâs tutorial. I have not played the mobile version of the game but I imagine that the majority â if not all â of the commands havenât been stripped out or modified yet. There are still commands telling you to swipe down on your screen, etc. While yes there are touchscreen monitors theyâre not common enough that a game would have dedicated commands for them that override regular keyboard and mouse commands. Some of these commands do not have keyboard equivalent commands â or at least I have yet to find them â such as crouch.\n\nA continuation of this is that there arenât any quick key bindings for things such as âmâ to bring up the map or âiâ to bring up the inventory. To enter these you have to click on the on screen button. A further problem is that some of the interface isnât always readily on the screen likely to avoid clutter on the mobile version of the game. One of these things is the spell menu. While an interface similar to the ones used in RPGs would be perfect for PC the game currently lacks this interface.  This is more than a mild annoyance given how much mobile stuff remains in the game and I believe should have been easily enough to add to the game before releasing the early access game onto Steam but I imagine â and hope â that it will come in time. It truly is holding the game back on PC.\n\nI would argue that the tutorial either doesnât teach you enough or that the interface shouldnât be completely revealed the moment you enter gameplay. For example, there is a lot of space for spells that probably doesnât need to be there as it can be more than a little confusing for a beginning player. Little improvements and thoughts along those lines would do wonders for the gameâs accessibility.\n\nThere are a couple of minor translation issues but nothing that isnât able to be overlooked. The strengths of the game are already visible and they truly are the most important components of the game because what I have discovered to be its weaknesses are things that can all be vastly improved throughout the gameâs development. For now I quite enjoyed the art work â the visuals are quite reasonable for a game of this genre and really do aide the immersion of the game. It is clear that the developers have an understanding of the art of storytelling. What there is of story keeps you wanting to play further into the game although apparently â Iâve never played it â it isnât as developed as the Gates of Skeldal. Iâm also a big fan of the combat system. Although fights are fairly straight forward and simple â to the point that Iâve played â the implementation of music (think something along the lines of Bardâs Tale) into the combat system is well executed. I would like the game to be a little more difficult but that may also come in time. Finally, I would be remiss if I didnât state that I found the puzzles also to be very well rounded and the execution intelligent in design.\n\nThereâs a lot to like here. Itâs going to be a beauty when itâs completed and I hope that aside from making the interface and key changes that they do fully flesh out the story. Iâd also advise to improve the translation and to smarten up the writing. The use of emoticons and a more professional translation would work wonders for the development of the game. But I imagine that when 7 Mages is released out of early access that it has a chance to be among the very best dungeon crawlers on Steam. A firm recommendation for fans of the genre.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 26","true","2.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Even though this game is a ported version of the mobile version of the game, the developers at least have made some changes to the game and have added some more features to make this version on Steam worth buying.\n\nGameplayThe 7 Mages is a nice and sort of unique kind of Dungeon Crawler RPG that requires skill and patients in order for you to succeed and win throughout each of your runs. The game focuses you being able to kill enemies, and move on with each of the rooms or areas in order to get to the excite trying to find the exit. It's a very old-school type of game, that hasn't really been made in this kind of way for a few years. The good thing about this game is that it lives up to what it actually is tagged as.\n\nThis game has a very interesting way of the way that you combat enemies, along with the level design and creative puzzles that are implemented into the game throughout every dungeon. The gameplay itself is fun and rather unique comparing this game with other type of dungeon crawlers that you seem now a days on steam, with it being in first person and have a turn-based combat system should make it stand out from other games of the similar genre. Although the game can come off as extremely difficult sometimes when yo play through it, it does seem that sometimes the difficulty curve does get too easy or too difficulty.\n\nA small flaw that I do have with the game is that it was ported from mobile version, although the developers have done a rather good job on making it compatible for PC even with the way that the game is now. The game does feel like it was intended for PC, just because of all the tweaks they had made from the mobile version of the game to make it better graphics and so on.\n\nSomething that is rather nice about 7 Mages is that you can create your own custom avatar, there are also 6 other party members which come with predefined statistics. There are some options in the game to remodel the other party members which you can do rather easily and quickly. For example, you can make your party into a no-weapon caster group and make it work out till the end, or maybe you prefer the strength heavy armored melee group that can also win.\n\nPros+ A good port from the mobile version\n+ Nice variety to make your party the way you want it to be\n+ Kind of unique and interesting gameplay\n+ Graphics are nice, have a sort of old-school sort of look to them\n\nCons- Ported over from mobile version\n- Can become too difficult really quickly\n\nResult / Final thoughts7 Mages is a very nice port over from the mobile version, although I still don't like the fact that it was ported over to steam doesn't mean I can't say that the game itself was ported nicely to fit the PC gameplay. The graphics of the enemies and players look nice, with a sort of old-school type of look to them which brings back nostalgia. The gameplay is interesting with a tun-based combat system, and although the game seems to rock between extremely difficult to sometimes too easy I still recommend this game.\n\nRating: 7.8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","April 28","true","3.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This game is not just difficult. It is an insane, sadistic creation of a person that has played too many dungeons and wants only the toughest challenge. I'm sure all the puzzles and game progression are obvious - but only to the author. The story "hints" are misleading and can lead you to a dead end. Inventory has just a few slots and characters get hungry every 5 minutes so you'd better pack all those slots full of food, or die of hunger. There is no party order - if you want a tank in front, you must split the party and move him one square ahead of the rest. While this is somewhat realistic, it is also extremely annoying and difficult to execute.Single wrong move gets you killed, both in and out of combat. I haven't used so many reload since Xcom. I gave up after 2 evenings of bashing my head against this monstrosity - honestly I don't have the time nor patience for such â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t anymore.","April 4","false","6.5"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","20","3","15","5","0"
