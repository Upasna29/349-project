You have access to the world map and an aircraft very early in the game, but the main story is linear and you can't skip or break the story progression. The world map has optional dungeons that have varying enemy difficulties and some unique loot. It would have been awesome to allow the player to customise the party according to the dungeons inhabitants, but you are stuck with certain party members. The main downside to the openworld style is the progression of equipment. For most RPGs you'll travel along a set path of towns and it is customary for each to have the next tier of equipment. When you can go anywhere from the start it is a bit more difficult and equipment will became available in shops as the story progresses. There is no indication on when the new items appear though. It would be nice if the equipment being sold was linked to the players level or an event that triggers new stock and you get notified about it. The maps are enjoyable to explore and loot and most enemies can be defeated in less than 5 rounds.\n\nThe combat in turn based RPGs is the thing that keeps my interest. I've enjoyed countless hours of grinding in the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy series, but I expect a bit more complexity from modern RPGs. Wolfsong starts slow with you being able to one shot the enemies throughout the first two areas with the standard attack. I only used  the Fierce Strike skill to one shot the first boss. I dislike the convention of introducing lazy combat strategies in RPGs and think it would be much better to teach the player to exploit enemy weaknesses from the very start of the game. When enemies did start to have weaknesses and strengths it seemed my current party was unable to exploit them. There were weak to fire enemies before I had any fire spells and then weak to ice enemies when the party no longer had a blue mage. I found this frustrating and ended up avoiding enemies and rushing the maps to progress the story. It would be great to be able to choose the best party members for a certain area.\n\nI bought this game on the strength of the tilesets and mapping I'd seen in screenshots and LPs. This game has some of the nicest tiles I've ever seen in a JRPG. They create memorable areas like the Ardan ruins, while at the same time making usually boring areas like caves look beautiful. The mapping style is great as well with a focus on smaller more interesting maps than large ones that are mostly empty. It was fun to explore these maps and having the option to avoid most encounters was appreciated. The only gripe I had with the art style was the quality of the portraits and the story boards. While they have a certain charm and character the varying quality of this artwork jars with the awesome tilesets and mapping.\n\nHaving grown up playing the early JRPGs I only expect the story to provide a context and framework for the gameplay. Wolfsong has a pretty straightforward story that progresses nicely and has a well developed world lore. As a player that enjoys these types of RPGs for the combat and loot I found some of the set pieces a bit long and skipped some of the character development conversations. I have little interest in character development unless it impacts the actual gameplay. These conversations could lead to discovering new skills or areas of the game instead of forcing a story onto the player. There were a few instances where I had had enough story and there were another ten dialogue boxes to read through. The game ends quite abruptly though which is a shame because a vast majority of the world map is empty and there could have easily been a few more towns and dungeons. This would have allowed more equipment upgrades and the character development could have been spread a bit more thinly.\n\nOverall, Wolfsong is up there with other modern JRPGs made by indie teams and provides around 10 hours of enjoyment. The game is not perfect and a few small changes could have improved the game immensely. Having a clear progression of purchasable equipment and being able to change your party members would have taken this from decent to awesome. The tilesets and mapping carry  it and kept me playing despite having aspects that have made me quit other titles. I have to recommend the game though because it is the best RPGMaker game I've played on Steam.\n\nI have completed the game once and ground my party members to level 11 before entering Rosewood. Despite this the final boss still took 10+ rounds to beat because the members that are not in the main party were still at level 5 (Edit: I checked and you can grind some enemies in the final dungeon before the boss, but it is really inefficient).","February 11","true","12.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Original Zelda style.\n- It does not involve much planning, strategy, it is really straightforward, and so is rather relaxing (I played part of it while being drunk :P)\n- It looks kinda cute, and it's simplicity is refreshing.\n- They tried their best to create some lore and story.\n\nCon's:\n- MAJOR CON (reason why I downvoted): It is really really short. Just when you think the world opens up and you gathered stuff and companions you suddenly are told you face the endboss :( Seeing the whole map (most of it not used), and the way things are designed I get the feeling they decided to release it half finished, or they plan on releasing DLC.\n- The art is often a bit too clumsy, and even amateuristic.\n- Story and lore feel like coming from nowhere at times (maybe I am missing on a known universe), and the end feel very abrubt and sudden.\n\nIt was good fun while it lasted, as I am a sucker for the Zelda style genre, but even now with discount at 7 euro, I find it dissapointedly short and unfinished. If it would have twice the current content I would surely recommend it.\n\nFull playthrough took me maybe 8 hours (I had to start over for technical reasons), and if you rush and skip it can be done in 6 I guess.\n\nIf you buy it, Alt+Enter will make it fullscreen (no tutorial on interface and controls whatsoever)\n","February 7","false","11.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

It's a casual story driven game that brings you to various places in the marvelous world of Lorestrome. No prior knowlegde of this world is needed, although players that are familiar with the Hood and Kingdom of Liars flashgames will recognize a lot of references and characters (These games are free to play on Newgrounds and should really be checked out!). The story unfolds around a young nordic female that has chosen the way of the warrior in order to make the world a better place. As she sets out, she meets a great array of nice and well developed characters. If you are looking for a casual game and a good story, this game is tailored to you.","February 4","true","11.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The battle system is quite fun and well-balanced. A lot of battling is optional, so you can play the way you want, which is great. The story is well-written. Overall, a very unique experience that is like the old days of great SNES RPGs. Well worth the download.","February 8","true","11.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This incredible game was created almost entirely by one person! Wow!\n\nWolfsong is lovely, with beautiful art and a creative story that is thoughtful and full of wonder. The world of Lorestrome is inspired and original, full of unique and amazing races and interesting characters. There are great references and carry-over from some of Hyptosis's other Lorestrome games. (That said, this is an entirely stand-alone game. Don't worry!) Some favorite characters, such as the enigmatic Bundled and Pikker and Kikker, make an appearance as well. And Cinnacat of course! As a player-character central to Wolfsong, he brings his indomitable spirit-- along with his Spice and Healing-- to the party, and we even get a bit of his back story too. The rest of the party are also wonderful, and I found myself wishing for the story to continue so I could spend more time with all of them.\n\nPlaying through Wolfsong a second time, I was really struck with how hopeful it is. There is a surprisingly positive outlook that people can be more and that there is hope even in a world full of violence. I like this. I hope others will give Wolfsong a chance and fall in love with Lorestrome and those who live there.","April 12","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
