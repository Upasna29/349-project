"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/3010/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","I'll admit that rally games are my guilty pleasure.  Most feature mushy controls, daft physics or ridiculously undamageable cars.  this has none of those.  The controls are crisp, the physics moderately good, and cars which will fly apart satisfyingly when you ram into a building or errant rock.   The career feature is quite well done, leaving you to decide which cars to buy to win certain races.  It does have relatively few maps (4 maybe?), but  a lot of variety of tracks round them keep things moderately interesting.  Stability-wise, there were very few glitches (I can count them on one hand, after months of play). The car addons actually feel like they're making a difference, and strategic part and tyre-selection can make an impossible stage remarkably enjoyable.\n\nThe games's only main downside is the repetitiveness.  Only four 'areas', means you get to race the same track over and over in different directions and different combinations of bits.  The openness of the career path does also lead to you making bad choices when purchasing cars and add-ons from time to time.   That means you must  race the same race 10x in a row to get the money to afford the thing you should have bought instead.    The only other small downside is the micro-stutter which occurs when a texture or sound is first loaded.  That can cause you to spin out, or miss a corner (e.g. when the game first loads the copilot voice for that corner).  A quick reload, and it doesn't happen there again.   Other than these small niggles, the game is notably bug and hassle-free.\n\nI recommend anyone who likes Rally games to play this.. It's got satisfaction value in spades, and while it's not as polished as Colin Macrae, I think in some areas it beats it (blasphemy!!) :-)","February 5, 2014","true","28.6"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","42","46","2","0"

It's not exactly a simulation (even on "simulation" mode), but it is a ton of fun. The physics are based in reality, and you can use all of the standard techniques to induce oversteer. It's a bit easy to go sideways, especially in a FWD car, but not glaringly unrealistic. I am not a rally driver, but I checked the FWD performance against Live For Speed (an acknowledged "realistic" sim) on its rallycross tracks, and I was able to get a similar FWD car (the Mini clone) to oversteer using throttle liftoff and brake, just like I was doing in Xpand. One funny thing is that you seem to be able to do powerslides in FWD cars in Xpand, which is obviously unrealistic. But that's fine, I just imagine that the FWD cars are AWD. The bottom line is that the physics are authentic enough that you can use the instincts you have developed in sims and have fun doing it.\n\nApart from physics and realism, the game is just a lot of fun to play. I have played the first stage about a dozen times, just because it's really fun. If you do nothing but play that first race, it will be more than worth the price. The stage design is one of the best things about this game: the stages are all completely crazy, with lots of tight turns and elevation changes keeping you on your toes without being unrealistic. And unlike many newer games, you don't have to sit through cutscenes, tutorials, and boring intro missions to get to the gameplay. Thankfully, you just turn it on and go right to the good part (the sideways racing).\n\nIt is an old game, so you will have to edit a configuration file if you want full 1080p resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, but it's easy. The file you're looking for is called VideoSettings.scr, and it's located in the Xpand Rally\Data folder. The settings in the file are clearly labeled and self-explanatory. Have fun!\n\nEdit: This game has a crazy difficulty curve. Don't try to drive insanely "at the limit," because some very strange things can happen with the physics at the limit. Instead, upgrade your car and drive carefully according to the pacenotes. Still a fun game and worth $5.","February 18","true","16.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is pretty realistic I would say, although the handbrake doesn't work like I think it should and the game is lacking the function to add a clutch button for controller use but that doesnt ruin it at all. Plus I don't know the exact release date but I remember it being fairly old, so you have to take that in to consideration.\n\nThe Rally Championship mode is excellent, with semi-realistic damage that may need to be replaced after every event. Individual parts can become damaged.\n\nThere is are no real manufactures in here which is a let down, but the cars are all modeled after real ones and have funny knockoff names. (IE. Tiny Hooper - Mini Cooper)\n\n$5 for a realistic rally game.

The general theme and ideas set forth by the creators of this game were actually well thought, but the full point conversion could not be made due to, what i'd beleive to be, a lack of funding or technology, or simply the want to make a fully functional game.\n\nThe first time i played this game, (enough times to make the average gamer turn in disgust) I appriciated the areas in which the game would of excelled, if not for its very bold failure, In which I mean the physics. Most racing fans love realism or simulation, in fact alot even prefer arcade style driving... but this game is far from either, with the realism of a 1982 version of a grand prix game. I can say in nay of everything wrong, once you get used to it, it becomes quite enjoyable and the stages themselves are quite challenging, eliminating the boring far off expectation from a "3rd party" game title. So all in all, I like this game, and i beleive most will, after the hour (or 5) of trying to comprehend how u controll you AWD beast.... And lastly, the game is very cheap, for that price, the game is a 10/10\n\n\n","October 9, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Graphics are nice, gameplay is alright and it's a decently priced game. There's better rally games of course, but if you're looking for a cheap on the wallet game? This one's the way to go... not that mobile-port BS Collin Macrae Rally from Codemasters.","August 25, 2014","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everything else is locked so there's nothing to do but play the same single stage over and over until you win.  About an hour of listed gameplay was spent playing the same stage trying to win since there is literally nothing else you can do.  And no, there's no difficulty settings either.","June 14, 2015","false","1.3"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","5","15","2","2"

Its been some time since I played this so your gonna have to comb the net to find the right tweak. It is a very simple matter but I don't remember. I believe there are 5 graphic renderers in the file and you have to choose the right one.\n\nTwo: This game is Efing hard!!!","November 12, 2014","true","11.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Forget about the WRC series, Xpand Rally has much better FFB and feel.\n\nIt has adrenaline, the cars can be upgraded and you can tinker with the setup quite deep. The only drawback is the missing licenses but who cares if the driving is so smooth!? And nevertheless all the cars are basically copies the it's real equivalents, so you get Puntos, VW Golfs, Seat Cordobas, Mitsubishis, Fords etc. There are tons of categories which makes the learning curve much more enjoyable.\n\nInteresting feature that this is the only rally game where you can even die in game. Just as the car you can also get serious damage.\n\nFor 5 euros you get a decent rally game. But please don't yell because of the outdated graphics and the engine, this game became 10 years old in 2016. Much better game than WRC series.","May 25","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
