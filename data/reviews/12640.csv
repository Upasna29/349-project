This system allows for more strategic battles and lets you organize your team and the skills to use.\nThe storyline is quite interesting but i felt that it could be presented in a better way. But what the main story may fail to deliver all the other things of the Drakesang universe you can find out make up for. The world has a history and it's really interesting to discover bits and pieces of it all over. Also there's really not any character progression regarding their personalities. At the end of your adventure you and your companions will be exactly the same persons as you were at the beginning.\nThe game is hard but that makes the battles really interesting and fun. You have to use diferrent skills, spells and items if you want to make it. What i really liked is the leveling system because it allows you to use your experience points in order to improve your skills whenever you want to. So if you feel like it you can wait until later to use them when you will be more certain about what type of characters you want to build.\nKeeping in mind that the game was released in 2009 the graphics are pretty good. As for the soundtrack i can't say i really noticed it.\nI strongly recommend Drakesang to all the old-school party based RPG lovers. I'm sure you will have a good time playing it.\n85%","January 5, 2014","true","57.2"," 88 of 92 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","88","92","3","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/remainaery/recommended/12640/","remainaery","remainaery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/remainaery/","82 products in account","Drakensang (originally released here in Germany in 2008) is a turn-based party RPG using "Germany's D&D" rules, "The Dark Eye", and follows in the footsteps of games like Black Isle/Bioware's Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights 2 - more or less.\n\nDoes it hold up? - yes and no. Some may call it boring, others call it slow-paced, either way, nothing about this game could be described as "high octane". If this rather intrigues you, then by all means, here's the full review:\n\nComing out a year before Dragon Age: Origins hit the shelves and probably resparked interest as well as expectations for the genre, this title is a neat little throwback that ALMOST succeeds in recreating the feel of the aforementioned beloved classic, but comes with a series of shortcomings, a lot of which can probably be traced back to a lack in production power for such an ambitious title.\n\nSome of these shortcomings include: The ability to not fully customize the looks of your characters, not having fully voiced NPC dialogues, the gameplay being "functional" rather than "elegant", and being fairly limited in terms of story-choices and dialogue options (most of which only truly seem fitting if you're playing a default human 'nice guy' type of hero, and end up seeming odd or out-of-character for any elf, dwarf, or less-than-nice type of hero you might want to play).\n\nIf you have played Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights or any similar title, you will probably pick up the controls pretty quickly - point and click or WASD to move, hold mouse button to turn camera, click on character, assign command, hit spacebar to pause at any time. If you have played any of the D&D-based CRPGs and had no background and prior knowledge in AD&D, you will probably also relive the same frustration of "what do all these things mean" and "why is my character unable to hit stuff", leading to a rather frustrating experience until you finally figure out the simulated Pen-and-Paper-RPG rules this game's system is built on. Expect to look up a guide online to get up to speed, since the explainations the game itself provides may prove insufficient.\n\nBut, all the negatives aside, there is also a lot of good to be found: The locations are very well crafted and modelled very realistically after late medieval Germany, character models are colorful and overall very nice to look at, and the soundtrack goes perfectly with the scenery.\n\nSo, whom do I recommend this game to?\n- You're looking for a "quaint" RPG where you do not wade in blood, a game that takes a rather light-hearted approach, not offering a lot of world-shattering choices, and overall a more relaxed experience\n- You appreciate hommage and genre conventions and don't expect innovation\n- You're not bothered by having to do a bit of research in order to fully get behind the game rules if you are not already fully familiar with them\n\nNot recommended if:\n- you're looking for a fast-paced game with action combat or even the tactical depth of the older infinity engine games; this game is hardly challenging if you know the rules well enough.\n- you want a more epic or serious experience, as the plot and presentation try not much to impress with edginess or cinematics\n- you're sick of "traditional fantasy rpgs". This is as traditional as it gets, up to the point where some would call it "clicheed", "dull" and "beaten to death"\n\nPS: Even if you like a "slower" game, do yourself a favor and look up a little thing called "Ergo's Fixpack" up online, as it modifies the walking speed of your party to a more covenient pace - but be aware that is also contains some other small modifications to the game and thus does not allow for the "100% vanilla experience".","November 10, 2014","true","119.5"," 82 of 85 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","82","85","0","0"

I've just completed the game and may I say it's beautiful. Also, the game is VERY hard. You can't choose a difficulty level, so you'll have to play at the game's "default" and only difficulty level. Common enemies are usually only hard when they're in packs, but bosses... Let's say bosses are TOUGH. There are a few boss opponents that will require you to think of some unusual tactics, because there's simply no chance you'll handle them going head-on. And yeah, bring A LOT of healing potions to final battle. I've just finished it without a single potion, and it's been a REAL STRUGGLE. Two hours or so...\nGame's core RPG mechanics is so much like Neverwinter Nights that sometimes you almost feel like you're playing NWN. I liked the mechanics. It's a pity you only get to buy good spells after the middle of the game, I'd like to see more spells and get them faster. By the way, you can increase character's skills (spend your experience points) at any time. This makes levelling up pretty much useless. And having to buy all the spells and active skills makes levelling up even more useless... I didn't like that. In Neverwinter Nights, you receive spells and skills as you gain your level. Here, in Drakensang, you receive experience points and increase your skills, and levelling up is just... Levelling up. That's pretty much it. "Player has reached level x", and that's all, nothing more happens.\nI enjoyed the main storyline. There's plenty of side quests, and they are ok, and the main quest is great, and soooo long! Completing the game took me 45 damn hours... But it was worth it. Some of the plot twists were somewhat unexpected. However, the main storyline is solid, but it's not a masterpiece.\nI liked the world, graphics are awesome (considering the game is 4-5 years old). Characters are great, I liked my companions and it was somewhat sad to finish the game, because I realized my adventure with these characters is over.\nBy the way, there's no fast travel system in this game, so you'll have to walk through the huge Drakensang maps on foot. Well, it didn't bother me.\nAnd the dialogues. I've read a bunch of reviews before buying the game, and almost every single one of them said the game has awfully written dialogues. Well, I have to admit that sometimes you hear or read something funny, and dwarves speak with significant accent. However, those facts create unique atmosphere. Nothing feels uncomfortable, nothing feels out of place. So if you're afraid of possible flaws in dialogues, don't be, they're OK.\nOverall, if you like old-school RPGs (pretty much like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights or Dragon Age), I think you'll really enjoy this game. Buy the game on sale, and it will be totally worth every cent spent on it.\n7.5 out of 10.","January 1, 2014","true","45.0"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","50","53","0","4"

BUT: I'm german, this game was written in german, and it implements the german Dark Eye RPG system. So while the basic idea is still that of a CRPG, the game can have a lot of peculiar aspects if you are coming  from the AD&D culture. The game system never developed the kind of depth that can be found in the AD&D system, especially at high levels. And obviously, this game's storyline can't even be compared to the depths and complexity we've seen in the true gems like Mask of the Betrayer or Planescape Torment. Nonetheless, the writers were pretty well-versed within the Dark Eye universe, and the whole thing is a full and convincing implementation of the game's pen&paper base. But if you can't play it in german, most of the writing's qualities are probably lost in translation. The game really lives by athmosphere, by capturing the "feel" of the Dark Eye universe, which is largely conveyed by the language.\n\nOther than that, the Dark Eye game system is also ridiculously complex when compared to AD&D. Where AD&D is optimized for playability and high-level scaling, the Dark Eye is optimized for realism and plausibility. So you end up with a combat system that is complex and difficult to master, yet feels very basic. However that's just what the Dark Eye world is like. Think of it as an "earlier", simpler world than AD&D. It's not as mythical, magic doesn't have as much power, people and their stories are simpler. I used to play some Dark Eye pen & paper, so I knew roughly what to expect, and that's why I loved it.\n\nSo, bottom line: If you know & love the Dark Eye, and if you're fluent in german, this is definitely an awesome game. If not, you might still get the hang of the world, its lore and the way it works, but maybe you don't.","September 28, 2014","true","126.5"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","41","45","0","0"

I'd say it ranks up there with Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, both of which were very decent games for their time, and I'd give it a couple of points higher than Dragon Age, if only because the difficulty is a bit higher. In fact it plays pretty much just like Dragon's Age, so if you liked that game you will probably like this one. The graphics are comparable (a couple years old, still looks nice on a new PC). Combat is fun, which is important for this kind of game. I consider it slightly more difficult than Dragon Age because some of fights can be quite difficult and actually require some planning.\n\nIt was just what I was looking for at the time... a break from online mmo's filled with snot-nosed brats and their temper tantrums. If you're sick of the annoyances of online games and looking to spend some time playing a little old school single player rpg, this is a good choice. Length was just about right, I'd say 40-50 hours playing in no big hurry.\n\nBy the way, I ran into not a single bug in the whole game.

But it comes with a caveat.\n\nIn the beginning, when you're a minnow just trying to scrape together enough coins for bandages and forming a new party out of a crew of eccentric NPC's, it's fun and challenging.  The graphics are colourful, the NPC's are kooky, and every fight can be your last.\n\nHowever, every time I play it, I hit the wall of boredom about 3/4 way through.  Battles amount to: buff, melee, throw a couple of spells, heal.  Repeat until nauseated.  Stealth seems pointless, ditto traps, or any strategy other than shooting first.\n\nAnd why am I doing the main quest?  As far as I can tell, the only reason I'm moving forward is momentum.  The plot seems to be: some vague bad thing is about to happen, hey it's a mystery, and also shiny bits of yellow armour are somehow important.\n\n(Spoiler: the bits of yellow armour are really ugly).\n\nI invariably end up starting a different game and forgetting all about Drakensang.\n\nConclusion: A honeymoon which turns into an affair, which turns into a divorce.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/recommended/12640/","derungrund","Der Ungrund","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/","388 products in account","Since leveling in modern RPGs has become mostly just a matter of dumping points into strength if you are melee, dexterity if you are ranged, and intelligence if you are a magic user, it's refreshing to see a modern RPG that actually requires you to do math and plan ahead if you don't want to mess up your game. In Drakensang, almost every action is determined by a formula that factors in 3 seperate attributes as well as skill points. If you invest in one attribute it will always affect several different things, which means that you are rarely boxed into one role. So, for example, if you want you can play as a rogue/mage hybrid who specializes in long bows and still be effective. There aren't many CRPGs left where you can do stuff like that. The writing isn't great, although it's kind of charming in the way that it avoids the "grim dark" fantasy tropes of modern RPGs and instead harkens back to lighter fair of the 1980s and 1980s.  But spotty writing aside, the combat and character customization are the real reasons to play.","March 18, 2012","true","64.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The main quest starts out quite relaxed, and gradually builds up into an epic tale of legendary heroes and ancient evil. It also has some fun side quests that can distract you for a couple of hours at a time. The character creation and level up system is complex, easy to learn, but takes time to master. Some non combat skills can influence dialogue options. The companion characters are interesting, and party combat has a similar tactical nature as Baldurs Gate, Neverwinter Nights and Dragon Age. The graphics show their age, and there are a few minor spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and bad accents during dialogue. But its worth overlooking these flaws because overall it has an atmosphere that is hard to describe, but just feels right. The world feels alive. I didn't encounter any crashes or major bugs. At over 40 hours, value for money is excellent.","June 1, 2012","true","43.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Some people compare it to DA:O, NWN, BG, etc...(that being the reason I bought it) but that's a big overstatement.\n\nThe bad:\n\n1. The story/main quest - linear, blurry and uninteresting - does little to motivate the player to save the world.\n2. The side quests are scarce, petty, uncomplicated and unrewarding.\n3. The companions are plain, stereotyped and boring. They have no personal quests (except one), don't develop with the progress in the game, rarely have something to say about quests/environment. Puppets with no personality, no conflicts, no banters, no life. The majority of them can be recruited too late in the game, so, for the first half, you will probably be stuck with the barking amazon and the cliché dwarf.\n4. There is no character customization in terms of appearance.\n5. The voices are simply horrible. Luckily, the English version of the game has very few voiced lines but this breaks the atmosphere, of course.\n6. The loot consists mostly of crafting stuff or cheap and unusable items. It is also unevenly distributed, there are large areas with only 3 plants and a chest and others (locked ones) with so much loot that your inventory limit is exceeded.\nThe game encourages you to pick-pocket everyone, but fails to mention that there are only 5 NPCs worth stealing. (How much fluff does one have to steal in order to buy an Amulet of Courage?)\nThe equipment is mostly generic and there are only a handful of special or enchanted items. The only set, main-quest-related, enchanted full armor looks terrible and only fitting for a warrior (additionally, at the end of the game someone had the great idea to transform it into some sort of all-or-nothing jump-suit, robbing you of the possibility to wear only parts of it).\nRummaging through the game data base I've found too many items and crafting recipes which have been left out and this is sad, because this game could benefit greatly from extra content.\n7. Most areas are locked after finishing the corresponding main-quest part. I can't phantom the reason behind this.\n8. Rogue considerations:\na) stealth is useless in terms of combat or stealing, it only comes handy in certain scripted conditions. You may unrealistically steal items in front of people with no penalty whatsoever;\nb) there is NO double-wielding;\nc) there is a large variety of traps but no reason, opportunity or fun to use them;\nd) disarming traps, picking locks, etc... brings no XP.\n9. Strange behaving camera in buildings and underground.\n10. Disappearing corpses during cut-scenes.\n\nThe good:\n\n1. The visuals are still sharp after so many years.\n2. The music is fine and contributes to the game atmosphere.\n3. The people responsible with level/area design did a great job.\nActually the music and the scenery are the only ones that create a positive atmosphere. The story and the characters subtracts from this instead of enriching it.\n4. The ability and spell checks system, though unnecessary complicated, make sense after you've understood them (except for harvesting plants - that's just plain stupid)\n5. The training-based talents.\n6. Gwendala - a healing mage/archer is an excellent companion; she also looks good.\n7. The combat is challenging at times but gets repetitive.\n\nConclusion: Buy/play Drakensang only if on sale and if you don't have great expectations. It is playable and almost bug free but lacks the level of detail, complexion and entertainment other genre related games (even older) have. I've had more fun modding it than playing it.\n","February 18","false","178.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","2"

Where to begin on this one.  This in my opinion is a decent rpg but I think the speed of the game really drags it down.  All of your traveling will be done by running very slowly to get on your way.  The running is so painfully slow I had to figure out how to adjust the config file to make my party faster.  While this made the game so much more bareable I still had a struggle pulling away from other games and finishing this one.  I got several hours into Drakensang but never finished it.  The game has pretty plain environments with pretty scary character models and even worse animations.  Some of the dialog has voice over but the majority of the quest dialog will not.  I also found the loot/gear to be very boring.

Seriously there are smashable barrels everywhere.\nI got to the second town where i got the medal and house. Review is only based on that part.\n\nPros:\n- Character creation, many characters to choose and game does not allow full min-maxing so no OP chars.\n- Initial town where you can use social skills, later not so much\n\nCons:\n- Shops sell mostly starting gear of other characters. My mage could not buy an upgrade to his clothes or staff in the first two towns, just got a healing spell and a weaker damaging one.\n- Economy. Crafting an item is at least twice as costly as buying it in a shop, and that does not include the effort of harvesting other ingredients which often fails. I let my guy learn Alchemy because the game described it as a money-making skill. Bought ingredients for 4 coins, added poison stings from non-respawning enemies, crafted weapon poison, sold for 5 coins...\n- No XP bonus for soloing the game, so party is preffered and needed.

From the incessant fights against uninteresing enemies (wolves, rats, and bandits, mostly) to the boring and unimpressive spells, and the underwhelming combat moves, the game is dull.\nThe game's storytelling is also dull.  The characters are fairly boring themselves.  If you decide to play it, whatever you do, don't decide to ask a character's backstory.  What you'll get is a tedious dialogue that reveals nothing about the game world and nothing interesting about the character.\nIf you're like me, and you're looking for a CRPG to pass the time, then I suppose this game will do.  But the pace is slow and nothing about it has yet to enrapture me.\nI'd reinstall Neverwinter Nights 2, but that would take me forever and NWN2 has its own issues (bugs, mostly).  But at least NWN2 has some interesting abilities for your character.  Not so here.  I've looked online out of sheer frustration, and it seems the most interesting spell the game can give you is some kind of fireball.\nWoo.  A fireball.  The game has nothing with more pizazz than that, I'm afraid.\nOtherwise, the game will keep you busy.  There's plenty of uninteresting sidequests, and the main quest seems pretty long.  Unfortunately, busy doesn't mean entertained.\nI really wish somebody would make some more CRPGs of the caliber of the first Neverwinter Nights (not the multiplayer one) and Dragon Age: Origins.  But I guess making fun videogames is hard, so it's unlikely we'll see much of that.\nAnyways, back to Drakensang:\nThe combat is turnbased and rather clunky.  Casting spells seems to take several rounds, which is quite frustating considering that the duration of debuffs is about as long.  So by the time you've cast your weeny cold ray on an enemy (assuming you haven't been interrupted, since the cold ray spell has an exceedingly short range in addition to a long casting time), the distracting shock spell you've cast upon your opponent will have run out.  Your party members then have fifteen secodns to take advantage of your enemy's momentary weakness.\nExpect lots of waiting around for your character to get his turn to strike.\nThere doesn't appear to be any significant player choice in the game, beyond turning down quests.  So if you weren't allowed to wander aimlessly, this would effectively be a linear game.\nSo: don't buy.  It's a waste of time and money.  Unless you're like me and you're unemployed and you need something to kill the time that can run on your dated computer, fun be damned.","September 16, 2014","false","9.8"," 22 of 58 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","22","58","0","3"

Keep in mind I have just recently began playing this and my opion may change. So far however, I haven't been able to pass the first quest.\n\nFirst of all, there is not enough explanation on the talents, spells, and so on in the sense that it does not explain what it does or even how to use it (cast on friendly or foe?). You are supposed to learn as you go, or trial and error... whichever works for you.\n\nOh and this goes for character development as well. Sure, there is a short tutorial when you first open the character screen, but the details of what each stat means and how it affects the game is not explained fully. I believe you are expected to have some knowledge of RPG's prior to playing this game.\n\nSecondly, your character starts of very weak and although the levels of the enemies match that of your own, the levels of the quest related enemy NPC's are at a level to cause difficulty for any player.\n\nThirdly, the squad/party system is a little difficult to master. It is not intuitive and you have to either select the entire party to move everyone together or select a specifc member to place him/her in a particular position. Oh and then if you try to cast a spell, you will find yourself charging the enemy automatically post casting the spell...\n\nFourthly, the camera... I found it odd, unnatural. Also the controls kinda reminded me of the original Gothics (1 and 2). Not a negative, just my thought on the matter.\n\nFifthly, Frequency of saves... the game autosaves but do not rely on it... you really have to save often because once you (or if you have a party, your party members are all dying), the game is over. Now, if you could quickly cast a heal spell that would have been awesome but to cast a healing spell (perhaps just in the beginning) you do all these weird dancing moves (which get interrupted by an attack) that takes ages and ages (you gotta move those curves, yo!) and before you know it, your entire party is dead. Oh, la la! Thn you see a screen with two options, load save game or end game... Load save game. of cuorse... what the?! This is when I entered the area for the first time.... like an hour ago! SAVE! Very Very Very important in this unforgiving game.\n\nFor those of you that like to use the console commands to quicken the game, enhance their gameplay, run a one man show, or whatever you call it; you will be disappointed because there is no such thing in this game... so, you are gonna have to sweat it if you want to finish the game... and by the looks of it, you'd better get a towel ready because there is going to be a lot of sweating to be had!\n\nUpdate 31st of July, 2014\n\nOk so here are some other things I learned: right clicking on items provides an explanation of the item along with properties (if any), such as armor it provides (and where), damage and so on.\n\nYou only get a limited number of saves and only 1 quick save slot... Use them wisely!","July 28, 2014","false","17.5"," 15 of 45 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","15","45","0","2"

A very surprising CRPG experience! The only problem I have with this game is the lack of options for creating your avatar. And that's just a minor itch because you do get a variety of classes to choose from and each one has it's own avatar. Extremely well written, decent graphics, huge variety of skills and spells (and anyone can learn any skill as long as stats meet requirements), and plenty of secret areas to discover. Oh, and it does use a paper doll system that shows on the avatars. Up to 4 party members and a base (gotten a little ways into story quest) to keep the extra members you can find. All in all a fabulous CRPG that managed to suck me in. Love it!","June 6, 2013","true","46.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's THAT boring.  Dungeons are incredibly long drawn out affairs that are filled with useless junk or chests that are impossible to unlock...even with level capped lockpicking skills.  I've played 12 hours of this game and the only thing I've fought in the dungeons are giant rats and the occasional pack of wolves.\n\nThe storyline is reasonably interesting...but it just moves along at a gelatinous cube's pace.  Well, the female characters look good in their underwear at least...that's always a plus in my book.","November 19, 2010","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
