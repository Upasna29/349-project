Half the challenge is working out what to do, then the other half is getting your timing right.  It isn't mentioned anywhere, but this game comes with a free level editor - Free Stuff (tm) is a bonus!  It's in the install directory called "Bipolar Level Editor.exe", levels seem to save out as XML and it looks simple enough to swap levels with friends.  10/10","April 23","true","1.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is a good example of the simple but tough game creation choice. You are guided through levels at the start and then the challenges start coming. It is a fun and enticing game that can have you coming back quite fast.\nAs with any good platforming game there is a level editor but to find it you need to go to your SteamApps folder, common then open the Bibolar Game folder and there should be an application/.","May 6","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
