"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/448000/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Anyone being used to Sparkle knows that you need to eat nutriments so that your little sparkle can grow into a powerful organism that can be herbivore, carnivore or omnivore. So, you were used to the green, blue or red elements floating, with medusaes to eat or any other species wanting to challenge you. Besides, some levels were huge as you needed to use vortex to reach another level.\n\nThat's Sparkle 2 Evo and Sparkle 3 Genesis.\n\nErase everything you've learned because Sparkle ZERO, despite belonging to the same series, just wants you to grow a sparkle, without any tutorial and learning about the commands, that will be the predator of everyone. No more carnivore, herbivore or omnivore, no more faster sparkle or with a better range of absorption or with a better defense. However, everything else is still there: micro-elements that will grow your sparkle, jellyfishes still floating, other species still there to annoy you (bumpers that will send you far away of your food, parasites stealing it, etc.) and vortex to use if you want to evolve.\n\nYou don't have missions anymore, you're just eating, growing in a deep blue sea, with white stuff all around. You still have that sixth sense that will guide you to the nutriments but now, your little one can also sense vortex or enemies and show the way to them, which is good because as usual, the minimap on your right corner isn't really clear. I've seen it because I recognize the symbol for a vortex. Now, on the map, you can also see species wandering around.\n\nI don't know how many layers exist because I finished the game before checking if I was at the end or not. I largerly preferred the ancient system of levels and missions, mainly because you can come back to them and keep growing in beautiful landscapes.\n\nI finished the game in 95 minutes, where the others took me more time to do it. I was kinda disappointed that I couldn't control anymore the evolution of my little sparkle thanks to the DNA manipulation and that I couldn't see my level, so that I didn't know if I was nearing level 50 or not. I managed to reach it quickly because I've cleaned every floor - in other words, I've eaten all elements presents and defeated every enemy.\n\nSparkle ZERO has still a relaxing soundtrack, at least, the new developers didn't remove that good feature.\n\nI was under the impression that Sparkle ZERO was in reality the first game in the series, if I didn't check before if it was the case. Apparenlty, it's not. For me, it's a huge step behind compared to Genesis and Evo and for the new player, without any indication about the commands, it will seem impossible to use a vortex. I only managed to do it because I remembered more or less how it was for the other games.\n\nSo, should I recommend it or not? I must say that the game is avoiding a thumb down because I still enjoyed the challenge, despite all the missing features that I liked. But if you want to try one of the Sparkle game, I would point you to Evo and Genesis.","March 15","true","3.9"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/448000/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","NOTE: This was provided to me for free for review purposesOverviewSparkle ZERO is the last iteration of the Sparkle series, of which I was pretty fond of. Being able to play as a tiny celular being and seeing it grow and develop, hunt and learn was a great concept, and the game was well developed, with beautiful visuals, interesting evolution options, great soundtrack, etc. Unfortunately, the ZERO is both a token of "we are running out of ideas to rebrand this series, this'll do the trick" and of the good features they left in the game. Let's go over it step by step.\n\nThe Pros:Easy Achievements - 40 minutes of this will get you a perfect game, in case you are an achievement hunter.\n\nNice Visuals, and OK music - Nothing too fancy, but it helps to have nice visuals and calm music in a game such as this. I (hope) it was meant to be the little cousin of the series that just wants to chill.\nThe Cons:Very Short - The end scene shows up at random after you've eaten enough. That was about 40 minutes in. There is no incentive to play again, do what you will with that information.\n\nThere is no "evolutionary ladder" - You are the most advanced being in the whole game since second one. You are immortal, faster than everyone else, and the only one that can actually eat. Others are just nuisances. Do you consider it "climb the ladder" just by adding a few new flaps on your back?\n\nNo Control over Evolution - From what I can tell, every time you start another profile, you will randomly be assigned a pattern of modifications that will gradually pop on your back as you consume more. Everything is purely for looks.\n\nThey stripped this game of EVERYTHING - You no longer have beautiful colored food, walls, and enemies. Now everything is just two shades of blue. You no longer have walls! Maps? Naah, just some layered open space. There are no enemies! No one can kill you! No matter how small you are, two taps on another sparkle or jelly fish will kill them, and the only other two entities either harmlessly bump in you, or try to take food away from you. There is no challenge! You cannot die, you have no objectives, you just consume, without any effort! Just look at gameplay videos of the previous games and see just how much has been removed, whilst nothing was added.\nConclusion:I don't consider this to be a good game. I wouldn't even consider it worthy enough to be an alpha. That being said, if you got your hopes up for the idea of the game, rest assured! Sparkle 2 and 3 are still worthwhile games. Check them out!\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/448000/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1465 products in account","IntroductionSparkle ZERO is from the same series as Sparkle, Sparkle 2 and Sparkle 3 are from. It is a simulation game whereby you start off as a small organism and try to become the biggest of them all. Although this game in the series, it does seem a bit out of place compared to the other Sparkle games in the series.\n\nGameplayWith the game being from the Sparkle series there are some standards that have been set from the previous games that you would expect to be in this game or be better than the previous ones. The game is fun to play, to a certain extent. Playing for about 2 hours I found myself getting fairly bored of just eating other smaller organisms and getting bigger to eat more. It was a endless cycle of trying to be the best of them all. For me this was not a decent enough goal set to keep my entertained enough to motivate me enough to play the game more.\n\nI feel like in my own personal opinion that the game doesn't cover enough mechanics to keep a player interested enough to go back and play the game more. There is little, or no replay value of this game because of just how boring the game is the first time you play through it.\n\nSomething good about this game though, is the graphics and some of the sounds that were produced as you play through and grow your organism. The sounds are rather quite nice, with a sort of ambient feel to it which really sets the tone for what this game is, it makes you immersed into the game and pulls you in with the sounds as well as the graphics. The graphics of the game also set the tone for the game and really fits the game well, as the previous Sparkle games have done.\n\nPros+ The game is fun to play for a hour or so\n+ Full controller support\n+ Beautiful ambient sounds\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Steam achievements and Trading cards\n\nCons- Game gets boring after playing it for over 2 hours\n- The game doesn't set a decent goal to want me to go back and play it more\n- Doesn't feel like it belongs in the series of the other Sparkle games\n- The asking price isn't worth the game\n- Little or no replay value\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsThe game for me is split in half, on one hand my first experience of this game was fun. The first hour or so of the gameplay was enjoyable to play, the graphics are really nice as are the ambient sounds. But then again, now that I look back at the  gameplay I feel like it wasn't really worth it. I will definitely not be going back to play more of this game. Final verdict, don't buy this game, waste of your time and your moneys worth.\n\nRating: 4.7/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","May 4","false","2.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/otter-chaos/recommended/448000/","otter-chaos","Otter Chaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/otter-chaos/","1643 products in account","I reviewed Sparkle 2 and Sparkle 3, so I may as well review Sparkle, um, 0.  I'm not sure if this is meant as a reboot or maybe a tribute to Ringu, but for whatever reason, the new Sparkle game has a lower number.  Pedantic musings aside, I really liked Sparkle 2, and reviewed it as the best jellyfish eating simulator available.  The Sparkle games have held that title since Pac-Man, even though when asked if the creatures in Pac-Man were jellyfish, Toru Iwatani replied “I’m surprised that you made the reference to a jellyfish. The assumption must be from the transparency in their design and also their characteristics.”  You notice that he did not deny that the enemies in Pac-Man were jellyfish, so I'll just stick with that theory.\n\nAnyhoo, Sparkle 0.  The game is lovely.  Sparkle games always are.  This time around I get a sort of cyberspace cyberpunk cyberjellyfisheating vibe from the graphics.  It's you against the world, and you gotta bag and tag em chummer.  Sorry.  All that cyber talk brought out the Shadowrun in me.  Yeah, remember when Shadowrun was cool?  Hmm, maybe it never was, but I liked it.  I used to read the books, back when books were a thing.\n\nSo, what was I saying?  Right!  Sparkle!  Back on track!  My reviews have been gettings so narrow that maybe like three people will even get the references.  I'm starting to feel like Dennis Miller.  So it goes.\n\nSo the graphics are nice, as always.  The gameplay is more like Sparkle 2, very chill, no real danger, just eat jellyfish and pretty much any other creature you meet, with the ultimate goal of evolving your creature to become more bigger and such.  This process has been stripped down to the point that there are no longer evolutionary trees, and you just eat and grow without having any input, as if you were Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.  This may be a pretty big step backward in the series, but at least you don't have the spikey tunnels that plagued Sparkle 3.\n\nOverall, I still suggest Sparle 2 Evo as the best in the series, and I hope they return to the variety that game had to offer, but Sparkle 0 is still a good game.  Just a bit less so than fans of the series might have hoped.","March 16","true","3.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","2"

Now, with that said, I enjoyed the little over an hour I spent getting all the achievements. I would highly recommend using a controller and a very nice big screen to play this on. The music and visuals really make for cathartic and almost rythmic gameplay. This may not apply to everyone, but I have the goosebumps while playing this game due to the millipede-like creatures.
