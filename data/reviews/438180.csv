Great game to let off some steam (Ha, get it? Steam? Why do I try?) or to explore a different genre. I know most people's librarys these days are mostly just FPS games like COD, Battlefield, and CS, so games like this are fun to play inbetween, a little breather from the fast-paced action of AAA games.\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics.\nGraphics really complimented by the music!\nFun to play with good mechanics.\n\nCons:\nAs I played, I could'nt help but think, "Hey, this reminds me of Mario! Hey, So does this! Hey! This reminds me of M... Metroid!(Caught you off guard, didnt I?)\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great project, and it is worth every penny.","January 27","true","0.9"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","73","27","37","15","1"

Few levels was fun enough to say they were good. Some parts of game mechanics like character movement are really enjoyable.\n\nWhat I found annyoing was level design. I really hated when I just have nothing more to do than just jump into the spikes. I also hated the very last jump in last level where you need to be very precise and double jump correctly. I found myself often jumping to death just because I don't know if I can jump there or not.\n\nAnd the bugs... some of them were fun (backwards dash looks funny), some of them not (stuck on that green moving platform with spikes). I also couldn't get my gamepad working - it worked at the beginning but I couldn't set my x/y axis after I changed settings to default by mistake so I ended up playing this on keyboard. The game also crashed once (between levels 2 and 3 afair).\n\nIf that would be 4.99€ (or more) game then I would say a big NO to this game. I bought it for 0.59€ and I consider it a fair price for that. So yeah, I'm going to recommend it.","January 27","true","1.3"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/banjooie/recommended/438180/","banjooie","Banjooie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/banjooie/","595 products in account","The one good part about this game is that the controls are relatively tight.\n\nHit detection is a joke. The sound effects are either royalty free or literally the Mario 1 UP noise. It's impossible to tell the difference between a wall that can and cannot be wall jumped. (This is only mostly true. SOME walljumpable walls are marked, but not all of them.) The amount of damage enemies do is seemingly unrelated to what they are. Stationary spikes are a heart and a half. Moving smashy spike columns are half a heart.\n\nSome enemies will hurt you when you jump on them, but also take damage. It's impossible in many cases to tell when a cliff will lead to more level or will instantly kill you. It has a lives system with coins, but the lives and coins don't carry over between levels. The final boss gives you 100 bullets, but those bullets don't refresh between lives, though the final boss's health -does-. This game takes less than an hour to beat. Pursuant: I have, in fact, beaten the game.\n\nThe background art is pretty good, but the other tilework is terrible. Enemies can have the same sprite, but vastly different mechanics and different health. You have to manually select the next level after you beat a previous one.\n\nThe 'beat the game' art is actually worse than the title screen graphic. Of the guns you can get, one of them is an actual upgrade, and one of them shoots three shots (which you will never need) for three times the ammunition, which is acceptably sparse to begin with except for when you get a million ammo in areas with like three enemies.\n\nThe box physics are horrendous. In one level, I pushed a box down a thin shaft, and it got stuck halfway. Boxes on moving platforms will skitter around like nervous squirrels, and none of the puzzles are interesting enough to merit there even being box-pushing in the first place.\n\nThere's an enemy that is basically a koopa troopa, but not a single level ever puts you in a situation to use this to your advantage, or against you. It's there just for the sake of being there.\n\nTL;DR Quite literally everything in this game that is not 'controlling Super Mustache' is achingly bad.","February 11","false","1.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","20","27","2","0"

Walls you can jump off of have similar issues.\n\nNow for nitpicks: Ammo is not reset on death. This led to an annoying section during the final boss, where I died with no bullets. Because bullets are required to break the boxes containing more ammo and health, the fight was nearly impossible without exiting to menu and coming back.\nHorizontal inputs for the level select menu register as two pushes, so selecting an even numbered level on a 5x5 grid can be very hard, unless you use the mouse.\nJumping up into invisible death plains for previous sections of the level is possible.\nHealth pickup sound effect is a blatantly stolen 1-UP effect from Super Mario Bros.","May 30","false","1.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

After explaining the bare minimum, the seeming small number of levels drag themselves out with challenging design. A steady head and good timing will see you through.\n\nI bought this game on sale out of curiosity, and I think I would do it again.\n7/10 not enough Uranus jokes.","May 15","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As a fan of platformer games I went into this game hoping for a Hidden Gem for only $0.99.  It sort of reminded me of 8BitBoy with the style and controls, however this game did have a few "glitchy" moments.  On more thna one occasion I got stuck on the wall and had to restart the level.  As well as an issue with some blocks getting stuck against a wall and not falling where they need to.  The overall gameplay though was fun and once I got used to the jumping/controls, it made for an enjoyable experience.\n\nI would say the higlight of this game would be the soundtrack, it is solid and really helped keep pushing me to finish the game.  It's not a long game at all, but for the price I totally recommend it.  I would say this game is something that can be completed in 1 hour or less once you get used to the gameplay mechanics.","February 29","true","2.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Rather short.  But, well worth the small price, even off sale.\n\nMy only con is that after seven hours gameplay logged, no trading cards have been dropped.

I've been playing it a lot recently for my Let's Play videos on my YouTube channel, and going through it for the first time is really exciting and sometimes difficult. Super Mustache is only 99 cents, but I was able to get it for 66 cents due to a coupon I obtained. Honestly, for it's price and awesomeness definitely would rate this game 9/10.\nIt's like a futuristic Mario in some ways, and having a laser rifle at times is pretty epic. I'm hoping they release some sort of DLC or Super Mustache 2! Would definitely pay money for them. To conclude, the story ain't all bad either, you're a Captain from Earth trying to stop Gladius and Uranus from taking over the universe.

A very fun and short platformer that really does make you feel nostalgic for those good ol 2D super nintendo games.\n\nOnly complaints is that the games controls are set up a bit weird but you can personalize them to your taste. A few problems include getting stuck on objects and dying out of nowhere, but there problems are minor and there's not a constant flow of inconviences. Plus, this game is fairly new and I am certain those problems will be addressed. I wouldn't recommend this game  if you have a problem with reused content.

Finished the game start to finish in apparently 66 minutes including getting up to get a drink about halfway through.\n\nGraphics are borderline terrible.  Assets are heavily inspired or stolen from games like Mario (Thwomps).  Music is short loops that get very old very quickly.  Sound effects are bare minimum required and even the 1-up sound from Mario is re-used.\n\nThere is little to no replay value at all in this game.  No secrets to find, no hidden items.

Boxes needed to hold down switches and stuff getting stuck in the wall or not falling through the slot they are supposed to and having to spend a minute or two fidgeting around them to get them to go.

I'm a retro player, I love Stardew Valley and espically Terraria that are both pixel based games.\n\nPresentationLets see, I got about 5 minutes in and I just had to stop after the 3rd level. Firstly, there are Mario references everywhere, that is if the title's reference wasn't enough for you. You collect coins like Mario does. You jump on enemies like Mario does. You collect 100 coins to gain a 1Up like Mario does. You hit blocks like Mario does. Honestly, there is too much of the same idea here. And don't even start on the hearts you find in-game, they may not look like green mushrooms, but the sound of you collecting one of them, I can garentee that is ripped right out of the original Super Mario Bros.\nOther fren that. we are introduced to some things that were never seen in the Mario universe. At this time, you have a gun, and you only have limited ammo. The game however wants to encourage the player to jump on the enimes to reserve ammo, screamming Mario all over again. Ugh, you see what I mean? Look, I love the original mario, but this is just copying too much of it. I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't even sued the developers of the game yet!\nI also seem to suffer from a glitch in-game where the character dissapears whenever I move to the left. This makes platforming extremely anoyying for me because without the sprite of the character on screen, how are you suppose to even play the game? I even reinstalled the game to see if the problem would fix itself but it still happens.\n\nOverall OpinionLook, I like the art direction of the games sprites, but you might as well play a Mario game over this with all it's stong references about. Don't buy this for even 10c or even anything at all, it's not worthy of been on Steam in the first place.\n\nPersonal Score\nIsn't worthy to be scored","April 26","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's really not even worth a dime.\n\nThe game is actually unplayable. Everytime I move my character to the left the character turns invisible. I don't know why and I can't fix it. It's like trying to play Mario and everytime you touch the left arrow key Mario just disappears and you can't do anything about it.\n\nThe developer of this game should be ashamed of themselves LOL. Who would release a game that has such an obvious and terrible bug? There are flash games on coolmathgames.com that work better than this game.\n\nThe sad thing is I feel like this could actually be a decent Mario-esque game that I could enjoy, but the fact that you can't use the left arrow key is laughable.\n\nI feel like I was cheated out of a dime, so if you're thinking about buying this game full price please for your sake don't.","April 26","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Let me tell you what you are buying. That $1.00 is the amount of effort the developers put into this title, you are getting zero achievements, zero trading cards, zero forum support - the devs don't reply or even listen to their community, and a game with ZERO alpha testing - yes, it's riddled with bugs!\n\nYou are given the option to rebind controls, but lets face it, you are given 3 buttons to rebind and there are about 8 you use in-game. The controls while playing the game is quite obfuscated, it's not at all obvious on how to move a block back. In Zelda games, Link has a "Pushing" animation or "Pulling" animation, that doesn't exist in this game. Is that too much to ask??? I have never seen a game where pushing a block could be so frustrating lol, if you don't push a block far enough off a ledge, it'll often land in a spot where you simply cann't push it forward again.\n\nThis game allows you to shoot bullets and will replenish your ammo with hitting your head off certain floating blocks (lets face it, they are Mario "coin blocks"...). The first 3 levels are pretty good with giving you ammo, and giving you enemies to kill, but after that, the game focuses more on parkour than defeating enemies. If you like that sort of thing, more power to ya bud! It just seems to me that the weapon you use is a central mechanic in the game that's under used because there either isn't a need to use it (lack of enemies) or you are out of ammo because not enough is given throughout the levels.","January 31","false","0.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Unlike a lot of steam games (espacialy when it comes to platformers)  its average, but this time in a good way. The level design is not really challanging. The graphics look fine. The music is average (nothing that really sticks in your head), and the only real thing I don't like is the sound effects...their annoying and don't fit in with the rest of the game. The price however is good and makes you want to try it out. I like that you can shoot and not just jump on enemies, and with that comes very accessible ammo throughout the levels. Other than a few nit picks this game is great if you have a few dollars left and don't know what to do with it than I would recommend this game to most especially if you like older platformers like me. Also in a fair judgement this game in my opion is a 7.5/10. I hope you enjoy it as much as me.","January 31","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is this game. You play as Captain Super Mustashe sent on a mission to take out a robot named Gladius. Who has taken  control of the planet Uranus. 'nuff said. Its good enough for me. This is like the old school platforms like Megaman including the retro tech music. I like. Sure to frustrate you while you time your jumping, but for a low price and solid fun play with the Dev's obviously have a good sense of humor. You have a laser photon gun/pistol in witch you get upgrades OR you can jump on the alien baddies, up to you. Collect ammo for your gun and coins and hearts throughout the levels.

I mean, for example, at level 12 I can only pass through an obstacle if I have my gun upgraded. If I die in this obstacle, I respawn at the checkpoint without the upgrade, and to get it again I need to go way back almost to beginning of level (I found a way much harder to pass without the gun... Sooo try keep the gun). Things sometimes don't get intuitive when it needs, but can be solved with many tentatives.\n\nDespite these observations, I recommend it if you want a casual game to take a break from all the FPS and RPG and crazy-long-games-super-wow we play (:","February 22","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a super mario clone with OK controls, but ramps up the timed jump difficulty pretty quickly, which I find more frustrating than fun.  Personally, I'd prefer if it were easier.  The character control was decent, but not great.  It felts a lot more like playing a mario knock-off from the old Commadore64 days, but a little tigher and modern graphics.  I rather enjoyed levels 1-4.  But I grew frustrated with the timed jumps required in the 2nd half of level 5, and suddenly it wasn't fun anymore.  I had really hoped the fun wouldn't end until later levels.\n\nIt worked fine with an xbox360 gamepad, but first thing had to remap the buttons via its menus to something more intuitive to me (A=jump, B=dash, X=fire).  The level select screen doesn't support gamepad, but it works everywhere else.  Also the continue screen only registered Y to select (with my configuration, but wasn't a button to configure).","April 17","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
