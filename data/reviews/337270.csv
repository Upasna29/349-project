Still, I decided to take a chance on it, and in retrospect, I'm glad I did, because this is a great little game!\n\nSo, the basic game play I'd describe as a 3D platformer - you run, jump and otherwise maneuver yourself around in a three dimensional world, looking for eggs and the exit. Along the way, there is lots of other things to do. You can dig for treasure, look for chests, collect butterflies and ladybugs, kick trees over to collect fruit from them, take photographs of interesting things and much, much more.\n\nSometimes, getting to the exit isn't so straightforward - you may need to find keys, repair teleportation portals etc. And while I've never really felt stressed so far, the water is raising as you play, so you do have a time limit of sorts. Still, the game feels very chilled out, and you feel no pressure to rush - which is good, because the game is more about the exploration than just getting to the next level.\n\nAnother thing that is nice, and may appeal to parents looking for games for their kids, is that while you can kick various items to break them, and if you are playing cooperatively with another player, even that other player, it is not a violent game. I would not hesitate to put this in front of even fairly young kids, and moreover, I believe kids of all ages can have a blast playing it. Even though there are levels and criteria for winning, most levels can be treated as sandboxes in which you can do your own thing, rather than working towards the goals of the level.\n\nAnd best of all, you do not need to be a kid to appreciate what the game has to offer - I certainly did!","February 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","59","62","4","0"

I find myself positively enjoying this game.\nIt reminds me a lot of the old PlayStation games I used to play as a kid. It's a fairly simple 3D platformer. You roam around each island trying to escape. Along the way you can collect eggs, food, and treasures like hats and skins. There's also multiplayer, although I haven't tried that yet.\nIt's certainly not the most polished game out there, but it's just so simple and harmless and makes me grin from ear to ear. The devs are constantly providing major updates. This, along with Steam Workshop integration, means there's a constant flow of new content for the game.\nMaybe I'm a bit bias because this reminds me so strongly of my childhood, but I really am enjoying this game tons.","March 26, 2015","true","1.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddiesonne/recommended/337270/","ddiesonne","NOOB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddiesonne/","1002 products in account","Initially I felt like bashing the game, as I really couldn't get used to controlling the ostrich, and I still can’t, and I think improving the clunky controls is a must for its developers, but I managed to pass over the bashing phase thanks to the fact that the game is quite addictive. The continuous exploration, the permanent little novelties to be discovered, and the feeding of rather easy Steam achievements kept me going, and I ended up actually liking the game.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Original concept;\nWell, there’s no other game in which the main character is an ostrich, is it? And that’s more than enough for many people, including me, to raise an eyebrow and give this game a try.\n- Decently cute;\nNot irresistibly cute, but still cute enough to be appealing for those looking for cuteness.\n- There’s plenty of variation and complexity.\nThe exploration part is pretty well-done. There’s always something new to find out, from small items to entire locations. As soon as I was about to start getting bored of the beaches’ setup, some skeleton-filled caves’ setup was next, at the right time to shift things considerably and keep me interested.\n- Steam achievements;\nSome people, including me, care about them, and the good part is that in this game, these achievements just keep on coming, plenty, and quite easily.\n- Steam trading cards;\n- A quite interesting leaderboard system;\nIt’s nice to know where you stand compared to all the other people playing this game, and not just your friends. Anyway, the way the leaderboards’ system works is still rather unclear to me, as it’s unsure to me if it takes into consideration only a general score (points) or a value depicting the general progress throughout the game (percentage of completed maps/levels).\n- The ostrich is customizable\nwith items that you get just by playing the game. You find the items in the game and they’re yours to keep and equip. There are no other costs involved, like when it comes to other games (DLCs and stuff). The items are pretty cute so far, and I’m sure when they’ll get more numerous, and especially more diverse (currently only skins, hats and sunglasses are available), they’ll make the game even more attractive.\n- Comes with coop mode\nwhich I haven’t got the chance to try yet, but I’m sure it’s a nice addition to the game’s feature list.\n- The developers are active in the community and interested in feed-back\nwhich is a nice thing, it’s good to know they actually care about improving the game and providing a proper experience.\n\nCONS (or more like a suggestion list):\n\n- The controls seriously need some kind of radical refurbishment, at the moment they feel very clunky and laggy. After taking my hands off the forward key, especially after it already started running, the ostrich won’t immediately stop moving forward, but it’ll still move a bit, often just enough to make it go ahead and sink into water, making me lose a life in a pretty frustrating manner. Overall, the movement mechanics are pretty awkward, as moving the mouse changes the camera view (often in a rather imprecise way), while the ostrich’s position and direction is changed only by keys. Getting used to these issues might not come easily for some players, especially since the keys/mouse/controlling configuration is not customizable.\n\n- It’s missing some settings that I think they’re otherwise needed. Besides the aforementioned lacking of customizable controls for the camera view, there are also no screen brightness settings (at my work computer I could barely see chests in the dark caves), and no mouse sensitivity settings (which, by being set to a lower value, might make the camera view control less abrupt and awkward at times). Some settings, like the screen resolution ones, should be available right from within the game during its playing, not only by accessing its main menu (the start screen). As for the graphical quality settings, I failed to notice any actual difference yet between those levels, but maybe it’s just me. Anyway, I know for sure that settings (a specific configuration containing windowed mode of a certain screen resolution) failed to be saved and I have to re-enter it every time I start the game.\n\nAlso, I really think that toggle-able automatic running should be an available option. I’m really not ok with the ostrich starting to run automatically after I keep the forward key pressed a little longer. Some people might be ok with it, but if I could, I would’ve disabled it. If I wanted to run, I’d rather press the “run” key and that’s it.\n\n- The background music is ok-ish but while some in-game sounds are pretty well-chosen (like the “death” sound when a skeleton runs you over), other are rather annoying, somehow "cheap", and a bit too loud compared to the rest (like when you pick up an egg)\n\n- The graphics are rather poor, not in the sense they’re not advanced and sophisticated (which they are not, but that’s not the problem), but in the sense that they’re somewhat buggy and glitch-y. Seeing through walls in the cave levels happened to me not just once, and the ostrich actually floating with approximation over non-existent surfaces is something I already got used to.\n\n- The storyline could’ve received some more attention. A simple additional screen at the start of the game, which explains what happened to the ostrich, what’s with the islands, what’s with the skeletons, and so on, would’ve been nice. Otherwise the game feels a bit weird, chaotic, and superficial, mostly because of giving the feeling that random elements have been blended in, just for the sake of it (skeletons?!).\n\nIn conclusion, though it’s got some quite a few issues at the moment, the game is still worth playing. I have fun playing it despite all the aforementioned issues, and that’s all that matters.","January 13, 2015","true","12.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","2"

Freely explorable levels with tonnes of collectables, secret items and areas and a few traps and enemies! Obviously it's not up to Spyro's level of polish, but as the first game by this developer I see bright things in their future - they might not have incredible programming expertise or artistic talent but game design, theme and character they've got down pat.\n\nThe game itself is a collect-a-thon with a huge number of hidden secrets. You can play the entire game alone, but you can do some fun stuff with a friend (like jumping on your heads and kicking each other). You can tackle each level however you like - sprint through to the end of each one and you'll get through it in no time, but look for every secret and you'll be here for a very long time. There seems to be a glitch where Steam doesn't track your time played correctly because a friend and I spent about 4 hours in the first 8 levels having a blast!\n\nIf you want to snoop around every level and find everything you can this game is definitely for you! It's a reasonable price for hours of gameplay (especially fun with a friend) and it even has Steam trading cards so you can get a bit of that price back!\n\nThis game bodes well for MeDungeon Ltd.

I'm a bit concerned about his relationships with these other residents of the island who failed to notify him of this natural disaster. Anywho, you must now escape and rejoin up with your family and friends. Let the adventure begin!\nSo the point of the game is to move from island to island discovering hidden achievements and collectibles and doing them in a timely manner will reward a greater score and possible achievements. This will be no easy feat though. You will be faced with some difficult tasks along the way. Ever seen an ostrich do parkour or go for a stroll underwater? Well you will now. Wall jump your way to collectibles you need, or waddle your way under the ocean as you search for eggs, ladybugs and fruits! The replayability of the game is high as well. At the end of each island you're awarded a score that will be determined by how many collectibles are found and some collectibles will dissapear within a certain time after you spawn in so there are actual stradegies to completing with a high score.  I have already found myself returning to completed islands to aquire a better score on the leaderboards.\nThe game is fun to say the least. I really enjoyed my playthrough and stayed interested the entire time. You can customize your ostrich with hats, skins and glasses you find along the way as well which adds a great deal of humor to it. I definitely reccomend picking this game up and convincing a friend to get it as well since there is online coop.

The game isn't perfect, but the developers do listen to viewer feedback and make updates based on this feedback, which is really great and something that I very much appreciate.\n\nOverall it's really fun and cute game that never fails to put a smile on my face. It's even more fun to play with friends, too! The 2-Pack is really worth it, because the only thing more fun than being an ostrich is being an ostrich with your friends.","June 17, 2015","true","5.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

None of this is explained, mind you, instead leaving you to bounce around levels clipping through the environment, collecting hats you can't equip (until the game miraculously decides you're worthy and they begin to work), and generally breaking the game in order to proceed. Most objectives are optional, but without them the game is nearly entirely empty, so you're left with either rushing through accomplishing nothing or struggling with challenges I never understood even after completing them which in essence accomplsh nothing as well.\n\nCoop had the slight potential to salvage a terribly clunky, often malfunctioning experience, but naturally it's just as unintuitive and poorly implemented, with levels often becoming even more faulty when you introduce another player and objectives tending to require repeat playthroughs so as to allow both players to complete them. Controls are stiff, generally unresponsive, terribly mapped (especially on controller, which despite what is listed on the store page is far from fully supported), and wonky enough that I'd often fly wildly out of control simply trying to perform a normal jump let along trying to complete some of the more strenuous platforming sections.\n\nEverything about Ostrich Island screams of a missed opportunity and a misunderstanding of what it wants to be. The idea is so absurd it's almost endearing by itself, but it's hard to even find dressing your ostrich up like a cow wearing heart shaped glasses amusing when everything is breaking apart around you and you're still expected to somehow make it through. It's not impassible if you're determined enough to push through a ceaseless technical disaster, but there's nothing on the other side to have in any way made it worthwhile.","January 12, 2015","false","2.8"," 45 of 88 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","45","88","5","5"

When I launched the game my ears were r4ped by the sound, it was so loud it woke everyone in my house up. This was at 4am and I bought this game to keep me awake. I went into the first mission and I was impressed with this game, the graphics are sublime! This game is simply beautiful, only the masterpiece called Zlate: How to throw. Furthermore I was impressed by all of sand in which I could put my DONG. However I was bricking myself when I saw a crab because I knew it was going to rap me.\n\nMemes\n\nThis game is simply amazing it great fun. It kept me awake all night and I wanted more. I kept drilling my shlong into the sand until I finished the level. Oh, and the eggs they are the best especially the gold eggs. I mean how painful must it be to crab out a gold egg? I have real respect for the Ostrich's that poo out those things, simply beautiful. However I would not recommend this game for anyone under the age of 13 as it can be quite scary. There is lots of jump scare crabs everywhere all over the shop. They jump out of the boats and the walls. Oh and how can I forget the Jerry cans they are great, because if you put your dong in them they will blow you up. What more do you want? Great game mechanics and fun game overall! I did enjoy getting that sweet Ostrich Pootang Points at the end of the level. Probably the best part about the game. This game is next level. You can put a hat on the end of your shlong so when you go for the pootang you are able to hide it and be sneaky beaky like.\n\nConclusion\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone as it is a perfect game and an example to any game developers of how to make a game correctly (I'm looking at you Zlate: How to throw Pt II). Please go out and buy this game you won't regret it. It was one of the best decisions of my life and it will be the best decision you will ever make, because this game is like no other.

Well, now you do, and it is all thanks to Ostrich Island, by MeDungeon Games! We have taken control of goats, become cops, tried our hand at farming and even become slices of bread, so it was high time that an ostrich simulator showed up. They aren’t the brightest of birds though, having not noticed the volcanic eruption going on around them. But neither would you if you spent most of the day with your head in the sand. Our intrepid flightless pal is on a mission to escape the island. rejoin his family, and maybe even pick up some trendy accessories whilst they are at it.\n\nOstrich Island splits its levels up over several islands, tasking you with collecting eggs, bugs, and kicking everything in sight. If it’s there, you can kick it! It is slightly reminiscent of games you might find in PC game collections whenever you purchased a new computer, back in the late 1990s; the type that invariably came with various pieces of Kindersley software. That is to say, as a product, Ostrich Island is quite primitive.\n\nThe basic objective for each stage is to make it to the bubble portal which transports you to the next stage. Why the portal is made of bubbles is anybody’s guess, maybe ostriches love bubbles, who knows? As an aside, each island has various hidden collectibles like fedora hats, sunglasses, golden eggs and other cosmetic items for you to find. Golden eggs can be used to purchase extra lives if you run out, or you can invest them in new special abilities for your ostrich. If you’ve always wanted to jump or run just that little bit faster you should hang on to them. Sight-seeing types can also use their cameras to take selfies with various items scattered around the island in return for golden eggs, so get snapping!\n\nNobody likes to be a lonely ostrich though, so you can rope a pal in to play cooperatively with you, or, you know, to kick you into the water repeatedly. It is a given that you will end up kicking the living cluck out of each other, rather than escaping the island, but it is fun all the same!\n\n\nJust like the “simulator” games that came before it, Ostrich Island is a little bit buggy. Rather, it is a big bit buggy. The various faults run from slightly amusing to frustrating. The most pressing issue is just how slippery your ostrich is to control. They are also very sensitive and will sometimes shoot way ahead of where you wanted them to go, especially when using the run function. Other niggles include the game’s dated graphics and repetitive music, but the jolly archipelago atmosphere goes a long way towards washing those issues away.\n\nThere’s no denying that Ostrich Island is a pleasant game to play, and I couldn’t help crack a smile at my own fedora tipping birdie, and I’m a grown (kinda) adult! It is quite clear though that, from its Steam page, this ostrich is meant primarily  for kids; either that or for streamers to play it ironically, like they did with Goat Simulator.\n\nIf you do have children Ostrich Island is sure to keep them quite for a few hours, meanwhile the more juvenile among you might also get kick out of cooperatively aggravating your friends. Me on the other hand, I’m still waiting patiently for my sloth simulator. Take note, MeDungeon Games.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks to MeDungeon Games for review code.

Islands are very repetitive. Controls are clunky (often fell to my death beacuse of it) Couldnt type a password in to play with a friend which made online games very hard. The online system needs to be easier to connect to friends. Took me and a friend a while just to figure out how to join each other.\n\nAt first this game looks fun and cute, me and a friend bought it for fun online coop gameplay. We read the reviews on here to see if it was worth the £2. It wasnt.\n\nThis game reminds me of the over the topness and stupidness of Goat Similator and the level design of 3D platformers like Banjo and Kazooie. I got a refund after an hour of playing this as it was repetitive and boring.\n\n2/5","April 8","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
