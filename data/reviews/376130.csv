I have yet to inspect the full elements of the game but so far have the basics pretty down. The point of the game so far as I can tell is to gather intelligence through formats of info such as pamphlets, discs, etc. You may also be given the objective to kill a specific man in the world. You are fighting back to learn more information of the truth and you do so by rampaging throughout your world killing all you see. Everything represented by letters and/or symbols of the text appearance and plenty of objects being made out of them.\n\nPros:\n-The game's controls are tight and responsive.\n-You can immerse yourself into the game as you progress.\n-Different variables to the game to assist you and thus adding more possibilities such as money.\n-The style of it is very easy on the eyes and something I have yet seen be done.\n-Such as any Rogue like game you have the need to explore every nook and cranny to advance and  gain better equipment.\n-Potential of endless hours of enjoyment.\n\nCons:\n-Level Design is limited and possibly seems repetetive.\n-The AI is a tad forgetful once they see you as soon as you hide behind a wall they forget all about you and just stay.\n-The AI gets tuck a lot on just simple corners.\n-I see a lack of much variety in equipment so far only have gotten a hat and not very specific kind either, it's a hat.\n-The aiming is a tad awkward as it seems your aiming for an enemy but in reality your shooting the corner of a building, so the gun shots themselves are more to the right than they are centered.\n-Keys for doors seem pointless as you can just kick them down.\n-Depending on the color of the enemy you may or may not see them as they just flat out blend in with the enviroment.\n-Immersion can be broken easily when you have to reach for 'I' to open the inventory.\n-Yet to have customizable controls.\n-Have yet to see any story or plot whatsoever as you continue on.\n-When you spawn you best be ready because more than likely you'll be surrounded already.\n\nIf you have the money to spend buy this game if you're looking for a decent time waster. If not then wait for a bit if you're not that super excited over it. The game could have potential but it is VERY limited. Not one of the best Rogue Like games, but it's decent enough for it to not be terrible.","August 11, 2015","false","0.6"," 108 of 158 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","108","158","6","0"

You will dwelve into the life you know you have. The quality of this game makes me forget what time it is. I can feel temptation as I hear the drumming of the sound, the sound of our future. ASCII numbers and letters will forever and always haunt my life. This game brings realization, with top notch sound/music effects. The world is like my mind, deep with uncertainty, a void that is filled with logical nonsense. This game is like a drug, some of you will see it as not your thing, but some of you, will see this as an awakening.. a spiritual path through our life, I will cherish this game for as long as I can. I truly believe this is a beautiful masterpiece that will stay hidden and only a few of us will be able to carve into its inner beauty. Give it a shot, you might like it, you might not, but don't say I never warned you to stay away or to cave in. Numbers and letters have always been the answer to everything, what we made. We are the beginning and the end, but this game, this product of perfection, has no end. Even if it did you can't reach it. This game test all who is willing to enter what has been unknown to us since the beginning of mankind.\n\nThis game is a gift from the Gods. Buy this game, have a smoke, and enjoy the inside of your mind.","August 11, 2015","true","10.1"," 35 of 54 people (65%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","65","35","54","22","0"

I felt like it was bad ; however, that doesn't mean it's bad overall. I understand some (seemingly a majority) of people may appreciate it, I highly recommand to do just as I did : grab the game, give it a shot, and if you're not ok with it, ask for a refund.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't recommand this to everyone, for many (uncommon) reasons.\n\nFirst of all, there's no way to rebind the keys in this game, and that's a huge concern for me, as a left-handed player. Everything has been thought for a right-handed customer (and even then, most people like to have their own key bindings, I guess). That gave me quite some struggle with my keyboard and my mouse to find a somehow comfortable way to play.\n\nBefore going any further, I would like to say that these bindings issues are refraining me from playing anymore of this game. I did not play it alot, I do not know much about the plot and the storyline(s), and from what I've seen, it does not look all that great. Still though, understand that this review isn't covering every single aspect of the game, it would be closer to first impressions, since I'm having a hard time even playing.\n\nThe mouse sensitivity. I'm used to a very low mouse sensitivity, and it was so high, I coldn't even figure if which one (from 0 to 11) of the values was the lowest sensitivity.\n\nThe music is nearly inexistant or poorly done, decreasing even farther my will of going farther into the game. I know, these musics or the silence are quite a personal and subjective point ; in my opinion, I think I shold not censor what I think of the game.\n\nThe graphics are very original, that's what attracted me the most to this game, even if it unfortunately led to quite a disappointment. This game may be good, but the unchangeable binds prevent me from discovering it more deeply.\n\nI can't recommand this to everyone, especially if you're left-handed.","December 25, 2015","false","0.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","11"

The whole "only ascii letter" thing is anyhow cool and it feels just cool how everything "explodes" in those lil tiny asciis.\n\nWell thats pretty much all prositiv about this game, really. I mean dont get me wrong but thats it coz the game has really a lot of bugs right now which "NEEEEEEDDDSSS" to be fixed.\n\nSome samples:\n- Sometimes your Hud plays crasy: in one moment is shows you youre hungry so you go eating something, maybe even 2 times "FOOD" than you are suddenly so full you need to puke? Da fuq? Another time is tells me i have no bullets left, if i change my gun into one of the others and switch than back i suddendly have bullets back in the gun. okeeeeeey?\n\n- Sometimes the menu "stuck" if you dont press the EXACT right button to leave it, as sample: I opens inventory, enter to use a item and X if you used it. If you dont press now X and press insteed I to leave the inventory, the inventory keeps so long frozen till you PRESS X, if you dont you are not able to use a item EVER again.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=500019044\n- The Weapons feel pretty much like the same, i mean some appiers stronger but they all act like a normal, straight shooting gun - even the "shotguns", sadly. Some shoot faster, some slower, some are stronger but thats really it. they maybe look different but handle like the same.\n\n- The Enemys (Letters) appiers pretty stupit. They act like they really wana only getting close to you, using different kind of "weapons". The most horrible thing is that those Enemys can "wallcheating /-hacking" - which simply means they can shoot thru walls - so hidding behind one will not help.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=500018863\n- It looks like it only gives 3 kinds of "random" stages which is pretty less if you think about the whole game costs you (about) 11€. Also the "random" placement is even not the best (look picture)...\n\n-A very very very very simple "hunger" system. I duno why it IS even in this game. It makes no sense to be in this game and as much as i played the game, the only "opinion" to "fill" this system with was, literally, "FOOD" and nothing else...\n\n- It is pretty  much everytime the same, either you "hunt" for items or have to kill a special "letter" (ENEMY~). Thats kinda it. Also you can finish each stage in less than 2 minutes, if you rush them...\n\nFact\nIlluminascii looks like a great game but the game self is so much buged that it *NEEDS* kinda a lot of updates, like a lot lot. The Enemy AI is stupit and they appier to wallhack/-cheat, the weapons act like the same, the random placement is pretty weird and the missions and stages appiers like pretty much the same time after time. For 11€ a mess of bugs and not worth it, even the maybe nice idea in graficstyle not. If those stuff get really fixed some day it might be making more fun and i would sure overwork my review.","August 14, 2015","false","1.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","7","12","3","0"

I love the ASCII theme, just like in some oldschool roguelike such as Nethack!\n\nThe gameplay itself is a mix of some roguelike, RPG elements (random levels and names, hunger etc. + experience points and statpoints) and FPS. It works well enough together, but the game lacks some polishing. For example, sensitivity settings only affect vertical mouse sensitivity.\n\nOtherwise the game is just fine and entertains me well enough to keep me playing, but I dislike two things:\n\n1. The music is kinda.. Blergh. It feels really glitchy and weird. I feel like that was the devs intention, but it.. Could be better. I usually disable the music and just set Hotline Miami soundtrack on the background. Maybe someone else will like the music though!\n\n2. Enemies are.. Boring looking. They're just letters of the alphabet. Now, I know they're an obvious reference to old roguelikes with ASCII graphics, since in those games enemies were just letters with some name. I still would've liked it more if atleast some of the enemies would have had somekind of animated sprite made with ASCII graphics. Atleast the names of the enemies are entertaining: Nothing like getting attacked by a Horny Politician. (The names are randomized.)\n\nOverall Illuminascii can be an entertaining and fun game but only if you get most of the jokes, and like the oldschool ASCII style. The jokes are usually references on things people who have played older roguelikes can get. I recommend this game to anyone who liked older roguelikes, maybe not for the gameplay, but for the neat visuals and references.","October 5, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I swear that it is like someone hacked the developer's computer, stole the (unfinished) game and launched it on Steam.\n\nIf you saw the trailers, what you see is what you get, but to be honest, as much as I like certain aspects of this game, it just feels lazy and ends up being broken. There is absolutely no reason to buy this as there is barely a difference from the free 7DFPS version from where this game came from plus the fact that it featured randomly generated cutscenes that are missing in this version.\n\nWhat do I mean by broken and lazy:\n\n-The clue finding levels involve you searching containers around the level area for an X number of clues and leave the area when you have them. You interact with the container and there is a (fair) chance that it drops a clue for you to pick up. The problem is that as long as you haven't picked up the clues, you still have the chance to have the containers drop more of them. And NO there is not the excuse of "it is not broken because that X is the minimum your character needs" because the clues stop dropping once you get all you need.\n\n-Some doors are locked and need a key, but you can kick down all doors. Noticed the problem there?\n\n-On the title screen it says: "Press f6 to clear data". What data? There are no savegames and there is not any kind of leaderboard.\n\n-The UI is a mess and don't get me started on the you-can-only-navigate-down-the-item-column inventory.\n\n-Though there are plenty of lovely ASCII based weapon sprites, the reload animation is the same for ALL of the weapon tipes and they end up only being different in the stats.\n\n-The gameplay ends up being boring. As you beat the levels, the enemies get more HP and deal more damage. You find better weapons to deal more damage and level up you character.\n\n-The outdoor levels are shamelessly defined by a black wall of nothing.\n\n-No key rebinding.\n\n-It is badly optimized.\n\n-Strangely enough, what is shown in ASCII is actually neatly detailed: interact with lamps and they turn on/off, interact with shower heads and sinks and they drop ASCII water. touch fireplaces and you get burn damage, etc.","September 30, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
