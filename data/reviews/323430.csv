Fantastic.\n\nYou play as a crow going through an interesting story: Firstly you fly over exploring open world areas discovering story points, objectives, challenges and 'trinkets' for upgrading your crow. While your at it enjoying the scenery because whilst the game may not be graphically amazing, great design and aesthetic result in a nice looking game. The open world areas are not big but there's a few, varied and they're large enough to explore.\nSecond aspect of the gameplay is the objectives. Completing tasks and challenging the 'guardians' take on a linear set flight path where you balance your energy for shields and attacks, dodging & blocking hazards & attacks while taking down the enemy. Again made a good effort to put in some variety here not to mention you're given choice to 'spare or curse' guardians so I'll be playing again to try the other path.\n\nThey've got the feel of the game perfect. Flying and gliding your crow around is a great sensation and doesn't at any time feel too slow or too jerky giving the game a great atmosphere and that brings me onto the music.\nAn awesome soundtrack masterfully tops off the good design and feel. It gives weight to the story, makes exploration sections feel open and relaxing and fights become epic encounters. In case you missed it, you get the remastered (9 tracks, 18½min runtime, 48KHz 256kbps mp3) soundtrack with the game.\n\nOverall I really enjoy this game and certainly think it's worth a look. One thing could maybe add is oculus rift support when Oculus decide to make an end commercial product. Being an originally mobile developed game shouldn't put you off. It's still a well made game and seems to be a decent quality port running smooth with no glitches and looks like supports all resolutions.","October 7, 2014","true","3.3"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","54","63","2","0"

As harbinger of his coming, it falls to you to aid the evil entity in his mad quest. Crow is set within a medieval backdrop that tells of magic and nature being in disarray, whereupon the Dark Lord will rise and take over. But in order for him to come into the world and exert his influence, he needs to leech off others. To achieve this, the Dark Lord has tapped into the mind of the titular crow, an actual bird given the power to cast spells. Crow takes off into the air and his objective is to curse his marks and mercilessly destroy them to feed his master’s growing taste for power.\nYou’re almost never on the ground, and when you are, it is only to take a break to read story sections that flesh out the plot of the game. These are presented from the dark tone of your master and a benevolent entity that asks Crow to reconsider his servitude. The game consists of flying over four different maps while using a mouse pointer to uncover secrets and click on points of interest to engage the story, collect trinkets to power Crow’s skills up, and initiate events and encounters. The maps are limited in design and discovery is usually done by spamming mouse clicks until you’re done finding everything. Missions involve Crow moving through a predetermined flight path while the player helps him by steering the bird towards loose trinkets, health and energy pick-ups and performing offensive and defensive maneuvers.\nCrow is an easy game to jump into and exclusively played with the mouse. If you’ve ever played any game on the Nintendo DS or 3DS then you’re likely to figure out the controls by instinct. Even if you haven’t experienced a touch pad game before, Crow easily conveys maneuverability and actions. To attack successfully, you must wait until an enemy locks their eyes onto you before you can slow down time to cast spells. The claw spell is your main attack and the protection spell can be craftily used to defend yourself and launch a counterattack. It’s simple gameplay in the form of an obstacle gauntlet you must survive through while defeating numerous foes and bosses.\nTo influence gameplay and character progression, skills are unlocked by your actions during specific events. To channel power from the defeated bosses into your master, Crow must curse a weakened boss, thus killing them and receiving part of the power in the form of a new skill; but he can also choose to spare these creatures, forfeiting the latter and making the Dark Lord angry at Crow. As the story progresses, the master’s attitude towards Crow will change depending on what kind of servant the bird is and this will indubitably change how the player approaches subsequent challenges and encounters with or without additional skills.\nCrow‘s flight sequences are similar to Spyro The Dragon‘s famous bonus flight levels. The only difference is that Crow follows a predetermined path. Collected trinkets can be used to enhance existing skills once enough have been acquired, and every challenge you find can be repeatedly played to beat your own high-score. I didn’t feel that this added a lot to the game honestly, mainly because the flight levels are very short experience and the challenges don’t offer anything memorable enough to warrant a replay.\nCrow is a simple and short journey that doesn’t offer sizeable morsels to its plate, but players interested in story will find Crow’s tale of action and consequence to enough to keep them engaged during exploration and action downtime. For a title offered from the iOS store, the graphics did not really impress me, with its square-y textures and flat visuals; but the music is a different story. Perfectly soothing while in free roam and epic during showdowns. Crow manages to be good, but it’s not “hold-your-breath here it comes” good.","July 12, 2015","true","17.9"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

True: I've not gotten far into it, and only scratched the surface of the story after half an hour. And I'd love to know what the game is all about. But the horrible controls don't allow me to do that: I feel like I have barely control over the crow. To make matters a lot worse: this is probably the first game ever which got me motion-sick. I've played thousands upon thousands of hours in first-person shooters, some of them very fast moving ones, and never got this feeling before. But I can tell you: it's horrible to feel and it makes me really sick. I guess it's because of the fact that the entire screen wobbles while flying, looking upon the crow in third-person view from over the shoulder (and pretty far of). There's no fixed point left, no horizon, and apparently I can't have that.\n\nSo although the idea is interesting, I can't recommend this game because I can't play it. If better ported, maybe the motion sickness wouldn't kick in that bad, I don't know. Truth is: it never feels like a pc game at all.","October 11, 2015","false","0.4"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","0"

May have benefited from being in 'Early Access' but for the price-point it's not a bad buy I would suggest.\n\n\nTLDR;\n\nWhile there's plenty to say 'steer clear' I'm going to go with a 'buy' recommendation though as the developer seems to be quite involved and willing to listen to the community.\n","October 10, 2014","true","0.9"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

You'll be exploring small maps flying around and trying to uncover hidden trinkets (to earn skill points) or point of interest: once you're done the actual fight starts and this section plays somewhat similarly to an on-rail shooter.\nCrow is a mobile port and, despite an upgrade for the Steam release, it shows in its simple gameplay: the concept and story are intriguing though and are original enough to make it worth a shot if you're interested.\n\nPROS:\n\n-the graphics are decent and pretty, considering it was originally a mobile game\n\n-the soundtrack is quite nice and has a dark, epic feel to it\n\n-while you can't expect the depth of an RPG the story is quite interesting and pretty original\n\n-the fight section gameplay is nice and controls well\n\n-good level and boss variety\n\n-the fact you can choose to take revenge or spare bosses adds a nice touch and justifies a second playthrough for those interested in seeing what happens\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n-one of the two paths is noticeably easier, but you won't know that until you follow it\n\nCONS:\n\n-some graphical elements stand up as noticeably simpler due to its mobile origin, some textures don't hold up well when you fly nearby and human enemy models are very simple both in looks and animations\n\n-the exploration gameplay section feels a bit slow and dull as you fly around somewhat aimlessly trying to uncover what you need\n\n-the ending is delivered through credits and feels quite lacking\n\n-pretty short,expect about an hour and a half\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546846171\n\nCrow is a simple game with an equally simple gameplay, as long as you know that and are ok with it its story and narrative are good enough to keep you interested with their mix of dark magic, myths and nature spirits. It's a bit sad that said story is only told through text whenever you reach a point of interest, a few more cutscenes'd have been appreciated for sure.\n\nThe actual gameplay is ok,as mentioned above the world exploration is honestly "meh" at best and felt like filler while the on-rail fights were actually quite fun despite their simplicity: you'll also be able to unlock and upgrade a few skills whenever you gather enough points and this very light RPG element adds some depth to the game.\n\nAll things considered I think Crow was a satisfying experience and it'd be the same for you if you like this kind of game and/ or love crows: the price is honestly way too much for what it has to offer though. Thankfully Crow has been often put in bundles, or you can wait for a deep sale on it.","November 2, 2015","true","1.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Graphics arent bad, especially for a mobile port. Textures and animations are pretty simplistic though. Considering its origins, I think that is to be expected. Where this game shines however, is the audio. The sound track is amazing and perfectly fits the tone of the game.\n\nExploring is kind of fun. Its a relaxing break inbetween fights which allows you to collect gems (by clicking them) which unlocks the boss fight, challenges, story, as well as lets you upgrade your abilities, such as your shield or your energy regeneration. There is also a nice button to allow you to get the "birds eye view", which lets you see the entire map you are currently on which can help if you still need to collect your gems.\n\nAs far as abilities go, you can only claw and shield. Clawing only works when you can see your enemies eyes, and you use it by making a "slash" with your mouse. Shield works by drawing a circle. To use abilities though, you need to have the energy to do them. The controls are fairly responsive which was very nice to see from a mobile port.\n\nThe story is fairly simple as well (which you can sort of expect since you play as a bird). Basically, you are a crow that met a dark spirit that gave you some powers and wants you to use them to destroy things. While you are progressing, you start to have a second/good voice that encourages you to forgive instead of destroy. Which voice you follow determines which end path you get set on.\n\nThe only real downside to this game (for me) is the length and lack of depth. The game can easily be completed in an hour or two, which doesnt leave much room to expand on the world of the game. Id have loved to know more about the "ancients" and the baron in the third act. The game lets you have a quick peak into what could very easily be an immersive, fantasy world, but they dont have the time to expand on it, so you get to fight a couple ancients with little backstory (why do they exist? what do they do?), and fight a baron who was trying to enslave an ancient (we learn why in game and I dont want to spoil, but what gave him the idea to do it? what is the history behind him?).\n\nOverall though, I do recommend this game, especially if you see it on sale. Even if the story is a bit shallow, its a nice quick little adventure with a very nice soundtrack, decent graphics, that plays pretty well.","January 28","true","2.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Though it has to be said that even getting it at half price I still felt I didn't get too much bang for my buck with the whole game being easily complete-able in well under 2 hours.  But I still feel this is worth recommending.\nThe game consists of essentially 2 game modes.  One where you are free to explore as you steer your crow around a small open area, finding collectables (or "trinkets") and unearthing further nuggets of story.  And the story missions which functions quite like a semi-on-the-rails shooter (or slasher) as you fly about, collecting gems to allow upgrades, deploying shields to fend off incoming missles, and attacking enemies.\nDeploying shields and issuing slash attacks is quite nicely implemented, as you have to press an action key and then draw the appropriate symbol onscreen with your mouse.\nThe game does not hide it's phone origins with its focus on drawing symbols and easy difficulty, but it offers a suitably unique experience that is worth having.  It marginally increases its difficulty over the course of the two hours but it's still on the easy side, with the end boss being the only real challenge which resulted in a couple of repeats.\n\nThere is a choice element at the end of each chapter, a simple binary good/evil choice, which I assume has an effect on the ending cinematic, an assumption based on the ending I saw.\n\nThere are also some optional challenge missions that function very similarly to the scripted story missions only they are repeatable, but weren't enticing enough to have me coming back for any more.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what else this developer puts out.\n","October 2, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

There is a challenge mode which adds a bit of replayability to the overall experience, but if you're looking for value for your money, go with something else.","February 5, 2015","false","2.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The gameplay, however, is barely there. There are two modes. First one is "exploration" of tiny maps by flying over them, looking for gems, story pies and level entrances. Second one is a clunky rail shooter, except without shooting: you avoid projectiles and other dangers (never sure where to go or even what might hit you), and once in a blue moon get to cast one of two spells. Both moving and casting (done with gestures) feels very unresponsive: it's an experience of dragging a spoon through thick jelly, not flying on bird's wings.\nThis game belongs on tablets, where controlling a bird and casting spells with you finger rather than a mouse, might add an additional level of "wow".

It has great graphics and although it's a mobile port, the models are great (although unavoidably low-poly except the crow) and the textures decent (they even have bumpmaps on them which shade greatly with the lighting in the game).\n\nThe gameplay is well optimized and the performance incredible. There is just a sliiiight delay on the movement when swiping with the mouse (which is also probably present on the mobile version) but it's nothing that keeps the game from being enjoyed. The fights are engaging and although repetitive they do pose meaningful combat to the story.\n\nIt has some flaws though, such as randomly freezing, where it doesn't really freeze but the crow just keeps on going without anything being able to be done (like pressing the spacebar). Eventually pressing escape blackens the screen and you have to quit the process in taskmanager.\n\nOther than that, there is absolutely nothing I can't recommend with crow. Maybe a little explanation would be helpful at the start as you're just put in the middle of the game with no background whatsoever, but after quickly understanding the story and what you are able to choose for in-game and the consequences that come with it Crow will simply fill your time with great a great experience that is better than many PC games that weren't even ported.","October 13, 2014","true","4.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"
