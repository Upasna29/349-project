I've put two hours into it so far and I can tell you that I am definitely not disappointed and enjoying it a lot!\n\nInnoquous 5 is a really fun and addicting puzzle-platformer, filled with hours of content, satisfying gameplay. and lots of great music. Levels are original and nicely designed. Game modes are awesome and keep the game interesting. There's also controller support which makes everything even better.\n\nThis game is totally worth the low price, considering the high amount of content it brings you.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI've put more than 13 hours into the game as of today and I have to say I'm quite addicted to it right now. Once you get more involved into playing this game, you'll begin to feel the urge to complete it entirely and get all achievements. It does get really difficult though, but that doesn't take away all the fun it has to offer.\n\nDevelopers are also really nice and open to suggestions. They'll respond and try to help you out as soon as they can. Exactly what a great game like this one needs.\n\nAgain, definitely worth checking this out!","May 14","true","26.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

So far, no cheap deaths to level components that I couldn't see, and levels are short so dying isn't a hassle. Each level has a bunch of mutators (additional enemies, ghost that follows your steps and kills you on touch, and a few others), so there's definitely some replay value. The music is good and the experience is very polished. You can tell that the creators knew what they were doing and actually cared about making a game that didn't feel cheap.","May 14","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have only tried it out for about 10-15 minutes but clearing the first few levels in all modes was fun! controls are solid (have to see if I can enable WASD, Haven't checked yet) and the levels seems to be straightforward at the beginning but still challenging when you just start. I'll update as I get further along but the one thing that I do appreciate is that in the settings you can toggle on/off the music you like or dislike in the playlist. Also, you can slide the music volume around if you prefer slight background noise or full 100% volume!","May 14","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While YoyoGames was full of trash, there were a few good games. And Innoquous games were some of them.\nWhile I haven't played this one as much as the others, I can say this one is much better than others in every single aspect.\nThe gimmics are unique, the level design is good, and while the controls are a bit too sensitive they are okay. If you like platformers, this game is worth checking out.","May 17","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a great little platformer, chock full of content and variety. It has 175 levels, each of which can be played in numerous play modes. Even with several hours of playtime, I'm far from exhausting the game's content. It's worth noting that there are essentially two sets of levels: Levels 1-100 are the "Innoquous 5" levels, while levels 101-175 are based on levels from the developer's prior game "Innoquous 4." As levels 1-100 began to get quite difficult, I welcomed the ability to play additinonal easy and medium difficulty levels in the Innoquous 4 set.\n\nThe game also includes a level editor and steam workshop functionality. I'm really looking forward to playing around with the gravity rotation gameplay to build custom levels.\n\nMy one criticism: as the levels became more difficult, I began to feel that the controls are just a bit too sensitive--the speed of your ball is quite fast, so it can be difficult to nail subtle left/right movements (at least with a keyboard). The game is certainly fully playable and enjoyable as it is, but I'd love to see how the game would play with a slight adjustment to the control sensitivity.","May 20","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
