"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juvar23/recommended/301520/","Juvar23","V | Juvar23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juvar23/","43 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nTL;DR: Robocraft did not deliver on the potential it promised and instead changed the core gameplay mechanics to mimic other shooters, destroying what made the game unique.\nI have played this game for over 3000 hours (the standalone launcher does not add to steam hours) and supported the game with over 100GBP (150$+). I was a moderator for the game because I believed in it and wanted to support the community, but was removed from the team because I spoke out to a developer about the direction they were taking – not because I wasn't doing my job, but because I spoke my mind.\n\nThe game has changed. Freejam have tried to make the game more accessible to new players, with a focus of getting as many players as possible. But instead of focussing on what made the game great and trying to get players to love it, they changed the gameplay mechanics in order to please a wider audience, which destroyed many aspects of what made the game great and unique in the first place.\n\nInstead of a currency reward system that allows players to buy the parts they want for their robots, they now have a "random loot crate" reward system, which is a blatant attempt at copying other games and trying to trick people into spending real money on the game. Non-premium users get tempted by the items that they could have received if they had paid for premium (every loot crate that gets opened show the premium items) with the option to purchase it now to receive the items. Furthermore, only the top scoring player on the winning team receives the highest level crate (which promises better item drop chances), while every member of the losing team receives the same low quality crate. This leads to selfish play for the highest score rather than the rewarding teamplay experience that it used to be, and also leads to the losing team to stop trying because they receive the same bad rewards either way.\n\nThey also made the most interesting part about the game – the fact that building skill and design decisions directly affects battle performance – much less meaningful over the last couple of months, by removing the pilot seat component, introducing auto-healing (another aspect to mimic other shooters), and allowing each player to put several different gun types on their robots, which removes the need for playstyle specialisations. This also negatively affects teamplay, because there is no use for dedicated medics or dedicated frontline or support types – every player is now a (selfish) one-man-army trying to score the highest points.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential a year ago, but the developer's decisions over the last updates have shown that they care less about making a good game and more about the money they can make by trying to get more players with lower skill levels, by copying other generic shooter-types and removing/reducing the unique aspects that used to make Robocraft great.\n\nFreejam have gone the way many F2P games go and opted for the cash-grab alternative. It is disappointing, because there was so much potential.\n\nUPDATE: After two and a half weeks, the lead game designer released a "state of the game" letter, which conveniently failed to address any of the points the community has brought up in their feedback. This, to me, puts the final nail in the coffin. These developers do not care for the quality of their game or their community, they are only out for new players for their statistics and wallets.","May 6","false","367.6"," 1,843 of 1,965 people (94%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","94","843","1","65","160"

You can no longer pay real money to get exactly what you want. You now pay real money to gamble on crates. Because they removed RP in favor of Robits, the only way to make money is to recycle the random junk that you get from crates at 1/4 their value. This heavily increased the time it takes to get a single item that you may want. This game is no longer about experimenting with new builds, it's about gambling your time away on random junk.

Making a hilarious robot is a waste of your time as no one cares to even look at you and you're just an easier target for the enemy.\nMatchmaking is still broken, new players with 400-600 cpu gets matched with 1500 cpu bots. I know that since i have started a new account myself. Every match so far has been filled with the no-skill weapons, and there's no reason for me to continue playing that account, when i cant even win one match, and there's nothing good enough to earn from the recently added loot crates. My friend agrees with me.\nLeveling up is boring and unrewarding, since all you get now is 10 more CPU for each level. Once you get to level 100, the CPU increases by 5... Really? That's what i get for playing your game for so long, make it even less rewarding?...\nLoot crates are not worth it at all. You did insanely well in a match? You got the highest score on your team? Well here is a single uncommon wheel... Yup, that's what you can actually get from a highest ranked crate (or some 20 useless cubes...), and you're not even going to use it, just recycle it for LESS THAN A QUARTER OF THE ORIGINAL PRICE, untill you get enough for that one hover you actually wanted instead.....\n\nIt was way better what they had before, you had a currency called tech points and you would earn a reasonable ammount every battle. You could use them to unlock WHATEVER PART YOU WANTED, but now its just like "Here have these 20 cubes, but if you BUY PREMIUM you will get an extra green colored electroplate!" (Rarity doesn't matter, anything below Epic or Legendary is completely useless and not really worth selling.)\n\nWhat little ♥♥♥♥ thougth completely random loot was better than freedom of choice?!\nThis is a BUILDING GAME. Imagine if a game like Minecraft had that sort of system, would anyone like it? Ofcourse not! So anyone like this update? OFCOURSE NOT!!\n\nThey took away a perfect system becouse Freejam didn't like it. They removed what made the game unique and fun. I understand that it will keep changing with each update, but its not always those updates are good.\n\nHere are my first 3 protonium loot crates, with the items i got from them.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=680334473\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=680334594\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=680334682\nAs you can see... Why even bother trying to get a good score? You're won't get anything you want, this is awfull, no one wants to see that every match.\n\nI have had 1 legendary this update, and it was an Ion Distorter in a bronze crate...\nWhat's the point of getting a new score, when most people i've seen getting legendaries get them in bronze crates?!\nNo wonder how some players get these massively owerpowered weapons, in such a low cpu match, when items are not dropped by effort and only complete luck.\nI cant live more than 10 seconds against a flak cannon, with my little 550 cpu plane...\n\nThere are so many downsides to this update, with how random the chances of getting the different items are now, people are also going to build these abominations of a "robot" out of parts they don't need and just place them everywhere.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682025413\n\nTons of people are hating this update, just look at how the Steam rating has gone from 81% to 76%. A WHOLE 5% OF STEAM REVIEWS. (Yes, still a majority recommend it, but those are from way back when the game was actually fun. If they weren't, it'd say 33% recommended. Freejam can't keep ignoring their own community otherwise this game will die.)\nYet Freejam doesn't care at all as one of them have said in a tweet that the steam reviews are "boring", "unconstructive", everyone is only complaining about teirs and megabots and they need to "Deal with it".....\nThey're completely ignoring that everyone is complaining about this Epic Garbage update, but Freejam is not going to remove it, they will let it stay as they dont care about what the majority of their players want becouse that's not what Freejam wants.\n\nAlot of people finds negative reviews more helpful, than positive reviews which mostly gets 0 found helpful.\nEven the new recent review feature, shows that 64% of recent reviews are negative, still doesn't gets the devs attention.\n(Also, wow, 4th most helpful review (;• –•)\nYou also just know they really ♥♥♥♥ed up when both some Robocraft Youtubers and streamers, are disappointed with this update. I see alot of people hating on the update in chat, saying that they will never return to this game again.\nSince Freejam doesn't care about any of the negative reviews at all from the majority of the players, and only wants to listen to positive feedback from the minority, we will never have the same fun and enjoyable Robocraft it used to be.\n\nThey need to listen to their community, and not their own opinions.\nWithout a community there is no game.","April 29","false","271.3"," 381 of 423 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","381","423","13","3"

It's unfortunate that my first is a negative review.  I've been with this game since fall of 2014 I believe and that’s where most of my hours for the game went.  Now........ What have they done? How could they manage to screw up a perfect formula?  Let me explain some of the key changes that turned me away from this game.\n\nTaking away techpoints - Tech points were key to unlocking new parts such as: wheels, treads, weapons, wings/rudders, building blocks.  This was a perfect progression system that I was ok with.  Now just leveling up to get parts just isn't fun compared to the techpoint system.\n\nRemoval of boss battles - I never got to the level to face off Mega bots.  Oh how cool it would have been for my bomber to fly around a gigantic robot.  Sounds cool right? That was one of the big reasons I got this game.  Now it's gone....... why devs.\n\nRare moment in pvp where you were paired up with four high teir players *Removed* - Sometimes when you played a game, your team of twelve had a chance to get paired up with four high teir players as sort of a challenge round.  This mode was fun! The thrill of being hunted by someone much stronger than you and being able to take down someone with 3-4 of your team mates.  How could you remove such a fun mode!\n\nThe "new" gamemode - What the hell... Is this League of Robocraft or something?! You get the gist, you and your enemy have a "nexus" you gotta destroy and in between are capture points to shut down the enemy shield if one team has them all.  What irks me the most though, is the devs recreation of League of Legends Leaverbuster system (Which btw, Leagues system is way more merciful).  Second time playing, the game crashes due to poor hotel internet.  Come back later to play, "You have been temporarily banned from playing as you have left too many matches recently." *slow clap*  Face it devs, Robocraft isn't a MOBA, it's a PVP game.\n\nPaint system - "Hey loyal fans, want us to remove the block tier system, potentially throwing away some of the money you spent on this game to be replaced by a paint system in which you have to pay us more money to unlock basic colors?  Too bad, were doing it!"  Why.... just why.....  Adding a system in which you just scrapped tier blocks completely and replaced it with paint.  Here’s the catch though, you need to PAY FOR PREMIUM to unlock BASIC colors, but here’s the best part, free players ONLY have access to light grey, orange, light blue, and white.  REALLY!?  If your gonna add a paint system and throw away people’s money they may have spent on blocks, then MAKE FREE PLAYERS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL BASIC COLORS!  A good premium perk for a paint gun would be a color mixer, not locking off every single basic color to the free players.\n\nThe 10 second heal - This just ruins the strategy and the role of a medic bot completely.  Not only that, but it ruins the part in which your robot being stranded on the field somewhere.  Waiting in anticipation for an enemy scavenger to come by and finish you off.  Now, its just crash, wait 10 seconds, and take off again, what’s the fun in that.\n\nGetting rid of pilot seats - When I first started this game, there was a cool astronaut pilot that was supposed to be the core of your robot.  Then came along android, three with unique strengths.  Then the devs just decide to get rid of the pilot seats completely..... Really!? Now you need to destroy atleast 75% of the robot to kill them, which is annoying if all that’s left of a player is a block and a thruster.  J-just why, the android pilots were perfect.\n\nInsane RP prices - Robo points (I think is what they're called) have been around from the very beginning.  I wanna create an insect themed robot.  What’s the price of the lowest tier leg, 150,000 rp? Ok then, how much do I get from a match.  ONLY 500 RP PER ROUND WITH ABOUT 2-4 KILLS!!  Then they put the rp you WOULD have gotten, if ya just payed $10 for premium or however much it costs on a monthly basis.  SERIOUSLY! The game I knew before was free player friendly, two rounds would get you five tier four blocks, about 10-20 would get ya a couple decent wings.  Now... about 25,000 RP for the LOWEST tier wings.\n\nNow, here are some of the changes I just so happened to like, but it's not enough to change the inevitable score.\n\nNew single-player mode - I admit, AI being able to fight back is the perfect way to test out your new robot before entering pvp.  It gives good practice bots while seeing some cool and witty creations like: R2-D2, the enterprise, the millenium falcon, a freakin toilet, and many others.  While these added features are great for single-player, it still doesn't fix the game's true focus.\n\nMultiple garage slots - Finally, I can store more robots than just having three slots.\n\n\nNotice how the liked features list was way shorter than the disliked features list.  When I got this game, I thought the devs really wanted to make a fun, free game.  Now its paywalls, paywalls and micro transactions galore.  A game that once had intense strategy is now mundane.  I believe the only way these developers could screw up a perfect formula is their lust for money.  I thought you guys were gonna be different for a change, but shame on me for thinking that.  Final score is a 4/10, below average.  If this game keeps heading down the path it's headed for, I'll be ashamed to see the final product.  For what it's worth, download the game if you're morbidly curious, but it'll never be the same as it was in 2014.   How this game got a very positive rating in its current state is beyond me.\n","April 4","false","67.8"," 738 of 881 people (84%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","84","738","881","41","61"

The grind, i assure you, will be real. But who cares about that when you can spend countless amounts of dollars to be able to buy protonium crates. These crates will give you the advantage against others as you will be able to build not five, not ten, but only one decent robot a day (provided that you keep buying 300 crates every day).

Finally, new update is out and once again, the update has broken the game to an even more unplayable state. Anyone who has played the game since the very beginning has seen the evolution of a once promising game, become a hideous monstrosity. With the new "Epic Loot" update, the game has now sunk deeper in to the lowest common denominator. Copying other games. Of course we all know which game this is trying to copy *cough cough* CS Go *cough cough* it is now almost impossible to progress. The game in my professional opinion has become so unplayable that even i, who have never reviewed a game before, have reviewed this game to comment on how horrendous it has become. The game is still in early access. I mean for crying out loud, this has to be an bigger scam since the Nigerian prince (still waiting for the transfer) and the metropolitan police (need to wait for the money from  the Nigerian prince to unlock PC). It is just a horrible excuse to change the game dramatically without much consideration for the existing player base\n\nThe Epic Loot Update\nNow this update is obviously released out of greed. Play one game and you will see what i mean. The loot crates give premium users more than double (epic and rare items) what players who play for free get. Although you may argue that premium users should get more, it demonstrates the desperation that the developers have for  Money	. This is what the update is released for. The rail cannons now use more power per shot and smgs don't fire as quickly as before. Medics are now obsolete, repairing robots slowly enough that i can make an cup of tea, write this review as well as watch an couple youtube videos before they are fully healed (excluding the 10 second self repair of course).Ask any person who journeyed with robocraft throughout the years and they will tell you that " Robocraft has been ruined	"\n\nWhat to expect\nBy playing for free, you only get four colours, less Robits (previously known as RP), stress from grinding as well as high blood pressure from realising that most, if not all, shotgunners that killed you were or are premium.  The battle arena is a blatant attempt to copy  League of legends and DOTA	 and incorporate MOBA into the game. Team death match is just destroying robots (No respawns). The main point of the game is building robots and fighting, which this game does quite well. However, needing to destroy at least 75% of the enemy's robot, now without the pilot seat, is an absolute deep pain in the ♥♥♥. Especially if all that is left is a thruster and a single block. The reduction in speed of the SMGs have definitely bent each one of us over and screwed us, since it only takes 10 seconds to start auto repair, the singe thruster bot would have full repaired by the time we tracked it down.\n\nExplanation\n"It isn't all that bad" you may say, innocently or while the developers are elbow deep in your rear and skillfully puppeteering what you type and say. Most of my hours came from the very start, but there are quite a few things which turned me away from wanting to play this game:\nRemoval of tech points\nThe removal of megabots\nThe addition of extremely OP weapons\nThe removal of the tech tree\nThe lack of consideration to long time players\nRemoval of the pilot seat That is barely scraping the surface of the problems. I am not demanding in-game items to be given to me. What I am asking for is  for 25% of their stock with a certificate to be served to me on an metal plate and 10 percent of their profits	 change. For example, adding in again the pilot seat will bring the fun back into building to defend the seat (the description still says "Jump into the pilot seat of your robot and drive it into battle...), adding in the challenge mode to encourage team work(with megabots of course).\n\nFinal thoughts\nThere are a number of things I quite like in robocraft right now, but listing one or two them would require more effort than the developers have put into the new ideas. Each update is well presented, but taking a massive dump on the game and putting a bow on it Does Not conceal the fact that the game has been defiled (well that ship sailed a long time ago). Any new idea implemented causes dramatic change to the game from the developers basing the whole game around the update. Download and play it if you want, but keep in mind that it will never be as gripping as it once was. I rate this new update 1/10 but 10/10 for the game's concept.

Some for the good, mostly for the bad.\nMy previous reviews have always been positive, albeit quite criticising.\n\nAfter the recent removal of the megabots from the game, i installed it again. In ignorance? With hope?\nOr perhaps it was because FreeJam has given me that tiny bit of hope, that they would make robocraft great again.\n\nUnfortunately, with the recent edition of the shotgun, they just completely messed up and lost all of my trust.\n\nIncrease of TTK (Time to Kill)? That was a "maybe". Well, TTK is getting lower and lower with each passing day.\nSkill should be an important factor! Well, with the addition of 3 guns that really don't require much skill, really doesn't strengthen that comment.\nFLAK: Introduced to sooth the pain of the players that lacked the skill to deal with drones. (What is shooting me? I don't see it? I'm looking everywhere, except of course above me, because i'm a ground vehicle)\n\nLOML: Yes, this gun is as awesome as it sounds. Lock on and fire, no need to aim as the rockets will find their way to your target,\n\nProto-seeker (or as i call it, the turdgun): On first introduction, it was litteraly a gun that fired crap. It hardly did any damage and was just plain annoying. And you could fire it without your enemy even seeing you, due to the ridiculous range. Just aim in the general direction of your enemy and you would simply hit aim. No skill required.\nIn the next update, the range was nerfed, but the damage was buffed. "Great" job FreeJam.\n\nLet's talk about the "making robocraft a competitive game" comment that was made. It was most definitely a priority.\nhttps://twitter.com/MarkDJammer/status/613285367886667780\n\n- The leveling is now a lot easier. What used to take weeks/months to do, can now be done in 1 week or 1 month. Depending on how much and how often you play.\n- There is no more steadily unlocking of items. Meaning, combined with the leveling, new players who reach the end game in no time.\n- There are no tutorials in the game, so what you learn you learn by doing, without having any clue what or where to start.\n- The removal of the pilot seat: The importance of building a good (and competive bot) is no longer as important anymore. To "balance" this out, FreeJam decided to let your bot die, when it's at 25% health. It could still be functional and combat ready, but that no longer matters.\n- Regen: Another "awesome" addition to the game. Because removing a part of this "competitive" game wasn't enough. And likely to make up for that *facepalm* die at 25%, you will heal up if you're not being shot at for 10 seconds.\n- Tactical gameplay: Also note the irony in this part. In order to help the megabots (weren't they removed? Yep) move about more easily, about 50%+ of cover on all maps has been removed.\n- Ranked: Just because you call a square a ball, doesn't make it a ball. And "ranked" in Robocraft is as much ranked as a pig is a carrot. It doesn't matter what "rank" you have or what "rank" your enemies have, the end result is still the same.\nAll that matters is win and loss and if you lose, score. Be in the top half of the scoreboard when you lose and you will not lose "rank". There are 5 "ranks". Bronze (1-5), Silver(1-5), Gold(1-5), Diamond(1-5) and Protonium(1-5), with Protonium being the highest.\nThis is one of the biggest fails FreeJam has made, as far as competitiveness goes. As a bronze player, you can be fighting with and against even Protonium players. The matchmaker doesn't really care (if at all).\nThen there's the "ranking up". Just win and you'll rank up. Currently 6 wins in a row, will get you to the next "ranking league".\nCombine this with the "awesome" matchmaker and perhaps you will guess that being a high-ranking players doesn't mean anything, there's also no point. Whether you are on the bottom or the top, you'll be playing with the same kind of players. Even new players, who don't even know what to do (yet?)\nOne little note: The one reason to rank up is to get the league badges. They do look really nice.\n\nNow let's be honest... it can't be all negative, right? No, you are right. They did remove the tiering system and all armor is now the same. This means that artbots are actually viable. They also decreased the cost of the cubes you need to build your bot. AND... they added the paint tool. (4 colors standard, 16 (or was it 12?) with premium).\n\nSecondly, they added the CRF (Community Robot Shop) in which players can upload their own designs and allow other players to buy them. However, the rating system has a big flaw. You can only rate a bot after the first real battle. As such, the ratings mean little to none, just like its ranking system.\n\nConclusion: Robocraft is turning more and more into a game that you'll play for a while when you are bored. All the promises are basically ideas that can be withdrawn/changed or be completely the opposite.\nWould i recommend it? No. Not anymore. Robocraft Developers are basically like a 5 year old kid that has an attention span of a goldfish.\n\nNote: I have over 1000 hours in the game. As such, i do know what i'm talking about. I could boast about my ranking, but whether it's Bronze 0 or Protonium 5, it just doesn't mean a thing.\n\nDeveloper comment\nBy Sergii Design Jammer\n\nSurely we have no plans to revert everything we was working on for a year. Surely we avoid removing content from the game if we don’t absolutely have to: after all, this will surely make many players unhappy.\n\nBut we are spending years of our lives working on the game. Surely we don’t want to make the game worse.\n\nIt’s well known fact that without content updates online games die quickly: players get bored and leave. So even if it was true that before Aeroflak the game was perfect, this perfect game won’t last long without things like Aeroflak (i.e. without content updates making big impact). So to survive, the game needs to evolve constantly, even though many mistakes happen along the way for sure.\n\nSo the choice for us is to let the game die, or to evolve it. We understand the disappointment of players who liked the old ways more, but honestly leaving the game as is wasn’t an option at every stage in the past and won’t be in the future. Changes are painful, but there’s no evolution without change.","April 14","false","129.8"," 286 of 324 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","286","324","7","18"

Simply put, the development team (FreeJam) is utterly incompetent. There have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). Instead, FreeJam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. This accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. Sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, FreeJam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.\n\nOther major issues with the game:\n\n1) Building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. Nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. Any new player can slap something together in 5 minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. In fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, FreeJam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. Either they'll nerf your movement or make various components 10 times heavier, etc. Regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did "because FreeJam said so."\n\n2) Significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. Simply put, FreeJam rarely gets weapon balance 100% right, or even close to it. In the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. There are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out).\n\n3) FreeJam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. They won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. Instead, FreeJam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. Basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. Things like clans have been "on FreeJam's radar" since mid-2014 or earlier - and guess what? Still not implemented, and it is almost mid-2016. The sad part is, by the time FreeJam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this.\n\n4) Minimal skill required. If you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. FreeJam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. This might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.\n\nFreeJam: One step forward, two steps back. Always.","April 29","false","002.6"," 248 of 279 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","248","279","8","43"

If the prices won’t be fixed, then it is way too grindy to do anything, reforge values are incredible (75%+?). For example, from items that cost 20000 to forge you can only recover 25.\nFor newbies, I assume, it simply won’t do. As well as for players, who don't already have everything.\nThey also divided RP/63 to get to Robits balance.\nHowever, if you were smart enough to buy thousands of weapons to reforge them, literally millions of money could be saved. I wasn't.\n\nCrates?\nEven with premium I get 3-6 simple blocks from gold/diamond/protonium crates. And some customization trash. And I can’t even recycle it from the crate’ screen.\nOh, since you can recover only a few robits from the crate, even protonium ones, good luck playing thousands of battles to get some weaponry. And only BA/LA battles, TDM gives 1/4 reward of BA/LA or 1/3 of The Pit.\nWant to donate to buy 300 crates and get some good items for you bot?\nYou will only get thousands of simple blocks and very few movement parts and weapons. But, duh, you will can tons of customization dirt.\n\nNewbie-friendly?\nAh yes, simple robot blocks. They are now 10x times more expensive, some newbies cannot even build a normal robot since they do not have enough money even for blocks.\nI do not even know how newbies can get into high-tier now, seeing everything is way too expensive even for old players.\nSo much of a newbie-friendly game. Also, the matchmaking with FJ' fixes.\n\nMatchmaking?\nDid I mention that even 500 CPU (sized) bots are still thrown into 1500-1750 CPU battles?\nAh, now I did.\nAlso many afk's, since being afk and wait till the battle's end is much more profitable than trying to do anything.\n\nRobot-building?\nForget about it, simply place some cubes, just make sure it is not too hollow, some weapons, at least 6 of them, and you are ready to go.\nBuilding does not really matter for a long time.\nOf course, there is a meta-builds, but why build it when you can buy it from roboshop?\nObviously, FJ undestands it and now you can buy it for free.\n\nGame-modes?\nThe Pit is incarnation of killstealing along with ion distorters little bots. Not very interesting.\nTeam Deathmatch is a good mode still, however, FJ hates this mode and to promote Battle Arena they made severe nerfs to rewarads from TDM, so if you like to play TDM you will never get much money (now you really won't get anything, since you get only one item from the TDM and you can recycle for around 50 robits, while new weapons and modules cost thousands and hundreds of thousands).\nBattle Arena/League Arena - gamemodes with highest rewards right now. FJ likes to think they are making game similar to MOBA and promote this gamemodes as hard as they can, reducing rewards from other gamemodes and increasing rewards in BA/LA.\nHow bad BA/LA?\nSmall maps, countless campers, in the lattest update you are guaranteed to lose if you have Robocraft's target auditory (10-12 year old kids, from FJ's comment on the official forums) and one or more disconnected people or leavers.\nSo, if you want to play BA, do not forget that disconnect and wait for two minutes is much faster than try and lose in the battle witch lasts for 15-20 minutes in average.\n\nWeapon rebalance?\nHigh-tier battles became way too boring and low-tier battles are full of shotgunners.\nSeriously, a few shots from SMG and you have no energy. And SMG's don't really damage anymore.\nProtoseekers, which I disliked, first were changed into close-combat ones, which was much less fun than longranged annoying weaponry, but now they were nefted into dirt and completely pointless to use.\nPlasma?\nUnless you manage to land the hit into dead center of the robot it is weak and after each strike you can go to make a tea to wait for energy to reload.\nRails?\nOh, somewhat useful, one of two weapons that can damage enemies now. But you have only two shots before you have to wait ~10 seconds to energy to restore.\nIon distorters?\nOnly weapon of close combat capable of 1-3 shotting any bot. And there are many of glass-cannons on low-cpu battles literally humiliating newbies, who can do nothing against them.\nFJ also told that low-tiered weapons will be useful.\nThey are not, however still being a little better than high-tiered ones. Still bad. And forcing to turn beatuful bot into cactus of small plasmas/smgs is a disgrace.\n\nModules?\nBlink is fun, this much I can tell. One of the best ideas FJ made ever.\nInvisility is strictly limited to shotgunners, has some uses for planes and copters, but not much.\nMegamodule turned into powerboost is a must in high-tiers, without it there is simply too big delay in weapon' fire.\nDisc Shield Module is not really of use now, but I sometimes see someone to use it only to enemy rush through it and kill the DSM' user with ion distorter (shotgun).\n\nBugs?\nOne of my friends can’t play, since he is getting white screen/falling underground/crash issues.\nHe is, obiously, not the only one.\nAnd I got another fps drop, but I am used to it.\n\nExploits?\nFJ removing bonus to players' score when the latter spot the enemy to fix exploits.\nI really think it is not a way to fix exploits.\nAnd desync is still not fixed, FJ cannot into fixes, duh.\n\nEAC?\nPoints 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are still relevant. They are seriously doing almost nothing.\nAs for point 2 - I do not see crashes and issues with the game in the last update, but in previous update I could start the game only a few times out of ten, because EAC would simply not start and then the game would crash since EAC is not running.\nAs for point 3 - now it is hard to understand if it's FJ's fault for optimization or the EAC's, so I can't say anything about it. To be honest, optimization is not very bad, however, there are lag-spikes and sluttering with micro-freezes from time to time.\n\n\nI am not saying I am quitting, I already have more than 20+ detail each and some robits, so I will stay to see when FJ hits the rock bottom. Seeing this update it shouldn’t be too far away.\nHowever, this update is much worse than I expected and I expected something bad.\nI am disappointed in FJ and especially Mark, the latter one could read the forums and not hide in his twitter ignoring any messages that matter and making silly updates which make the game worse.\nI really do miss the classic robocraft without regeneration and with pilot sits.\n\n(Updated 29.04.2016)\n\n\nOLD:\nNew anticheat EAC does not prevent hackers to use hacks, yet it:\n1. prevents the usage unsigned drivers\n2. gives absolutely horrible matchmaking, almost always kicks from game and if be lucky enough to get into the game you may get into the middle of the match (and get kicked again), too many false positives and crashes\n3. cause of low framerate\n4. messes with other software outside robocraft\n5. dissallows software like fraps and macroser even when they used on other programs\n6. recognized as malware by some antiviruses\n7. EAC devs suggest you to run the game in virtualbox if you encounter problems like unsigned drivers\n8. There is no guarantees gathered data (screenshots, keylogging, logins, passwords, usernames, chat messages, etc) from you will be kept private.\n\nI do not think it is the full list of the issues.\nBy the way, I mostly run the game without turning on steam, so I do not have much hours on the record.\nAlso my friend's brother died from this.","April 29","false","307.7"," 226 of 253 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","226","253","11","3"

I admit, I didn't know what to expect. But I can't say I like it.\nWell, the matchmaking issue is fixed, you're more free to build whatever, and for that I thank FreeJam. But what most people don't realise, is that you don't earn Robits from battle. Progression in the game is now completely reliant on the drops in crates, down to complete luck. No skill, just luck. It doesn't matter that you have 20 Protonium Crates, someone out there will unlock something better from a Rusted one. FreeJam, I think I know where the problem is. When you think of a shiny new mechanic, you base the WHOLE GAME off of it. Couldn't we agree that the new crate mechanic would be better added to the meta, and not rewriting it? Because right now, I've advanced more in Singleplayer than in actual battles.\n\n**ORIGINAL POST**\nDevelopers.\nDo you not understand what this game is meant to be? I downloaded this game assuming I could build what I wanted and watch it explode in the midst of battle. Things like CPU caps and level progression just stop something that everyone wanted. And now you're getting rid of megabots, meaning the bots we can make are limited. You're getting further and further away from your original plan, and we suggest you turn around. Let us build what we want again!\n\nThis doesn't even take into account the god-awful matchmaking, in which a small plane will be matched against giant SMG tanks for no reason, and the terrible weapon balancing, where owning one weapon means you win the game. There needs to be more ways to build an effective bot than just "stick some missiles on it".\n\nGame mechanics have come and gone. I admit, the new battle arena with respawning and protonium towers was a good idea, and I still enjoy it. But I also enjoyed Megaboss mode, a mode where a full team of smaller bots take on a Megabot. I've had instances where I have both won and lost as both sides, but of course FreeJam removed it.\n\nEven further back, we had the tech tree. A sense of progression gave the game purpose, and it was hard yet rewarding work to earn the tech points needed to unlock a new weapon. I was super happy to have unlocked an end game item, but of course the tree wasn't finished. Then they updated the game, granting me access to every item, and completely eliminating this sense of progression from my game.\n\nFreeJam, that is what the game should be. Please, for once in your careers, listen to us.\n\n\ntl;dr it's bad but used to be good","April 5","false","170.1"," 373 of 454 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","373","454","9","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overene/recommended/301520/","overene","Neurodice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overene/","11 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBefore you read the rest of the review, I want you to notice a trend. Look at the positive reviews. Notice how most of the positive reviews are from people with very few hours, rarely more than 100, and almost never over 200. Also look at how the positive reviews (for the most part) sound like they were all written by little children. Compare with negative reviews. Most negative reviews have hundreds of hours, tons of experience, and have watched this game go from something amazing to nothing more than a depressing reminder that you should avoid early access games. On top of that, you can tell that the people who write most of the negative reviews for the most part sound more mature, or at the very least can spell words correctly.\n\nOkay, now I can explain this. The devs for a while now have been deliberately trying to pretty much kick out all of the veterans. They ignore our feedback, ignore our problems, and on top of that, they move out updates that they know will kill a massive amount of the playerbase. Their strategy of getting new players is absolutely atrocious, and they do it by exchanging experienced veterans for new players, and given that new players usually quit pretty soon after starting the game, you will see on Steam Charts how much this game has fallen in popularity. around 4000 online while writing this, when it was released on Steam a little after I joined, this game had on average around 14000. The game gets a small player spike every time an update is released, but then they eventually lose more players than they gain. The new players usually don't. Why? Because FreeJam is beginning to rebuild there playerbase, this time instead of it consisting of friendly and mature players, their new playerbase is made 99% of illiterate 10 year olds that think to themselves, "wow, updatez? very gudz. 999 removd featurs? me lieky."\n\nNow, let me take you down memory lane to explain to you the updates that really screwed up this once amazing game. Unfortunately, I forgot which order the updates go in, so instead I'm just going to say which major changes screwed over this game, it's community, and it's future.\n\nTIERS\nTiers were what made Robocraft.... Robocraft. I still vividly remember how much I enjoyed moving up tiers. I eventually got to tier 10, and that was a huge accomplishment for me. Now, they removed tiers, and so no one else will be able to feel awesome after finally achieving tier 10. Now, the whole system is based on levels, I think, which was screwed up also.\n\nLEVELS\nIs it even possible for a game to seriously screw up something as basic as a simple leveling system? It is when you work for FreeJam, to aid them on the mission of creating the worst game in history (This game was called "Robocraft"). Now, the game depends on leveling, and not tiers. But wait! There's a catch. Now, leveling is so easy, An experienced player could probably create a new account and reach the max level, 100 within 48 hours. The first time this happened, I went from level 42 instantly to level 100, and I heard that they later made it even easier to level up later on.\n\nCRF\nA fairly recent addition to the game was the CRF, or Community Robot Factory. Now, it's easier than ever to plagiarise the bots of other players. Not into plagiarism? Oh well, the CRF still means that much of the element that the game was known for, building, is gone. This game was supposed to be a game where you build, drive, and fight. Now it's a game where you drive and fight bots that you took from someone else. A place to share creations is good for most games, but Robocraft is not one of them.\n\nPLAYER  BOTS\nThere are 2 major categories of bots in this game. Boxes covered in guns and massive d!cks that people ride around the map. This kind of bots isn't something you will get banned for, and they are usually completely useless as they have no guns. There are also 2 minor categories of bots. 1% of bots are actually cool and original while another 10% or so (just an estimate) is something bought off of the CRF.\n\nFULL SPECTRUM UPDATE\nThis was actually a better update that the other ones, I'll admit, but it does take this game a step closer to being pay2win, and does take something else away from the game aswell. Now, cubes are no longer tiered, and with that, they no longer have their own colors. To get better cubes, you need higher robot ranking or levels (I forget since I haven't played this game in weeks) but now all cubes are colorless, all parts are colorless. Everything is white. Non-premium users get only 4 colors, (white, orange, and 2 others that I forgot), while a premium user gets them all.\n\nTECH POINTS\nWhat happened to TP (tech points)? Well, the developers thought to themselves, "This is unacceptable. Our players are actually enjoying this feature. It must be removed at once!" and now we have no more tech points. They were originally used to gain access to new parts, although now the tech tree is no longer a tree, it's an ugly elliptical spiral where you get everything on it for free, by leveling up. They may as well just remove the 'tech tree' entirely, cause that implies that there's actually different paths of things to unlock, but nope, not anymore.\n\nTHE GRIND\nAs if this game wasn't grindy enough in its infancy. I used to have to play around 250 hours to get to level 40 and tier 9(?), now parts are so expensive, it's almost unbelievable. An endgame user such as myself only gets a few hundred thousand RP per battle. You need around 11 MILLION for a single high-end weapon. And you need atleast 6 guns to be a worthy target to people, otherwise you are basically a useless addition to your team which will often result in your team failing the battle. So, approximately 67 million for all of your guns. Think that's as bad as it can get? Well, your in for a treat. A complete high-end bot also requires you to pay for other things, more importantly, cubes and mobility. Cubes are pretty cheap now. but mobility is also pretty expensive. For the 'perfect bot', I'd say that's roughly 80-90 million credits. How much for a megabot? Probably at most, double that. Note that all of this is purely guesswork, so I could, and probably am, a little off on these things, so don't hound me for it. I actually did the math and for a high-end user to get a fully maxed out regular bot, it would require around 450 battles. For a megabot, probably around 700-900. However, you do get double RP for one victory each day for every robot you own, and the devs occasionally give out free premium, although they appear to be getting greedier and rarely give out premium nowadays compared to before. They did give users during the christmas seasons a TON of premium though, although I already lost interest and missed out on most of it. Anyway, if you need to do 450 battles, and each takes on average 15 minutes, that's 6750 minutes, or about 112 hours. Keep in mind that this is for one bot. ONE BOT. And often times when you finally build a nice bot, you realize "Wow, this bot doesn't perform as well as I was expecting," or an update destroys it, therefore you end up deconstructing and rebuilding it. Often times for me I like switching weapons cause I get bored of one kind. I'm not interested in grinding for around 84 hours just for a new set of weapons, so I tend to just sell my old ones for the kind I want, losing a lot of RP in the process.\n\nConclusionThis was a longer review than I thought it was going to be, but everything said here is true, except that my statistics may somewhat inaccurate since I haven't played in a while. I'd keep writing on, but apparently there's a limit to how big reviews can be, so I'll stop here. BTW Mark (CEO of FreeJam), if you are reading this, maybe you and your dumbass crew should quit screwing up your own games.\n\nEdit: One more thing, the devs also removed pilot seats, no more weak spots,","January 27","false","207.6"," 625 of 807 people (77%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","77","625","807","50","117"

You used to be able to pick what things you wanted more than others, if you didn't want helium, you didn't need helium, they could care less. Now you get helium regardless of what you want.\n\nThat was just a scratch of what this review is. Now i will explain why each of those things was important.\n\n-The pilot seat-\nThis used to be what you had to protect, you had to deal with the weight of it, engineer creative ways you could protect it from being damaged, now thats removed, what is there to protect? Guns? Wheels? Blocks?\n\n-Teirs-\nThis was the "Leveling up". It was implemented a way i loved, you upgrade your blocks and guns, so that would count towards your new teir, as soon as you had enough of htose blocks and guns your teir would go up, now it's a level thing, A little to confusing to under stand as well. I belive as you hit marks you get new items.\n\nAlong with the removal of teirs came the removal of teired items, now it is a weird one item thing, where some guns get better as the price goes up? And are stupidly expensive.\n\n-"Tech tree"-\nThe tech web, yes at one point is was a tech web, now you get one item after the other, so you are forced on the items you get one after another. You used to be able to pick and choose what YOU wanted, they had tech points you earned and with those you evolved your tech web, and you would get to choose what item you wanted, although eventually you would need to get the rest but you could get the stuff you wanted way before them. Now you are stuck with the spiral tech pole.\n\n\nIf they revert this stuff it will become my favorite game, but now, it's just not even fun to play. It's pointless, and dumbed down. It used to take skill, now you can spam blocks and actually still do decent. Out of my 50 games at the momment this dropped down from #1 to bottom 3 favorite games.","December 20, 2015","false","296.3"," 270 of 332 people (81%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","81","270","332","14","49"

First to go were Tiers, which had balanced matchmaking oh so well. Suddenly formally Tier 9/10 Bots were facing off with Tier 3-5. Then Tech points disappeared. Literally. They vanished.

This developer has no idea what they are doing and for some reason want to base their unique idea off of games that are not even the same genre e.g League of legends and heroes of the storm. That is legit from the developers mouth, they are gonna take their current meta and change it into other games metas.\n\nI love this game but if this is the direction they want to go in it won't be the game that i have played since it came out. I've been there for every change and I don't see how their newest direction is going to be a good one. It used to be unique.\n\n*UPDATE* 30/4/16\nSo I Haven't been able to play this latest update but from what i have seen the game is almost entirely pay 2 win. If you have been playing the game as long as i have then good for you, you now have lots of cash to spend on crates that will allow you to completely do whatever you want. If you're new to Robocraft then the news is a bit more unfortunate. Welcome to the latest in gaming inovation newbies as you are now in a sense gambling your way to a new bot, let's hope you actually manage to create something you like even though you're now forced in a certain direction then having free reign to buy any block like you used to.\n\nA lot of people have used the term "Dated Concept" when referring to how robocraft's old tier system used to work, You level up and spend tech points to breach yourself into that sweet new tier that has an entirely new meta than the old one and etc. It's fairly simple and it worked quite well in my opinion, I always wanted to get to tier 10 and fight against people who had refined skill and bots to match.\n\nHere's the thing i don't like about the term "Dated Concept" while this concept is old and everyone is used to it now that doesn't mean in any way that it was detrimental to Robocraft. If "Dated Concepts" didn't work in gaming then games like Terraria would have failed, it's pixel style in a 2D world is a dated concept and yet most of us would agree that this style is what we enjoyed about it. Robocraft had a style, it's take on the traditional progression system was one that allowed for a great flow of creativity and freedom in build.\n\nYou chose your parts and what kind of bot you wanted to be. Somewhere along the way the devs of this game got the impression that because this style was dated it needed to change. When most of us would have just liked some more gamemodes and the new parts.\n\nLots to read i know but I truly loved this game and i kinda wish i had it back. Don't get me wrong the game still has it's moments though.\n\nAlso sidenote why the hell is this still in early access i mean the game has changed so much there's no way it can still fit in this category.","April 4","false","170.3"," 220 of 267 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","220","267","3","2"

The new Robocraft: Unleashed update came out and all of a sudden everything has gone to ♥♥♥♥. The credit system in the past used to be great, I would get a nice amount of credits for finishing a game in a high tier. 200-300k depending if I did gone in that match. Now, since the new update has came out, when finishing a game I get about 30-60k credits. This doesn't help when the higher tier parts cost about 100-150k each.\n\n\nFurthermore, they removed the Tech Tree system, which grants access to all of the part depending on your player level. I am a high level, and it feels as if there is no progression in the game anymore. I got a buzz out of working to unlock parts to build my Bot; but now its just handed to me and it just doesn't quite feel the same. To be honest, it feels awful. They have removed tiers in the game, may I add it was a great system, and replaced it with Robot Ranking. Robot what? Anyone can be matched with anyone, and there is no sense of achievement anymore. You could acknowledge that you have increased in tier, and you would feel great because of it. You could feel progression through the tiers as you earned more and more tech points and credits. Now? You feel nothing. Robot Ranking isnt quite the same, and to be honest... It is a dissapointment. I couldn't wait to download the new update as I thought it would bring loads of new features to the game to make it more fun, to be honest they just ♥♥♥♥ed it right up.\n\nFinally, they decided to change the UI to a mouse-based system. Was there any point? You could have used certain keys to open different menus. Now its all mouse based and is sluggish as ♥♥♥♥; Another unnecessary feature that has ruined the game.\n\nThe new matchmaking system that they decided to add in allows you to play with anyone you want which, don't get me wrong, sounds like a great idea. But the only problem is, it doesn't work. Basing this description on the tier system, it basically matches lower and higher tiers together. Tier 5s battling Tier 10s and Megabots? Not fair at all. This completely ruined the game for me as my Bot was completely useless against some other Bot designs that had overpowered SMGS that they unlocked also because of another terrible unnessecary feature that they added; the awful new Player Level tech tree system.\n\nTo finish it off, I wouldn't recommend this game to any newcomers until FreeJam get their ♥♥♥♥ together and realise which features are necessary and which features aren't. The game isn't fun to play anymore, they killed that vibe along with the hype that everybody had leading up to this update. Long time players are sure to be quitting this game because of the trouble this update has caused; infact, there is no point in even downloading.\n\nThe community is slowly dying.\n\n\nUPDATE 25/8/15 : They fixed the credits, the game is much better as they have fixed this. Still would not reccomend until they fix the other messed up features.\n\nUPDATE 6/3/16 : They fixed the credits but quadrupled the price of the parts? Wow.\n\nUPDATE 8/3/16 : THEY ♥♥♥♥ED THE CREDIT SYSTEM AGAIN!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? THE DECENT MODULES AND WEAPONS ARE 1MIL+ AND THEY EXPECT 50k A GAME TO CUT IT!!?!?!?!?!

That is what this game WAS. Note that I'm a Tier 9 and have just recently played this game to update my review.\n\nI have Built:\nM-35 Mako from Mass Effect 1\nM-44 Hammerhead from Mass Effect 2.\nUT-47A Kodiak from Mass Effect 3.\nTerran Diamondback from Starcraft 2.\nTerran Ar♥♥♥♥e Mercenary Siege Tank. (YES. THE SIEGE BREAKER FROM WINGS OF LIBERTY.)\n\nBut none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being 6 feet under, Rewards being lowered with "Improvments to the system", and a plethora of other problems.\n\nBack in early 2014 I STRONGLY, I repeat, STRONGLY supported this game. STRONGLY, I emphasize this, say it with me. STRONGLY... SUPPORTED THIS GAME. But with every step forward, FreeJam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.\n\n- "Clone Wars"\nSo let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. This included the Hoverblades, Plasma launchers, Railguns, and thrusters. From level 1 upward of Level 3. Yes, this happened. Freejam didn't change THIS until 7 months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.\n\n- "Double Edged Butt-♥♥♥♥ery"\nNow PRIOR to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a "Repair function" to the game, which put a drain on casual players Tiers 6 and up back then. What was the kick in the balls here? a 25% decrease in rewards. Yes, BOTH RP and TP (Robopoints and Techpoints).\n\n- "Hero Zero"\nNext up was the "Hero System", which allowed you to get the full RP and TP from a match you died in if your team won, but WAIT! ...At the cost of the entire reward system getting another 25% decrease. At this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a 50% reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, It's been a massive pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\n- "Turn up for Hate"\nNow, next up, THEY REMOVE repair cost, yet YET again, ANOTHER FREAKING REWARD QUANTITY DECREASE. You getting the pattern yet? Don't worry I'll explain it in a second. At this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even MORE.\n\n- "From Intense to Indense"\nThis game was always a One-life team Death Match game. The "Respawned and Overclocked" update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused MOBA wannabe. Even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named "Classic" So far on the back burner it can take from 5 minutes to 3 hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. But here's the final blow to the old mode: A 80% decrease at this point... To the profit you make from it. "Classic" is now as worthwhile as dumping your ♥♥♥ in a toilet...Or on a development team. Think that's the worst part? Oh no. I'm not even FINISHED.\n\n- "WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY ♥♥♥♥ING KEYBOARD!?!"\nThe controls with any movement design other than Tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... Yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. As of the R&O Update, Wheels are incredibly sluggish, Rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even ONE, Aerofoils are a disaster to use, Walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. And LASTLY, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.\n\nTHIS ♥♥♥♥ GENUINELY BRINGS MY P!SS TO A PLASMATIC BOIL. THE CHALLENGE SHOULD NOT BE IN HANDICAPPING THE ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYER.\n\n- "GIVE US UR MONIES!"\nWhy all the reward debuffs? Because they want money. They want to FORCE THE PLAYERBASE to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. This game never DID have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. And also, No, it's not even classified as Pay to Win. IT'S PAY TO ♥♥♥♥ING PROGRESS.\n\n- "GIVE US UR MONIES 2!!1"\nThe introduction of Easy Anti Cheat, or EAC. Instead of using Steam's VAC system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. They decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. You see where this is going? Yeah. They drove off a number of their player base stating, "If you can't get into Robocraft to play because of EAC, that is a small price to pay for the issue of Hackers trying to ruin our game". The only people who tried to help fix this was EAC themselves as I recall, and even THEN, only under the pressure of the Robocraft community, which had already started leaving.\n\n- "GIVE US UR FERKIGN MUNEEZ!!11!ELEVEN!"\nWHY did EAC have to fix it? Because Freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. But it doesn't even end there. They won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. Not even an ounce. They won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. If they don't like your ♥♥♥, you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK that involves any kind of actual review with a VENGEANCE. And hell, this hasn't even ended yet. Keep reading. This is starting to look like the Robocraft Holocaust. *shudder*\n\n- "Nerf 'em to the Grave"\nNow, the FINAL kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. FINALLY, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of Gun Bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. I'll give an example.\n\n- "From Speedy to Needy"\nI made a vehicle called "The Masterkill B@stard" (Frankly can't put the word itself in) Which operated on two things: Wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. As of 3 days after the R&O update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a Treaded Tank, and that's WITH the thrusters on. I guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their Railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. WITHOUT rockets, it's even SLOWER than a tank. Believe me, i've tested this one the day I learned of the horror inflicted on the Physics engine, which I think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now.\n\n- "Final Thoughts"\nLastly, like i said, I STRONGLY... STRONGLY! SUPPORTED THIS GAME! Hell, I even put $10 into this game just for hangar bays! But as of now? FreeJam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. This game had SO MUCH POTENTIAL a year ago. But now it's all been dried up. Freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. A year ago, i'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. But as of now, I can only - in good conscience - give it a 4 out of 10. A toxic community, confused development team, nonsensical gameplay, poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a double-edge to updates, and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was, ALL IN THE NAME, of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit, keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this. Stay. Away. From this hideous deformed child of a game. You will be stricken with it's Gods-awful MOBA wannabe gameplay.\n\n[More on my Review in the Comments section]","June 11, 2015","false","279.4"," 463 of 605 people (77%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","77","463","605","75","109"

I used to recommend this to many friends but after having more and more features removed I am left with no feeling of progression or achievement.\n\nDo the developers care about the game? Probably. But in reality it just feels like they are trying to swap the game out from under our feet. I used to invest my time into improving my robot and be really excited to try out a new part but now it's only good for a quick round of shooting things where most of the bots are just the same design. Creativity is gone. Originality is gone. Excitement is gone.\n\nThis is not the game I supported in the past. It's still a fun game in some ways but be cautious about how attached you get to it. They might decide robots are not what they want in the game anymore and continue making it less unique by turning it into a FPS. It wouldn't suprise me if they did.\n\nOh and if you do play it you should know this. When it says press left shift... they mean right.

My name is Jeff, I am 28 and I have been playing Robocraft for over a year and a half now.\nIn the next few paragraphs I will try to explain how and why Robocraft has gone from one of my all time favourite games, to no longer worthy of my time.\nI will start by telling you more about me, and my account.\n\nI have always been able to think outside of the box, and come up with great, new, original ideas. This gave me the ability to create, test, and perfect many bots that looked, and functioned like no one else's. I took great pride in spending MANY hours making these ground breaking bots. I enjoyed it so much I often offered to lend a hand to all of my fellow friends and community members. Thus - I have the account and passwords to 22 other accounts. Some of them have as much money and hours invested as mine, however none of which play any longer for the same reasons you are about to read.\n\nI have more hours logged then most players.(928)\nI probably have another 500+ hours logged on friends accounts.\n\nI have more garage slots then most players. (30+)\nPrior to the reduction of max CPU per tier I had all 30 garage slots full of max CPU builds (1511, -more details on this issue to come)\nI HAD a bot for each Tier 1-4 and 2 bots for each tier 5-9. I kept a healer, and a DPS in every tier to allow me to help friends level up. (I used to premote this game heavily amognst friends)\n\nI still have have some of the BEST T-10 max cpu builds possible. (16+)\nRead that again. 16- T10 bots. All finely tuned and perfected for battle.\n\nAt one point I also had 2 max CPU Megabots - but tore them apart as the Dev team seemed to go in a different direction after releasing Megabots.\nIn other words.... They were a huge time and money sink with no real way to play them in any game mode without waiting 10-20 min to get into a 3 min game.\n\nI have over 200,000,000 in-game credits.\n\nI had every single part unlocked and some 150,000 T-10 tech points.....  I had many thousand Tech points in every tier until they did away with tech points at the same time they did away with tiers (more details to come)\n\nNone of this matters when you have changed the game to the point it is not enjoyable to play.\n\nMy advice - STAY AWAY!\n\n-If you want a more details on why the devs are ruining this game - continue reading.\n\n\nThe #1 reason for me is a 3 step process. (represented by A,B,C)\n\n-A. They put a Max CPU cap on all lower levels leading up to the old max of 1511.\nT-1 500\nT-2 600\nT-3 700 etc. etc. etc.\n\nThey did this, because they claimed it was unfair to have a 1511 CPU bot in tiers lower then 10. My argument is the tiers were broken up by RoboRanking - not CPU.  So If I choose to be skimp on armor, and movement parts, to get a better gun, and play my bot to its strengths and weaknesses then that choice is on me.  The same give and take could be made with any combo of parts as long as you stayed inside the RoboRanking of the tier you wished to stay in. Each part added its respected value, meaning the better the item - the more RoboRanking it had. You could make a 1511 CPU bot with the same RoboRanking as a 900 CPU bot using different combination of parts.\n\nAt the same time they applied a max CPU cap per tier - they also made it impossible to add any guns HIGHER then the tier you were aiming to build in. In other words.... IF you took one white block, and added one T-7 SMG to it, your one white block is now a T-7. Same for any gun type, of any tier.\n\nNot a big deal unless you already had 13-15 max cpu bots at lower levels that ranged from T1-T9. All of these bots I spent a GREAT deal of time making, and fine tuning. So suddenly all of these bots were T10. Obviously these bots were not able to compete with proper T10 builds.\n\n-B. So I was forced to DELETE all of my T-1 through T-9 bots that I spent so much time working on. But I am not easily deterred, so I get started on rebuilding. I spend MANY MORE hours remaking lower tier bots inside the new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t requirements only to have the VERY next update (2-3 weeks later)remove tiers completely.\nReally?  Like REALLY, really?\nIf your whole plan was to remove the tiers entirely then why even release the update before it forcing all this nonsense on me? Why not release the updates together so I didnt just waste 3 weeks of my life??\nTo make them more "fair," (not sure how this process is fair to players like myself) is their official statement. "Balancing of the tiers."\n\n-C. Now there is a broken match making system that attempts to put you in with other bots around the same rank as you. It fails horribly. They were trying to prevent people from stacking at the top of a tier to make it easier for the people at the bottom. Instead, they take you from wherever tier you are in and places you against people 2-3 tiers higher. Cause that's fair.\nAll they were trying to accomplish was water it down, so the young kids, and faint of heart, did not have a hissy fit when it came time to enter a new tier.\n\n-Point of interest- It is supposed to be hard..... That is what leveling up, and grinding is all about. This is also how YOU, Devjam, make your money. By offering a solution to those who do not wish to grind.\n\n\nOkay - So looking past that huge game breaker of tier removal...what else is wrong?\n\nThe new game mode?\nYou really think it is a good idea to give each team a shield around their base, that they can shoot OUT of but enemies can not shoot IN TO?\nAND while doing that you want to buff snipers so they can 1 shot you?\n\nThe middle of the map became a no man's land.... People would literally just sit inside their base dome, camping, waiting for the enemy to leave the safety of their dome.... As soon as you leave your dome you get sent back to respawn. Said snipers are not playing the objective of the map. Just straight up camping. And - can you blame them? Thats on the Devs.\n\nRobocraft is a PERFECT example of how devs kill early access games. They spend too much time trying to nerf this and nerf that so that all the little 12 year olds can get along. When are you going to build a game that time and effort is going to be a factor in your success?\nThe amount of time I spent fine tuning 1 bot until it was perfect is probably more time then most other people have played the game in total.... Only to have that 50-100 hours spent on 1 bot to be ruined by the next update, or exploited by a glitch. or even worse - reduce the max cpu per tier forcing players to remake their lower level bots - only to completely remove the tiers entirely... What a ♥♥♥♥ing slap in the face that was. No compensation for time lost.\n- I can not even get a single Dev to respond to me anywhere, about anything. I have tried politely messaging them privately, publicly, on their personal pages, public pages, left forum posts, filled out reviews on the website..... ZERO response from anyone but noobs who have no idea WTF I am even talking about.\n\nAnd why do you keep releasing "new content" when you can't even get the previous updates "new content" to work correctly.....\n\nTalk about a joke....\n\nThis game went down hill when megabots (not even worth getting into that discussion) were released, and every update since has only made it worse.\n\nI have uninstalled the game - if you are interested in purchasing my account - message me.","September 12, 2015","false","971.5"," 1,007 of 1,363 people (74%) found this review helpful 131 people found this review funny","74","007","1","131","76"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeeboralski/recommended/301520/","zeeboralski","CAPTAINKATRAD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeeboralski/","16 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNew to Robocraft? Here's how to get started quick.\n\nThe keyboard controls are very simple. "W" moves your robot forward, "A" turns your robot left, "S" for going backwards and "D" for turning right. When you have thrusters, the controls are exactly the same, except you can go up and down, with "SHIFT" for going down and "SPACE" for going upwards.\n\nBasic Tips\n\n• This game takes practice to master. The starting design in Bay 01 is a well-rounded entry-level robot. Play a few     games and get used to the handling and keyboard layout. Once you have gotten used to playing you can press G and try building robots in any of your 3 starting bays. (You can purchase Galaxy Cash to buy more bays)\n\n•Hold off trying modifications until you have a few games under your belt. It really helps.\n\n•Your Tier is determined by your Robot Ranking, not player levels. If you want to progress to higher tiers, with higher Robopoints (RP) and Tech Points (TP) rewards, unlock and buy better gear for your robot.\n\nConstruction tips\n\n•Half the battle is won not on the field, but in the construction bay. Remember that well!\n\n•You can press "P" to enter Practice Mode, where you can test your robot in peace.\n\n•At least a basic understanding of physics is necessary in a game like Robocraft.\n\n•Tipped-over robots are a common sight with players at lower tiers. Avoid this by making your robots bottom-heavy, or by expanding your wheelbase and/or track.\n\n•When building your bots try not to position your weapons right behind each other. Lifting rear guns higher is one way to improve gun coverage. This way your guns won't be blocking each other.\n\n•Thrusters are a good idea in order to make your robot accelerate faster, especially if it's is heavy. Note that, barring warping, robots are governed by a coded speed limit.\n\n•For a good Robot Balance is key.\n\nCombat tips\n\n•Press Q when aiming at a target to spot it. This alerts the rest of your team of the target's location, allowing them to lend you firepower in destroying it!\n\n•With SMG's, there is a special method ideal for sniping known as "Tap-firing", where you fire one or twice, let the scope reduce it's size and repeat.\n\n•Though the starting SMG is a fully automatic weapon, resist the urge to hold down the mouse button and spray and pray. The SMG has infinite range, so you can pick off enemies at a distance, up to and including those who are barely visible, but is not recommended for sniping.\n\n•In general, until you acquire better armored cubes, going toe-to-toe with other robots is not recommended, as the basic light chassis cube is very, very weak.\n\n•Cover is your friend. Ideally, you want to position your robot so that only the guns poke up over your cover (a technique known as hull-down), allowing you to fire with impunity. Be careful with your terrain as you may get stuck at times, especially with a poor-handling vehicle.\n\n•Stick together! As it is said, "Two is better than one." A team that fights together will have far more significant chances than if separated. If you wish to battle together with a friend or more, consider creating a Platoon!\n\n•If the situation permits it, flank your target from an unexpected direction while it is occupied with another teammate.\n\nPlanning tips\n\n•Once you get a feel for the game, figure out which role you want to play and use your Tech Points appropriately.\n\n•It is not recommend you to go suicide, there is no repair cost so no matter how much damage your robot takes, the repair cost will always be nothing.\n\n•When destroyed, press the Escape key to return to the mothership, then jump into another battle to fight for more Robopoints and techpoints!\n\nPiloting tips\n\n*Avoid ice if your only method of transport is wheels; you can get stranded!\n\n•Don't ram other people; the collision could send you veering off or even get you stuck together.\n\nHope you find this helpful :D","January 3, 2015","true","65.7"," 139 of 162 people (86%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","86","139","162","16","5"

Also why not make all the weapons and stuff overpriced so that you have to grind for three years to be able to by one wing to crash around with.\n\nEdit: Now when the Epic Loot update have come out the game have improved a lot, however it is still a pain to try to get something decent because it costs half a robot to try to upgrade one piece to the next tier. I do like that they changed the economy system but relying on luck to get something good in a box and then sell it to get a low amount of money from it is way to slow for me. So I say that the game has improved but there is still a couple of unbalanced bits and pieces until it can get a thumbs up again.","April 24","false","112.2"," 134 of 157 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","134","157","3","3"

Robocraft won indie game of the year 2014! What happened? This game smacks of an enlightened individual creating a new and refreshing idea but then as he gathered the mediocres around him to develop it they eventually turned on him and pushed him out.\nThe game originally appealed more to adults as it required a degree of intelligence and experience to understand the physics behind building the more effective bots.  In other words you had think and do your research.\nUnfortunately Freejam (the game developer or should that be crucifier) decided to completely ignore thier older player base and appeal to thumbsuckers. They then  dumbed the game down to the point where a lobotomized chimp could play it. But in thier clamour to provide more and more new features at every "up"date (which kids with thier short attention span need) they ignored fixing old bugs and exploits i.e wall clipping. They didn't test the new features and instead just introduced even more bugs and exploits i.e. the notorious slope cube exploiting tesseract bot.\nI find the game is now a frustrating almost unplayable mess which has completely lost it's sense of direction.

I havn't been much of a minecraft type of player, but i must say the block building style seems to work.  I was able to create something I liked before even trying to drive it.   I hoped that after spending over 1hr making and re making and re making something i wanted to drive the game was as decent as the builder.\n\nSuccess I loaded in fast with a similar group of newbie players.  After inspecting some units i guess not so novice.   I noticed a few vets that had aquired larger weapons and scaled thier vehicles down to be in the bracket so I tried to avoid the high flying snipers which actually helped me get better.\n\nI spent a whole day playing and by the end was pleasantly addicted to building and destroying.   I enjoyed the battles which mostly left me 1 shotted :/   or rolling around with 1 tire , or better yet upside down un able to move.\n\nEvery battle I wanted to change my vehicle, fine tune it,  use what i was seeing otehrs kill me with and so on.\n\nAnyways I am only on day 3 and really enjoying the game as simple as it seems the game modes are they work for now.  The BOSS mode will be exciting when I am able to level that high.\n\nThe free to play seems to work.  I REALLY hope they keep it so people that do not pay do not need to grind.     I have not paid a dime and I feel like the grind is comfertable and satisfying enough.\n\nPaying does give you an edge obviously.  You get your Armor and weapon blocks faster and so on as expected.    I hope they Keep the model letting free players have equal access to all game content levels and equipment  at the same speed since I felt rewarded when winning.\n\nSucks a bit if you dont get a Hit on the enemy,  you dont get much points at the end of the match so you really want to be part of the battles.\n\nAnyways my opinion is the game is a decently fun builder.  It has made me giggle a few times rolling around 80% wrecked killing off whoever got in range of my last weapon.\n\nThe bads that the game might have is the overpowered weapons in certain brackets.    Being fully armored with that tiers armor and getting 1 shotted from accross the map might be fun for the shooter,  but i think can hinder the old school feel of original arcade Tank shooters were you r skill manuvering your vehicle and getting a good shot on a target was key game play.    Some weapons are so strong you get as high as you can and just 1 shot sniper whoever comes in view :/\n\nThis game needs guilds int he future,  platoonsa re ok but seems shallow.\n\nBottome line:    I like the game as a FREE player.   So I plan to spend some cash on this game and see how the higher levels play out.  Hopefully they nerf the overall weapon damage in lower tiers with higher tier weapons but other than that try it if you like to build.\n\n","January 31, 2015","true","121.8"," 114 of 135 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","114","135","15","2"

They never stop even after much disdain to how the updates change things, and they never backpedal, even when somebody not two sheets to the wind would.\n\nIt's now all about who has the "legendary" weapons. Who's gotten the RNG favor today? Never gotten anything good other than pitiful cosmetics or something I already have plenty of. I get a legendary? It's a blimmin' "special" pair of wings. I get epic? Gee, six useless cubes that some idiot rubbed up on with charcoal(carbon),... Joy. Only time I saw anything worthwhile in this topsy turvey hole is when it was on premium, which I'm assuming is also more likely than free to get legendary items.\n\nIt's flak, shotgun, or grind until you get them because everything else is six feet under as even rails won't stop a horde of blinking shotgun, crutch players. I enjoy the fond memories, but over 200 hours of my life were wasted on this sinking ship. Glad this mutated, devolved abomination is out of my library forever(and a day).\n\nAlso, ever notice how most positive reviews keeping this game's recent review rating above "Mostly Negative" are not just grammatically inept, but simple statements with no reasoning or logic as to why it is actually still anything more than another "social experiment" gone wrong?\n\nThis game may be "free", but I'd like 265 hours of my life refunded, please!\n\nUpdate:Just came back to check, and congratulations on making it more visible to the developers, as Steam now regards the recent reviews as "Mostly Negative". May it someday penetrate the narcissistic, thick craniums that choose a vile idea of what they want to make rather than the majority's desires, that someday we may actually have fun grinding gear again, as I did before epic loot or their abysmal energy malarky.\n\nThough seriously, a couple condescending numbskulls on youtube making reaction videos were smart enough to backpedal, so why the hell isn't a single person in a team of about 35 bright enough to do so?\n\nAs an update, I've reviewed this on IndieDB as well, and here is the review:\n\nFrom the heights of potential and of much praise, to something whose developers condemn the very people advising them of their wrongdoings, proclaiming their own players at fault for not adapting, and in spite of the condemnation of such a lousy recent update, all they'll do is tweak it and add onto it, blaming us players for the prestated fault. I'm sorry, I'm not fond of adapting to a bed of nails at night, nor people who say they listen, but only if it's a one-sided conversation in their favor("quality of life" voting system, wink wink*flipped bird*).\n\nI had so much fun at one time, making custom robots in creative ways and duking it out with others, but that was many, many updates ago. They've done it before, and they've done it again after the main update everybody is ragging upon, with the armor update. They flip the main mechanics of the game about like a yo-yo and expect us to deal with it.\n\nWhat we hold dear also means nothing to them, proven with the removal of megas, and the addition of shotguns. Now you'll never have to worry about actually spending effort, creativity, time, or any intelligent ingenuity! Just money(go figures, eh?)! All your work gets annihilated in a heartbeat anyway, courtesy of shotguns. Just grab a couple high-tier legs, a couple shotguns, perhaps a blink module and some rechargers, then slap a couple armor cubes on, or maybe a flak! You'll win every time until the matchmaker forces you to lose twenty games in a row(gee, 'fair', right?!)! This game is not what it was, and not in a good way.\n\nIt didn't change into something of worth or equal value, it mutated into an abomination lead by minds beyond a point of any sane return. Wanna bet the developers still will pay us no heed, and if they do, they'll be obnoxiously condescending?\n\nI highly recommend you review it on IndieDB as well. There aren't many reviews, and any surge of reviews now will be recent, so they... might maybe,... possibly actually... listen to us.","May 12","false","503.3"," 112 of 135 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","112","135","7","1"

However the set has been growing larger and larger with every update. The new content isnt really that exciting anymore, for instance the pit. The pit was promising at first when they presented the idea of adding a moba element, a new type of game. Sadly it just turned out to be a FFA which is not very balanced for classes (if you are gonna play that part go for the smg) like plazma or nano.\nUpdating itself is a very slow process, no wonder as they dont have that many devs working on it. Unfortunantly what they promise should come out in the next few weeks wont until months later, when no one even remembers there ever being a note.\nOther key elements in this game have been for the one or the other reason (in my opinion) made from really nice looking to.... kind of crap.\nFor instance the new menu is supossed to be better, however it has only made things worse. It`s just really inpractical now. The new waiting screen is basicly just ads and not really that pretty.\nThe terrain textures are not that good even not on the fantastic setting.\nThe control setup is just an imposibly long list of buttons, and overall the game itself doesnt really look that pretty.\nAlso the point in using anything else then wheels or wings has been lost a bit, everything is now basicly equally crappy, trax used to be slow but to counter that they were near invincible, but now they`re just larger wheels same speed, same armour. not to mention legs which are completly useless unless you want to build a stick with some railguns on it.\n\nTo some it all up:\nthis game used to be great, due to the crappy, boring and just generally pointless updates it has turned into an unbalanced, not that good looking shooter game.\n\ndo i recommend it? No not right at the moment.\nwill i recommend it if some of the problems are solved? YES\n\nEDITION:\nWell its been well over half a year now and i can say: they`ve really ****** up.\nAll they`re doing at this point is adding new and pointless op sh*t that makes the game an incredible grind, aswell as incredibly unbalanced.\nBuilding a hover is pointless now, building a tank is pointless now, building anything else then a walker with flak or a heli of any sort (aslong as its rotors are all on the back) is just plain stupid.\n\nConclusion: dont download this ******* game its utter ♥♥♥♥.","August 28, 2015","false","697.6"," 159 of 204 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","159","204","4","2"

UPDATE ! ! !\nWill revise review when EAC stops blocking Test Mode and unsigned drivers. Would be positive otherwise.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nTake a game with a good concept and throw in every con known to mankind, and you have RoboCraft, the game you want to love but want to strangle to death at any given time. Robocraft wants to be a good game that can allow players from around the world make their own tanks/planes/mechs/flying pinwheels and pit them against everyone else's, except that it fails on every part on what a good multiplayer experience should have and soon becomes boring, repetitive, and rage inducing.\n\nIn Robocraft, you can make just about anything you want to a degree (but more on that later). You have many options of movement from wheels that let you tread around the terrain to hoverblades that let you cushion some air between you and the hard ground. Advanced players can arm themselves with wings and take to the skies or mix everything together into some monstrosity that were not meant for the eyes of mere mortals. From the start, you get 3 robots to work with and 3 garages for each one. Each also demonstrates the unique weapons of the game: the sub machine gun, the plasma cannon, and the railgun.\n\nLet's talk about the weapons: the sub machine gun is you standard 'SMG'; high fire rate, decent accuracy, and good effective range. They are the only weapon (at this time) to have two varieties: front mounted and top mounted, with front mounted being able to lay on the face of a cube and top mounted being best for being on top of a cube. The plasma cannon is an arcing explosion-on-hit weapon that requires some skill to use, but once mastered, it can easily be one of the better weapons in the game. It is only trumped by the railgun, which might as well be the 'point and kill' weapon. The SMG and plasma gun do not have block penetrating damage (though the plasma has splash damage), whereas the railgun does. While it's balancing factor is that it takes 20 seconds to reload, this creates a problem because of how the game determines 'death.'\n\nIn your design of a mech (robot, mech, at this point, the game doesn't really seem to define what on earth you are building), you have a pilot seat, which is where your pilot sits. For a game called 'Robocraft', this seems out of place, and in gameplay, it is. It is a 'block' that consists of 2 blocks outwards and 3 blocks in height. It must rest on two blocks underneath and those two blocks are your only lifeline. Let me repeat: TWO BLOCKS DEFINE IF YOU ARE ALIVE OR DEAD. Remember the railgun's penetration ability? It didn't get the nickname 'point and kill' sitting around drinking on a summer beach (the plasma cannon is no better). Your dream robot better have a huge underbelly because that is your only way to survive, but even then that only gives you a slightly better chance at not dying.\n\nSo let's talk about gameplay. At the moment, there is only one game mode: Capture the point. A team wins by sitting on their enemy's base until the timer gods are satisfied with your demonstration of doing nothing or you can kill the enemy team in your quest for showing off your mad Plasma cannon skills. This is all assuming you survive the first 5 seconds of the match. The game's physics engine is your first real enemy: assuming there is at least one impatient person on your team (pro tip: there always will be one), you may run into the situation that just a gentle bump will send your Robotic death machine into a flying whirl that can only be achieved in a cartoon. If you land right side up, proceed to call that teammate a ♥♥♥♥♥ and move on. If you don't, congratulations: you are now target practice for the enemy railgunners and plasma cannon users until either they kill you (and your two blocks too), or the match ends. You can quit the game at this point with the penalty of taking 25% damage (more on that later).\n\nAssuming you survive the onslaught called 'Lack of Teamwork', the network engine will come out to play. 'Warping', or when an entity moves from place to place due to network latency, is common and the same happens with their bullets. This can make SMGs get magical penetrating powers and make enemies appear to attempt a re-run at flipping you over like the impatient teammate whose mech looked like a fried egg. This doesn't have a lot but when it does happen, you can join the therapy party for everyone else who died from the same reason, and that party is at least a third of the player base.\n\nSo about damage in the game. The game's definition of 'damage' is the total health of your mech, which is mostly attributed by what blocks you used, since each one's armor value is different depending on which ones you do use. If a set of blocks becomes disconnected, that is considered to be doing a massive amount of damage and your health will plummet like most of your hopes and dreams of what could be achieved in the game. Any damage you receive at the end of a match (including if one of the two blocks providing your pilot leg room gets destroyed) must be repaired at the cost of either the in-game currency or actual money. Remember that 25% that you lose if you quit the game early? That also falls under your bill and if you get flipped over after taking damage, the 25% is only tacked on to what you have. This makes any earnings you received from the game get minimized even further. The game has a 'bonus engine', but the rules for that are to laugh at any player trying to actually achieve it: you must not die and your team must win. This means if your team wins but you were sacrificed to ensure victory, congratulations: you haven't appeased the Robocraftian gods enough for a pay raise. Will that be cash or cash?\n\nSurely there has to be a way to keep the game balanced, and the game's attempt at it is laughable at best. There are 10 tiers, with each tier under the assumption that the weapons and armor of that tier is better. Unfortunately, this isn't the real world situation. You can be shoved into a higher tier due to using more blocks for your beach ball of doom or because of the weapon's lethality. On top of that, assuming you have evenly matched lethality and good looks, the matchmaking will often pit you against tiers 1 to 2 above your own. Suddenly those pair of sunglasses you added aren't looking so hot and floorless pilot is you with the enemy team's highest tier mech mowing your fellow team's tier mechs for target practice.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the map selection, and unlike the flavor selection at your Dairy Queen, you have only 4 to choose from, two being ice and the other being on Mars. If you have the misfortune to be rocking out with tires on the ice area, have fun on the ice river that each ice map offers, as it has a physical property where you will glide forever in one direction despite how much you try to turn and reverse the other way. You will grow thankful for how other games interprets ice physics after experiencing Robocraft's interpretation. Mars doesn't really have much going for it and the blandness will make you wish for another map, all of which are chosen randomly while matchmaking, which is the only option you have (no picking a match, no choosing an enemy platoon to face).\n\nIn closing, Robocraft is the game that wants to be unique and enjoyable, but falls flat on its face on its own ice physics only shortly after tripping over its own flaws. I haven't even covered its 'premium membership' and other obvious ploys to earn money quickly and with as little effort as possible, but those would only add insult to injury.

Freejam has recently confirmed this:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/301520/announcements/detail/61147721897843297\nWhile my review, which is based off the game's CURRENT state will still remain "Not Recommended", I must say, after seeing this, I've got one thing to say. Freejam...\n\nDON'T F**K THIS UP.\n\nAnyways, now for the rest of my review. Keep in mind this is all based off the game's current state (or at least, when I last played it which was during the last weeks of June), and will change once, as I've said at the end of this review (multiple times), Freejam gets their s**t together.\n\n===================================================================\n\nOkay, I apologize for the upcoming wall of text but, I feel like this needs to be said.\n\nLet me tell you a story. You see, there was once a time where this game was one of the best Free to Play Indie Games you'll ever get.... anywhere, really.\nI started playing this more than a year ago because, well, I liked the game's general concept.\nBuild a fighting machine and fight others with it in a crazy capture-the-base type game.\n\nAnd the battles, the battles.... they happen on either Mars or a fictional ice planet from one of the Gliese star systems.\nYou can choose to be a tank, a jet, a helicopter, a mecha, a walker, a high performance hypercar....\nDude, you name it.\n\nSure there were once a few setbacks like say, repair costs and all that crazy BS but, the devs (before they f***ing lost it) decided to eventually remove that and heck, even added new things like Tesla Blades, Nano-Disruptors, Rotor Blades and other cool ****.\n\n\nHowever, with this good stuff came something rather... awful, so to speak.\nA rather toxic and divided playerbase. Something that, unknown to some (including myself, unfortunately), would cause this game's eventual downfall (as of writing this review).\n\n\nSee, Freejam (the devs) decided to do a massive game changer:\n\nCreate a new game mode that involved destroying the enemy team's base and capturing a bunch of towers (sort of like a MOBA, so to speak).\nPersonally, I really didn't mind the update at first, I mean, the original game mode was getting old pretty fast and, I always wanted something far more strategic... unfortunately, that is when things started going to s***.\n\nThe update finally came around and all of a sudden, unoriginal, uninspired, easy-to-build "bricks" reigned supreme.\nTanks or helicopters shaped like either bricks or a bunch of bricks slapped together (the creator of Lego is rolling in his grave right now), armed with SMGs, Plasma Cannons or Nano Disruptors (aka Medic Guns).\nThere was almost no way of stopping them without either dying or losing half of your entire 'bot. Thankfully, with that one update\n(called the “Meta” update by the devs), you can still respawn and, heck, the devs even decided to listen and fix some the bugs plaguing said update.\n\nIt wasn't really enough, but it was definitely better than nothing.\nLittle did we know, however, that it was unfortunately, all downhill from there.\n\nAs time went on, Freejam seemed to be more catering to those aforementioned brick builders.\nFixed Winged aircraft became close to obsolete, walkers and even other vehicles, whether built creatively or practically went down like flies.... it was awful.\n\nFortunately, most of us still had the opportunity to build the way we want, only limited by our robots' ranks and our CPU levels which, while limiting, wasn't that bad. Little did we know however, that things were, yet again, about to get worse. Far worse that what we could ever imagined.\n\nSome elitist scrubs, a VERY vocal minority, decided to complain on and on.\nThey called some of us overpowered, overtiered (ignoring the fact that most people, e.g. the ones who built actual bots and not tiny scrubmobiles with one over tiered gun, were building along the tier limit), seal clubbers, etc.\n\nThey kept telling Freejam to nerf EVERYTHING they find "overpowered". And they did.\n\nIn the span of a month, they limited weapon and armor tiers, they limited how much CPU you can have per tier, effectively limiting majority of the playerbase's ability to build actual good bots.\n\nAs of today's recent update, bricks, scrub bots (THE VERY THING THEY WERE TRYING TO NERF), literal glass cannons (bots made out of glass), and 'bots dubbed as "Markbots", tiny bots made with 5-10 armor cubes, glass, one powerful gun of each tier now reign supreme. Maps and multiplayer are broken, there's bugs wherever the eye can see (and probably beyond as well), the creativity, the fun, the "soul" this game once had, so to speak...\n\nIt's gone. All gone. And the elitists celebrate and gloat over their victory while most of us suffer for the actions of a few random scrubs who can't build worth s*** back before the Meta update even came around. Freejam has killed their own good game.\n\n\nTL/DR: Until Freejam decides to get their s*** together and stop catering to certain elitist scrubs, avoid this game at all costs. It's just a hollow shell of the greatness it used to be.\n\nEDIT: Decided to fix this review a bit so it won't be a straight up wall of text (and therefore, easier to read.... hopefully). Oh and grammatical errors have been fixed too. You're all welcome.\n\nStill, my opinion stands. Until Freejam gets their s*** together, avoid this game at all costs. It's not worth it. Maybe I'll play this again in the future (again, and apologizing for being a repetitive **** here, when Freejam decides to fix their s*** and get their s*** together), but until then, again, avoid at all costs.","June 24, 2015","false","805.5"," 277 of 378 people (73%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","73","277","378","23","47"

RC is a relativly calm game with sparcly epic moments in between matches. If you desire more action rather than using your brain or just being relaxed - having more casual-orientated fun, will ultimatly decide if this game is for you.\n\n2 - RC is a game that has more emphasis on creative (and somewhat more) strategic gameplay. The creative aspect is obiously building your own bot upon your desired taste with using the finitie resources that you have.\n\n3 - 30% of victory chances will be dictated by the calibur of robots. 70% go towards teamwork - and how tactics are handled.\n\n4 - RC has a great community, and will open its eyes to any player brand new player or otherwise. There is a fairly large variety of bots to build or inspire from. Going on websites like RC garage, Forums, Reddit or even YouTube, will make you become a better RC Engineer.\n\n\nCONS: (again, imo)\n\n1 - RC is grind heavy, when you need to build higher tier bots, so you will need to invest planty of time to get the most out of this product. This issue espacially arises during late game stages, when your in this situation that building lower tier Robots in quantity is far cheaper and more fun rather than doing weeks of grinding to get that desired fulltime-T10 other Robot.\n\n2 - Though the game does counter this with the creative aspects, Robocraft still does not have a variety of game modes to choose from. You may have a large pool variety of robots to possibly spend the RP for, but you could feel that this game may need more maps or even items (cubes) on the cube depo.\n\nAnd that is really it...","May 9, 2015","true","450.3"," 90 of 105 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","90","105","9","3"

As it stands today, the game is near intolerable, broken and flawed on nearly all levels. Robocraft ‘CAN’ be extremely fun, at times. Those times... are ending.\n\nOverall Fantastic idea, monumental potential… However, horrendous money hungry developers who lack the intellectual and creative potential to sustain and progress this game past its former glory.\n\nPlay for fun, but don’t waste your time expecting anything balanced, professional or even at times functional.

Vehicles are voxel like while the terrain you fight in isn't. Currently the game modes: team deathmatch, last team standing wins or you can capture the other team’s base; the pit, free or all, first to 20 wins; battle arena, MOBA styled gameplay where you basically take out the other team’s base.\n\nEdit: Full Spectrum Combat\nIt comes with free premium until 2016 for existing players. Lot’s of major changes. They added a paint gun so you can color your blocks whatever color you want, but now tiered blocks don’t exist like T1-T10. So you can now be creative with color and not suffer a combat disadvantage. Speaking of creativity have 25 garage slots to be creative with. It’ll be infinite garage slots later on so that limitation of 3 is gone. They also added new blocks to be creative with.\n\nCombat wise there isn’t a pilot seat anymore so you die if <25% of your bot is left now. Being stuck crippled somewhere isn’t a thing now since if you don’t participate in combat for 10 seconds you auto heal. There’s alot more so I won’t dive further into the update.\n\n\nAspect	Pro	Con	Building	It's easy. There's a mirror mode to make things easy.\n\nBuild anything.	Some kind of grind to get more stuff to build bigger vehicles.\n\nHave to be premium to use all the colors.	Devs	They're active with content updates and bug fixes.\n\nTechnical support forums is good.	Tech support seems...average.(I've never had any tech/account problems during the year I played) [They’re ‘customer support minion’ is down till Jan. 4th, but I doubt you’ll run into any problems]. 	Gameplay	Always on blue team so less confusion. Just attack red.\n\nMostly balanced matchmaking, both teams will have as close to the same amounts of gun types as possible.\n\nNo Pay2Win. Everything (except cosmetics) can be bought with in-game currency you earn from battle.\n\nFree Premium every once in awhile to help you get that much needed currency to build your robot and progress.	Bad teammates/medic.\n\nOnly 2 map types, ice planet and mars. 6 maps total.	Guns	Simplicity. You can only be 1 out of the 4 gun types (machine gun, sniper, explosive, medic) with an optional melee weapon that you unlock later in the game. 	Not much gun variety.\n\nRecommended To:\nPeople who like designing vehicles\nPeople who like vehicular combat which includes tanks, airplanes, helis, etc. (You can just buy robots from the robot factory with RP you get from battling if building isn’t your strong suit)\nPeople who like shooters\nTrolls","April 12, 2015","true","368.5"," 104 of 127 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","104","127","13","11"

What a shame - PLEASE fix your terrible new tiering system out, you completely killed robocraft with it. Until then, I have very little motivation to play. I have played with friends since first release, LOVED IT. Got over T10+, stopped for a while and we said to each other that "we can't wait to play it in a while and see it grow and mature"... 1 year later, we try it again updated, excited to show additional friends too... but wait, it's not Robocraft anymore - it's truly Robocrap. The spirit of classically, easily and understandably levelling up (to all types of end-users) has died... you could even say this pretty much isn't even a proper objective-based level-up game anymore, now it's just some weird kind of open-world-free-for-all-matchmaking-CHAOS that is really frustrating and just doesn't make sense.\n\nRobocraft is now literally a sinking ship - soon on it's way to 'Mixed' reviews on Steam. This game could have been a timeless classic, and it still can be. Would love to delete this review and leave a recommended one, make it happen. I'll be watching carefully, and honestly if it's not fixed soon I'll be very sad to see this once-a-great-game be uninstalled from my library.\n\n*EDIT/UPDATE 1* - For people who say I'm hating, I'm not, I still love the game and I'm actually still playing it, if you haven't played the game since it's initial release you won't understand. Trust me, if you played the pre-updated versions you would say, “why did they ever change it?!” ... I just cannot recommend Robocraft anymore - yes it WAS a fantastic game, but anyone can make any robot now and the matchmaking will 90% of the time put you in an extremely unfair game - the tiering system is completely messed up making the whole aim of the game pointless... the achingly painful feeling of spending hours on building an awesome robot only to find it is put into games with MUCH more powerful robots is depressing, confusing and just pure torture :(\n\n*EDIT/UPDATE 2* (29/09/2015) - I was just playing Robocraft all last night, woke up this morning and wow... just WOW - FREEJAM what are you guys even doing?! A few days ago I made this review and it made it to the steam store page and I hoped maybe you guys would feel my outrage, but nope, you go and add even more ridiculous updates. In the last update you made it so that only high level robots can do TDM, a week later, without any word of warning again, without letting the community know what your doing you switch the whole thing around for a week? and your excuse is, "so we can make more games available for everyone"... :| :| :| LOL HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?! At least come up with better excuses. Seriously, let us know more about what your doing and working on, you should be serving your consumers, making votes and poll's, making us feel part of the development, instead you don't listen to suggestions and complaints and you act like Gods who use their consumers as lab rats. I'm not even playing this week because of today's update. You know, I didn't even know who you guys were until your over-tampering with the game, your presence in the game makes me feel nauseous and I had to find out who was causing it, how sad is that? I should be searching you guys up because of how awesome you guys are as developers, and yes you guys were good initally, but your test of integrity failed badly. How can you not see your ruining the game? It's like you guys sweat on your monitors so much that you can't see your screens anymore. Take a break, have a shower and clean it all up.\n\nSorry if I seem harsh xD I'm just ranting on, BUT STILL, the truth is always harsh. :) Anyway just remember I'm willing to forgive and forget and venerate you guys as one of the best indie game developers ever for making the awesome game that is Robocraft if you just sort out all these unnecessary updates, kthnxbye :D (Y)","September 22, 2015","false","144.3"," 287 of 397 people (72%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","72","287","397","26","20"

Pretty pleased with myself. Then freejam, the drugged up devs of robocraft, went ahead and scrapped the entire teir system! xD Luckily i was lvl 100 so i wasnt effected from loosing things.\n\nTime 2: The pricing of TX parts. Just extortionate prices. Basically if you didnt have premium, you would have to play 300+ hours saving up to get a mega robot. BS.\n\nTime 3: In a recent update, they scrapped ALL ARMOUR BLOCKS, all weapon teir names and removed half of them. They made this dumb looking paint THING which makes blocks stupid colours. They added the portal gun which you know use to place blocks. The blocks are all the same now, but are they? I dont even know xD, because this update is so dumb that we dont even know if the higher tier (when there was a teir) weapons do the same amount of damage to the blocks depending on the robot ranking? They also removed the pilot seat, which is the main thing you protect in robocraft, which is one of the challanges of making a robot...\n\nBasically, over the past year or so, FreeJam has ruined their game. Since they got that indie game of the year award, they just went downhill... I kind of wish they hadnt gotten that award, as I feel it boosted them to go a bit crazy on their game. We didnt know if the changes would be crazy stupid, or crazy good, but i guess thats the unpredictability surrounding freejam.....\nSo it was a good game, but that was before the updates came out....

And you also might be turned off because a lot of those review are by people who played this game A LOT. Well they're all right.\n\nI used to play this game whenever I didn't have a enw game to play, because it was consistantly fun. Sometimes i'd get burned out but then i'd come back because the only limit to what you could build was pretty much what you thought up. New ideas, more gameplay. But now it's nothing like it used to be. I'll list quickly the reasons for my dissatisfaction.\n\nFirst - No more tier system, everything is linear.\nSecond - They took away the pilot seat (the core of the robot) and just say that if you drop below 25% hp you die.\nThird - They killed off healers, if you can hide for 10 seconds without shooting, you auto heal almost immediatley, so healers are irrelevant.\nFourth - They changed cubes without compensation (of which i should have gotten a lot) and completly ruined my favorite bot because of the change in cubes\nFifth - To go with the auto healing, there is now this one type of bot that takes forever to kill, but never stops moving. In other words, it attacks, flys away, gets full health and attacks again. It's just so annoying that i quit the game after seeing 5 on the other team.\nsixth - It's just not the game that they had origionally gotten known for, and they continue to degrade it.\n\nConclusion - If you want to play this game and form your own opinion go for it. just know that it is a HUGE grind with littel reward now, and they might decide they don't like stuff and junk it so don't get attached.\n\nP.S. Just in case someone is reading this thinking "o he just doesn't want to make new things and keep up with the game" that's not true. I have loved that they updated their game, but this specific update is terrible.

I'm not even going to bother linking all of you to the monoliths of text I have written to try and save them. So, I'm done with this game.\n\n--Covering every mistake since the crumbling of robocraft, the invention of the ranked protonium battles\n\nFirst off, you're a tad late posting that maximum loadout trailer\n\nRanting on OP Plasma Bombers\n\nSecond, what went through your minds when you gave players a flak cannon to defend the OP plasma bombers, and then release missiles so you can make them OP again? The only way to protect yourself from missiles is to hide behind objects. Guess what! Bombers go OVER those objects. Not to mention they move 5 times faster than ground bots. Oh, and then you release the full weapons update, you give them BOTH plasmas and missles! What a great combination for DEATH, never ending DEATH\n\nRanting on the destruction of railgun robots\n\nHow about when you added those "Cray" player model bots for driver seats? It was awesome, but when you remove driver seats altogether, it combusts the point of railgunner bots, because you're giving them less things to aim for. EXCEPT FOR THE MEGACUBE, OFCOURSE\n\nRanting on the destruction of medic bots\n\nBots that orbit around that whole area are now useless, thanks to these new updates. You have a fire-rate with these now, not to mention that they do NOTHING to enemies anymore. You also shortened the range of their use and increased their proficiency by about 0.01%. OH YEAH, NOT TO MENTION THAT BOTS HEAL THEMSELVES NOW\n\nRanting on protonium ranked battles\n\n"Ranked battles will not always increase or decrease..."\nWhat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I do proficient battles in that ranked arena FIVE TIMES to get a rank increase, but every loss seems to be a decrease. OH AND WHAT ABOUT: How leaving a protonium battle will cause you to wait two minutes, even accidental. Listen, robocraft even gives you a CONFIRMATION NOTE that you accidentally disconnected, and you still get the short-♥♥♥ 2 minute beating of wait, just enough time to grab a cup of coffee.\n\nFinally, ranting on the obstruction of strategy whatsoever\n\nHmmmmmmm lets see where to start with this one. Oh yeah, the removal of tiers, blocks, and all that other ♥♥♥♥. Good work, because when you remove tiers and blocks and limited weapons, you remove the even thought of needed to get a challenge in building a robot. Why? Because now all you need to do is just make a ♥♥♥♥ing twig robot, throw some weapons on it, and its good to go! What happened where if you were going to build a flying robot, you'd actually need to consider and calculate how many sheilds and what weapons? Oh wait, you can put any weapon on them now. Oh wait, your robot falls too fast behind a rock to be destroyed, giving you the chance to heal yourself all fine and dandy. As for megas, you still need that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ strategy cause God knows that mega smg's accuracy was reduced 50% so you can't actually kill the ♥♥♥♥ing things shooting from above, which you allow 80% of the bots in a battle to be flying~\n\nOh, and how about not restricting almost every color available to premium? And all that other stuff, of which you're bottlenecking non-premium players to pay more money~\n\nYour match making is also one unfunny joke. All those flying bots. RIP in MEGA.\n\nRanting on what should also never have left robocraft\n\nYou never should have removed boss battles. Boss battles were the best, and I still remember those great days where 4 Teir 8 or 9 bots would fight against a whole team of little Teir 3-5's or one Megabot fighting against a battle of Teir 3-7's. But wait, Teirs don't exist anymore.\n\nEDIT: Lets go over to when this game went to ♥♥♥♥.\n\nRobocraft Unleashed Updates:\n-- Maximum Freedom, just build whatever you want and take it into battle\n-- Completely new match-making using Robot Ranking and Player Level\n-- Armor restrictions lifted completely\n-- Tier CPU caps lifted completely\n-- Overtier restrictions lifted completely\n-- Brand new Robot Ranking gauge, with pizazz!\n-- Platoons now match-made based on (just above) the average Robot Ranking between the smallest and the largest Robot Ranking in the platoon\n-- RP rewards are now based on your performance in battle and the Robot Ranking of your Robot\n-- Robot Ranking re-balanced on all cubes to assist ‘match-maker’ to match Robots more equally\n-- T1 changed to Mk1 in names of all functional and armor cubes\n\nand all that other crap.\n\nLike freejam wrote a book on "freedom" and replaced their hard-drive backups with it.\n\nHere's something we all miss:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lgZFLlt.jpg","March 14","false","428.6"," 138 of 183 people (75%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","75","138","183","15","62"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xzal/recommended/301520/","Xzal","Xzalander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xzal/","597 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI give up with Robocraft.\n\n\nTLDR; Robocraft devs don't know what they want their game to be. They've tried DM/TDM, E-Sports, Creative Building, MOBA, Player Choice Progression, Forced progression, bland progression. Each and every update drastically changing how the game plays and nullifying ANY work players have put in to creating their bots.\nThey establish one set of rules only to change them a few months down the line under the guise of "Balancing" or enabling "player creativity" and doing the complete opposite.\n\nNot to mention the game has flaws from years ago still not fixed and now being hidden by new changes. For example MM being broken turning it into "Who has the most medics, wins"and hiding the poor matchmaking by removing robot classification "because not all bots were classified correctly" (translation, 1 in maybe 100 were wrong, and "its haaaard.")\n\nEdit to include the latest update (Max Loadout) - Again FJ don't understand normal development practices. They threw in MASSIVE changes all at once and are no sat scratching their heads wondering why it broke. Flak is bugged (DMG), Nano is bugged (LMB+RMB = superspeed heal), MSMGs are bugged (free aim firing, without LOS), matchmaking is atrocious (still), Blink and DSM are stupidly expensive (Both RP/GC and CPU). They should have done a slow implement of these changes one by one to iron each minor kink, instead of this.\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\nToo many wild changes, one step forward two steps back is this developers motto.\n\nRobocraft initially had a sensible mixture of Creativity and Function. There was also a sensible mix of Grind, Progression and sense of achievement. It was a little lacklustre in places.\n\nFor example, the RP system allowed you to choose what you unlocked and the level system determined how "effective" those unlocks were. As you progressed in Level and CPU, your bots got bigger, your weapons better.\n\nThis has now been swapped out for a system where equipment is unlocked in order, over time with no player input. Once you unlock an item, that is it, theres no improvement. Everything is by default "Tier 10".\n\nThis in turn made building robots boring, no more balancing weaponry vs armor vs mobility. If you chose to go cosmetic-bot there was a challenge to making a bot functional but in "theme".\nNow sure you can build a bot "exactly" as you want, as long as you like Yellow, Pink, White, Grey & Brown as your color palette. The other colours are locked to premium (Note they touted this "flattening" of tiers as an 'improvement' to creative robot building).\n\nThen theres the slew of problems with actual Gameplay mechanics.\n\nInitially there were balancing issues as expected, they kind of balanced themselves out up until Unleashed/Legendary update and the devs got stuck in a nerf cycle on everything except SMGs.\n\nThis last update saw them add the near useless flak, severely nerf the Medics Nano and turned it into SMGcraft again.\nThey also did away with many of the useful gameplay information elements.\nSpotting now just says "Enemy Spotted" with no indication of flier, hover, walker, they claimed this is because bots were "complicated to classify" yet for the most they were classified correctly. This means you find it far harder to prioritise the right targets.\n\nThis also affects your own team negatively as you can no longer easily see if a friendly medic is nearby or if a push block is Rail Heavy and needs more SMG or plasma.\n\nThe game has also suffered Match making issues from day one. Resulting in differing metas.\nThe latest of which is "The Team who has the most medics, wins".\n\nThe hiding of Bot Type and spotting call outs I think was done to merely hide how bad the matchmaking is, especially as in the past when we could see the team makeups we would see matches where it was 6 rails and two plasmas vs say 6 SMGs and two medics.\n\nPut simple, the devs have taken this game in far too many directions, too rapidly and with no forethought.\n\nInitially it was a DM/TDM game, then they opened it up to the Creative Block Builders, then expanded to Boss Battles (removed, was one Megabot vs lots of little bots quite fun), then switching to try their hand at MOBA-like Tower matches, then trying to create some kind of bespoke "Robot Market" where players can sell their bots, but their currency system is too expensive to support.\n\nIts like they saw all these good ideas from other games and tried to cram it into their own, trying to snap up a bit of another niche in gaming and half assing it so badly that it introduces more problems than it gains in players.\n\nThis is likely the reason why they "flattened" their game down to basic progression.","January 28","false","533.3"," 184 of 253 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","184","253","9","7"

Where people once spent countless hours fine tuning creative vehicles now the most effective bot is a brick with several guns attached on treads. Additionally they have enstilled extreme limitations on all tiers making gameplay homogeneous and boring at all levels.\n\nAt the begining of the year I couldn't have said enough good about this game but now all I can say is don't waste your time. Look up Steamcraft if you want something more to the tune of what this game used to be about (be warned though the whole game is set up in russian so there is a bit of a learning curve).\n\nUpdate: The limitations on tiers have been lifted by way of removing tiers. Now the old problem of extremely powerful weapons making it into low level games is worse than ever. In an attempt to fix the problem of overtiering they have made it much worse.\n\nAdditionally the lead developer made a statement that he will be much more active on the forums, bringing up new ideas and getting the communities feedback before adding in unwanted changes. And he did...for 3 days. Since then (roughly two weeks ago) he has been all but completely absent on the forums. It appears that nothing will convince the devs to really use community feedback.","June 24, 2015","false","091.0"," 257 of 364 people (71%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","71","257","364","13","13"

Its completely unsafe and invasive of your privacy. The program collects your online data and personal information ie. browser history, downloads. There has been numerous cases where users couldnt sign in after the EAC update as well.  Honestly i think the developers should instead have a report system where users can report other players if they are using cheats or hacks.\n\nConclusion: RC is fun and the more items you unlock, the more you just want to keep on playing.

They have completely ignored their vocal community and have made the reward system become a game of RNG as opposed to skill.\n\nThe balance has been destroyed gradually over the past year, up to the point that there are now 'legendary' weapons that will outgun any normal weapons. To make matters worse, the new weapon types are also designed to require no skill (such as massive aoe explosions and auto-aim). The overall result of this is the game no longer rewards thoughtful construction of bots and skillful aiming.\n\nIf you are a new player, these problems are even more prevalant, as you will be matched up against players who will slap a hover blade onto a 'legendary' weapon and they will completely outlcass anyone within their robot's rating (which is determined by the parts you use to build your robot).\n\nUnfortunately this game seems to be moving towards 'cash grab' and is starting to feel like a premium mobile game.","May 18","false","369.5"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","64","74","2","1"

Back then it was a sense of adventure to rank up through the tiers and levels, both of which were very hard to increase - so the challenge was there. That sense of "Yeah, I built that" when you finally make that perfect bot was also brilliant.\n\nThose days are long since past.\n\nThe tiering system is gone entirely, and it is SO EASY to level up, that when I started the game after it was first changed. I jumped from 55 to 100 instantly, and I heard you could jump from even further back than that. The game's menus are SO CLUNKY now and they're hard to navigate... I still don't know what many of my button mappings actually do on the menu, but they do something. The colouring system was a neat idea - though it's just a consolation prize for losing the tiering system - but you have to be premium to actually have creativity with the colours, which is just... marvelous. Oh, no more tech points? There goes the fun in unlocking things too.\n\nThe Community Robot Factory, while well-intended, is just a plagiarism facility at worst, and at best utterly annihilates that thrill of finally completing a robot which you built yourself. Also, HOW MUCH ARE THESE WEAPONS?! TEN MILLION RP FOR A SINGLE TOP-POWER WEAPON? GET STUFFED I AIN'T PAYIN' THAT I ONLY GET LIKE 50-100K PER BATTLE!!!\n\nMedic bots have been rendered obsolete, as has any form of stategy in the game and the building, by the auto heal feature. If you do actually take damage, you can hide behind a corner, and get all your health back. What a load of ♥♥♥♥. And the pilot seat was removed, so no need to worry about protecting the weak spot now.\n\nI really miss the old boss battle/megabot challenge. Couple of strong bots against a full team of weak ones. That was actually really fun and it was balanced too. Guess they decided it gave the veteran players too much enjoyment, and they didn't want noobs rage-quitting after one of these fights, so it's gone now.\n\nWorst of all, the game crashes a LOT more than it used to, which really pisses me off, as if you're in the middle of a battle, SEE YA NO REWARD FOR YOU WE JUST WANNA WASTE YOUR TIME BYE! I swear the amount of times I heard "A PLAYER HAS DISCONNECTED" in one match was frightening, just before I crashed myself.\n\nI remember the days when I used to enjoy this game, but now it's both too complex and too simple at once. Complex, in the sense that all those CUBE VARIATIONS; inner slope, edge slope, what? WHAT ARE THESE FOR?\n\nAt least they refunded all those new garage payments I made so now I have thousands upon thousands of free GC. So there's that at least.\n\nUPDATE TIME:\n\nSo, they changed the mechanics again, by changing prices so they are a bit cheaper. Fine, that's alright, it's a good start. What isn't so good is that they lowered the maximum reward whilst raising the minimum one, so now you earn roughly the same amount of RP whether you're complete crap or absolutely amazing. To quote, "Our intent was to help boost the RP income of below-average skilled players so they felt they could make progress regardless, and to lower the bonus obtained for doing exceptionally well to something far more reasonable."\n\nSo now what? Now there is ZERO incentive to actually put effort in to get good at the game, because you still get a decent amount of RP just for participation. This just downright insults those who have taken the time to learn and master the game by restricting the value of their skill, and patronizes the weak and makes it so that they don't have to actually master the game at all. Add this factor to the appalling matchmaking and you get a complete and utter mess of a competitive game.\n\n... If you do exceptionally well at something, you expect to be rewarded for it. If you're bad, you're deprived of that reward so you have incentive to get better so you will EARN that reward. But no, everyone gets similar amounts now. It's as if the devs wanted to be modern-day Robin Hoods, or those feminists trying to sort out the mythical "wage-gap" that no-one can prove exists. There's a better way to fix the progression issue; stop making everything so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ expensive. Even with these price drops, most of the top-tier weapons are seven million or so anyway - so what's the point of all this?\n\nWell, at least they tried. They killed off all of their veterans with this change, but they tried. I know some of you will call this "nitpicking" but when you see how much of a stupid concept this all is...\n\nUPDATE AGAIN:\n\nOk. They reverted the reward changes. I take back all that I said before. Good to see that the devs are actually listening to the community for once. Let's see where the future takes the game now. They still have a bit to fix.","February 6","false","113.5"," 213 of 302 people (71%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","71","213","302","23","8"

I even gave the developers some money and bought some items. I now wish that I had saved my money. This game has, like many of my bots, been flown into the ground at a rapid rate after several of the important bits have been taken away. It used to be that you would build a robot of a certain tier, and would be matched with similar robots. Hearing complaints about how you could exploit the ranking system, they attempted to balance it, but it was a crap method of doing so: by completely removing the system. At this point, I stopped playing for a while. I came back to this game, hearing of a new update, and they had in fact removed features.

Before one could get one shot kill with bombers or  railguns if hit the right robot spot, Now it takes forever to destroy pretty much anyone because everyone uses the same blocks. Block type is one variable removed that helped to make the game challenging.\n\nA bad remark also for the non-compensation on blocks when the update was made, some of us have spent a lot on blocks and that was a waste of time and money for some. I'm glad i didn't spent any money on this game otherwise I would lose the investment in blocks. I don't recomend to spend money on this game because you can lose your items overnight in some crazy update or your item can be rendered useless by an update\n\nAnother one is the pilot seat removal, it helps to create diferent shapes of robots, but now you don't have to protect your sweet spot! again, making the game easier by removing the sweet spot and the limitations the pilot seat had.\n\nThe worst one is the auto healing, this completly changed the game dynamics! before you had to think on how to build your robot even for the case it would get damaged, making sacrificial parts to be blown when under attack. Also you had to put some extra locomotion parts, in case you would lose wings, wheels, etc. when under attack.\nNow you have auto healing! no need for this! just hover your bot over a mountain, if someone shoots you down, just lay on there hidden (when possible) and wait to be up and running again! Same for tanks, just hide in a corner when your health is getting low.\nBefore the update you would think twice before engaging, now everyone is Kamikaze! before you could damage an airplane or tank useless with a couple of shots, so people would be carefull when atacking, now everyone just charges ahead full steam!\n\nAlso untill the introduction of the AA canon, the game was quite unbalanced, air units had a massive advantage because of the hit and run tatic, T10 block and the auto regen.\n\nOnly good remark was the introduction of colours.\n\nAl said, I think the game was dumbed down in order to attract more people and to please fustrated users who couldn't do a good robot or use them properly.  The developers want to please everyone and attract more people  making the game  more "arcadish"  but they are scaring some fans away and killing the thing that made the game special, I know I don't play as much asI used to!\n\nIt was a very good and addictive game now I guess it's just ok, something to fill that 10 min break.\n\nPS: sorry for any misspeling, no spell check was used.","January 28","false","284.3"," 210 of 302 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","210","302","6","12"

Just buy it, its better than think of your own unique bot, right?\n6) Tiers- I cant see Roboranking or whatever being better.\n7) Eliminating veteran player bases, OK, we don't like new stuff and we are always complaining that game was better before, i know, but still.\n8) Boss mode- This was fun, a actually liked it.\n9) Tech points- They had sense, you could invest in whatever you wanted, and part tree wasn't that spiral something.\n10) Seats- i see why you removed them, but that doesn't change fact, that half fun was to make it hidden as well as possible, because it was weakest robo point (they had sense, considering em as "crit spots").\n11) Cube types- Slopes, this *****, curves and that little thingy that made tesseract possible.\n12) Homing projectiles- why? Where did the skill aspect of game went? Actually, rockets are balanced in its kinda way, but proto-seekers... Why?\n13) Parts connection points- most things just got 1 where could fit multiple- also wings could have some points underneath, for better mounting of weapons.\n14) Hide&Heal - yeah, this got rid of awkward waiting for crippled bots to kill themselves, but it just seems to be... Lame.\n15)League of what? I personally don't like this mode, its about which team have more of "Cancer bots".\n16) Unique designs- where did they went? Right now, everybody is downloading bots from CRF, or there are just few styles to play game, because others arent worth it.\n17) Optimization/Connection- Game freezing aka im the only one who can move, i spawn in middle of game, and my team is dead already, i spawn dead, loading screen freezes game, and i could continue whole day....\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAlthough, i cant say i don't like this game, but something just don't work here, It could be great with just few changes....\nI spent about 600 hours on it (steam+non-steam launcher) and i don't regret it, i don't feel like i have the rights to complain about a game, i like and hate at same time, there never will be such game, that will fit everybody...\n\nAlso, its FREE, should i complain in first place?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","April 1","false","431.8"," 69 of 85 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","69","85","0","3"

In the meantime however, FreeJam has done a very good job at completely destroying the game.\n\nFirst off, my most hated patch: Matchmaking:  match-making takes into account Player Skill, Player Level and CPU of Robot.\nWhile it sounds ok at first, it was stated and ment to be a CPU based system, the bigger your bot you made, the higher matching tier you get into, great for everyone, while the algorithim was bad, it was more or less acceptable. They made player skill and player level a thing now. With this, a max level player now can not play with a low level friend, without their friend getting the shaft, seriously. Play a match with a buddy whos 150 like myself, and the guy is under 40, BY DEFAULT my level puts him into high ranking matches. WTF? Good job on destroying party play.\n\nProgression: NEW PLAYERS READ!\nProgressoin used to be fairly straightforward. WIth the introduction of Loot Crates and matchmaking changes, Your going to find yourself in a black hole of stress and anxiety that will only be saited with death and dismemberment. New players will have a starting bot and starting armaments, no extras, no money no nothing. You will be put into matches with players who now have everything, who are capable of oneshotting your little starter mech with the simplest of weapons, Im warning you now, if you DO decide to play, Understand that you will die, countless countless times as you level. I almost reccomend you buying a humble bundle code for 6 bucks, it will atleast give you starter material and 90 days of premium. The grind to get gear is RNG based, so finding that wing you need, or that wheel, could take you a long...long time.\n\nLoot Crates: The addition of Loot crates this new expansion was good in theory, the game orriginally allowed you to purchase items with the money made each match, allowing players to build how they want. Now? Now you have to open loot crates, a RNG system, that allows you to obtain items from the game on a random basis, items you dont like, you can salvage for 1/20th the value of the item, thats right, 1/20th. Before, you could play a match, and afford a weapon, or perhaps a wing, or maybe a little bit of blocks. Now players, especially new players are unable to build freely. You must break down items you dont want, to get 10-200 robits (currency used in game), then spend 20k+ robits to buy a weapon that would have taken far less time to recieve, OR get lucky and get one in a case.\n\nCombat: Combat was great for a time, then the introduction to Lock on Missle Launchers (LOML henseforth) and Protoseekers (PSK) has created a game that no longer requires accuracy or skill, instead requires a person simply to get a lockon beforeyou. A game with this content, with this gameplay , should NOT contain weapons that allow a player to simply lock on and kill. This effectively nullfies any Flying bots almost indefinatly.\n\nFreeJam Company: They have a bad habbit of being quiet, While i supported them at the start, over the years ive seen them turn their backs on their playerbase 95% of the time, when they are listening to us about imbalances, horrible matchmaking, or bugs/gliches, they put patches out that not only negatively affect the game, but introduce even more issues!\n\nCombined with the issues of Matchmaking, Lock On weaponry, and a company who doesnt listen to the cries of their victums, you have a perfect recipe for disaster that can only be mitigated with a clean house at FJ. They seriously need to hire a better PR manager and hire some more devs who are a little more knowledgable in arena gameplay, the current ones are only worried about expanding content, not fixing problems. Fix your ♥♥♥♥ FreeJam, in 3 days, youve lost almost 8% of your positive votes on steam, for good reason, it took you 3 years to build up respect and only 3 days to destroy it, I hope this is a lesson that you take seriously because your about to lose your entire playerbase in less than a month if you dont revert or fix some of the crap youve done to the game.","April 29","false","71.8"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","50","56","0","1"

I am going to address some unfair attacks at this game.\n\nThe BIG thing about these negative steam reviews is that anybody can write them thus many Loser players with idiot tank designs come here to take out their anger on the game’s store page.  This is partly thanks to the chat window in the games main lobby where countless 9 year-olds tell the whole server why they lost because SMG’s are cheap and not because they rushed in alone with their no-armor hovercraft in between 5 enemy tanks.  When other normal players lose to an SMG tank they see the chat and believe the exaggerated comments and join them, then they start venting their anger too. The other slightly more fair reviews I’ve seen are from the old-time players who say the game devs ruined the game. I’m a little newer at this than them and I’ve played almost 40 hours of gameplay in these "dark times," made it to T5 and had fun all the way, and there’s no signs of the fun stopping any time soon. The people who are having fun (and there’s a lot of us) don’t bother to write reviews, just the people who want to vent their anger do.\n\nThe first thing people say is that this game is pay2win but that just isn’t true. First of all, paying users and free users get all the same parts to work with and second, in this game your robot has a stat for ranking. When you add a part to your robot it raises the rank stat and if you reach a certain point it will go up in tier. There are 10 tiers of robots and you just about always get put against robots in your tier so paying 2-win is impossible. The only thing paying does for you is give you faster progression through the tiers. Some people say its pay to progress but I’m on top of T5 and I haven’t had that problem yet although I think during a certain update it was bad but they have already fixed that by now. Progression isn’t super important anyway because by T5 every TYPE of part is unlocked, just not the bigger stronger versions (which are in there own tier). Unlike World of tanks and other F2Ps you can still make cool stuff at lower tiers and there’s none of that “premium ammo” crud that I hate.\n\nNow for the second big thing to talk about, op (over powered) weapons and parts. Every type of weapon gets called “op” 90 times in the same day because of that venting 9 year-old thing I told you about before. One big thing to keep in mind is that this game is in alpha so balance is subject to change. I hate when people say “plasma has ruined this game forever” because even if plasma was cheap the devs would rebalance it ASAP. There are only 3 different types of weapons in the game (for now) and they all have their intended functions. I’m not saying the game has always had perfect balance (and it still doesn’t) but it’s still a lot of fun to play. The last thing about balance is that a lot of players are new to this game and don’t know what they can do. An example would be that hovercrafts can dodge plasma shells vertically but I don’t see many players do this. Those players could go on to say that plasma is cheap or that hovercrafts are underpowered but the real problem is that the players don’t try new tactics.\n\nPeople whine a little about other things like lag, warping and glitches but I have never had those problems, those things are just more problems that people unfairly vent out during their rants.\n\nOverall I just wanted to tell you that this is a really fun game that can make you think and adapt, and also that the devs aren’t evil (I think), they gave us free stuff as makeup for a server crash they had. If the game gets big and devs finish this right then this could be a really great and solid game.

It was a simple game with hidden complex gameplay mechanics. When you started, you build a robot with a gun and played some games. That said, building is quite simple and intuitive. You don't have to be an engineer to build a working robot. But the more you played, the more you understood the little weaknesses of your robot. Also you had to improve your skill with the available weapon. Especially your aiming and prediction was very important (like in other Shooters ofc). What made this game also great is how Freejam handled the pricing of products. A monthly premium membership, which doubled your loot after a battle (currency to buy new robot parts) only cost 5$ per month, which is very fair compared to other games, who charge 10$+ for monthly membership. And even without premium you could easily get all the parts you wanted.\n\nBut since the new updates, this all changed... sadly\n\n1. Monthly Premium costs now 10$ for a month. They also introduced loot boxes. If you get a loot box after a game, you get a row with 4 different items (random). And with premium you get a second row with another 4 items. Probablemtic about this is, that you also see the 4 premium items even if you dont have premium. It's a common tactic from mobile games to show the players what they COULD have gotten if they had premium. I dont like these fishing tactics and I'm sad that this is introduced in Robocraft that way...\n\n2. They removed most of the depth from the game. You can now literally built any crap and it's working. They did this to make Art bots possible (example: A robot that looks like a house)\n\n3. They introduced a MOBA-like gamemode. It's quite easy to observe they Freejam tries to implement every trend possible.\n\n4. All new weapons require no skill. In the past, there were railgun (sniper), SMG (automatic weapon) and plasma launcher (grenade launcher). You needed aiming for all these weapon. The new weapons are flak cannon (impossible to dodge as flying unit), rocket launcher with aiming assist (rockets follow players when locked in) and a rapid firing gun with following bullets.\n\nThe game becomes more and more casual combined with high prices for premium membership and fishing tactics. I can't support a game like this and it makes me sad that I have to write a negative review after all those hours of playtime...","May 1","false","510.8"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","46","51","0","2"

I started off in the laser-fest that was tier one, and slowly began making my way up the challenging but very fun slope of technology. School starts, and I make two new friends (which are still great friends today) because we all had one thing in common: Robocraft. I got a lot of my other PC gamer friends to join us and we had a blast. The developers were releasing updates fairly frequently, and added my most favorite weapon, the Nanotech Disruptors. The majority of my friends an I were in tier 4-5, and I couldn't wait to get them, since I love playing support. I literally couldn't wait, so I payed $10 to get them and some extra in game money as well. The game kept getting better, and everyone was having a great time. I was in tier 7 right as they added spider legs.\n\nAt this point, the game was at its peak.\nNot necessarily the peak as in the most enjoyable time, but as in right when it started to go downhill. The updates got more obscure as the game went on, adding in tank treads and other cool new weapons and addons, rebalances etc. However, there was one update that completely crippled this game. What seemed a cool new concept and great way to have fun in the game turned into a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ of people spamming caps in the chat because we weren't defending top lane or that someone kept getting spawnkilled. This was the update that added the new gamemode with the huge mechanical mushroom looking things with gems or whatever the ore was called at the top. I heard about it and was actually decently excited, the game needed a new gamemode. I played about 40 of these matches, and figured out that it was no where near as fun as the risk vs reward of the classic gamemode. Of course, you could sitll play classic, but with this new shiny gamemode about 4 people in each tier were actually playing classic. We (being my friends and I) decided to take a bit of a hiatus from the game, to see how it was doing later in development.\n\nFast forward half a year or so, I meet a streamer from the Netherlands and a friend at school who have both played recently. The tech tree is essentially gone, all progress has disappeared (including my ten dollars mind you) and they add ♥♥♥♥ing round blocks, to a square based building system. The community gets more toxic, the demographic has completely changed, and was once a life changing game has transformed itself into a monstrous cardboard box of ♥♥♥♥ on my doorstep.\n\nIn its earlier stages, I would have reccomended this game. Now? Well, lets just say I'd rather play Bad Ratz for 4 hours straight than play this deformed atrocity for an hour. I'm sad that it had to end this way, and wish it would magically revert to its old state.

I have played alot of mmo's and they all suffer from the same thing.....Best Builds. A build or a set of builds that can beat all others in pvp and pve.\n\nRobocraft does not have this. Some builds are better then others in one thing and crappy in another. It is very much up to the player to decide how they want to play and while you can grab a tutorial or buy a bot (the pay to get bots are usually really crappy and serve mostly as a fun cosmetic thing rather than a viable build to play) there is trillions of ways to build a bot. I am almost in tier 10 myself and i have seen planes with wheels or cruisers that can hover. Tanks with legs and so much more.\n\nWhile there aren't many play modes each battle is different. One battle you will get utterly crushed and the next the timer click to 0 because you were too evenly matched and got a long battle. The variations in bots and tactics make it very fun. The devs are polite kind and helpful. Ususally offering a day of free premium every once in awhile. If the servers crash they work tirelessly to get them back up. They care about the players and seem pretty determined to avoid a pay 2 win model.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, go in there and play fr yourself.......be warned though you will probably get addicted to it.","February 17, 2015","true","369.4"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","55","67","12","6"

Now it is terrible. The developers do not look at the community at all. They released a game in alpha (and while yes it is alpha) the game shown at first has changed dramatically for the worse and has gone in a completely different direction than what any old player does remember. It may seem the same but Robocraft no longer is. They are making a game that THEY want with no community input which is largely the reason why it is going downhill. The point of early access is like getting free help with the game but they do not take thaat help.\n\nAfter playing this game 240+ hours i have determined that the game developers punish people who play the game alot. Every update only takes away from the game for the long standing players and give more to new comers. Thi slast update, "Epic Loot" is not epic at all. What would have taken 12 30 min games to get 1 item that you want before update will now take 52-65 30 min games just to get the same item. The grind is terrible and based on my example of time, you will spend 4-5 times longer to get anywhere now.\n\nAny amount of money spent in this game is now worthless. The economy is down the drain and the time value worth of YOUR REAL LIFE (or even anohter game) is more valueable than in this game will ever be.\n\nThe things that were added that made the game terrible: Loot crates, Nanos dealing no damage, the deletion of the Tech Point Tree, deletion of the Pilot Seat, the new MOBA base race gametype, the 10 sec auto heal, etc.\n\nNever play this game starting from 4/28/16. I highly suggest that you pick up "Gear up" or even "Mech Warriors" than this game now.\n\nGame WAS good, developers are terrible. Please never vote up for this game. Show the developers their mistake.\n\nEdit: Because of the new random loot system, the freedom to build what you want as long as you have money is now limited to what you receive by random chance. It is possible to get more corner blocks than normal building blocks which forces horrible "creativity". You will never be able to build what you want when starting out unless you go with the grind that has now been increased drastically.","April 28","false","245.7"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","40","44","0","0"

A few weeks ago the problem of cheaters became the top priority. It was hardly a match without one. Reporting them didn't change much, there were detailed instructions on the net allowing any elementary kid to cheat.\nAt first dev's implemented server-side protection, which caused lots of issues when players could not actually play. Insted of working on the fixes, they do what? They implement a very doubtful 'solution' called EAC, causing even more players to not able to play.\n\nFor me it says "EAC is not able to run in windows Test mode"\nI have Win x64 and have some modded audio drivers and some unsigned drivers for a legacy WiFi chip allowing it to run as virtaul AP. Disabling the test mode is currently not an option for me. Never ever I had a problem with this from, say, VAC or any other anti-cheat engine.\n\nSo what? I go to their forum and find out that not only they are aware of the problem, they doesn't plan on fixing it at all! Their argument is: "There are not that many people who need this, ok, we might block some legit players, but it's not a problem. They better buy themselves some new hardware. Or new version of windows. Or something. We don't care".\nThis somehow resembles an approach of executing innocent people along with the criminals without proper investigation - what's the problem? They won't be able to complain anyways. It's that kind of logic.\n\nCreate a VM or another boot record allowing you play this game you say? I might do that one day, because I like the game itself. I might even try to spoof EAC check for test mode. But a whole situation when a legit player have to hack anticheat to actually play _without_ cheats is wrong on soooo many levels.\n\nNot only that, reading ito this EAC reveals it's invasive and pivacy violating nature.\nRead the ToS.\nThe notorious "False Positive" alert from some of the AV vendors is not that much false as you can think. The EAC posess keylogging functionality and according to ToS you allow them to gather unspecified private data form you. Great, what's next? Charge my bank accounts directly for false cheating accusations?\n\nUnfortunatelly, early access games combined with Free-to-play game model have one major drawback. There is no way a player can influence the changes devs make or have their money back EVEN if the game becomes broken beyond repair.\n\nI really regret I have to put a negative mark for this game, but I find it the only way to let devs know I don't approve of their way of dealing with loyal player base. Sincirely hope the Dev's drop this horrible EAC stuff ASAP and forget it like a nightmare.\n\nPS: Tech support finally sent me a reply (after 5 days) saying something like "We're working to fix this." Hope this is something more than a canned response.\n\nPPS: Ended up with the dual boot to play. Never added any eclusions for my AV on this and would never do.","November 20, 2014","false","729.9"," 227 of 344 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","227","344","3","14"

I would fight other bots that resembled bad ♥♥♥ futuristic tanks, air and ground walkers, and bots that ressembled creations out of movies like star wars or halo\n\nthere was balance in chasis cubes.  And i dont mean just the cubes i also mean armor.  You would see decent builds with a little bit of armor for protection and overall have a balanced fight in a match\n\nHowever ive started to play again for a few matches and i was upest to find some of the keythings that made this game fun...are while not gone, slowly being used less than they originally were\n\nI see more armored turtles with guns poking out in a match then i see a decently built, creative, cool looking battle machine these days and i think that is mostly because armor has gotten far too important in building a robot\n\nNothing seems to be balanced anymore in terms of creativity and building balance of cubes and its really upsetting because this was and still can be a really fun game to play and i dont want to see it go down the tubes just because the development teams dont do anything to bring the creativity back.\n\nThat stuff on the new cover for the game is never seen in a real match.  Because if it were it would be incinerated by hovering builds covered head to toe in armor.\n\nThe creativity to make robots is still very much in the game but the matchs themselves make it impossible to win with these creative bots because they get destroyed by these other robots that are covered in parts so high in defense that they shread you to pieces before you can do some damage.\n\nSo if the development team(s) ever read this then please do something about balancing out these parts so that it is not impossible to win a game creativly.\n\nAnd to the people reading this review i say to give robocraft a try, its not a bad game it just can be frustrating at times.  But if you find you' re always getting frustrated and always getting destroyed in matches, then i would reccomend to just  play something else and stay updated on robocraft to see if the dev's fix these problems that have been occuring.\nAnd if you dont feel like waiting then im sorry robocraft has disappointed you\n\nthese are just my opinions on the game so please dont harass or synically bash me over the head through the internet because im trying to helpful while still positive for a game i really want to pull through.","August 19, 2015","true","222.8"," 66 of 86 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","66","86","9","3"

Not that it was ever that good.\n\n\n1. They removed the Tier System, the best aspect of the game. They also removed pilot seats so people could make ridiculously unrealistic robot designs with no strategic placing whatsover. The game now places you against superior oppenents with ridiculously overpowered robot designs.\n\n2. Matchmaking is terrible. Wait times are generally over two and a half minutes, and you will get placed with the same people that you played with before (even if there are >4000 people online)\n\n3. New mech types are absolutely unrealistic. Walkers can run as fast as a tank with 4 wheels and a thruster on the back of it. One helicopter blade can support an entire robot if it is on the back of it.\n\n4. Microtransactions everywhere. Pay for premium, cosmetics, robot designs, building materials, you name it. The game is a living advertisement of its own microtransactions. The queue window features robot designs that you can buy with premium currency. It even has a little note that states how much the ingame currency amount is equivelant to in USD, so all the little 10 year olds that buy these stupid and uneeded items can tell their mommies exactly how much money they are wasting on this game.\n\nThe only positives about this game is the originality of the concept of the game.

Robocraft is no longer fun to me, and I am sad to say I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore, as it simply is no longer a joy to play and make robots when you cannot even buy the blocks without either playing lots of games to get the right ones, or recycling ridiculous amounts of hardware and blocks at a mere FRACTION of their cost. For example, one gun (the rail penetrator, specifically [which has also been nerfed to the point of near uselessness]) costs 2200 of the "robits" to buy (you CANNOT get robits from a battle outright, you instead have to recycle blocks you get, which gives you a measly amount of robits per battle in total, as I am about to explain), but somehow you only get 144 robits from recycling it, a mere fraction of the original price (exactly  18 / 275ths  of the original cost to buy the gun). This means you must grind a ridiculous amount to get only meagre amounts of robits, and to give an idea of the grind to get a interesting gun, the "best" gun (that is now practically worse than the worst gun) costs a whopping 175000 to buy 1.  (ironically, the Developers stated that this so called "Epic-Loot" update would reduce grinding and make it more enjoyable). Im sad to say I will probably quit; this update took the fun out of what Robocraft used to be. One of the worst parts of this is also the fact the developers do not address any of the complaints about this failure, and instead focus on how many people are getting the game now. I have a feeling those people won't have the game for very long, however, if they ever find out what robocraft once was.

I could have given it a positive review a year ago, before the update. Before it was clear (Tiers). People played with people who are the same Tier as them, and the game was more or less balanced. I mean there was at least some balance. Of course there were some super donors who actually bought good stuff and played with you. Even if they killed you, that was fair enough. You cold just face it. And you could see by their blocks, colours and stuff how good they are and whether to evade them or fight them.\nThe update messed up the game. Now, textures were removed, colours for each Tier block where removed and what? Yo can colour your Mark 10 (Tier 10) blocks white and everybody will attack you. And you just rek them.\nAlso before GC (Galaxy Cash) had a higher value. You could buy a Megabot for like 5 dollars GC or could build a boog T7 for 10 euros. Like super mega Tier 7 or prebuilt magabot. Now, the cheapest crappest robot costs 30 euros, like a Call Of Duty or GTA V game.\nTier system was messed up. Now worst players play with best players. Da hell? Your like T6 and a wild Megabot appears from somewhere and wrecks you, Lol?\nIf you think differently comment.

The Epic Loot update that happened on 04/28/2016 has ruined the game entirely. The previous grind to get enough money to make more  bots, was easily  bearble and fun. This new crate reward system though, kills the fun in  the game.  I'd much rather be rewarded for my skill in a game on a definite  basis that I can predict.\nI for one, cannot stand carrying my team, getting a protonium crate, and getting a bunch of blocks, and shields. Maybe  if FJ tweaked the robit prices of stuff, and possibly fix the loot crate isssue.  I could  consider staying on this game full time again,  and dropping some cash on it.

Maybe my opinion is tainted as i began playing long before all those new ''features'' were added, so let me compare the old robocraft to the new robocraft. But first let me say, this game is not bad, but i can't recommend it to you. It's free, so you might try it out, but there are a Lot better choices to try out if you don't have money and compared to those robocraft is just not worth the efford to download it.\n\nBuilding a robot is certainly as fun as always, probably even more, since new weapons and special abillities were added... playing with it not so much, especially since you barely gain any points to improve your robot any further. I am sorry, but there is no chance i will play for 10 days just to earn enough points for a single weapon. A few months back it was a whole lot easier, thus you could experiment a lot more and have a lot more fun.\n\nInstead now the game feels a lot like labour, instead of a fun game.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on health regen. How often have i shot someone into pieces, jsut for him to crawl behind cover and  get fully repaired within seconds. Why even focus on sniper or medic anymore? Cover is extremely expoitable, not only with the new health regeneration, but also with the new rocket launchers.\n(get behind cover, lock onto target THROUGH A SOLID ROCK, peekaboo and shoot, repeat)\n\nI am not the only one of my friends, others stopped playing, too, as they could not conform with these crappy changes screwing with the progression system and the balancing.","March 4","false","66.0"," 149 of 223 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","149","223","11","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomkl/recommended/301520/","tomkl","TeeKay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomkl/","130 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRobocraft is actually extremely fun . . . sometimes.\nThe idea of the game is great, and there are a lot of fun mechanics.  The developers release updates at faster pace than I've seen in almost any game ever, which is sort of a good thing.\n\nExcept that so many of their updates seem so poorly thought out or untested.  Don't get me wrong, Robocraft is improving as a game over time, but every update is two steps forward, one step back.  Each update will release cool new features, and completely breaks something else.  The next will fix the previous issue, but break another part of the game.\n\nCurrently, the biggest issue is probably the matchmaking.  Your robot can be placed in a match with robots with hugely better parts.  It completely ruins the game to spend hours carefully designing your bot, and months honing your piloting skills, only to have it get wrecked by a box on wheels because the box on wheels has guns that deal twice as much damage.\n\nI regularly get matched with robots that have over 10 times the ranking rating of mine.\n\nMatchmaking is not the only issue either, other issues include:\n-  Lack of voice chat, making communication and strategy with the team nearly impossible.\n-  Some very, very flawed map design.\n-  The medic tools heal faster than most guns can deal damage (unless at short range), which does not make for fun gameplay.\n-  The platoon system (which allows you to play with friends) is glitchy and has been for over a year, which is a long time compared to the very frequent updates this game gets.  It is starting to feel like the developers don't care that trying to play with friends can be a huge pain.\n-  The main game mode, battle arena, has some weird mechanics that make for a very strange and not very interesting meta-game.\n-  Robots take too long to kill, especially in the early game.\n-  Respawn times are too short (<10 seconds) early on in a match, although they do reach more reasonable times after a while.\n-  Players frequently abandon the game.  To be fair, sometime it's not their fault and their game crashed.  This often makes matches uneven (like a 6 v 8).  The game tries to balance this by reducing the smaller team's respawn times, but reduced respawn times don't help the smaller team, they just make it take longer for them to lose.\n\nIf anyone doesn't understand or agree with something I said in this review I can try to explain in more detail.  Some of the issues are hard to explain in simple point form because it's more like a net of complex problems that exacerbate each other.\n\nDespite the long list of issues, Robocraft is very fun when the matchmaking places you in a fair match.  None of the other issues completely ruin a match like the terrible matchmaking can.  This review will remain negative until players are being put into fair fights.\nIf the matchmaking is fixed (and another game-breaking issue isn't introduced) in the next update and I forget to update this review, message me or leave a comment and I will.\n\n\n","February 1","false","636.9"," 116 of 170 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","116","170","10","8"

I mean, i love team deathmatch, but battle arena was the beginners only reliable source of income, what the hell?\n-the game only seeks to make it harder for beginners to progress, forcing them to pay to reach higher levels, and on the oppisite end, making it frustrating for higher tiers\n-Anti-cheat bloody sucks. You'll see glitch exploiters (not really hacking, but still cheating and a clear sign on how buggy this mess is) and hackers everywhere.\n-Also BUGS, lot's of em'.\n\nAnd i used to like this game.

Different types of armor allowing you to put more importance on protecting THE SEAT by surrounding it with better armor in special patterns. But now there's no seat. No tech tree to upgrade how you want. No armor tiers to differentiate between the tough and the high-damage bots, or the higher tier, more expensive bots from those of lower tiers. NO SEAT WHICH WAS THE ENTIRE FOCUS OF HOW YOU BUILT THE BOT. Protecting your bot from damage is no longer top priority when there's no medic. The entire point of the railgun (aiming for the important part, the seat) is screwed. It's just so disappointing, and I don't know how they will be able to reverse this last update, if they ever do.\n\nRIP Robocraft\n\n","January 7","false","163.9"," 132 of 198 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","132","198","3","3"

This game used to be mediocre and now it is awful. It is as if the designers sat down in a meeting room and made a series of incomprehensible decisions on the premise that the game was too good and needed to be destroyed as soon as possible.\n\n1) The hexagonal tech tree is now completely linear. It is a straight line. It offers no choices anymore.\n\n2) The armor system has been flattened and offers no choices anymore. All chassis cubes are identical now. You have no options for strength or weight tradeoff anymore, other than to just layer on more armor.\n\n3) The autorepair mechanic is completely bogus and serves to further defeat careful and balanced robot design\n\n4) The plasma mortars have been horribly nerfed. Why? They were always slow and hard to aim, and now they are weak on top of that.\n\nIt seems as if the latest game mechanics have been selected to dumb down the game and broaden its appeal, but what they have accomplished, instead, is to make it less fun. Then, in addition to that, as if the laser sights on railguns were not already useless enough to the point that your rail shots veer off in seemingly random directions for no discernable reason, the random hitches and pauses in the game further ensure that you will miss continuously until the point of ragequit.

The previous update was almost perfect. Was one of my favorite games, now possibly not worth the time.\n\nThe Good:\n- Possibly one of the best build and fight games out there. Lots of possibilities for robot construction.\n- Great players. Can be very punishing if you are new. But ultimately good to help you learn.\n- You are forced to bring your A-Game. Good bot construction, good strategy, and good teamwork and planning.\n- You have to think on your feet, or you'll be spending most of the time waiting to respawn. Cover, position, speed and stealth mean just as much as skill, bot construction and weapons loadout.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n- All weapon, movement and special blocks now cost more relative to previous releases.\n- Money was removed in exchange for Robits and you accumulate those at a significantly decreased rate.\n- Loot relies heavily on RNG and the loot tables are poor at best. They could be tweaked for better gear to improve rewards, but the way they are now, they're very poor.\n- New players will struggle to build up an arsenal that will have them competative with endgame players. Ultimately I think this will stifle entry of new players.\n- Ranking system and matching system are broken. Players with very low level (low CPU and poor construction) are getting eaten alive in those matches probably resulting in a very bad experience for them.\n- The energy mechanic means you'll be shooting less (probably less load on the servers), but it is a lot less satisfying now than just opening up your entire loadout on an enemy and completely decimating them.\n- Oh yeah, and with the slow Robit accumulation, good luck forging that Power Booster you now need to run most of your builds.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- The "epic loot" you get is anything but. Most of the loot you get, even when you're on a winning streak just maybe a few blocks that you don't need. Once in about maybe 30 games you get a legendary that comes up and even then you need to subscribe to VIP to get that.\n\nUltimately, spending money on the game isn't worth it at all. You have to put up with the random number generator (RNG) to give you gear. After having bought 12 protonium crates (i had a bit of money left in my account), I got 1 useless legendary, 2 useless epics, aabout 10 rares that I already had and a bunch of blocks that are ultimately wortheless. What I'm saying is that with the current loot tables, even the best crates grant mostly useless loot. Using money is now worthless.\n\nGrinding for gear at such a slow rate will ultimately alienate new players and just frustrate long time supporters like myself. It is unfortunate that the game has reached this state, however, it is fixable.\n\n1) Tweak the loot tables so that the higher quality loot boxes really do give loot that's valueable.\n2) Increase the loot table floor so that even losing matches more quickly accumulate robits.\n3) You could lower robit prices.\n4) Make more decoration/customization items that are valueable or useful in order to increase more real/money purchases.\n5) Make visual customizations VIP only or more expensive (many won't agree with me on this, but if you really want to make your bot LOOK kick ♥♥♥, hey shell out a little).\n6) Or you could just revert to the old mechanic of credits and GC.\n\nOverall, it's a better game when you're playing with other bots that are designed well. That means giving people a better way to get equipment that's useful. Make it so if you want a beautiful looking bot, cash is necessary.\n\nHopefully FreeJam will get their act together and either tweak the loot tables, or revert partially to the last update. Still possibly good to play if you have already saved up enough gear to outfit all your bots. But for those of us still building up, it's frustrating.\n\n\n(edited for spelling, and to confirm that buying protonium crates are mostly useless)","April 29","false","609.4"," 28 of 28 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","28","28","2","0"

It was fun and challenging since you had to protect your pilot seat from harm. The leveling up took a long time but it gave me and many others a sense of progress. Now its nothing more then a generic block construction game with guns minus the fun. The Tech tree isnt even a tree anymore. So no more getting to choose what you unlock first. The removal of tiers was ok to some extent but it made match making a bit more confusing in terms of figuring out what MK version of a gun/movement parts to use. Lastly, the removal of the pilot seat was honestly in my opinion the most stupid thing they could've done. It was a mechanic that forced people to think about block placement and encouraged "creativity" but now thats gone. everyone just throws a crap ton of blocks on and calls it a good robo. Oh, for vetern players who spent hours upon hours of playing the game to gather thousands of blocks to build thier megabots. All of that went to waste since FreeJam decided to remove all the blocks and give only a handful of basic blocks back and they made them dirt cheap. Way to go FreeJam, any more low blows like that and people might get the wrong idea when they try calling you over from the street corner.\n\n(( Also, I don't mind people commenting about my review but please keep this in mind.

It is not only about the PvP part but also about the building part, trying to make the best out of your bot. There are 4 different classes of weapons which make it quiet interesting. In the first two tiers it can sometimes be a little frustrating, especially if you don't have a good design but that should only make you wanna build a better one ;)\nFor everybody who like PvP this is a must-try and for everybody who wants to find the engineer inside himself, it is too :)","October 10, 2014","true","129.2"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","43","53","0","2"

Used.\nThe reason I hate this game now is because its too "happy". The game used to be hard, it used to be intense. One shot could screw you over and made you think about the design, its practicality and its firepower, so when the update came with the base-shields and respawns came I wasn't happy but I made do. It still had part of the thrill, but I made the mistake of leaving for a while... and came back to this."only certain ranks can do this" "Share your robots online" "sorry, but we are limiting your CPU" and the tech tree update was the final straw. There was no effort, there was no grind, there was no specilisation. You could spend hours building an indestructible machine, only to find out a 10 year old who just started bought a better one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/giveittomeraw/recommended/301520/","giveittomeraw","Catherine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/giveittomeraw/","50 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStay away from this game, it is not newbie friendly, it is not vet friendly. As a new player you face nothing but seal clubbing, as a vet you face huge sweeping changes that invalidate your thousands of hours. Hell, if you joined this game a month ago and got just a hundred hours in, all that time got invalidated, they practically hit the reset all accounts button.\n\nTo preface this: currently as of writing the devs of this game have added crates that you pay for by the bunch that randomly unlock parts, in these crates you mostly get worthless items such as building blocks, and once in a great great great while do you get anything worthwhile. After opening about 100 crates from matches (You get one per match) I got roughly 1 max tier item, about 3 rare items, and the rest were common items (blocks). You can sell things for about 10% of what you have to build them for, so if you want one gun of a different tier, you have to sell 10 guns of another type (aka 10 max tier smgs = 1 plasma gun), but to get these drops is nearly impossible without thousands of crates, WITH PREIMUM.\n\nIn the previous patch all parts were insanely expensive, so you had to keep a small inventory while making a bunch of frames made out of blocks while swapping around parts which grows tedious. The devs tried to get people to get so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at farming forever for a single gun, they simply spend money on the gun. That didn’t work, and only generated animosity.\n\nThis game is now going down a much darker road of taking advantage of middle aged people, and younger children with access to parental money (the two groups most likely to suffer from gambling additions). That second group has lost a lot of staying power over the years, but the first one has grown much more common and plays this game much more often while gambling constantly. The devs of this game are taking advantage of children and weak willed adults with addictions and children.\n\nThey missed the most critical component to this steam game gambling addition; people gamble because they want to spend money in hopes of getting something back of more value then what they spent, Guess what, the parts in game cannot be solid on the market place (yet). It works in TF2 because real money auction, it works in CS:GO for much the same reason, it works in all valve games because of steam's market place. So people wasting tons of money get nothing but parts in return, so it is 100% money lost.\n\nThe next obvious step for the devs is to add cosmetic skins, or just add straight up weapons to the steam market place so you can buy power instantly. This review is going to call it first, you heard it here first folks they WILL do this.\n\nThe devs of this game routinely ignore their player base no matter how many people say the same thing and desire the same change, no matter how well you word things, no matter how well you write, or even if your suggestion is amazing. They could implement tiny changes with huge results. They ignore the high-impact low-hanging fruit constantly in favor of implementing wild huge game changing updates. Most recently gaming crates mixed with “you get the same chance reward at all levels” and match making worse than it’s ever been: Robots are purely matched by how many points they cost. Guess what that translates into, vets of the game making extremely efficient, extremely small low-cost robots to get placed into matches with new players that barely understand how the game works.","April 30","false","17.4"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

Literally, one of the worst as of current. It was great, when it released. It was fun, fair, and was easy enough to progress through the game. And it got better, and better, more ways to move, more weapons, more balancing. Then, things went south. And hard. There was a once upon a time where you literally couldn't fight your vehicle, unless every single block and weapon was of the exact same tier. This made artistic bots, or just bots people were slowly upgrading impossible to play. Then they removed it, so, good, right? Not really. Skip a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you come to today. Where all blocks are the exact same, and after the update, if you had thousands of high-level blocks, that, from where I stopped, at tier 7, cost around 50k per block, and that's not even tier 10 or mega blocks, you get NO compensation for it. You got your blocks, but guess what? There are all the exact same and you get nothing for the amount of time and money you spent on them. Garage slots are now free, and you got your premium currency back, but it's not enough. They added a paint gun, which is cool, right? Paint all your vehicles nicely. Uh, no. You get 4 colors and need premium for 12 more colors. You get white, blue, orange, and grey. Not a lot. So to sum it up. Even for free, don't download. Get minecraft and get mods.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blood-And-Steel/recommended/301520/","Blood-And-Steel","Entropy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blood-And-Steel/","210 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter clocking up 135 hours and greatly enjoying it, my opinion has swayed over the past few months. Changes which break builds, tactics and so on and force you to learn, I expect but not to the extent and frequency to which updates have been released, infact, I enjoy it! The need to learn and develop new skills and builds is good, previous exploits fixed, broken builds, tactics, bugs and so on, fixed and balanced.\n\nNow however, the motivation to go back has completely dwindled now as each update for a good while has reaped the same problems over and over. No longer do I hear about good matches, interesting builds or tactics but rather cheap builds which really shouldn't work at all like rectangles covered in boosters. I understand the game is early access and aspects of it can change drastically but over the past few months updates have been changing the game over and over in such a drastic and reckless manner and too frequently. It seems if people complain enough about how "Snipers are OP" and how they get slaughtered when an SMG gets close then an update will mess up the statistics of those builds, raising the power of other builds too much and just recycling issues instead of finding and maintaining a balance.\n\nThis game was fun, particularly when playing with a few people you knew, you could co-ordinate and compliment each others builds or make something special. Now, all that seems lost, I don't want to learn what works now since it just isn't enjoyable anymore and if I learned again, how long would it be before that knowledge is scrapped again?\n\nPerhaps new players will have fun playing the game and learning and having fun in its current state, but if they keep changing it, I fear the cycle will repeat with longtime players and groups quiting and eventually this game may die out. There's still time to save it but I feel too many players have given up that it may never recover if large, calculated steps are taken to improve the game and content an to welcome veterans once again.\n\nWhat I can still say for this game is its free to play model is excellent (Atleast the last time I played 25/07/15) there's no P2W, any part for your bot which costs real money is identical in stats to their regular counterpart or are purely cosmetic like a flag. There's a premium option which I believe awarded double RP and allowed for platoons of 3 or 4 players. Extra garage slots could be purchased for a reasonable price but you still had a handful if you didn't want to invest and premium bots were available which really just let you skip ahead in the tech tree and sometimes provided unique cosmetics. I never felt pushed or like I needed to spend money, I spent it because I enjoyed the game.\n\nPerhaps in the future I may try this game once again but I don't have high hopes. If you play it then be aware of the issues some of us have pointed out in our reviews and be prepared to re-learn if you play long enough but for now, this game will gather dust in my library until I decide something better could use the room it currently lingers in.","September 16, 2015","false","137.8"," 101 of 152 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","101","152","6","0"

It was an excellent and creative game that allowed you to test your best designs against that of other players to see who is the victor and flecks of robot fly about the map!\n\nSadly however the new"update" to the game has killed off any love I had for it...\n\nThe new main gamemode (classic is still and option but for severly reduced credits) has players shooting at cap points in an attempt to destroy the enemies main hub, Not so bad eh? Well here lies the problem, there is now respawning as opposed to the one and done mechanic previously. This has led to a lot of players taking the paths of least resistance as there is no fear of death, no more is there marvellous creations and ingenious designs to maximise longevity on the battlefield. Now the current 'Best plan' appears to make spazzy flyers covered in electroplates and smgs, if you die so what? you can just respawn and annoy people all over again.\n\nThis respawn feature also removes any hope of a quick game of robocraft as games now last up to half an hours on average (kinda like a MOBA huh?)\n\nAlso like a MOBA is the idea of 'Overclocks', these are basically levels that a players gains for killing, capping ect and this is probably the main thing that upsets me about the current game. People snowball and they snowball hard, you can quite happily just sit on a hill and snipe your way to victory, so what if people attempt to confront you? Your higher level basically negates their hard thought design and you can just happily tank their low damage attacks until your rail is recharged...\n\nSo in summary, the game as is stand is a mere husk of a previously awesome game. And if the developers where to return to such a game I would be all ears, however as it stands I cannot endorse this game. It's trying to be something that nobody wants it to be :(","May 29, 2015","false","102.0"," 89 of 132 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","89","132","7","10"

The subsequent updates became more about revenue generation than a game that was balanced and fun the last update the loot update was the last in a series of disapointments, as the name says the loot update made victory or defeat rewarded with random pieces for your robot...before this they could be perchased either with player perchased in game money or with coin earned while playing ...however the new update makes it nearly imposible for new players to advance the ranks and turns the beginning matchmaking into a killing field whereapon a later tier player can make a small bot with a powerful gun and unleash carnage upon newer players.(I should know i average 3 kills a match but in this fashion scored an average of 25) I still recommend folks play this game even in its current state I believe has the promise that made me enjoy it from it's start, but as for me it's no longer something I am willing to invest my limited time or money in..no for me it's on to playing Factorio a mod supported minrcraft esk overhead industrial builder that also shows great promise.","April 30","false","170.6"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","0"

Recently, I started playing it again and it was awesome. I enjoyed it a lot and it was one of my favourite games. Unfortunatly, a recent update (epic loot) completly destroyed my enjoyment for the game. First of all, they reset the GC which means all of the real money you spent on it, you don't get back AND you don't get refunds. So if you spent over £100 on this game, that's completely gone. Also, they removed RP and replaced it with this dust thingy which you don't get from finishing games, but ONLY from selling cubes.\n\nEDIT:\nAlthough I have only mentioned negative points above, there is one good thing: crates.

Sounds fun, right? But the latest loot update ruined everything by changing the "build, drive, fight" formula into "p(l)ay, gamble, grind".\n\nFirst, the random drop system may work in other games, but it is not well suited for Robocraft. No longer you can buy the parts you want and build what you want. You are now at the mercy of random drops, which is anti-creative.\n\nBut most importantly, the amount of grind and / or money required to get the top stuff is now insane. If you are a new player, the loot system may look OK at first, but do not be fooled. Let's do some calculations. Probability of a legendary drop per 8-slot protonium crate is about 1/35. To get most of the high level items from crate drops only, you'd need about 2000 protonium crates. That means either paying 700$ for the crates or winning 4000 matches and finishing 1st in every single one of them if you don't want to spend anything. Assuming you win rate is 50% and you finish 1st 50% of the time, that'd take you about 4000 hours! These numbers are somewhat inflated because you can recycle items. But the recycle rates are abysmal, so the calculations do reflect the magnitude of grind that the update has introduced.\n\nThe worst part: despite a massive outcry from the community, the developers act as if nothing happened, calling the update "a success".","May 18","false","492.0"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

They also remove the ability to fire all of one type of gun, causeing you to spam the numberkeys to fire like a freaking moba.

All the weapons cost around 200,000RP, one 30 minute match gets you around 90,000 if you lose, most of the time causing you to grind for hours upon hours to get a good "bot"\n\nIt wasnt always this way, the game used to be super fair, fun, and the people on it didnt steal each others work. **sorry rosefall, but i see your bots WAY too much**. The megabots update was incredible, it added a new challenge, a way to get massive amounts of money, and once you got there it was a last. After seeing how happy people were, the demons at freejam then decided to remove them as it was making TDM "unbalanced". Now all you see is missile carriers with lock on craps, and practicly invinsible bots that only focus on shielding and spamming the new uzi gun.

Too many things that made the game awesome have been removed,  and too many things that absolutely suck have been added. It's just not worth playing anymore. Here are some reasons to stay away:\n\n- Say goodbye to originality as you'll often see many of the same overpowered designs in battles due to the Community Robot Factory. Your original designs that aren't based on exploits won't stand a chance.\n- The map variety sucks. Different colours basically. No water-only maps. No air-only maps. No cave maps. Nothing interesting at all. No destructible terrain, no interactivity. Just impenetrable generic hills and walls. For every map.\n- Game modes are too same-y. Drive around and shoot. No race mode. No football/other sports mode. Nothing interesting. Same thing over and over. The developers have no imagination or creativity.\n- Player base sucks. Too many casuals who copy each other's designs. Too many Japanese cartoon bots. Too many exploiters. Chat is always filled with nonsense.\n- Graphics are terrible and unoptimised, not to mention boring.\n- Developers don't seem to test or even think new features are actually any good before adding them to the game.\n- Sound is very basic and unimpressive. Boring.\n- Barely any social options(which I don't mind, personally).\n\nWell damn I'm sure others can elaborate on what's wrong with the game but I just can't be bothered anymore. As of this review, reviews in the last 30 days are 39% positive. They speak for themselves. Stay far away and don't even bother unless the developers get their ♥♥♥♥ together for once.

There was a grind but getting to max teir was awsome, pushing your bot to the limit just enough to get into the next teir was an achievment. There was something to fight for.\n\nNow this mess is comparable to mobile games, every aspect of the game is random, skill means nothing, building even less so.

Everything is predictable,\n\nI do not recommend even watching this trash, this 'game' is a shining example of what happens when developers ignore thier following.

And it could be a good game again.  But, the developers inexplicably put a limit on bots going into the best game modes.  Instead of tiers, they added a "we'll rank your robot and you'll get into battles faster."  It didn't really do a lot to help the queue times, but it was okay.  Then they said, "Ahh, we can make this faster if nobody can play."  So they require a rank in excess of 30 MILLION to get into the good game mode.  As a level 93 player (out of 100), my bot comes in at a hefty.... 3 million.  My friend I play this with most often is max level.  His bots?  3-4 million.  Just for fun, he sold all of his bots, bought the highest level stuff he could, and still doesn't make it into the 30 million range.\n\nSo, what's the solution?  I suspect the answer is that Robo wants to be a "Free to play (1 game mode), but pay to play the good ones."  They want to be in the free world and still get money by making you buy bots high enough to play.  This game is now dead to me.  Unless they remove the limits, I see no reason to ever go back.\n\nTL;DR:  Don't waste your time.  The game used to be good, but the devs do wildly unpredictable and nonsensical things that can completely ruin the game without warning.","October 16, 2015","false","150.7"," 70 of 105 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","70","105","6","0"

I think it’s probably overloaded because of the popularity.\n\nFor an alpha the presentation is pretty good. Main menu area looks good. Sounds alright and has decent menu music.\n\nYou pilot pre-made or modified robot vehicles. Or build them from scratch piece by piece. You have a selection of different types of chassis blocks i.e. heavy armour or light, propulsion e.g. (hover or wheels, rear wheel drive or front wheel drive etc.), weapons and so on. You make your robot in any shape or configuration you want. You can make a heavy tank, a gunship with long range or short range weapons. Online matches appear to be a team deathmatch.\n\nThe typical players robot isn't very pretty but I think this game has a lot of potential for some really cool designs. And because of the apparently huge amount of customisation a large amount of variety to gameplay.\n\nIn the short time that I played I basically thought the game was awesome from the start.

In the beginning, it had one of the best matchmaking systems I have ever seen, taking into account the power of the robot instead of a rank like many other games. Robocraft was unique in being able to do this,  due to their building mechanic. Since then, they have revamped the matchmaking into a slaughterhouse, added incredibly overpowered endgame weapons for one team and base weapons for the other, and have turned the game into a near complete pay/grind to win system. I loved this game and it's combat and building used to be unbeatable, but every match is now a roll of the dice between whether or not you are on the team with the smurfs. The latest update has been the worst by far, turning paid for items and worked for items into  a fraction of their original worth and forced the pay to win feature even father down it's users throats. I hope the developers work to return Robocraft to it's original glory. Until then this is me, leaving a negative review, on a game that I have almost 200 hours in.","April 28","false","189.6"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

This article, which I had hoped would be used as an opportunity for the devs to adress the major concerns myself and a large portion of this community have with the most recent major update to Robocraft, instead comes off as an attempt to move the community forward and distract players from the flaws with the current game. Admitidly it does adress the problems players have been having with matchmaking, but it doesn't offer many if any concrete solutions to the very specific problems which many have been pointing out in the weeks since the Epic Loot update, especially with regards to the in game economy and progression system.

This game is fun for a while when you first begin, the fun of designing your own robot and sending it to battle is enough for a while but then once you get to around level 50 you realise that there is actually no progression apart from CPU limit. The drops are completely random so you can be level 10 and pick up a 'Rail Erazer' from a purple chest when you come in first place, which is what happened to me. I then dominated every game for another 10-15 levels because my weapon was so much stronger than what anyone had for a while.\n\nThe RNG element needs to be toned down, especially since only the person in first place of the winning team will get a purple chest which offers the only semi-worthwhile loot. Its like a feedback loot, the people who keep coming first place will get the best loot and then they will keep winning and having a higher chance of getting the better loot.

It should be changed, cause with the new loot system, you have no freedom of building anymore, thus limiting creativity. People are heavily encouraged to buy a bot on the shop, discouraging creativity even more.\n\nLastly, the most recent weapon rebalance has left the gameplay incredibly stale, which is the reason I finally decided to stop playing this game. If they would have bothered to fix at least some of the issues the game has at its core, like matchmaking in the ranked matches, I could have looked past a lot of all of the above, but alas, making shiny crates seems more important that fixing the real issues here, which sums up pretty much all the issues this game has and it doesnt seem like that will change anytime soon.","May 17","false","604.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

Tier-flattening has major balance issues, SMGs are next to useless, the RNG crate system needs major reworking/rebalancing, and the new matchmaking based on CPU and "player skill"(lol) is a complete joke in its current form.  Overall the latest patch, "Epic Loot", has killed any incentive I have for playing the game.\n\nFreeJam will quote higher player retention stats etc. however this could have been done by giving players QoL changes that we have been asking for, for a very very long time, along with player tutorials, new maps, new game-modes, clans, better match-making, custom games/lobbies, better platoon system etc...  All of which the playerbase has been asking for for over a year.  Instead of improving the game they had, FJ decided to rip up everything but the foundation and rebuild their "vision".  Unfortunately this vision includes alienating the entire current player-base (aka. the people who have kept your little studio afloat these three years) for a quick "grab cash from the new players and give them a carrot on a stick to keep grinding" system.\n\nOverall this game is doing a HUGE transition from point A to point B and personally I cant endorse the changes.  I understand that the game is technically "early access alpha"(lol, again) and FJ has every right to make major changes.  However this entire process has been at the dis-advantage to the playerbase and there has been massive collateral damage at every turn.  More communication from the developers would have been great but I guess there is no easy way to say, "We know you guys are our loyal player-base keeping this game alive for three years, but we have decided to forsake you and not deliver on anything you have suggested, Instead we are focusing our time and energy on an enire new group of players who will stick around becuase they have no idea how great this game once was."","May 17","false","712.2"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

Let me rephrase that. This game WAS a great game, wonder why, i'll tell you why.\n\nFirst off, being honest, i used to absoluteley love playing this game even before it was on steam, the matches were fun, balanced, friendly and all out great, even though the 'robot' building was a bit tough, I liked it, as it gave me challenge to buid something cool but allow me to learn from what works and what doesn't, but then, it was introduced to steam.\n\nFirst up, what i though when i saw it first arrive on steam i was like "Oh, awesome it's on steam now, now i can play with my friends.." It was good for quite a while, but then they started updating alot more, at first it was pretty good with the addition of armoured blocks and electroplates amongst other things, but, then the later updates happened, they are what annoyed me.\n\nFrom what i saw with those later updates were, new blocks and some new game mechanics and matchmaking, some were alright but others were absoluteley horrible ideas to even get to the development without asking the community what they wanted, as if it's FreeJam's way of saying "We don't give a damn about what the community wants added, we just want more money" And this kind of behavior really annoyed me, as for one thing they changed, they removed the armoured blocks, for what, ♥♥♥♥ing colours that you need premium for more than 4 types, or was it the fact they wanted to attempt to 'balance' the entire battle challenge of the game. They also removed the pilot seat, like, that's what defined the shape of your robot and how you designed it, as they likely would've though it being to easy to be killed, they removed it.\n\nNot only did they add new mechanics that heavily unbalanced the battles by having a 10sec no-hit repair time delay that allows anyone to fully repair their bot if they stay untouched for 10 seconds, but they changed the entire 'Tech-Tree' so many ♥♥♥♥ing times, it can't even be called a tech tree anymore it's more of a damn 'Tech-Spiral' now while it used to be you had to earn points to select what you wanted to unlock instead of leveling up to get each item consecutively like they've done now, and the fact that they've set it with each conescutive item tier, the price is drastically increased, so most people will get premium to spend real money for ir, I understand that, they need money to keep it being developed but honestly +500% in-game credit price increase for one tier higher in which, most people can't be bothered mustering enough in-game credits to buy alot of those as that's what most people do.\n\nWorst part is, with the addition of the 'Robot Factory' which is just a market where people can sell people thier robots so new players that get what they want will just purchase a high tier bot and use that, which makes the game's already unbalanced rank matching, even worse.\n\nTo end this review rant, if i made a review of this game before it was on steam and i would say that you should get and you should play it but i'm not, instead i'm saying that you should not play it if you are unable to spend real money for this game as it basically a money making machine for the company.\n\nAnd here's a message for the Devs and FreeJam, chnage what you have done to this game, listen to the community, don't just look at a few people saying that they don't like something or they would rather something, listen to the people that actually care, that actually want this game to be fun and something that they can play and actually enjoy playing it,\ninstead of being annoyed by the tryhards with bought robots.","February 5","false","42.5"," 87 of 135 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","87","135","3","12"

All of the fun in the game was building good bots with enough wiggle room to make amazingly efficient bots in one tier, and that was in my opinion, the best part of the game.

Now you ether drop a bunch of money on crates or you grind for maybe a week to get the 1 part you want. Also you can sell almost your entire inventory and still not have enough robits to buy the one gun you want, only to have someone open a rust tier crate and get said gun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aefax/recommended/301520/","aefax","adolf sandler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aefax/","53 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me start off by saying this: the game isn't bad.\n\nThis game is certainly a lot of fun. If you're just searching for a game in which to screw around with friends, this is a game you won't regret giving a try. I personally have had some good times with this game, especially in a rather small amount of time.\n\nHowever, if one is to don the identity of a critic, there's a lot of interesting points to bring up, both good and bad.\n\nAs if we're in a cheesy 1970's action movie, we'll start off with the bad, and then work our way to the good.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n1.\nThis game has some of the weirdest (and no, I don't mean wacky/enjoyable) physics I have had the ultimate displeasure to lay my precious eyes on. Seriously.\nIn the FIRST game I joined (with, admittedly, a precariously built little WALL-E that obviously couldn't tell which of its sides was which) , I found myself flipped in the first thirty seconds. Helplessly, I tried comming in the chat for one of the other new WALL-E clones to try and flip me over. Thankfully, they obliged to give it their all, which in the end meant nothing because robot collisions are barely even a thing in this game. You can ram into a tiny little 3-block retardcycle at full speed, attempting to move him a centimeter, and he won't budge at all. However, as he does not budge, you go flying at the speed of a middle-aged mother attempting to buy the next installment of mommy porn.\nAnd of course, you flip over at the smaleST GODADCNM THIBGN FCKUK EVRFY ♥♥♥♥IN TMEIE I DRIVE ROTBOT IT FLIP VOER YWUFVU VDD WEFIDFH.\n\nSecond on the list of the bad:\n\nBalance is nonexistent. If you disagree, I challenge you to go find a railgun-user who doesn't at least admit that the railgun is incredibly overpowered. Plasma cannons are pretty close after the railguns as well, completely outclassing SMGs in the first 4-5 tiers of the game, especially after a certain update that shall go unnamed until later on.\nRecently, the developers have made efforts to change this incredible gap in the risk-reward/skill-payoff differences between the weapons. It still hasn't been enough, it seems. I've taken a pretty big break from the game now, and I don't expect to be picking it up much sooner if the balance in SMGS/Rails/Plasmas doesn't drastically, and I mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRASTICALLY change.\n\n"oh but afx ur just urmad cuz ur gt rekt (xd) by ppl whu r butter than uuu!!!11"\n\nUn-equip the railguns/plasma cannons, give yourself the equivalent of a new player's robot, and then survive more than 2 rails in a tier one game.\n\nThird on the list:\n\nOmfg. July 31st/August 1st, 2014. The days that made me want to kill people IRL. Before this update, railguns, plasma cannons, all the tools needed to customize an early robot, EVERYTHING was available to the new player after a couple matches and a few clicks in the Tech Tree.  While weapons were certainly overpowered, EVERYBODY could be overpowered with each other. However, the developers decided to cut that circlejerk in half. They removed the ability to acquire railguns, plasma cannons, aerofoils, and thrusters (as well as other things, I believe) before Tier 4~ish. This basically just ♥♥♥♥ed new players. It ♥♥♥♥ed 'em. Straight up gave them the hard Ron Jeremy, right in the ♥♥♥. Anybody who played after/on August 1st could not unlock the same things other players had unlocked before. Anyone who had had the luck to install the game and get involved in it early on became a god. It was like WALL-E vs. Mega-♥♥♥♥ing-tron for days on end, as the new players, including myself, struggled to put a dent in the mechanical messiahs that were the more experienced players.\nWhen I had seen the capability to build a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ airplane robot thingie, I was so excited. Sure, it could offer quite a challenge to make a design work as I intended it to, but I was hella ready to get on that ♥♥♥♥. Now, after the update, I couldn't do that. No Starscream for me. Just normal old R2D2 with a water pistol against Mecha-Hitler with sniper rifle bazookas.\n\nFourth, and more of a nit-pick:\n\nFinding a game can be buggy. Dunno. Kinda dumb.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nThe possibilities are kind of amazing. When I played with a friend, the very first thing I saw him in was a stick-figure on a platform with wheels. After seeing a bunch of power-ranger wannabe robots, this was pretty refreshing, ridiculous, and hilarious. Even disregarding the not-so-practical possibilities a robot design can have, there's a ton of room for creativity and imagination. If the interface for building were more streamlined, I daresay building the robots could take more of my time in the game than shooting other robots. This is one of the best things the game has working for it. The amount of things one needs to take into consideration while building a robot that can take and give damage is astounding. There's no real metagame of robot, no OMG MEGAZORD ROHBOT that you're expected to build to get the highest score or whatever. Your robot is only as good as you allow it to be.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay itself:\n\nUnderstandably clunky at times, the gameplay is still pretty charming. Getting kills is satisfying, the combat is easy to understand, and it can be skill-based depending on how you approach each situation. You never know what you're facing, and no two matches will have the same outcome. Not too much to say about it other than that it's pretty good.\n\nThird, the potential:\n\nThis game has such a huge potential for growth. The developers, while not making the best choices at all times, show that they care for the game in the multitude of changes they continue to throw at the community. If the developers don't act on the potential in games (I'm looking at you, Stomping Land), there's only so far it can go. Thankfully, this game has shown that it can adapt, in good ways and bad, with the community around it. With the other things working in its favor, this game can certainly grow far beyond its beginnings and overcome the negatives that are sure to come with a rather new game.\n\ntl:dr : bad physics, bad weapon balance, dumb dumb dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates, good gameplay, great possibilities, and fantastic potential.\n\nFor new players' sake, I won't recommend it now. But after this game has been turned around and flipped upside-down, changed to be the best it can be, I sure will be recommending it.","August 15, 2014","false","20.3"," 104 of 166 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","104","166","5","18"

It had everything I was looking for, freedom to build, pretty casual attitude, but competitive community, pretty even spread in weapon useability...but it seems like in recent updates, starting with megabots they just keep shooting themselves in the foot.\nFirst was Megabots:\nMegabots was a miserable addition. You build a giant tanky SMG bed and that's it. The plasma option has never been worth building because of the sheer lack of damage of the cannons and the armor of the top tier bots. All high level games became defend your megabot and hope to god they are semi-competent.\n\nNext they decided to push toward moba... This was an interesting idea exccept that in the weeks I tried to play it after that update all matches were bombarded with one side or the other running into glitches that either made it impossible to finish the match or impossibly one sided on objective since you couldn't capture them. This persisted over the course of a couple months until I just stopped trying to play for a while.\n\nNow they have...whatever they have now. Megabots are in the same spot with either smg or....smg because you still don't use plasma if you want to win. Matches are taking several minutes to queue as opposed to about 10seconds back in the earlier releases. FFA is what you'd expect, just a moshpit of gunfire. The maps still add little-no flavor to the game besides a few that were around since the start anyway.\nI guess I can say the CPU load and how blocks unlock now is pretty nice for freedom to build, but that's pretty much the only thing I've seen that got better.\n\nJust a minor grievance in addition, the automatic flipper is still crap.","September 12, 2015","false","211.4"," 49 of 71 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","49","71","2","0"

The combat system is enjoyable, and I like the robot creation tools.  The problem is how difficult it is to get everything now.  With the currency system battles were rewarding;  a long battle may be more of a grind, but it would be that much more worthwhile because the reward was higher.  With the epic loot system it doesn't matter if a game takes 5 minutes or an hour, you get the same stuff.\nThe epic loot system also just doesn't feel rewarding to me, and I get protonium crates more often than not from battles.  You can recycle items you get from loot crates that you don't want but they recycle for such low prices that the feature's nearly useless.  I understand that there is the potential for a loot crate to be more valuable than the galaxy cash, but it has yet to happen for me.  At this point the daunting aspect of grinding until I can get the parts I want has just about driven me away.  I can only imagine how disappointing it must be for people who get rusted and bronze crates more often.\nI can understand the inention to appeal to new players by making it easier to start the game with higher level loot, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the players that are already invested in the game.\nAt his point I'm still hanging in there in the hopes that it'll turn around, and would be more than happy to recommend the game if a future update adresses the current problems.","May 24","false","91.6"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Before this latest update, you fight using pre-built robots to earn robopoints, use robopoints to buy parts needed to improve your robot's design. You repeat this process of building and fighting repeat until you've built a set of excellent robots. It was an excellent model that works and I loved it so much I've spent money supporting this game and have spent thousands of hours playing it.\n\nThis latest update changed it all. Instead of earning robopoints from fighting in matches, players now earn crates that reward random stuff when opened. And by random, I mean completely random. A crate may contain a single wheel or a single wing, which is completely useless as wheels and wings must be paired. I can no longer get the exact parts I need to complete my robot. Instead, I have to recycle parts I don't want for a heavily discounted price before I can "craft" the parts I actually need. In order to build great bots, I now have to grind hundreds to possibly thousands of matches to gather all the parts that I need. This level of grinding is not fun for me and I has made me give up on this game.\n","May 12","false","463.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSupergeek/recommended/301520/","TheSupergeek","Supergeek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSupergeek/","202 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Updated 2016/05/16)\n\nIf you are new to Robocraft, I do not recommend playing this game for several reasons, the most important of which is that I believe Robocraft is now leaning toward Pay To Win as a result of the recent so-called "Epic Loot" game patch. Instead of trying to make a fun, rewarding game, FreeJam is placing an emphasis on new player retention and money through psychological manipulation.\n\nRandom Rewards\nWith the introduction of Epic Loot, all in-game rewards given for playing have been converted to Crates. Opening a Crate will give you a random item reward, such as building blocks, a weapon, a radar jammer, etc. A better score in the game will yield a higher level Crate. Higher level Crates have a slightly better chance of yielding higher level items. If you don't like the item you get, you can "Recycle" (sell) the item for in-game currency: "Robits."\n\nOn the surface this sounds fine. However, in my experience, after playing hundreds of matches in the new system, my in-game Robits balance has moved only very slightly. Why?\n\n* Rewards are random. I have yet to win a "Legendary" item, the most valuable tier of items. I have won perhaps 2 or 3 "Epic" items, and a handful of "Rares."\n\nThe thing is, it feels like there is no correlation between my performance and my rewards. I have not noticed any trend in the better crates giving me better rewards. It feels wrong. It feels like punishment. I'm not getting rewarded for doing better. I'm getting random rewards like pulling the handle of a slot machine.\n\n* Recycle values are very low. The resale rates are effectively a small percentage of what they used to be. So, even after selling everything I win, I have very little in the way of Robits.\n\nPrior to the Epic Loot update, players were able to earn in-game currency ("RoboPoints" or RP) by playing the game or by purchasing a separate game currency ("Galaxy Cash" or GC.) Players were rewarded with RP based roughly on their performance in game matches. The more expensive modules would take several days of playing, perhaps a few dozen matches. Progress was a little grindy but tolerable.\n\nMy progress after Epic Loot has ground to a halt. It was like hitting a brick wall.\n\nBuy Crates!\nThe option, of course, is to buy crates for real life money. I understand developers need to make a living. However, the crates you buy are STILL full of random junk. The rates for Legendary items even in the purchased crates are still under 5%, which means you can spend US$25 and still not get a Legendary.\n\nEven if you sell all of the items you got out of crates with that $25, it might not be enough to afford one Legendary item.\n\nIn contrast to this, prior to the patch, you could purchase one of those Legendary items for $5 or less.\n\nDeceit\nMy biggest problem with the update is that the currency names and scales were converted in an attempt to obfuscate how drastically the in-game currency earn rate was nerfed. The amount of Robits you earn from selling back items you don't want is much lower than the comparable earnings prior to the Epic Loot change. FreeJam is attempting to deceive and confuse players by changing the numbers on all of the items.\n\nWeapon Balance, Quality of Life, Clans, etc.\nThese things are important, but they're not the most important thing. They don't speak to the integrity of FreeJam. As a developer myself, I know balance is hard. I know development can be slow. I know social features are complex.\n\nBut if you try to pull the wool over my eyes and deceive me about what you're doing, if you try to put me in a Skinner box to milk me for money unfairly, I'm done. You've revealed that all you care about is sales.\n\nSummary\nI have played Robocraft for years. I have been around through a lot of changes to the game. This recent change is a blatant money grab and shift towards Pay To Win. It is deceitful to the players. I would recommend staying away from Robocraft until this latest fiasco has settled down, if it ever does. Robocraft may never recover from this if the developers insist on keeping these new earnings standards,","May 5","false","366.4"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

Those awesome robots shown in the images? You won't be making any of those. Once upon a time, not so long ago, you could. But it is not so now.\n\nSee, the game would reward you after every battle with a kind of in game currency based on your performance, allowing you to pick and choose parts to build robots with. This allowed for a great amount of creativity and encouraged you to get out there and cause mayhem, as it meant more money for the parts you wanted.\n\nNow though, as of the most recent update, instead of cash, you are given a random assortment of bits and bobs to construct robots with, curbing the creative potential by an huge amount. These can be sold for money but even then you're not making anywhere near as much as you would with the old system. Add to that the grossly inflated prices for parts and any kind of meaningful progression is nearly impossible.\n\nDon't waste your time with this game. If you're looking to get creative there must be a hundred games that give you the basic freedom to build what you want, as you want. Or just buy some lego.","May 9","false","221.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

The new Ion Distorter shotguns are insanely powerful, while the protoseeker has been nerfed to the ground. Nano's require huge amounts of energy to operate, making combat medic bots unviable. The economy has been shifted from a linear progression system to a flattened one, which is good in theory, but Freejam ♥♥♥♥ed it up.  All items in the game (blocks, guns, shields, etc) are now dropped from chests, which restricts building options and player creativity  - I've been waiting for modules to drop for days. One time I completely ran out of normal cubes, and had to grind singleplayer for enough cubes. You can recycle dropped items for currency, which is used to buy specific, individual parts, but the prices on these parts are so high that you're better off waiting for the small chance that the legndary weapon you need drops.\nI'm not sure if they're trying to kill off all their old players to attract new players who never got to play this game at its peak.\n","May 16","false","133.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CJ_Mickey/recommended/301520/","CJ_Mickey","Psatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CJ_Mickey/","51 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've been playing Robocraft since July of 2014 shortly after it was released from beta, and I can honestly say that this game is one of the most fun games that I have ever played; I just keep coming back to it! The concept is simple: make a block out of armor cubes, stick it to a pilot seat, and slap some wheels and guns on it, too. Just like that, you have a working robot that you can use to drive around and fight other players and their robots. You start out small, but eventually you level-up further and further until you can make huge, complex crafts with shields, wings, hoverblades, "triforced" armor... Tons! Each robot takes real-time damage during battle, which means that parts of your robot will fall off once enough damage is dealt to them; this adds a whole new dimension to combat and thought when building a robot.\n\nRecently, the game has gotten a lot of flak because of the implementation of the new MOBA gametype "Battle Mode," in which your team must fight the opposing team to capture and control 3 towers on the map to aid in destroying the enemy base. Older players grew accostumed to playing "Classic Mode" (now called "Team Deathmatch") and complained about the new addition of Battle Mode, failing to realize that CLASSIC MODE (TEAM DEATHMATCH) STILL EXISTS. Whereas in Battle Mode, players respawn after being killed and focus on taking/retaining towers for their team, Team Deathmatch is a game mode which consists of no respawns, ~10v10 combat, no towers, and -- if you are in a high enough tier -- a MEGA bot on each team. Mega bots are HUGE robots that players can build eventually. So yes, Robocraft has two awesome gametypes that you may choose to play at your whim with the high chance of additional gametypes being added in the future.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of Robocraft is how responsive the development team is. It is worth noting that the game is still in its alpha stage, and FreeJam is a pretty small team. Despite this, FreeJam is very active on Twitter, Reddit, and the Robocraft forums and open to discussion with their playerbase on how to improve Robocraft. Yes, FreeJam made some mistakes (limiting building capacity for each tier, ruining artbots, nerfing hoverblades, for instance) but they have ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED these issues and have promised to fix them. Though FreeJam can't fix every mistake immediately, they are extremely aware of what the Robocraft playerbase feels is wrong. Some examples when FreeJam did RIGHT was: when the servers got clogged with an explosion of new players (last summer) they got more servers within a week, they implemented an anticheating software program when hackers became an issue which significantly reduced the amount of cheaters in games, they implemented a CPU restriction to each tier to prevent "overtiering" in matches which a lot of new players were complaining about -- not an example of a GREAT solution but definitely an active, attentive solution (this update made it so a lot of artbots had to be deleted). So yes, sometimes FreeJam makes a mistake with an update, but they are always aware of the mistakes and actively trying to fix them. I want to reiterate that the game is still in alpha and that FreeJam is a small indie team. Despite this, FreeJam has already recognized the issue and has promised a solution to make artbots possible again.\n\nI think a current issue that some new players may face is the brief tutorial the game offers. I would recommend watching a youtube video to learn how to properly play/make a good robot/learn the controls in the garage bay.\n\nOverall, I think Robocraft is a spectacular game even in its alpha state with a lot of promise for the future. The developers actively listen to their playerbase's concerns and always deliver solutions to their problems. I could not recommend this game anymore to anyone!","July 21, 2015","true","568.4"," 137 of 225 people (61%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","61","137","225","17","9"

Robocraft is subject to change.-\n\nDespite the disclaimer above, Robocraft is already a pretty well oiled machine. Most of the features are working quite efficiently and the core mechanics are in place. There are plenty of things to love about Robocraft straight from go. The basic gist is you build a bot/death machine and battle it out against other peoples creations. Where the beauty of the game lies is in its creativity, from a floating pirate ship to a MechWarrior style walker, you never know what you are going to end up fighting. Robocraft is a multi-faceted game that has many layers of complexity, so I will do my best to break it all down but I may forget to mention something.\n\nThe first time I loaded up Robocraft I was greeted with an anti-cheat 3rd party software. Not my favorite thing in the world but more than welcome for this type of game. Aim-bots have ruined other games and I appreciate the extra safeguard. That being said, the game does actually take quite a while to load up all of its assets. Also the game crashed right after the long load up. Not a great first impression. I credit this to Early Access hiccups and reloaded the game with little to no problems.\n\nUpon second load up, I was brought into the heart of the game, The lobby. I watched as my pre-made bot gently floated in circles and I waited. Nothing happened. What was I waiting for you ask? A tutorial or anything for that matter. Nothing came. So I began randomly clicking around. I felt dizzy and lost with the amount of buttons, however this isn't my first rodeo and especially not my first battle arena style game.\n\nAfter clicking around, my curiosity led me to the build mode. After a minor pop-up that explained a few buttons. I wouldn't call this a tutorial more a crash course but I digress. The builder is exceptional! It reminds me of Space Engineers where you build things in first person view and can quickly change the direction of parts with a roll of the mouse wheel. You are given some basic parts but most unlock through the games leveling system and huge branching parts tree.\n\nThe way things work is that you unlock parts the more you level. You level by playing in matches and destroying other vehicles. After leveling you unlock that part for purchase. You don't get that part for free, just the ability to buy it. There are some ways around this but we will get to that later. The builder is quite extensive needless to say and a quick Google search of peoples creations is somewhat awe inspiring and impressive. Sadly my skills and blocks were inferior and building my own machine was not necessarily the best idea, not yet at least. The only problem I found was that I was very limited for the most part at the beginning of the game. The basic starting vehicles and parts work but they don't really make you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ or all that cool. Especially as you will more then likely see other people using the same vehicle with slight variations. Things don't really become all that unique and interesting until much farther into the tech tree and amassing a fortune of in-game currency.\n\nAfter this, I jumped into one of the pre-made vehicles and got into battle mode. I was not disappointed at all. There are several modes and they add different objectives and themes. You have team deathmatch, a conquest type mode, and boss battle, my personal favorite. In boss battle, you and many smaller craft face off against 4 much bigger and advanced craft. This requires a great deal of team work and coordination on both teams part otherwise you end up dead very quickly. The same can be said for conquest mode, which features capture nodes that must be protected/assaulted to attain victory. In all, my experience with the battle modes was fast, visceral, and fun. Usually whoever shoots first wins but sometimes I managed to win, even if I was left heavily wounded. The only problem I found with combat was queuing up, which could take anywhere from 1 to 4 minutes per match. Which given that some matches last about the same length, was a bit much for my taste.\n\nGraphically, everything was very nice with Robocraft as well. While the focus isn't on the environments, the terrain had some nice detail and good level design, offering multiple options for different kind of play styles. The focus is for sure on the vehicles and this shows quite nicely. From the crackle of energy as your plasma cannons fire, to glowing energy panels. The only thing I felt needed a bit of work was the way you exploded which felt more like a firecracker going off than an actual explosion.\n\nThe soundtrack was there. but I found it forgettable for the most part. However, I did love the sound effects. Robocraft is one of those games where you want to load up your own tunes and go to work. The options menu was rather robust with a decent amount of graphical options and rebindable keys.\n\nSo let's talk about the elephant in the room, the microtransactions. Now Robocraft is not P2W or pay to win, but more like pay to skip. If you are a premium user everything is a bit easier as you earn more RP(in-game currency) and double the experience. Aside from all that, you can also purchase GC which is a premium currency that you can use to purchase most things from parts to premium status. Mind you, level still applies to this, if you aren't the right level, you can't use something ahead of everybody else in combat. Where the lynch pin lies is in the Robo shop, which allows players to purchase premade bots for real cash. This auto levels them to that particulars bots level and tier, essentially skipping the grind and getting into the good stuff.\n\nWhile this is far from a P2W scheme, the problem I see is that this makes the free to play aspect kinda lame. Grinding and getting up to that point is going to take you months of work where as some dude with twenty bucks did it in five seconds. Your time isn't valued here, your wallet is more important. You may be vastly more experienced in the game but getting anything done is going to be a nightmare due to queues and the way the experience system works. You are given experience based off your contribution, meaning if you have a couple of bad matches, expect zero experience.  Now one could argue that this is fair. The developer has to make money some how and development isn't cheap, also the player should be rewarded for coughing up some dough. The problem is that the free to play experience isn't as exciting.\n\nIt's like going to the Zoo and seeing only the animals feet because you didn't pay. On the other side of the pay wall they have a freaking petting zoo, and you get to ride a Cheetah. Which is a damn shame because in Robocraft you probably can make an actual Cheetah, just expect to do it in weeks-months of grinding or drop a few bucks and get that shiny Cheetah right away. Everything just feels heavily stacked towards premium accounts. This shows in every aspect of the game.\n\nIf you take anything from this review remember this, Robocraft is a game that requires LARGE amounts of time investment or some cash to get to the really cool stuff. The game runs well and the combat is fun but long queues and long load ups can drag the overall experience down. You can take everything I say with a grain of salt though, because the game is free to play. You have nothing to lose but time. So feel free to check the game out and make up your own opinion. Robocraft is fun and worth it alone for the boss battles and seeing the huge bots. I haven't seen many games like Robocraft, especially ones that let you have this much freedom to make whatever you want.","August 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","36","50","2","0"

It used to be really good... Now? It's a piece of trash.\n\nI read all of the most recent reviews, where most the veterans hours rated it negatively, and sadly, I could not agree more. The developers really messed this game up. They ran it straight into the ground, said "Lets make this a more complex! Also add a MOBA mode! Lets screw around with the currency! Oh no! Are planes having a hard time with SMGs? Lets add HOMING ROCKETS and FLAK CANNONS! You know what? F**K IT! ADD AN INSTA-LOCK RAPID FIRING LASER THINGY AND A SHOTGUN! LETS ALSO ADD SOME MOBA BASED ABILITY BLOCKS! WOO HOO! NOW THE GAME IS SO MUCH F**KING BETTER!"\n\nThey not only ran it into the ground, but poured hydrochloric acid on it, beat it up with a bat, took a big dump on it, and then threw it into the ocean. I would not be suprised if most of the playerbase has already abandoned the game, but lets take a look back into the golden ages...\n\nTech "Research" Tree:There used to be a research tree type of unlocking system, where you could use points you earned from games to unlock the blocks you wanted. There were many different tiers of armors, guns, sheilds, radars, aerofoils, etc. And unltimately, it worked very well. I though it was pretty good.\n\nThen came the Level Unlocking System. You unlocked a new block each time you leveled up. and I said "Ok... they didn't screw it up too bad. It's playable." After all, I was already level 98. However, a little piece of me died that day. It took that special customizable feel away. With the old system, you had to choose what you wanted to upgrade depending on which area you specialized in, you chose the path of your robots design. Now, they just feed you whatever block they have at that level, and it is just not the same.\n\nMoving onto the most modern system... oh wait, I don't even know what it is. They don't even have a tab to cheack what blocks you unlocked!\n\nWeapons:It used to only be the railgun, SMG, and plasma. That was it. And tbh, I was glad that they added the Nano-Disrupters and Tesla blades. It only made the experience more fun with different types of robots and strategies. The downhill spiral started with the introduction of the Flak Cannon. It was powerful, had an area of effect, and obliterated planes. I was the plane type of guy. I loved to fly around in my Heli-Plane hybrid (gives you the speed and mobility of a plane and the hovering capabilities of a helicopter). SMGs were already a challenge for planes as one hit from a medium-high tier SMG could cripple your vehicle. The arrival of Flak Cannons rendered planes effectively useless, esspecially the slow ones. It didn't get any better from there. Homing rockets definitly did not make the situation any better. Of course there is going to be some where to hide when you are the in the middle of the sky. And the proto seeker is just a joke. What kind of weapon even is that and why would anyone add it to a game. A never miss, auto homing/locking, rapid fire, slightly sub-SMG damage laser. It just doesn't make any sense...\n\nAnd that is not it. The worst part comes with the new "energy" system. Seriously FreeJam?!?! YOU ARE GOING TO PUT ENERGY USAGE ON GUNS AND LIMIT THEIR FIRE? Hell no! The best part of robocraft was the big battles where people just just continuouly firing at the enemy team. Now, you just can't get that same euphoria from the heat of battle. This is just an example of making things more complicated.\n\nThen they adjusted how plasma cannons work. Instead of firing them all at once with a reload time, they made the firerate like a SMG's and it only shoots one "plasma shell" at a time. WTF!?! It is literally a SMG that shoots plasma projectiles! THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE! Plasma cannons are supposed to be shot all at once, demonstrating that powerful blast damage. And it was not overpowered or anything. Others could easily sustain plasma attacks with sheilds...\n\nThere are many more mistakes that the devs made (mega boss battles, premium paint, epic loot, maximum loadout, failure to balance weapons, lack of new and cool maps, bad matchmaking, etc) but I have already dragged on too long. Just note, it is not worth the time and effort to play this game anymore. It's just not fun anymore.","April 28","false","138.5"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","1"

I've casually played this game for nearly 2 or 3 years now with a few longer breaks and I've literally watched it change from a to 坑. On a sidenote: i have no idea what that symbol means. I just mean to say it changed a hella lot. Albeit you gotta say they are always eager to balance the game, they also fail hard at it.\n\nIt used to be possible to overtier if you preferred a single type of gun by unlocking higher tier tech with ubertech points (cash feature), then they nearly completely prevented that by making tech dependent on your level. Now they've completely removed the tech tree and you just randomly get ♥♥♥♥ from the lootbox after matches.\n\nIt's always been hard to purchase new parts from the shop without cashing - it involved a truckload of farming - but it certainly was possible. Nowadays it's just f***ing hard to "purchase" new parts like guns and utility parts: you recycle the useless pieces of ♥♥♥♥ you get from the lootbox for virtually nothing (about 100-300 "dust?" What even is this?) to save up to 300,000 dust for a legendary item. Alright, legendary items are legendary after all, but 2k for a blue plasma cannon? And then you're not set with just one of those? So calculate about 4-8 plasma cannons and you need to farm 8-16k dust. On top of that premium users (cashers as I like to call them) get two items from the loot crate instead of just one. Clearly they're favorizing people here... Plus cash purchased bots usually are far superior to custom made bots unless you spend a lot of time.\n\nI hate to watch another great game go down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ path of "Oh my gawd we can make ♥♥♥♥♥ons of money here if we make it a pay2win."

You say very good game and you dont recommend why??? Well first of all , i am playing this game since 2014 as it is a free game . I don't have that many hours because i wans't playing in all the periods of my life... but i was there when the updates were released . I have to say that a year ago this game was one of the best free to play games out there , it wasn't P2W , you were able to create everything your brain would think of from a simple robot to a beautiful robot and to a very practical robot and it required way more skill than it requires now if it requires any to tell the truth . One year ago the only weapons you had was plasma , rails , lazers , teslas and the nanos if you would like to be a healer . You were able to have only one type of gun which made the game way more  difficult and strategical as a wrong move may cost your robots ''life'' . Furthermore , that days was what i would like to call my best days as a plasma bomber . Yeah plasma bombers were actually a very good robot that days before these flaks were introduced . I loved to play as a bomber they were hard to hit plus plasmas  had good damage if not beast damage . But now i dont even consider getting off the ground as 5-6 hits by a flak to my jet are enough to bring it down . Now i have to talk about the present ... No tiers No Ranking(i preferred tiers to ranking of course) no tree , no flyers...at least for me flying is something i dont consider to do anymore :'( . The current matchmaking system is broken asf the crates are s*** if of course you get a crate after the match and it doesn't glitch . You can't make the robot you want if you aren't lucky enough , simple robots with op weapons made by unskilled or players that can't stand this update is a very common phenomenon as lock on missiles and ion distorters , legendary sh** plasmas lazers and many more things . That's it i with the review except one thing that i would like to see.

(30/04/15) I would give this a positive review BUT AFTER Resspawned and Overclocked update....... That's a whole new side....\n\nHere's why-\n\nBefore Respawned and Overclocked, this game inspired team work revolving heavy towards flanking, sticking as one big cluster of brute force because of the arena type mode. Once dead, you're gone. Once they introduced medics; it revolutionised the whole battle mechanic on whether a team would succeed or perish further reinforcing the team staying together. Moreover, when FJ released the team balance patch, the battles would last sooooo much longer and be even more adrenalin filled so you wouldn't be paired with 5 other rail walkers and be crushed by a whole team of smg tanks. As medic you would feel so valuable; one of my favourite memories...\n\nMegabots arrive. Some of the player base decides this was a bad move (this was where the game started to get controversial) however, in my opinion, this was even better because now the T10's would stick by the Mega's siding them in one big turf war. Those were the good days of RC.\n\n30th of April arrives. Respawned and Overclocked. The danger of dying now gone; stupid bots start appearing virtually killing the cleverly thought out designs using tri forcing ect. Team work is gone; no need to stick together. If you die, you can just respawn again. Don't even get me started on medics... Before Respawned and Overclocked, medics were the top priority on kill list. But now they're just replaced with respawn. Again, no fear of dying. Megabots are restricted to the old mode where hardly anyone played because of the shiny new Respawned and Overclocked. (The megabots were still fairly new yet all the work seemed to just be abandoned). Even though arena mode is still here, it feels as if it gets no love anymore.\n\nRobocraft Unleashed touches down. The removals of tiers and tech trees are here. This resulted in a huge backlash from the community as many veterans felt that all their progress was for nothing as it took ages to grind up to each tier and save up for new parts to find that it's no longer the case. In addition, going up a tier made us feel amazing and satisfied giving us a sense of progression. I can see FJ wanted to enable full creativity as many wanted but it just won't work.\n\nTo some up-\n\nRobocraft used to be one of my favourite games and WAS a fun and enjoyable game. Simple and easy to learn. However, as the updates passed, Robocraft got more and more complicated destroying the fun and simple factors or the arena game mode into a supposed 'moba' style game...\n\nps: if you read all of this; thanks for your time!","August 10, 2015","false","442.8"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","0"

But not enough to keep going.Wrong.  I have 1k+ hours in this game.  The biggest problem is a memory leak in the client.\n\nStill true:\nA little policing of the user community is not a bad thing.First things first and not limited to FreeJam: FreeJam accepts seriously offensive account names like SlapHerWhileSheSucks, so you can get an idea of what a small part of the user community is like.  Nobody reputable should accept this stuff.  At the very least, there needs to be an option that allows a player to ban any contact or gameplay with a specific account.\n\nAll animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.In general, the majority of the level-100 elite are perfectly satisfied with the bot builds a player is pushed into, and a lot of them think that anyone who isn't is a whiner.  Some are really genuinely good folks, who offer serious advice about fighting and building bots.  But they don't see why people get frustrated and "rage quit" (rage quitting is a very familiar activity in the Robocraft world, which should tell you something immediately.)  Edit: The introduction of anti-aircraft has changed the dominance of flyers.  They are now a dangerous element in the battle arena, and not the only thing that guarantees a win.  Much improved.  There are build options that just can't work.  In the end, any bot that travels on the ground is a losing design.  I've seen any number of "I'm trying to help you" conversations end with something like "have you tried to build a flyer?"\n\nLittle technical problems.There are game glitches (Edit: haven't seen this in a while. players can spawn into the terrain and then fight--considered cheating and a reportable offense.)  Frequently the servers become unresponsive.  Edit: this may be inaccurate now: If you lose connection, the servers may decided you need a lesson and will make you wait an extra two minutes because you "left a battle" (I'm not kidding.)\n\nEdit: Haven't had this happen in a long time: You can fight for 30 minutes, and win, only to discover that none of the rewards for that will ever be awarded.  The rewards are "rp"--the equivalent of money.  Even if the game isn't in release, fighting a battle and getting nothing for it is just lame.  Maybe the servers are being worked on, maybe The Net has issues -- who knows.  I didn't crash.  I didn't lag.  The battle seemed fair (except my platoon mate, who did very well with his underpowered bot.)  We won.  We got nothing.   Not even a dev or a mod in chat to explain it.  This in NOT the way to get a recommendation for your game, FreeJam!\n\nEdit: this has gotten better: Not too surprisingly, FreeJam is not always forthcoming with information when there are problems.  When things get really bad, messages in-game will start showing up, which is an huge win for FreeJam.  Nothing is more frustrating than being frustrated by no information.\n\nArena battles: Teams, rewards and fairness.FreeJam  decided to move from a system that matches bots according to a "tier" structure to some ill-defined "robot ranking" before I started playing--it sounds like the tier structure was much fairer.  I'm not sure what the robot ranking system uses to decide what teams should be put together.  There is no way to see what the rank of a bot is, or the level of a player, and no way to opt-out before a battle starts (like a "Oh we ain't doin' this" team vote before the battle starts.)  A team can surrender and stop wasting time once the battle starts, but only by unanimous vote.  One holdout can keep everyone from leaving--everyone who doesn't want the righteous punishment of FreeJam to come down on them, that is.  There is nothing in the arena fight setup to keep FreeJam honest, in other words.\n\nRandom groups of players are supposed to fight as teams.  As is usual in any group of humans, the ones who learn to "game the system" are the winners.  We all get enough of that in real life, it would be nice to see a game thought out so that it's less possible in said game.  The feeling I get from Robocraft is that gaming the system is actively encouraged.\n\nEdit: the following struck text is no longer true--long distance fighters are still very dangerous, and can swing a battle, but they aren't the only factor.  Don't try to do anything that doesn't involve being on the high ground, and having weapons that do outrageous amounts of damage from long distances--the bots that win fight a very sanitary battle, and don't have to get their hands dirty.\n\nEdit: the practice mode has changed so much since this was written... The most telling thing about the game is the practice mode.  The AI bots can shoot through the terrain (so the previously mentioned glitch is very much a part of the basic game code.)  One of them was really bad about this, it seemed like the AI for that bot was programmed to exploit it but I think it was more a combination of the bot-type's basic strategy and configuration.  The bot no longer seems to exploit this terrain-clipping "glitch," but the other bots still do.  What's telling is that the most egregious offender was patched, not the actual, real, Houston-We-Have-A Problem.  That's a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe verdict (for me)Like I said, I have had some fun with this game, but  I won't be playing it again anytime soon.  Too bad too, I have almost reached that magical level 100.  If I come back in a month, and things are no better, I'll uninstall it and try something like "From the Depths."\n\nThe current verdict (Jan 25 2016)This game is addictive, even with all of the frustrations it carries.  I wish I could give it a neutral review, but Steam only allows up or down.  THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS ME FROM GIVING THIS GAME A "RECOMMEND" IS THE MEMORY LEAK IN THE GAME CLIENT.  If FreeJam fixes that, I will give it a thumbs up.  As it is, I can't recommend a game which is capable of locking up a system so hard that it needs to be rebooted (this occurs on a Windows 8.1 box and a 64-bit Linux box, so it's not one particular computer.)","September 12, 2015","false","501.7"," 45 of 66 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","45","66","0","4"

One of the weapons - "AeroFlak" - also functions as a hard counter that renders one of the most interesting types of robot to build and play - aeroplanes, such as interceptors and bombers - largely useless.\n\nThey have also publicly stated that they effectively refuse to address either of these problems in any meaningful way.\n\nEven though the community had warned them about it for weeks (ever since the announcements for the changes) through every possible channel.\n\nAnd even though the community has been suggesting hundreds of viable solutions to the issues created by the new system.\n\nJust look at the recent State of the Game post, and compare that to recent Steam reviews, the reddit.com/r/robocraft subreddit, the official forums on www.robocraftgame.com/forums, etc., and you get an idea about how much the developers care about what the community thinks of their game and what they want out of it.\n\nI can, unfortunately, no longer recommend this game.","May 18","false","58.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

HA! that feature is no longer worth while, now there are 2 ways to get robits, sell the ♥♥♥♥ loot you get for minimal robits, or have other players buy the robots you make, yeah if you're lucky, plus you only get 25% robits from selling a robot. You can also buy the best chest with real money, only problem is... you still have a high chance to get nothing.\n\nPremium is no longer worth it, instead of double robits and experience, you now get double the amount of crap loot and ooooooooo more colors to paint your ship, I ALREADY HAD ALL THE COLORS!!! now im stuck with 4.

The removal of tiers system is just bad.\nThis game used to be fun when you actually needed to specialise in one class and cooperate with the whole team in order to win. You could earn money no matter what, then you could buy whatever you want for your bots and upgrade them.\n\nHowever, with the recent updates (the implementation of crates system and the ability to put mutiple classes of weapons onto one bot), people can just spam craps onto one bot and rush to the top of the scoreboard in order to get some slightly better ♥♥♥♥. Most players become selfish and only focus on scores because only the top player on the scoreboard can get the protonium crate (better ♥♥♥♥). Also, you can't earn anything except crates and XP from battles (AKA no money and crate is basically everyting).\n\nThe worst part is that even if you can get the protonium crate, you can still get cheap ♥♥♥♥, because the items in it are distributed randomly and not performance-based. Normal players seldom get what they want from crates. You can still buy stuff, but they changed the in-game cash to robit which can only be obtained by destroying other stuff you own and it only gives very little amount of it, you can only get back 10-25% of what the original value is (you could get back 50% of the original value in the old system). Players can buy crates that cost real money and try to get what they want (even if they can't get what they want they can still destroy those buttloads of stuff from those buttloads of crates and buy whatever they want). This makes it really hard for new players who don't want to spend real money to upgrade their bots to higher level. And old players (me) usually bought everything they need from the good ol' days and good ol' system, which is extremely unfair to new players.\n\nThe removal of pilot seat is also a really big mistake. The pilot seat allowed players to make something creative but reasonable because you needed to build something that could protect the pilot seat (basically you needed skills to build something). Now you can just build something completely ridiculous since there isn't a pilot seat anymore.\n\nI don't want to make this review too long so I will just say the removal of tiers system is just a really really poor decision.","May 26","false","206.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","2"

I Loved the new battle modes and I spent even more time playing with every update. After 200 hours, I finally got to MEGABOT! The game was so fun after I got megabot. One day I opened up the game after an update. Basically it said, we are removing megabots and giving everyone who had megabots at that time about 2400 gc (can just buy a pile of crap). In addition to the bye bye to megabots, they decreased the amout of rp earned in a battle by like 90%. I just stopped playing then. I was angry, and the robocraft team got alot of complaints from me. Another update came along and I tried it. They took out all currency and replaced everything with crates you earn after a battle.

Welcome to Mechwarrior Online 2.0.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the medics (even though I played one) pretty much ruin everything as far as strategy goes.  So the game turns into a turtle match of "let's see who runs out of energy first".\n\nThat's not fun, it's never been fun.  Why would they think this is fun? They need to look at their low level tier matches and figure out exactly why people have fun at that stage.  Because right now building a robot or mech is absolutely pointless when the design doesn't help at all.  Shields don't do ♥♥♥♥ against rail weapons or missiles, or getting bombarded with plasma from one player.  It does nothing except weigh down your robot.  So there goes your imagination out the window, so much for refining your design.\n\nUpgrading your weapons also doesn't do ♥♥♥♥ except queue you with higher ranking players that have extremely powerful weapons, so what's the point? just stay low tier and never upgrade anything, you will experience the same game but less frustrating.  Especially with no lock-on missiles that you can't avoid unless you get out of it's distance range.\n\nI spent a measly 5 bucks on this game and I regret it now, it's extremely unbalanced, it's full of cowards and the designs mean nothing against a rail gun that blows up all of your defenses in one shot.","March 9","false","71.7"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","31","43","0","2"

The concept of this game is to build a functioning robot (it isn't really a robot due to the fact that you have a pilot seat, but that's beside the point) out of the parts they give you, then take this robot into battles. The more you fight with your robot, the more currency you earn (represented by RP) along with Tech Points, which are used to unlock new parts, which are then bought with RP. You must also use RP to repair your bot if it is damaged in battle, and the repair costs varry depending on just how damaged your bot was. Currently, there is only one gamemode in which you must capture the opponent's base before they capture yours. So, if you're a fan of varrying gamemodes I can't really recommend this to you...yet.\n\nOne major thing that I feel like I should address is that this game does include microtransactions. BUT, before you hear that word and automatically deny the existance of the game, the game is not pay to win in the way that you would be able to notice it while playing a match, and arguably not pay to win at all. The reason for this is that the game works by matching up your bot with other bots which fit in your tier (I saw one of the reviews not recommending the game complaining that they are constantly matched with players in tiers higher then themselves, but I have never had that experience in over 30 hours of gameplay). Due to this system, someone who buys the best parts in the game is going to be automatically moved into the highest tier in the game, where they will still not gain an advantage over other players. If anything, those who pay for parts would have a disadvantage due to the fact that they are not as experienced in building their robots or fighting with them. Building off of my last sentence, the way you build your robot is very important. Someone with the lowest avaliable items in a tier with a well designed bot could still defeat someone with the highest weapons in the tier with a badly-designed bot.\n\nAnother major aspect of this game is progression through levels. The only time this game gives me the feeling of grinding is after I've maxed out my robot for the tier I'm in but I don't quite want to step up to the next tier yet, which is really only a limit I put on myself. There is rarely a time (in the first 4 tiers anyway, I haven't progressed to the tiers above so I can't speak for those yet) when you get back from a battle and can't afford to upgrade your robot in a at least a minor way, such as upgrading a few sheets of armor. Due to this constant ability to upgrade at least something, I never really feel like I'm grinding away at the next level, but rather slowly progressing through the level towards the next one, something I really enjoy.\n\nAll in all, Robocraft is a game with a great premise, currently limited gameplay elements (in terms of gamemodes) and a few glitches, but those are to be expected in early access games. I would recommend it to anyone who has ever wanted to be able to build and use the vehicle you take into battle and don't mind the fact that there is curently only one gamemode. To those who are turned away by that fact, there are still 3 maps which provide areas for using different strategies with different robots, adding some sort of variety into the gamemodes. Even if that still doesn't seem like enough of a redeeming factor, just try it anyway, as the worst that can happen if you end up absolutely hating it is that it took up some space on your computer and some of your time.","September 18, 2014","true","51.7"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","5"

Some of the major complaints are regarding the recent additions of CPU limits and armor tier locks, as well as the removal of all overtiering. While it affects the game, sure, it is not 'game-breaking' in the sense that we cannot play the game.\n\nThe main piece of advice I would give to new players is to not rush tiers. The new update was poorly thought through and hence a new player can rush from tier 1 to tier 10 in a matter of hours whereas for me it took almost 200 (I launched the application directly for probably half my playtime instead of through Steam). The advantage of taking your time in each tier is that you become a better player and have a much higher player level by the time you reach tier 10. If you tier-rush, you will likely arrive at tier 10 with a player level of 5 or 6, not nearly enough to be at all competitive in T10.\n\nThe game is still very fun, despite the changes, and I think the new meta has revived a dying game, which many of my friends quit because it was getting boring. I strongly strongly recommend this game as long as you avoid tier-rushing :)","July 21, 2015","true","378.8"," 92 of 151 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","92","151","5","0"

I've played this game since November/December of 2014, now I have a bit more than a couple of hours in the game. I loved the freedom and creativity this game allows for, even after all the restrictions. I joined after the removal of repair costs, but getting to T10 was still a massive grind, where I was stuck in T7/8 for quite some time before I got to T10. I remember the feeling of awe as I played my first T10 game, admiring all the "pros" of the game, all the well built end game bots. I was hesitant to play T10 with my crapbot (in hindsight, it wasn't very crap at all), but I eventually got better. I tried all types of movement possible, made a lot of experimental builds that hilariously failed/worked. My rule of thumb is for any battle worthy bot I make, I must get at least a kill in it.\n\nNow, I've become very experienced at the game. I've used basically all the effective build types, and most of the ineffective ones too. I'm now an end game player, building and flying vertical thrustersticks (bots that have a little less than 50 thrusters). At this point, I can honestly say that the game has gotten stale. The average player skill has decreased dramatically since I first got into T10. No longer do I fear going into battle and meeting veteran players who will hand my ♥♥♥ back to me in pieces on a dinner plate. I'm not even hesitant to engage multiple enemies anymore; there has been many situations where I find myself 1 v 2 or even 1 v 3 and I'd come out victorious. I only play the game for the platoons/clan events now, occasionally for engineering/building.\n\nI can honestly sum up my current experience as this motto: "When something stops being interesting, make it interesting yourself". We've had many events on the Cookiejar teamspeak for Atlas core, ranging from renting art bots from the CRF, solo queueing into the same game for (almost) clan wars (with ourselves). In between all the bugs and the player disconnects (in a 8 v 8 game), that's the best we can do to make the game interesting for ourselves.\n\nI've rambled on for too long. If you're a prospective player, go ahead and try out the game! I'm sure you'd enjoy the various aspects of the game, from building random pieces of crap (maybe literally) to tearing enemy bots apart bit by bit. I can't guarantee you'd still be interested after 10 hours, let alone 100. But there is still the magic that hooked me into the game, and after all, this IS a free to play game.\n\nIf you're a current player reading the reviews for whatever reason, let's just say that we veterans know the pain of getting the devs to listen to us, when we've seen the game through thick and thin. We've been through the reign of SMG bricks, copter bricks, rails, plasma, and tsticks. We've been through all the nerfs and buffs, all the poor matchmaking, all the flaming on forums. In the end, this is Freejam's game, they can take it wherever they see fit. The forums is a hostile place filled with QQ threads and minimal developer response.\n\nAs each update comes, I log fewer and fewer hours into this game. Noobs complain that Freejam is catering to the veterans on the forums. Veterans complain that Freejam is catering to the noobs on the forums. The sight of a tstick is enough to make new players ♥♥♥♥ in their pants, even though a single SMG shot can take out one thruster. Teslas are OP even though their armor is worse than paper. Client side hit detection coupled with poor game servers make shots through entire mountains possible, and there are 3/5 weapons that are hitscan (SMG, Rail, Nanos). There are bugs that have been in the game for so long, they are essentially features now. There are those who pull the "Alpha game" trump card for everything negative about the game, while the game is at version 0.999999.\n\nRegardless, it has been a wonderful experience playing the game before. Give this free game a shot. It isn't pay to win, and although it isn't perfectly balanced, it is still enjoyable most of the time. There will be updates every once in a while, and the next update looks promising, so who knows!\n\np.s. Hop on the Cookiejar Teamspeak server if you want to platoon with others. Add me on steam if you want to platoon with me, or want helps/tips!

The wrong tier players are matched with incorrect tier players. I would love to play as a "Robot" but loose all hope when the opposing team are all flying robo... I mean "Drones!" Drones are not robots hence the difference in name and operation. I'm all for a bit of variety and quirky building, but to have my tactical designed Mech, that I spent a lot of time and care on  destroyed in an instant by a flying square on acid is really rediculous!\nMatches need to be fairly matched, based on equal levels and equal amount of robot type. Say 3 Mechs+ 3 tanks or Wheel vehicals and no more than 2 drones /planes/ helis ect a side, that would at least even the odds and build a little tactical advantage for both parties.\nI love the creativity i can put into this game and do enjoy playing it. Would it be at all possible to allow co-op in the practice range against the AI bots? This would be a nice change of pace from constant deathmatches with little reward and of course players could always have a mode where they work against each other whilst fending off the AI bots and accumulating the best score?\n\nPlease sort this great game out and win back all the other players that have left disgruntled, ( just read the comments) I can't believe this games review says Very positive, I think a recount is in order, dont you?\n\nP.s single player crashes all the time loosing you progress, somtimes after 20 kills, everytime after one death or beating your high score by more than 25-30 kills, please fix this\n\nThanks","April 6","false","57.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

Last weekend Robocraft was a very balanced game.\n\nThis weekend it has all changed. The problem that the creators have made is it is now a pay to win game. That was fine but the thing that made it unplayable is the the matchmaking. It is completely of the charts, Very high level players before this update had WMD's and they could go against people that had them, now new people get instantly killed by them and they quit hoping to find a better game. And get no luck.\n\nSo if it is possible, reverse the game to what it was, or your player base is only going to go down to the pay to win players. And we all know if they go it will be a unfunded game. The worst thing i have to do about this review is to not recommend it.

I really couldn't be bothered.  This game is so mediocre that it is hard to describe.  I will point out a few things I liked and how they changed.\n\nLiked:  The tech point system.  It directly rewarded you on how you played.  Play good.  Get stuff.  Play bad.  Get stuff much slower.\n\nLiked:  The toned-down approach to pay to win.  It was there, sure.  But it wasn't in your face.\n\nLiked:  Gameplay.  It was fun.  Simple.  Incredibly so.\n\nDisliked:  The lag.  The spikes.  The network issues.  That the game automatically punished you for (disco bugs that enforced a wait period to play again.  What?  Am I at work?  Uninstall.)\n\nDisliked:  Once you felt like you were getting ahead changes were made.  Big changes.  Got that awesome railgun that you been playing all week to afford?  Boom!  Nerfed on accuracy, reload and speed of bolt.  How about those 14 or so laser blasters you installed after fighting like a dog for a week to earn?  Boom!  Nerfed!  Accuracy out the window after three shots and ranged reduced by a third.  This basically goes for all weapons and mods in general.\n\nDisliked:  The feeling of never getting to breathe because of all the sudden changes that were so sweeping and so often in implementation.  The game has probably been reworked in either level system, weapons changes, physics, research model, grind model or gameplay as to make it almost feeling like being at work.\n\nDisliked:  The latest patch.  It has gone fully out the window.  All the effort since 2014 (on and off from frustration) just gone out the window.  All my grinded parts gone.  Just gone.  Revamped.  Now they have a random loot reward system at the end of every match.  Before you would fight well and get paid well.  Now you fight well or bad and an RNG roll decides what you get.  YAY!  I just rolled 20 common cubes!  Nice!  Because I needed 3020 of them!  All those uncommon and hard to get toys you worked for you have to work to get all over again.  And guess what!  They are insidiously expensive now.  But oh!  Wait!  You can make a roll and get them by chance if you play!  Play more and get more chances.  Great!  I should also mention that you get double the loot if you have premium.  Yes!  Pay us and you get double the chances to get what you want (you already had it and they patched it away from you but none of that talk!) and all will be well.  I should note that the vast majority of rolls I did make did have all the rares and legendary items up in the premium roll area.  For me down here it was 20 cubes and lvl 1 wheels.\n\nUninstalled.  Forgotten.  Not recommended.\n\nP.S.

After having been cheated out of gear due to crashes and bugs, and having what little I did get held behind a paywall, I'm sad to say that this game has finally hit the point of no return. Do not download, do not play. Uninstall if you have it, and get your diskspace back. This game has died. It was fun, once. I actually kinda enjoyed it. But now, it's just another crate simulator, grind and grind to get one single item, then scrap it and grind some more. That's not what this game was about a long time ago, but that's what it has devolved to. Goodbye Freejam, I won't be using your products again anytime soon.

Its core gameplay is unique and it's a ton of fun to bring vehicles you build yourself. But changing the progression from a quick, quality-driven system to a total RNG nightmare makes the quality of the building and gameplay meaningless. Thanks to harsh RNG gating off players' abilities to build vehicles, which is the core of this game, and players no longer being able to just buy parts with currency earned from gameplay performance, there isn't any reason to get into the game in its current state.","May 17","false","107.8"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

They had a tech tree system to level up your equipment, you were able to purchase gear from a shop, by winning games you got currency, etc. But ever since the removal of the tech tree, this game has just been on a trip of steady decline.\n\nIn recent updates, they have removed the ability to freely build your vehicle. The only way I have found to get new parts and accessories is by opening "Crates" to get "loot." You can then keep the loot, or recycle it to buy other items. I feel that this puts the whole "Construct your own robot" idea in the trash. I mean, this completely decimates the whole point of the game: being creative and constructing your own vehicle. It makes it so that you can only get 1 part at a time from each box (2 if you pay $$ for premium).\n\nThey also removed the vehicle tier system. The whole system of tiers and and the tech tree was perfectly fine, there were no issues whatsoever. However, the developers decided to remove the tier and tech tree system (who knows why) and at first replace it with a "buy items at your tier" system, and then downgraded it to what it is now, getting loot from boxes. Also, by removing tiers, the matchmaking is even more buggy than it was before. It will pair up people who are exploiting by mounting a high level weapon on a very tiny vehicle, which will match them into low tier games. This was a slight problem before they removed the tech tree, but now I see it every match.\n\nOverall, I'm going to give this game a numerical score of 6/10. I feel I'm being generous because of the former passion I held for this game when it was still fun and enjoyable.","May 13","false","73.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Instead of progressing toward a richer building/crafting/fighting experience, they removed the faculties I liked the most (those capable of introducing teamplay for instance, or those that made victory dependant on skill). Each and every update they uttered some fluffy bla on how they are going to listen to their community next time.. then iterated on how 'their vision' of the game is grand and nice and still moved at least three steps backwards, for each step forward. I played this game alot, until their 'vision' became a toxic influence of ♥♥♥♥ing over established metagame with every update. They might not wanted to be destructive, but they are. What they never get is, that they were fixing problems they introduced themselves, Now with half of the old community already gone, they feel free to squeeze the last juice out of this once good game.  Who likes to open crates with random junk, when he could have the desired item bought directly. Nobody. But I dont want to create the idea, that the only abominable thing Freejam did, was the 'epic bull' update. No..no.. They had repeatedly the audacity to null my ingame cash balance with their updates,  - or similar.\nIt first happened when tiers were removed: the week before I purchased tier 11 blocks for several billions, only to have them removed without refunds , with an 'upgrade' to their vision. Then they removed the Megabots, the one and only goal for a lvl 100 player. This meant removing several multi billion credit items, many players bought with ingame cash/ premium cash. Without a real refund. (well you got a stupid energy carger module, for each megabot)\nWell after all this Ripoff and Abuse, I stopped playing for a while, because of my old gamer buds, nobody cared about this game anymore. But with the 'loadout' upgrade I convinced some of this group to rejoin the game and play with me. That happened for a glorious week or two, until they decided to implement their ♥♥♥♥ing skinnerbox ripoff abuse lootgame. While they were trying to hijack my endorphin-receptors with their 'casinovision' of theirs, they silently removed 9000 units of premium cash and offered no refund except a protonium crate with 20 blocks.\n\nSo now I stopped wasting my time/money on greedy idiots with a vision.","May 19","false","507.8"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

It's a unique vehicular-based shooter where teamwork and communication are the keys to success! Sadly, this game is filled with 10 year olds, but even without communication its a cool time killer. You get to design your vehicle fairly easy, and its pretty cool that everyone has a different machine, adding a large amount of diversity to the game. To get cubes to build your vehicle, you earn a currency during matches that you can buy cubes with and you unlock more cube with a different currency. There is another currency that costs real money, but it buys the same thing as the F2P currency and a couple cosmetics but that's it. A very fun game.\n\nMe (Later): Ok they changed the game a little bit, in ways i don't really like, but it is still an ok game. You still have the F2P currency and the P2P currency but now you don't need to unlock the cubes. It makes it so someone can take a Super-OP gun and put it on their tiny vehicle and it gets grouped up with the weak-vehicles with 20 very-weak guns. It doesn't matter how small the OP vehicle is because it kills anything that it sees instantly. There is also now a "community" market, which allows people to post their creations and other people can download them, if they pay for all the cubes that it costs to build it. A cool sharing system, but now people can just download the very-well built vehicles, which means now there is no creativity or diversity in most matches when 5 people have the same OP vehicle. A pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t update if you ask me, but the game is still all right, I guess...\n\nMe (Now): ♥♥♥♥ this game, it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. Now there is NO F2P currency. Nothing. Now we have ♥♥♥♥ing crates. OH WOW SO UNIQUE! ♥♥♥♥ING CRATES! You can get all the cubes you could have bought before by playing the game, but now you get VERY VERY VERY MUCH LESS. "Oh you spent the entire match healing a guy who was defending the base and pretty much saved your team from annhilation? Oh here you can have THE WORST CHEST IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME THAT GIVES YOU 20 CORNER BLOCKS." So now you're ♥♥♥♥ed because when you're trying to build a unique vehicle, have fun building it out of corner blocks. Meanwhile, the guy you healed the entire match got 20 kills and got the best crate in the game. So while you have corner blocks, that selfish-♥♥♥♥♥ has a heat-seeking rocket launcher. "OOOORRRRRR, YOU CAN SPEND 20$ AND HAVE ALL THE COOL STUFF AND WIN THE GAME SO YEA DO THAT" -Freejam. Freejam, more like PayToHaveAChanceJam. Do your self a favour and never play this game in this state. IF, they fix thier game, (They probably won't) I will change my review.

FJ wants new players, so they making this game more easy with every update. I played more than 1000 hours, and in mid of 2015 game was perfect. But now they added imbalanced weapons for players who even does not want to aim. Now you can ♥♥♥♥ some blocks on the floor of your garage, add there Ion Disorder + LOML and this ♥♥♥♥-o-bot will play perfectly.\nSome month ago high-skilled players made special schemes of armor aka "triforce", weight balance, and other things, trying to made realy cool bots. There were such bots like Thundercloud, Clurly ball, Tengu drone, Shashlik and others best ideas. FJ killed them all by stupid increasing of damage of all guns, making split-shells for rails. They wanted just to @improve balance@, but they killed it tottaly with their hands from ♥♥♥.\nSo, enjoy.","May 17","false","202.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

Unfortunately, the direction the developer decided to take isn't mine. In the past, you had a performance based reward system that made it easy to get the parts you need to build a robot.\n\nNow, the reward system is largely based on luck and randomness. Good luck getting all the parts you need to build the robot you want in a timely manner. It's not possible anymore.\n\nIn the past, you could spend money to get part that you want. Currently, you can spend money on a lottery-like system (buying crates with random items). This system is proven to work for games like Hearthstone, but in a building game, where you need a certain amount of wheels, tracks or guns, to build the robot you like, this just isn't fair for the player.","May 16","false","468.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

You build fighting robots out of armor cubes and stick functional movement and weapon components onto them.  Then you pilot them in a team vs. team environment.  The game plays quite smoothly, and the dynamic damage system lets you tear bots apart piecemeal, adding a level of precision to the combat that sets it above most vehicle shooter games.\n\nUnfortunately, the developers lack any foresight when it comes to balancing, and it's gotten steadily worse with each update.  For example, they've added several highly specialized weapons that excel in certain situations but are highly limited in others.  This would be great if not for a relatively recent decision to allow you to place multiple weapon types on a bot.  The result was that bot diversity immediately plummeted, as everyone can now build bots that have no weaknesses or limitations.\n\nImagine what Team Fortress 2 would be if the sniper was also issued a rocket launcher and flamethrower, and that's the current state of Robocraft.  Sadly, the developers seem perpetually oblivious to the harm they're doing to their game, and every update over the past year has taken it from a brilliant class-based team shooter with an extra addition of clever robot engineering, and turned it into a unique but mediocre shooter with robots that are functionally indistinguishable.\n\nI'll definitely be paying attention to it's continued development, in the hope that the developers significantly change tack.  Robocraft not only has the potential, but has flat out demonstrated, that it can be one of the best games I've played, but in its current state I wouldn't recommend it.","May 16","false","383.8"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

Premium rediculously increased and lowered in value. Rather than giving us new content they changed the numbers of damage/mass/armour values and called this an update.\n\n+ Since the spectrum update, they did make league mode optional and thank you FJ for this.\n\nThe new 'epic loot' update, has killed a lot of the creativity. You spend 700 pflops (out of 1700 for your bot) and those guns do nearly nothing. The new meta is shotguns and rails (snipers). If you like this class then this game is for you.\n\nThe new loot drop system is uninteresting and leaves a void (for me) of the refreshing newness of prior robocraft days where you could move fast and shoot fast. The controls feel clunky, and there was no warning about the change of mass for their updates.\n\nThe part that is most disappointing is how much this game micromanages it's player base. Touted as a creation based system, every change is aimed at nerfing new builds that people come up with (or at least it feels that way), yet some of the most problematic abuses (tessaracts) that clearly violate the games physics (seriously corner cubes barely touch each other) are left in the game.\n\nThe loot drop system would bother me as a new player simply because i have to wait for items to appear. Got an epic item? Hope you are leveled enough to use it.\n\nWe were told there was going to be an "epic update" and many of us were seriously excited for this. What they didn't tell you is that the real "epicness" of this update was that they were playing with numbers and calling it an update. No new game mode, no new maps.\n\nFinal notes on the loot system.  I have to say this being a game for young gamers, I really dislike the gambling aspect where users buy crates.  This encourages gambling and gaming, both pretty addictive.  I only say this as a watchdog for younger gamers especially, and because this game is geared towards younger gamers.  Lots of dislike from me on this.\n\nPerhaps I am just a dated gamer at 3+ years of robocraft game play and can't do change. I don't take back the money I've given the dev's but I won't be continuing to support them if this is the new robocraft norm. This game is clearly looking to make money (I don't blame them for this, I am just disappointed to have my crack taken away) rather than be a groundbreaking creation game. This is just my opinion of the current opening release of the 'loot update'","April 30","false","014.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","1"

But alas then came in the facist regime AKA the game devs, they had made updates every month or so that absolutely everyone disagreed with, they made the tech tree no longer as the composure of a tree it used to be but instead a leveling system. They made new game modes nobody liked. Honestly I feel bad for hitler because when I call the devs of this game nazis it truly gives them a bad name. But on the real deal, this game was dank but progressively gets less and less dank over time to the point where it just isnt fun anymore.

The game has changed with each update and this latest update is no exception. The currency and exchange system is unfair and seems like a real money grab. You no longer get rewarded with currency but rather a collection of subpar weapons, movement parts, cubes, and other trash. The system is flawed and needs to be redone or this will be a game that had so much potential that burned out for no reason. People if you like playing a game that is highly pay to win against people that have game time and no mercy for new people and destroy you relentlessly then go ahead and give your best. The freejam developers of this game seem to change and maybe the game will too in direction, hopefully for a better more playable previous version. The catch is if you cannot afford to buy premium and support the game then as far as I can tell the game will not be fun for you. You will be outgunned, out maneuvered, and out classed against ppl that p2w everytime.

However, the game design has gone ways that are just unapealing, unchallanging and quite bothersome to me. I started playing this game because I like building robots, and at the time of me playing, it was the only game I knew about that was of this sort. However, as time went on, I saw other similar games, and I also saw good suggestions for robocraft, not get implemented in game, while bad suggestions and ideas did. Seb, one of the game devs seems to think our negative reviews are jokes, but this just shows you how seriously they take our criticism because its their game and they want to take it the way they want, the way that makes them the most money and scares off the most logical players and makes way for children who have fat wallets for GambleCraft 2.0 open your wallet addition. Well, now they are on damage control and posting fake apologies, but its a bit too little and a bit too late. Dont apologize, fix this game and revert far far back to when it was once a good game. I dont care about all the time you spent on it, you ruined it. You fix the game and you will fix the reviews by doing so. Until than, keep laughing freescam, but if you go out of buisness, dont expect me to not laugh because it was YOUR fault. I dont want you to fail, but you seem dead set on doing so. I could list all the things I hate about how the game went but seb will just say get used to it. https://twitter.com/sebify/status/726373014854615040 #Game dev, FreeScam games oh and dont forget, they will ban you for talking about other games or having valid cricitism on bad updates. http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juvar23/recommended/301520/ What other company do you know of that is that insecure? Hell I cant think of any. Whoops, I talked about how the update is horrible. BAN, Whoops I talked about a game thats better than robocraft, BAN. http://steamcommunity.com/app/301520/discussions/2/364040166681997039/ it also appears the company freejam that puts out robocraft is owned by a mobile gambling game company and freejam owes them over 1 million dollars of debt due in september. http://robocraftgame.com/forums/topic/will-robocraft-be-adversely-affected-because-74-of-freejam-owned-by-hyperion/\n\nI love reading the recent reviews on steam about robocraft and you can easily see how pretty much all recent reviews are negative. The only reason the game still has an overal possitive rating is because the possitive reviews are years old by people who no longer play. I hope you devs have a fun time dealing with bankruptcy.\n\nThere are many bugs, imbalances, and seriously large pet peeves in this Robocraft game for me. You are very limited in what you can build, but other games have much more freedom that are also free. I have recently started playing Machine Craft on steam, I have screen shots of the bots I have made and come in contact with. You can build so complex and so large in that game its like using a megabot x100. You can even build transforming transformers. However, the skill cap is much higher, the game takes much more thought, and the community is much more mature. If this is what you are looking for, try machine craft if you like building. If you like a younger audiance and a very low skill cap, play robocraft. This is a link to Machine Craft. It was recently just released on steam so the community is rather small but when you like it, tell your friends about it and it will grow. Its an amazing game. http://store.steampowered.com/app/397100","May 2","false","112.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigJibblies/recommended/301520/","BigJibblies","IIIStrife","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigJibblies/","206 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nJust any other Free to Play game, you should pick this up for an hour and give it an open-minded go.\n\nIn this game you build a tiny vehicle (I say vehicle, because robots do not require a pilot, because it is esstentially it's own pilot, but vehiclecraft doesn't sound as good, so I'll call it a robo) and then fight using it against other players who have built their own robot.\n\nYou can build whatever you want. If you have the parts, it can be made. I've seen people make literal spider walkers (are usually seen in challenge mode or late into the game, like 80% into it), an smg car shaped like a person, a heavily armored box car, a car only describable as a quad from dune 2000, even a flying ♥♥♥♥♥ that one time.\n\nYou can make jets, hovercrafts, "drones", actual drones, helicopters, tanks, cars, and you can get to the end of the game's current progression to make gigantic versions of these where you can either pit it against tons of smaller, weaker enemies, or fight in a battle filled with giant robos!\n\nI have only gotten 27% into the game, Tier 3, but already I can make hovercraft, cars, tanks, hybrids of either of those and stuff.\n\nThere are indeed weapons, and they all have their own uses and strengths and ways of using them. Indeed, this isn't call of Duty where tons of weapons exist, but all of them in a category all work basically the same.\n\nYou've got 4 weapons. SMGs, Plasma Cannons, Railguns, and Nanotech Disruptor which heal allies and deals damage to enemies in a straight beam.\n\nThe game abides by physics most of the time, so if your robo is not properly made, then you can expect to find problems, luckily there IS a practice mode that has no penalty or reward, filled with enemies you can test your robo against, some of them potentially player-made (THAT NEEDS TO BE A THING IF NOT! <3)\n\nThis game is fun, just... don't get discouraged if some turd with a railgun goes into Tiers 1, 2 or 3. It happens a decent amount even though Tier 5 really should be a cut-off point for tech being below the tier it was meant for (Aka railguns below Tier 4 battles, or Helicopters below Tier 5. Walkers below Tier 7 isn't much of a big deal honestly because they're cool to the point I wished there was a Tier 4 version of them).\n\nyou won't be able to make the robo you want to from the get-go (I personally have an obsession for walkers, sometimes bordering on fetish-territory if you throw on some missile launchers and beam cannons onto it xD).\n\nThe only real downside to the game is the inability to mix and match weapon types. I suppose it helps for balance reasons, but it'd be cool if you could have two weapons at a time. Though then you could have medic guns on railgun planes, which would be a tad unfair.\n\nEach different item has its purpose and use, th only thing that is really much of an exception are the blocks, but they are instrumental in being tough to destroy as without them... well you're not tough to destroy as the original blocks are free for a reason.\n\nSpoiler: They're garbage above Tier 1.\n\nThere's also Electro plates, which are indeed shield technology, but the precursor to it.\n\nFeel free to download this game and give it a try, it's really quite fun! Personally building the robo is my favorite part, let alone actually using it, which is even better.\n\nIt's really fun.\n\nI also give this game a 6/10, which says alot for it's current state. There's not alot of bugs left and the devs have taken time and actually tried in their endeavor to make a great game which has probably very little content in comparison to the finished result, and 0 bugs or glitches pretty much.\n\nPS: This game has support for us OCD buggers who have to symmetry everything in the mirror mode. Press X or map the key in the controls menu under "Build"\n\nHappy Building, and Merry Killing!","February 20, 2015","true","93.2"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","72","28","39","8","0"

First, the tier-flattening from ten tiers down to five. Next, the introduction of weapons other than the original trio (SMG, plasma and rail) and the Nanotech Disruptors, starting with Flak. The introduction of using multiple weapons at once sealed the deal, and this new loot-crate system is just the devs taunting us all. The energy system was strategic, at least for a while, but with the loot crate system's rebalance to all weapons, it's now just "there," as energy runs out either too quickly or too slowly.\n\nThe game is now more of a contest of who can shoot first, between shotgun-mechs and shotgun-hovers, "Tesla trolls" who waste all their energy in one shot and are only efficient in cutting large guns like shotguns and flaks off of enemy mechs, then taking ages to kill them, and railgun-bed mechs who are literally just 9 or so mech legs held together with aero-rods (extended connectors) and coated in railguns.\n\nAnd yet, what do the devs do? They pretend it's the tiering that's the problem, so they get rid of tiering all at once, allowing new players with tiny starter bots to run into hulking colossi lugging around shotguns, missile launchers and flak cannons that promptly one-shot them.\n\nI would post a legitimate review, since the game used to be simple and fun, back when Nanotech Disruptors were introduced, and even before that, but I literally cannot think of any positives for the game now. The gameplay has gotten glitchy and laggy with all the new weapons introduced, and the old weapons have been made either grossly overpowered or grossly underpowered. Armor tiering was removed, along with weapon tiering, so everybody's the exact same. And while you'd think that might help make it more skill-based (the devs sure did,) believe me, it doesn't. The gameplay stayed the exact same in some cases, and got worse in other cases, while we had less and less variety to work with over time.\n\nAnd the "paint" for your bots... having to pay to use the colors that were previously free for everyone to use via different tiers of armor? Low-blow. But, I guess Freejam has gone the path of the greedy dev on this one, since now, with the introduction of the loot crate system, you have to use RNG just to earn money, and the RNG itself is horrific, it doesn't scale with level either so a new player might get parts that are too big for their bots that they'll have to scrap and sell, and scrapping/selling them returns barely any money.\n\nMeanwhile, a high-level player, at the same time, will get those same parts, which are too weak for his usage, and so he has to do three dozen matches and top-score every single one just to get enough "Robits" to buy one Tier 5 leg for his mech, thanks to how bad the RNG is. Meanwhile, both players frequently win Epic and Legendary parts for their bots... but those Epics and Legendaries ALWAYS show up in the "premium row" where you'd have to be paying to get the loot. Eeeeh... maybe it's just a coincidence... you know what? No. No it is not.\n\nWith how the new update works, the monetary gain from fighting in a high-tier match is the same as fighting in a low-tier match, so seal-clubbing is now going to be the game's meta, as high-level players take all their skills and fancy bots against absolute newbies just starting the game, in order for an easy win and top score in order to get the best loot crate available. Meanwhile, the newbies are getting decimated, and most likely will end up quitting within a few days of trying the game.\n\nI could go on and on forever about how Freejam's devs really, really messed this one up, but I'll cut myself off here for now. Let it be said, the only reason for you to play Robocraft now is... well, actually, I can't think of any. Oh well.","May 1","false","559.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

It was my favorite for a long time. Now I am forced to stop playing because the developers are flushing it down a toilet, and I'm not a piece of sh*t so I refuse to follow it on it's downward spiral to the cesspools. If they have some convoluted plan that saves their a$$es in the end, then I may pick it up again and change my review.\n\nI've logged 350 hours in this game and now I think it's time for a review.\n\nNo amount of half-arsed compensation can make up for the loss of the Mega.\nSure, we can sell back all our mega-guns, but what the funk are we going to buy with all that cash? It's not like I can go and use it to build a Mega. Speaking of mega-guns, their presence is entirely useless now that we can't have enough CPU to use them.\n\nThey say the Megas were too big for the maps? I never had an issue ever. If you're going to own a large vehicle, you better be skilled enough to drive it.\n\nAnd what's up with this new Fusion core? Another useless pile of scrap. Now that Mega bots are gone, we don't even need to worry about power consumption. And with the extreme CPU cost it has, there's no worry of having enough guns to eat all your power.\n\nOne possible reason the Mega bots were removed is because whiny children were complaining due to the fact that they DON'T have a mega. It's a case of the Have-Nots attacking the Do-Haves. Also, the Store page's video is now a complete lie of false advertisement due to the removal of the Mega.\n\nThe angry few are louder than the happy masses.\n\n\n\n\nTo the Devs: Please stop smoking crack on the job.

Parts get shot off and it realistically changes the vehicle’s handling. I’ve been left with nothing but one walker leg and used it to claw my way onto the enemy base and win for my team.\nNot pay to win. Real money only unlocks things faster, it doesn’t give any battle advantage\nLots of freedom to mix and match parts to optimize vehicles' handling, speed, damage, and durability in auto-match team games\nMovement: hovercraft, wings, wheels, treads, floating blocks, grippy walker legs, helicopter, skids, thrusters\nWeapons: sniper, artillery, machine gun, energy ram, healing beam (also damages enemies)\nDefense: armor cubes, various plates that absorb some damage without being damaged\nSpecials: radar, radar jammer, radar sharing, rods & beams, headlights\nYour designs really matter. There are tricks- like you can build with voids and layers to protect the core by routing damage on longer paths\nLots of players. Half the fun is seeing what other people build\nGood feeling of progression as you make money and invest it in your library of parts. Tiers went away, but I don’t mind.\nVery active devs who listen to the players and update the game every couple weeks\nGiant megabots. It’s so much fun to be a massive death dealer who shreds all the smaller bots. I’ve also taken a tiny healer with energy rams in so close to a megabot that its giant guns couldn’t focus on me. I burned several off before I guessed where the pilot seat was and tunneled in with the rams to kill it. When that huge thing shattered around me, leaving my tiny tiny bot victorious, it became the best of hundreds of great memories of the game.BadGenerally the anti-cheat works, but sometimes a hack gets through for a few days before a patch fixes it\nThere are glitches and bugs, but they’re minor\nSome adolescent negativity and other nonsense in chat\nThe big one: updates renovate or erase big elements and people complain. In my view the devs take 5 steps forward for every 1 back, and the downvoters are just focussing on the 1. Look how all the negative reviews are from people with hundreds of hours in Robocraft. The truth is they love the game so much that relatively small problems upset them.\nBecause you battle with your own design, embodying your ideas about what’s effective and displaying your style- the battles feel personal. It’s not a fake experience like so many other games where they give you carefully controlled challenges made to be beat. It’s raw and real and chaotic. That’s what I love about it.","August 27, 2015","true","491.6"," 86 of 143 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","86","143","8","6"

I have played this game since it was awarded indie game of the year, and might I say props to you for accomplishing that. That said, there are a few things that need to be taken into account:\n\nBalance:\nThe game is EXTREMELY unbalanced, the auto lock on missiles are very hard to dodge and are expensive(more on this later) and now the timer has been dropped from taking 2.5 seconds to lock on, to 2 seconds. Not only is this devastating but the main weapons of the game: plasma cannons, and plasma lasers have taken some nerfs. Lasers have reduced fire rate and plasma cannons increase power consumption. This creates a huge divide from the premium users that paid money to get the missiles easily and the basic players who can only afford one laser of a high tier.\n\nEnd game rewards (and money issues in general):\nI consider myself to not be at the end game, but close to it. My weapons have gotten quite expensive as of late. To list off a few:\nTop laser disintegrator: 959,549\nPlasma devastator: 1,107,169\nDisc Shield: 10,876,430\nBlink Module: 10,507,740\nAeroflak Cannon: 11,071,688\nLock-on Missile Launcher: 10,149,047Now, this list wouldn’t be too bad, if the payoff was about 60,000~, 80,000~ with premium users in the game. Now, understandably it is frustrating that the most I can get in a game is 110,000~ with a first win of the day bonus and premium users. So, all in all you are required to play approximately 126.86~ games to acquire 1 lock-on missile launcher, let me emphasis this ONE LOCK-ON MISSILE LAUNCHER, and in order to be any use to your team, you’re going to want to pack at least 2 of them, making the amount of games you need to play skyrocket to 252~. This is unbelievable and give NO incentive whatsoever to grind out the game for the RP.\nI can hear it now, how can I play this game if it takes so long to get something. Easy enough, you just have to pay real life money to obtain all of these weapons, problem solved. For translation it costs you 2,300GC for 1 missile launcher, that would approximate putting $2.50(and a little more to get 50 more GC) and to get two of them you need $5.00 for it. Doesn’t seem like a lot, but this is a “FREE TO PLAY GAME” Why then would you make the game free and then choose to make the game SUCH A HUGE GRIND that you cannot even begin to reach end game content without going past a pay wall or dedicating hours upon hours to a game.\nAdditional premium content:\nOn a side note, I have noticed that glass now costs GC to purchase, no RP method. The three principles upon which this game is built upon is “build, drive, fight” can you drive? Yes. Can you fight? Yes, now building on the other hand. Building has been limited in the terms of glass. Glass used to be a fun cool block that you can use in your vehicle to have, which is now gone, banished behind pay wall.\nThings they did well at:\nFun and amazing gameplay\nLarge variety of game modes to choose from\nRoboshop to help you get a ship if you suck at creativity\nHave more than 3 bays for free\nTesting area\nGaining RP for testing your ship against bots (although it is minuscule)I will update my review as major parts of the game are tweaked, but at the moment if given the chance to rate the game at its current state, I would give it a 4/10. This game is below average, it can perform meh compared to most free-to-play Minecraft cube copy games. However, the game still needs LARGE improvements before it can be considered a game to play.\n","March 8","false","87.3"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","26","36","0","0"

I do agree with some of these arguements...\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nThis game is still absolutely fantastic. To those complaining about the gamemodes being locked to lower levels: The Team Deathmatch gamemode, in which you have only one life, will only help the lower levels learn more strategies than in Battle Arena, where you have endless lives and can just rush headfirst into battle, rather than sticking together and positioning yourselves according to your weaponry and armor. I also like the leveling system a lot more, because it is not nearly as tedious as the previous method of having to go through each unlockable with barely enough Tech Points and then realizing that you need to go back and get tech points from a previous tier, meaning that you would need to downgrade your bots. People argue that the old leveling system was harder and thus more fun, but it wasn't harder. It was tedious. There is a difference.\n\nTo sum it up: At least try this game. I think it is brilliant. If you don't like it, then that's okay, because it's free. Just delete it.\n\nAnd to everyone that I can guaruntee will be ♥♥♥♥♥ing about me only liking the new leveling system because I'm a low level noob:    ♥♥♥♥ off. I'm level 74.\n\nEDIT: So... the most recent update obliterated the main arguments of most complainers: the gamemodes are no longer locked!

At first glance it looks like it could have all sorts of possibilities for crazy vehicles and constructions, but due to the very limited number of origional parts, all vehicles are basically a bunch of cubes with guns stuck on them and some wheels or jets. There are many parts you can buy, but they are all just the same parts made slightly better. The list of parts is, currently, as follows: structural blocks, (including square and angled bits,) wheels, jets, hover jets, flotation blocks, wings, armour plates, and three types of guns; basic slowish shot, lobbed shot, slow long range shot. Most of these parts, namely everything but the blocks, wheels and basic gun, is locked when you start, so to actually build anything besides a box with wheels and a bunch of guns tacked onto it you will have to either pay hard cash for them or put in many hours of play.\nOn top of all that, the only workable design for a vehicle seems to be your command seat surrounded by as much mass as you can pile around it, and as many guns as you can fit on the top and sides, because there is no strategy to the game other than drive toward the enemy and hope you can shoot more than he can.\n\nTo conclude this rambling, I would not reccomend this game in the least.

It would be fine if you got all of the items from the crates. You only get half of whats in them and what you do get isnt the most rare things no you 1 or 2 of the rarer good stuff while the locked stuff is the insanely good item locked to premium users. You get 1 crate per battle based on how you do. so a good player get the best crate but gets the loot of the worst crate. their half-hearted attempt to keep free players is the robits. where you scrap all the annoying crap they give you and 1/5 of what its worth. So your 1000 robit cost to forge "uncommon" rocket give 200 robits its flawed and trown together with zero attempt to fix.

I am not the only one experiencing this issue, and as far as I can tell, reports go back as far as two to three weeks ago with no answer from the developers or staff in any thread other than "Don't bump threads". The official respons I got from a support ticket is recreated below:\n\n"Hi,\n\nThanks for contacting Freejam Support!\n\nThis is an issue we are aware of and one we are currently working to fix as soon as possible.You should make sure to check the patch notes of our next update as information on bug fixes will be displayed there.\n\nThank you for your continued support and patience and we apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused.\n\nThanks again,\n\nDanSupportJammer"\n\nBelow is my review of the game at this point. I have tried to remain as un-biased as possible with respect to the crash problem I mentioned earlier.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nRobocraft used to be a game about building robots and fighting to the death. It used to emphasize builder skill and fighting tactics like recognizing the weak points on your opponents robot.\n\nUsed to.\n\nThe game now heavily focus on a MOBA style game mode without minions where teams of 8-12 players capture towers across the map. Each tower captured increases their weapons effectiveness against capturing other towers and damaging the opposing team's main reactor. If your team captures all three towers, the enemy's shield around their reactor goes down. If your shield goes down, you can no longer heal when in close proximity of the reactor, and must instead avoid enemy fire to heal automatically.\n\nI built a quick robot that can capture a tower solo in the mid to late game in 5 seconds, and I can easily solo the enemy's reactor if their shild is down in the late game in under 30 seconds. If you are on a team that knows how to capture towers quickly then the game will be over quickly, you will get a decent reward, and you can continue grinding. If however your team doesn't know what they're doing, frequently splits up, and suicides into huge balls of enemies while the other team knows how to quickly captures towers, your life will be miserable. You will get only up to the third lowest quality crate if you are top on the losing team.\n\nThere are other game modes, currently a team-death-match and free for all, but rewards for players in this game mode are so small that it really isn't worth it unless you already have most of the functional parts.\n\nNotice that I said "if you already have the parts". You are not rewarded with currency in this game unlike most other online games. Instead, at the end of a match, you are rewarded with a crate containing one or more random items ranging from armor and cosmetics to weapons and functional parts. The better you do, the better the parts you will recieve (supposedly). Players who pay for the premium boost get twice as many items, but do not have a higher chance at getting **better** items as far as I can tell. Items can be broken down into "Robits" that can then be used to craft parts that the player wants.\n\nUnfortunately, this move has massively inflated the currency used by players. Under the old system, sell-back value was exactly half that of the cost to purchase a part, and players were rewarded with currency directly. Under the new system, almost all parts are recycled into a measly 1/10 that of the price to buy a part, effectively increasing the time required to grind out the robits needed to purchase the parts you want by at least 10 times (this ignores the fact that you **may** get the parts you want in a random crate drop, but in my experience, the system likes to give you 10-50 cubes instead which decompose into one robit each)\n\nSupposedly, this has been improved a lot over the past week, however as I mentioned before, I am unable to verify as I cannot play the game currently due to crashes.\n\nThis game is littered with technical problems. Players getting under the map, weapons that sometimes fire and sometimes don't, special modules sometimes crashing the game for players, graphical glitches, and horrible de-sync errors which cause everyone to stop moving to your perspective. In this de-sync'd state you can still damage the enemy a little, but as far as the game is concerned you have disgraced your team and quit, thus you get no reward and are even punished for "leaving" early if you were playing the moba game mode, which is very frustrating. Tech support swears that this is due to a misconfigured MTU setting on your router, but numerous players can testify otherwise.\n\nFurthermore, the developers seem to have no sense of direction. Sweeping change after sweeping change, they keep steamrolling on ahead implementing new features, weapons, and game modes, and completely changing many critical core mechanics, forcing the players to adapt rapidly. This game uses the "alpha" and "early access" moniker as a massive crutch to hide behind the litany of issues and bugs the developers leave in their wake. The community technical support forum is a ghost town, players reporting critical issues have their threads relocated there to never be responded to by any developer or staff member. This is sad really.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend the game in its current state. Too much has changed, and it feels like FreeJam are only listening to new players while shoving their fingers in their ears and ignoring the rest of the community.\n\nSadly, this remindes me of a game I used to play: Battlefield Heroes by Dice / EA. Shortly before the open beta started, the developers completely re-worked the way rewards worked, massivly inflating the currency so that any player who wanted to progress at anything better than a sloth's pace was forced to spend money. The community split in two, and many players never returned. I hope this game does not face a similar fate...","May 18","false","195.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

Look at the good reviews and their play time. I gaurantee not a one is over 100 hours or even close to it most are 40hours or less. So don't be fooled by fake reviews that developers make and sit in the game for a day or a few hours then use to boost recent reviews.\nOr people like I said haven't played long enough to give a fair review. You can tell they are usually 1 liners.\nEverything shown in the video above is no longer. They have taken the game and twisted it into something horrible .\nI have been with this game from the start and every update has been worse then the previous.  Also every update has added more bugs which they will never fix.\nMost of my play time has been through their launcher But you can see. I still have a decent amount of time shown through steam launcher.\nIf you play this game now and think it is enjoyable, Then there is something either seriously wrong with you or you have never played it before.\nThe game play itself has been destroyed. there are only 4 viable Weapon options now. You used to be able to have any weapon combo and be a viable bot . Not anymore most weapons have been changed to the point they are useless. Most things they still have in the game are pretty much useless now like shields, triforcing etc. you used to move up in level and have it mean something and have better bots and better weapons.\nIf you think that the game play will change as you go up in level  now,think again. It does not any longer.\nThe game play will be the same from start level 1-level 150. It means nothing.\nI tell you this Most Vets of the Game like myself are gone. We refuse to play anymore. the Game has become that bad.\nIt used to be fun it used to be a challenge it used to be about teamwork and strategy. Now it is about kill stealing and rushing in to do as much damage as you can before being killed.\nThe crates and everything done in these last updates have been a disgrace to everything in the Gaming world.\nThe Devs are just greedy and praying on the youth and the stupid.\nPlay if you still want too, But I urge you not to give them any real money.\nTrust me when I say this if they don't keep giving out gimmicks every week the game will DIE.\nSteam charts show higher peaks , but they are slowly becoming pre-update average, but here is what they really show and you should look at these numbers the non peak times show an all time low. there used to be a average of 3,000-4,000 now it is 2,000-2,500.\nSure the peak times make the lower average equal out to seem high.\nbut that is only because of the gimmicks. When they go so will the player base and then shortly after the game itself.\nI say good riddance to Horrible developers. They took what was once a great concept  destroyed it and twisted the entire thing into a cash grab.\nI Plead once again,\nPLAY THE GAME IF YOU WANT,  JUST DON"T GIVE THEM MONEY.","May 21","false","989.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

New players are put at the mercy of the RNG System and they will be forced to fight against Seal clubbing Micro bots that move at blinding speeds. I've been playing since 2014 but This is where the train stops. since the beginning of the year the Devs have done nothing but break the game. They say it's to make the game into a horizonal progression system like LOL, They Scrapped The Linear progression that had decent matchmaking. and opted to make the game into something that it wasn't. The Match Making is Cancer.\n\nWhatever You do, Don't fund these devs until they admit they Screwed up, and make things right.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Due to recent events, the match has been lite and the bridge is burnt. I hope for a merciful death of this game.\nSEB who is one of the developers tweeted "Boring reviews on steam by who doesn't accept meta changes.

Before the update, you were given an amount of in-game currency dependent on how high your score was, independent of if you were at the top of the leaderboard. Now you get "crates" with random drops and most of the time those drops are either white for common or green for uncommon. There are 8 different items in most crates except for the lowest tier which is only 2, but unless you pay for premium you only get half of those items and the other half of them are there for "incentive." The worst part of it though is you only get 1 of each item unless it is a building block, so to reach your "nominal" counts for maximum dps and redundancy, you have to get very lucky and get the exact same part multiple times. Sure you could trade in some of the parts you don't want for the new currency, except that you only get 1/4 or less (many even down to 1/10th) of the value making it very pointless to trade anything in unless you have 20 of them and you want 2 more of something else in the same tier.\n\nAnd oh how the reward system got screwed over. Now after a match, you are given a crate based on how far up you are on the leaderboard, but only for the winning team. Only the top person gets the top tier crate, and it filters down from there. If you were the top player on the loosing team, too bad, you get the second to last tier crate like the rest of your team. No matter how well you play, if your team loses, you don't get a good reward. The funny thing is, while they state that the higher the crate tier, the higher the likelyhood you will get better parts, it seems the difference is negligible. You are better off getting many lower tier crates than one top tier, because you can still get anything from uncommon and up in the top tier.\n\nAlong with not being able to build anything unless you had the parts pre-update, the new weapons along with the "flattening" made the top tier and new weapons about all that is useable. Unless you get lucky and pull one of the top tier weapons out of a crate, you better be running a lot of rails to deal with the people who have got those items. I say rails because nothing else does enough damage fast enough and in one spot to take out top teir weapons without having to be directly on top of your opponents. You better hope that you get a lot of them as well, because for the lowest tier you need 9 of them to reach nominal count. Speaking of nominal counts and why rails are the only viable non-top tier weapon, some of the other lowest tier weapons have a nominal count of 14! That means you have to make room for 14 individual guns that have to have space to move and can't be blocked. Lets take an example of what you would have to do to get the rail though: if you want a second tier rail setup, you have to get very lucky on your drops 8 times. You won't be able to buy them, because you would have to sell 220 of the lowest tier machine guns to get the 17,600 to make 8 second tier rails.\n\nI joined before the Epic Loot update, and managed to get to level 25 before it happened. I enjoyed the game previously, but since the update I have seen no reason to keep playing, let alone pay for premium! I was lucky and had some tier 1 rails before the update but they are noticeably lacking in firepower. For new palyers I would suggest waiting until they do some serious work on the loot system or decide to change it back.\n\nAn interesting side note if you made it this far, check all the recent reviews. As of 5/20/16 the recent reviews are mostly negative with only 38% being positive out of 4,354 user reviews. FreeJam (the people who made this game) have stated that the general feedback has been mostly positive since the update. A quick scroll through the most recent reviews shows that many of the negative feedback involves at least a paragraph or more, while almost every positive review is a few words or an occasional sentence. The few exceptions in the positive reviews are people complaining about many of the same thing as the negative reviews, namely that if they are going to keep the random loot feature it needs work.\n\nNot one to complain and never offer any suggestions, the best I have seen and come up with are as follows:\n-Increase the excange rate and preferably make it flat across the board.\nSomething like 50% would be nice since they have stated they aren't bringing back "currency."\n-Allow for exchanging items for the same thing of the other side, such as left and right shields.\nFor when you have 8 left shields and only 1 right.\n-Instead of having completely spearate items for premium, double up on what non-premium gets.\nStill good incentive for premium, not as degrading to those who don't have the money for it.\n-Rebalance weapons to bring back the usefullness of the machine guns and the morter rounds.\nIf all you have are long range rails on spider legs, shotguns on hovercraft, and missiles on\nhelicopters, it defeats the purpose of being able to build what you want.","May 19","false","40.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I am not the only one experiencing this issue, and as far as I can tell, reports go back as far as two to three weeks ago with no answer from the developers or staff in any thread other than "Don't bump threads". The official respons I got from a support ticket is recreated below:\n\n"Hi,\n\nThanks for contacting Freejam Support!\n\nThis is an issue we are aware of and one we are currently working to fix as soon as possible.You should make sure to check the patch notes of our next update as information on bug fixes will be displayed there.\n\nThank you for your continued support and patience and we apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused.\n\nThanks again,\n\nDanSupportJammer"\n\nBelow is my review of the game at this point. I have tried to remain as un-biased as possible with respect to the crash problem I mentioned earlier.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nRobocraft used to be a game about building robots and fighting to the death. It used to emphasize builder skill and fighting tactics like recognizing the weak points on your opponents robot.\n\nUsed to.\n\nThe game now heavily focus on a MOBA style game mode without minions where teams of 8-12 players capture towers across the map. Each tower captured increases their weapons effectiveness against capturing other towers and damaging the opposing team's main reactor. If your team captures all three towers, the enemy's shield around their reactor goes down. If your shield goes down, you can no longer heal when in close proximity of the reactor, and must instead avoid enemy fire to heal automatically.\n\nI built a quick robot that can capture a tower solo in the mid to late game in 5 seconds, and I can easily solo the enemy's reactor if their shild is down in the late game in under 30 seconds. If you are on a team that knows how to capture towers quickly then the game will be over quickly, you will get a decent reward, and you can continue grinding. If however your team doesn't know what they're doing, frequently splits up, and suicides into huge balls of enemies while the other team knows how to quickly captures towers, your life will be miserable. You will get only up to the third lowest quality crate if you are top on the losing team.\n\nThere are other game modes, currently a team-death-match and free for all, but rewards for players in this game mode are so small that it really isn't worth it unless you already have most of the functional parts.\n\nNotice that I said "if you already have the parts". You are not rewarded with currency in this game unlike most other online games. Instead, at the end of a match, you are rewarded with a crate containing one or more random items ranging from armor and cosmetics to weapons and functional parts. The better you do, the better the parts you will recieve (supposedly). Players who pay for the premium boost get twice as many items, but do not have a higher chance at getting **better** items as far as I can tell. Items can be broken down into "Robits" that can then be used to craft parts that the player wants.\n\nUnfortunately, this move has massively inflated the currency used by players. Under the old system, sell-back value was exactly half that of the cost to purchase a part, and players were rewarded with currency directly. Under the new system, almost all parts are recycled into a measly 1/10 that of the price to buy a part, effectively increasing the time required to grind out the robits needed to purchase the parts you want by at least 10 times (this ignores the fact that you **may** get the parts you want in a random crate drop, but in my experience, the system likes to give you 10-50 cubes instead which decompose into one robit each)\n\nSupposedly, this has been improved a lot over the past week, however as I mentioned before, I am unable to verify as I cannot play the game currently due to crashes.\n\nThis game is littered with technical problems. Players getting under the map, weapons that sometimes fire and sometimes don't, special modules sometimes crashing the game for players, graphical glitches, and horrible de-sync errors which cause everyone to stop moving to your perspective. In this de-sync'd state you can still damage the enemy a little, but as far as the game is concerned you have disgraced your team and quit, thus you get no reward and are even punished for "leaving" early if you were playing the moba game mode, which is very frustrating. Tech support swears that this is due to a misconfigured MTU setting on your router, but numerous players can testify otherwise.\n\nFurthermore, the developers seem to have no sense of direction. Sweeping change after sweeping change, they keep steamrolling on ahead implementing new features, weapons, and game modes, and completely changing many critical core mechanics, forcing the players to adapt rapidly. This game uses the "alpha" and "early access" moniker as a massive crutch to hide behind the litany of issues and bugs the developers leave in their wake. The community technical support forum is a ghost town, players reporting critical issues have their threads relocated there to never be responded to by any developer or staff member. This is sad really.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend the game in its current state. Too much has changed, and it feels like FreeJam are only listening to new players while shoving their fingers in their ears and ignoring the rest of the community.\n\nSadly, this remindes me of a game I used to play: Battlefield Heroes by Dice / EA. Shortly before the open beta started, the developers completely re-worked the way rewards worked, massivly inflating the currency so that any player who wanted to progress at anything better than a sloth's pace was forced to spend money. The community split in two, and many players never returned. I hope this game does not face a similar fate...","May 18","false","195.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

When I first started playing robocraft, it was fantastic. There was good progression, each battle rewarded you in accordance with your performance, and you could be very creative with your builds.This was because you could buy whatever you needed either with in-game currency from good performance or with cash it the mood struck you. There was no pressure to buy, and premium was so inexpensive that I didn't blink an eye at paying for it each day I actually played Robocraft.\nThen all that changed. Now the game is a diceroll. I have received top score protonium crates dozens of times only to be handed cosmetic and useless items. The items are just as useless to sell, and so unless the dice smile upon you, your performance and rank are meaningless and you remain stuck with the equipement you have. It is a testament to the crappiness of this update that most of the equipment on my robot predates the update. I haven't been able to get anything better.\nConstant messages are released by the developper about how they're ensuring better quality items are dropped. They're clearly not trying very hard as the stream of sewage (green "uncommon" items) continues. It is becoming hard to view this as anything other than a pay-to-win cash grab.\nI'm trying to hang in there, but I'm nearly done with it.

I was lucky and had some tier 1 rails before the update but they are noticeably lacking in firepower. For new palyers I would suggest waiting until they do some serious work on the loot system or decide to change it back.\n\nAn interesting side note if you made it this far, check all the recent reviews. As of 5/20/16 the recent reviews are mostly negative with only 38% being positive out of 4,354 user reviews. FreeJam (the people who made this game) have stated that the general feedback has been mostly positive since the update. A quick scroll through the most recent reviews shows that many of the negative feedback involves at least a paragraph or more, while almost every positive review is a few words or an occasional sentence. The few exceptions in the positive reviews are people complaining about many of the same thing as the negative reviews, namely that if they are going to keep the random loot feature it needs work.\n\nNot one to complain and never offer any suggestions, the best I have seen and come up with are as follows:\n-Increase the excange rate and preferably make it flat across the board.\nSomething like 50% would be nice since they have stated they aren't bringing back "currency."\n-Allow for exchanging items for the same thing of the other side, such as left and right shields.\nFor when you have 8 left shields and only 1 right.\n-Instead of having completely spearate items for premium, double up on what non-premium gets.\nStill good incentive for premium, not as degrading to those who don't have the money for it.\n-Rebalance weapons to bring back the usefullness of the machine guns and the morter rounds.\nIf all you have are long range rails on spider legs, shotguns on hovercraft, and missiles on\nhelicopters, it defeats the purpose of being able to build what you want.","May 19","false","40.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I am not the only one experiencing this issue, and as far as I can tell, reports go back as far as two to three weeks ago with no answer from the developers or staff in any thread other than "Don't bump threads". The official respons I got from a support ticket is recreated below:\n\n"Hi,\n\nThanks for contacting Freejam Support!\n\nThis is an issue we are aware of and one we are currently working to fix as soon as possible.You should make sure to check the patch notes of our next update as information on bug fixes will be displayed there.\n\nThank you for your continued support and patience and we apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused.\n\nThanks again,\n\nDanSupportJammer"\n\nBelow is my review of the game at this point. I have tried to remain as un-biased as possible with respect to the crash problem I mentioned earlier.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nRobocraft used to be a game about building robots and fighting to the death. It used to emphasize builder skill and fighting tactics like recognizing the weak points on your opponents robot.\n\nUsed to.\n\nThe game now heavily focus on a MOBA style game mode without minions where teams of 8-12 players capture towers across the map. Each tower captured increases their weapons effectiveness against capturing other towers and damaging the opposing team's main reactor. If your team captures all three towers, the enemy's shield around their reactor goes down. If your shield goes down, you can no longer heal when in close proximity of the reactor, and must instead avoid enemy fire to heal automatically.\n\nI built a quick robot that can capture a tower solo in the mid to late game in 5 seconds, and I can easily solo the enemy's reactor if their shild is down in the late game in under 30 seconds. If you are on a team that knows how to capture towers quickly then the game will be over quickly, you will get a decent reward, and you can continue grinding. If however your team doesn't know what they're doing, frequently splits up, and suicides into huge balls of enemies while the other team knows how to quickly captures towers, your life will be miserable. You will get only up to the third lowest quality crate if you are top on the losing team.\n\nThere are other game modes, currently a team-death-match and free for all, but rewards for players in this game mode are so small that it really isn't worth it unless you already have most of the functional parts.\n\nNotice that I said "if you already have the parts". You are not rewarded with currency in this game unlike most other online games. Instead, at the end of a match, you are rewarded with a crate containing one or more random items ranging from armor and cosmetics to weapons and functional parts. The better you do, the better the parts you will recieve (supposedly). Players who pay for the premium boost get twice as many items, but do not have a higher chance at getting **better** items as far as I can tell. Items can be broken down into "Robits" that can then be used to craft parts that the player wants.\n\nUnfortunately, this move has massively inflated the currency used by players. Under the old system, sell-back value was exactly half that of the cost to purchase a part, and players were rewarded with currency directly. Under the new system, almost all parts are recycled into a measly 1/10 that of the price to buy a part, effectively increasing the time required to grind out the robits needed to purchase the parts you want by at least 10 times (this ignores the fact that you **may** get the parts you want in a random crate drop, but in my experience, the system likes to give you 10-50 cubes instead which decompose into one robit each)\n\nSupposedly, this has been improved a lot over the past week, however as I mentioned before, I am unable to verify as I cannot play the game currently due to crashes.\n\nThis game is littered with technical problems. Players getting under the map, weapons that sometimes fire and sometimes don't, special modules sometimes crashing the game for players, graphical glitches, and horrible de-sync errors which cause everyone to stop moving to your perspective. In this de-sync'd state you can still damage the enemy a little, but as far as the game is concerned you have disgraced your team and quit, thus you get no reward and are even punished for "leaving" early if you were playing the moba game mode, which is very frustrating. Tech support swears that this is due to a misconfigured MTU setting on your router, but numerous players can testify otherwise.\n\nFurthermore, the developers seem to have no sense of direction. Sweeping change after sweeping change, they keep steamrolling on ahead implementing new features, weapons, and game modes, and completely changing many critical core mechanics, forcing the players to adapt rapidly. This game uses the "alpha" and "early access" moniker as a massive crutch to hide behind the litany of issues and bugs the developers leave in their wake. The community technical support forum is a ghost town, players reporting critical issues have their threads relocated there to never be responded to by any developer or staff member. This is sad really.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend the game in its current state. Too much has changed, and it feels like FreeJam are only listening to new players while shoving their fingers in their ears and ignoring the rest of the community.\n\nSadly, this remindes me of a game I used to play: Battlefield Heroes by Dice / EA. Shortly before the open beta started, the developers completely re-worked the way rewards worked, massivly inflating the currency so that any player who wanted to progress at anything better than a sloth's pace was forced to spend money. The community split in two, and many players never returned. I hope this game does not face a similar fate...","May 18","false","195.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

I was very excited to put life into robot ideas I had and to even test them in battle against other player's ideas.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nEven after all the crates, despite being Protonium most of the time, I have only received a single Legendary, it wasn't even the one I wanted. To get the two I wanted, I have to recycle around ~80% of what I earned, still barely reaching the price tag as either the recycle rate is far too low, or the prices of modules are far too high.\n\nAs a result, I was never really able to create any of the robots I had originally wanted to make, and the only way to achieve that goal now, is to mindlessly gamble my way there.\n\nThe crate system is also, at this point in time, not very well implemented. It only gives crates depending on your position on the team, whether or not you lose. It's very random in the loot it gives and that alone ruins Robocraft for me. It's just too unpredictable, and very hard to get the specific modules you want, and you're forced to deal with that because it's just how the economy was changed. Oh how I wish I experienced the only economy with RP and GC.\n\nAs Reddit User visorakkal said cleverly, "Freejam should change their salaries to a loot-based system and see how that works out. You no longer get a paycheck, you now get random groceries and clothing. Ooh, you got a car door this week, neat!"\n\nI really hope this game gets back on its feet, because right now, it's like wrestling a pig in mud. You spend hours and hours trying to (get what you want through the loot) wrestle the pig in the mud, hoping to (get the parts you actually want) defeat it, only to find out (FreeJam is thriving on the fact that you're still playing) the pig likes it.","May 16","false","151.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

This is a shame. It's against any possible fair play logic. A shameful milestone for Steam and online multiplayer games as well...\n\nLong version:\nBesides the amazing sound and the perfectly fit graphic here is one of the many (and really, the most shameful one) reasons you should not play this game:\n\nAfter 2 years of playing, hoping for the best and supporting the game for a while, in the usual attempt to "mimic moba" they have introduced a 5vs5 mode, but guess what:\n\nIn order to play in full team you have to pay. yes, you got it right. you have to pay for having a full team and stomp on random people, matched for you by their long term broken matchmaker.\n\nThey will come to you with any possible excuse like "we are cheaper than others" or "you need just 1 player to pay [for having the chance to stomp on pubs]", but in the end that's what all is about. They will also flood the forum with promises and projects they will not stick to, defended by a horde of kids that will spawn endless "stfu we are in alpha" messages.\n\nIt really sets a milestone in the multiplayer games. the most unfair one.\n\nBack when games development wasn't purely based on greed we called this "pub bashing" and that was the lamest thing a team could do. In robocraft you can pay for bashing pubs, it's perfectly allowed and even promoted by the game itself.\n\nIt puts every kind of real cooperation, competition, strategy and fair multiplayer whatsoever behind a paywall.\n\nThe crate system was already a huge drawback for a game that proposed itself as an innovative building one. Turning it into a loot/gamble hell and removing any real decision on the items to buy with in-game points... if you don't want to wait for a couple of months of grinding for getting some (oh, you can of course rise the chances with real money...). But hey, there are people who like these kind of games, so whatever...\n\nNow they reach the bottom. After the additional paying slot for platoons, they offer paying full team bashing.\n\nMany things have been proposed by the community, like private servers and many suggestions have been made about fair games, custom games and tournaments but they got no clue of what fair and balanced gaming is about except for every possible way to get an income from that.\n\nThere are 2 ways:\n1 make an amazing product that everyone loves, supports and buys. This was the original project.\n2 put candies for kids behind a paywall. This is Freejam way.\n\nIf you had any hope about this company forget about it and move on.","June 3","false","983.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","2"

But I beg to differ: sure during the early game, everyone is trying to shoot each other with only five second respawns - which is quite understandable - but when you get to the higher OC level, respawns are longer making players think about their actions as much as if they were just in the old gamemode. And the towers serve as a pivot to where you launch attacks from and use them strategically to get in a wave of spawns and vice versa preventing the enemy from spawning in for as long as possibe.\n\nThe shields definitely was a different mechanic where it endorses players to take the towers to stop the enemy from retreating and to prevent protonium bombing due to the enemy having a distinct advantage due to heals and short respawn times in the early game.\n\nNow for my opinion. This game is, as what I learned, quite an addicting game giving the player to explore the giant possibilities of creating what ever the heck they want, and eventualy find their niche on what type of vehicle they like the most; I prefer heavy bombers. And that is what makes games fun.\n\nAnd the balance is very methodical as the tier system dictates what type of things you could have at a given time within the rank. You could have powerful weapons, but sacrafice getting one shotted due to you having to use T1 blocks in a T3 environment. And that gives the player the freedom to go to what tiers they want to play in when reaching a higher rank. Of course you cannont immediately jump in and reach TX-1 due to level caps and grinding.\n\nWhen you start everything is, technically, available to you needing tech points to unlock. But there isn't a mean of "buying" tech points or cash as the devs have done an amazing job keeping it that way, and the only thing you can buy are pure cosmetics or pre-built bots. So everyone is on the same boat.\n\nAnd you can still play the old gamemode, by the way.\n\nEdit: After playing in the T1s, I can see why. Have no worry, because you get shields and towers in the later tiers.","May 11, 2015","true","78.8"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","28","40","4","0"

Everything was originally just a deathmatch with no respawning.  Now it has mini-bases that you must destroy and claim as your own, which then strengthens your main base or something...  I don't know exactly how it works but the point is that if you find the new mode too complicated, you can still go back to the original deathmatch mode.  Everything you see and hear from the trailers above can give you an idea about how it works, with you building your own war machines and stuff, so I won't waste your time.  Really the only downside to this game is the long waiting times to get into a match recently now that so many people are on at once, but I'm sure that will be fixed soon enough.

Now you receive random loot instead of money after a match. This pretty much meant you will spend most of your time grinding aimlessly for poor 25% Robits(It is equivalent to Hearthstone dust) rate to get parts you want. Any building is also now limited to one robot as you cannot use one part in multiple builds, I scrapped all my robots from pre-update to buy half of weapons for my main one. It wasn't big problem when your limiter was your level but now it is Hearthstone where you can only use your legendary card in only one deck.\n\nOn top of that now you can encounter people who got lucky and got much better legendary weapons in their crates, which pretty much makes this game p2w as you can get better than other players using money. Before you were matched against people with same level and all of you had same weapons, now inequality in equipment are absolutely huge.\n\nOn top of that there are still problems like rail guns being pretty much anti-fun.","May 17","false","34.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

But learning to adapt and change your robot design is what ive found to be most enjoyable, its not about throwing some wheels and weapons on some blocks going into battle, failing and raging. Take your time to think about your designs, build a fighting machine that is attuned to your own play style and tactics.\n\nThis game has suffered from becoming very popular very quickly, the devs have had to deal with rapid growth in player base, they have had to grow every aspect of their business, and with such growth there are bound to be issues.

Do not even download this.. it's a small download, but the game is not even worth the 5 minutes it takes. The devs do not care about what the playerbase wants, they are shifting to p2w style, everyone is objecting, the artwork, screenshots, discussion, everything.. everyone is shouting "STOP FREEJAM!"\nBut do they care? No. They keep slapping us in the face with terrible updates that destroy the game bit by bit. Most robocraft veterans that have been with the game since the start are leaving the game because of what it has become recently. Robocraft has become a disgrace to the gaming community. They started off unique and fun in every way possible, but now it's a smouldering pile of dirty diapers. Now I am debating.. after all the hours i put into this.. I have heavily considered leaving. Everytime an update comes i get my hopes up thinking maybe Freejam did something right for once. But every singe time i am dissapointed and that makes me very upset to know that this game will never improve, it will only get worse until FreeJam kills its own game because of a crazed quest for MORE money.","May 19","false","522.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

It's good and all but you want more parts? Level up!\n\nOR if you're a rich person who likes to throw away money and waste the game, Pay for premium!\n\nWith Premium you get to instantly play the game and fund for the devs to keep making it worse!\nAnd what's more better than that!?\n\nNow for actual game it's good but it's utterly ruined by the massive "pay to win!" Aspect.\n\nI like it kind of but.\nWhy am I paying to keep up and get better. Why do people get to do this.\nAnd why isn't premium forever?\n\nYou have to pay monthly? No ♥♥♥♥ that! That's a huge scam in on its own!\n\nI suggest you play a bit of offline mode first before online. The devs tried to be funny. Yet their AI craft goes against guidline... With crafts that have add ons like "girl with boobs mk1"\n\nOverall I don't know what to say the game seems pay to win but if you feel like dedicating hours and hours into offline mode to level up and get better. Well that's your choice.\n\nEdit\nare you f*cking serious!?\nThey replaced the g*ddamn currency system with CRATES? WELL HOLY F*CK. F*CK PROGRESSION.

Does this game look like borderlands!? Nah. Cut the sh*t with unboxing.\n\nNot to mention if you're wondering what the currency system did, it let you buy parts and actually advance in the game. Loot? That's just a cash grab because you can always buy things with  Premium . That's right.

You had a pilot seat which was the critical block to defend, rewarding good robot designs which defended this weak point. Your robot was limited to a single type of gun, prompting robots to perform specific roles and fill specific niches, encouraging teamwork. There wasn't auto regenerating health, requiring you to fight strategically and making medics meaningful.\n\nNow, you charge into the enemy with wild abandon, doing as much damage as you can in order to score points. Then, when you're low on health, you take cover for 15 seconds and recover to full health. There is no higher strategy. You do as much damage as you can as fast as you can. If you aren't doing damage, the point system won't reward you, and you'll drop in ranking. But most aggregious of all, even if you win, if you're not in the top half of the score board, you'll drop rank. So even if you're fulfilling an intergral role to the team that leads to their victor, if you aren't doing something the point system recognizes, you will be penalized and lose rank.\n\nThis game puts the cart before the horse, prioritizing monetization over fun and getting rid of depth in order to make the game more accessible to a wider market. However, most insulting of all is the Devs' attitude. They simply ignore any feedback from the forums, leaving their mods to silence anyone who steps out of line.","May 17","false","245.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

The Epic Loot update made it virtually impossible to get the robot parts you need to finish your robot, as everything is based on random drops.

If you are familiar with the many pay-to-win smartphone games out there, you will find the current Robocraft very familiar.\n\nOne big down side of this change is that it cripples the original vision of being able to design creative vehicles. The nature of the random loot rewards means you either have to pay (real money) for large amounts of crates ($100 in crates would be a reasonable initial invenstment) so you can get enough of the same type of parts to even have a hope of designing what you want, or you plan on grinding for months with whatever cobbled together frankenstein of a bot you can manage.\n\nThis isn't to say you cannot sell the unwanted parts for in-game currency to buy the parts you want. The problem is the exchange rate is very, very bad with respect to the cost of the parts (10% - 30%). In addition, the random nature of the drops makes it undesireable to exchange any parts, since you never know when you will need one of them to make a design you just thought up ... or more realistically collect enough matching parts to make a complete bot, ignoring if you wanted to play that type of bot in the first place.\n\nFor example: movement types are collected one at a time, and you usually need at least 4 to be stable. So you would need to sell 4-5 random movement parts to buy just one of the type you actually wanted. On the other hand, if you kept those movement parts you would be partially along in 2-3 other movment types that you might want to try out later. So you have the choice of sacrificing being able to make multiple bots later for progress on making one bot now. The same goes for weapons, you could sell multiple weapons to buy a single weapon you wanted, but since you need 4-10 weapons per bot you really sacrifice your future ability to create bots if you do that.\n\nIn conclusion, the game had a lot of initial promise which seems to have been lost in the developers desire to turn it into a pay-to-win smartphone style game. My recommendation is to skip the Early Access stage of this game and wait for the final release of the game to see what the developers actually end up delivering.","May 18","false","646.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Now I would tell you to just look for a better game for you to play for free.\n\nThe opened doors that shouldn't be open in their updates, everyone and everything can use any gun. That means that you can use the most overpowered gun that what thought it should be used for lategame into earlygame thanks to their so RNG boxes and crafting sistem. Not to mention that you will get 1/10 of the price of the items you get from boxes with their awful recycle sistem.\n\nThere are RNGboxes that you can buy with money, and what comes, comes random, and that you could grind with time by winning boxes as you play. So you can either pay 100$ at start with 300 boxes of pure randomness, which can be painful since there is no skip button, and that if you don't have premium, you gain HALF what you get, so get that in mind, cuz premium for 6 months is 40 euros for me, maybe its another 50$ so in total is 150$\n\nTheir ranked sistem is broken since 1st day... You are bronze at first, fighting against diamonds, Leveling up will be tedious as ♥♥♥♥, for you will be wanting to be AFK\n\nThe punishment to leave a game is 2 mins... Same goes for Ranked, 2 mins punishment if you leave. You will be also leaving since it will be a 6 vs 8 all the time.  Because wasting 10 mins for the enemy to destroy you when you can leave and wait 2 mins to start another and get a better reward is way efficient that wasting time.\n\nYou can still aim with some weapons, but their is one weapon that you will be screaming of how the hell hide from it. Lock-on luncher missle. What you would thought that only tanks could carry such big weapon, helicopters and planes can fly above any cover for you to escape and destroy you over and over again.\n\nUntil they Fix their balance with weapons weight and damage, or just go back to the old days that you will have to pick just 1 weapon for a bot, they I just can recomend this game to any.\n\nIt went to a nice 8/10 to a 2/10.

You had a pilot seat which was the critical block to defend, rewarding good robot designs which defended this weak point. Your robot was limited to a single type of gun, prompting robots to perform specific roles and fill specific niches, encouraging teamwork. There wasn't auto regenerating health, requiring you to fight strategically and making medics meaningful.\n\nNow, you charge into the enemy with wild abandon, doing as much damage as you can in order to score points. Then, when you're low on health, you take cover for 15 seconds and recover to full health. There is no higher strategy. You do as much damage as you can as fast as you can. If you aren't doing damage, the point system won't reward you, and you'll drop in ranking. But most aggregious of all, even if you win, if you're not in the top half of the score board, you'll drop rank. So even if you're fulfilling an intergral role to the team that leads to their victor, if you aren't doing something the point system recognizes, you will be penalized and lose rank.\n\nThis game puts the cart before the horse, prioritizing monetization over fun and getting rid of depth in order to make the game more accessible to a wider market. However, most insulting of all is the Devs' attitude. They simply ignore any feedback from the forums, leaving their mods to silence anyone who steps out of line.","May 17","false","245.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Then FreeJam decided, ♥♥♥♥ the fans, we need income and changed everything...\nCons:\n1) PAY TO WIN, you need to recycle pieces and crush them to get some kind of green powder, just to find out that grinding them will take 20 matches just to get one piece you want.\n2) Stupid match makeing, as a first time player or a lower tier bot you can be put into higher tiers where you can instantly die.\n3) When you win you don't get ♥♥♥♥! There's crates now, copying CSGO was apparently a good idea accept you tend to never win in these, you can't recycle the pieces for enough, and when you win a good crate it's something you dont need or something that's tier 1 when the case is expensive.\n4) Broken leveling, now level doesn't really matter, either way you can't win unless your team actually works as a "team"\n5) Stupid community, now the game is filled with idiots who charge in with no help, no team work, people who spam, etc..

You said it yourself free jam," let me stess this FREE jam". That your game would not turn in to a complete money grab, well thats what it has turned into pay $100-$200 and you will have everything in the game easy. Another money grab is that you increased the price or premium. And yes i know you didnt have to buy anything the game is free to play but freejam set it up so it would take forever to unlock or buy anything.  This company should be be called MH (Money hungry) not freejam because obviously if they jammed with the community i wouldnt be posting this comment. The best part is that you took out the ability to get in game currency just by playing the game so you have to rely on RNG elements to get what you want and even then only 1 person in the game gets the best crate and its always just because they YOLO the core 20 times to rack up XP. Honestly whenever i see a bronze or rusted crates its a bother to open it because i know its going to be trash. Another thing id like to point out is you made my favorite class ,aircraft completely unplayable due to flak that 1 shots them out of the air. There are so many other problems i could address as well but other comments have touched on them in detail. To sum it all up i just wish this game went back to before the epic loot changes it ruined the game.","May 18","false","98.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Now I would tell you to just look for a better game for you to play for free.\n\nThe opened doors that shouldn't be open in their updates, everyone and everything can use any gun. That means that you can use the most overpowered gun that what thought it should be used for lategame into earlygame thanks to their so RNG boxes and crafting sistem. Not to mention that you will get 1/10 of the price of the items you get from boxes with their awful recycle sistem.\n\nThere are RNGboxes that you can buy with money, and what comes, comes random, and that you could grind with time by winning boxes as you play. So you can either pay 100$ at start with 300 boxes of pure randomness, which can be painful since there is no skip button, and that if you don't have premium, you gain HALF what you get, so get that in mind, cuz premium for 6 months is 40 euros for me, maybe its another 50$ so in total is 150$\n\nTheir ranked sistem is broken since 1st day... You are bronze at first, fighting against diamonds, Leveling up will be tedious as ♥♥♥♥, for you will be wanting to be AFK\n\nThe punishment to leave a game is 2 mins... Same goes for Ranked, 2 mins punishment if you leave. You will be also leaving since it will be a 6 vs 8 all the time.  Because wasting 10 mins for the enemy to destroy you when you can leave and wait 2 mins to start another and get a better reward is way efficient that wasting time.\n\nYou can still aim with some weapons, but their is one weapon that you will be screaming of how the hell hide from it. Lock-on luncher missle. What you would thought that only tanks could carry such big weapon, helicopters and planes can fly above any cover for you to escape and destroy you over and over again.\n\nUntil they Fix their balance with weapons weight and damage, or just go back to the old days that you will have to pick just 1 weapon for a bot, they I just can recomend this game to any.\n\nIt went to a nice 8/10 to a 2/10.

Meaning, I've played around when it was just wheels, hovers, and flyers. Not real sure if it was planes, choppers, or both, though.\n\nThing is, I can remember a time when I first got my hovers and was excited about buzzing around the battlefield that way. However, if they weren't spaced out, you could find yourself floating upside down with an unprotected underside. This was all before the much needed flipping mechanism they installed, then revamped to four seconds instead of ten, as well as no training rooms or what not. Just simple TDM all day every day.\n\nThen the insect legs came out, and boy was everyone happy. So much so, there were many who completely failed, but was still fun. Not to mention the fun little designs people created with them. Spiderbots. Spiderbots everywhere. Sure, there was the odd scorpion thrown into the mix, but I remember more spiders than them.\n\nThis was about the time I left for a few months, and came back to find MEGABOTS. Oh boy, what a train wreck that was when it started. The Megabots before the epic ♥♥♥♥ up with FJ were more artsy than naught, but you have to understand something. The art bots I very much enjoyed were VERY squishy. The reason why was very simple: Each block had different HP, with silver-blue and black-red/green being the highest, and white/glass being the lowest. Yes, glass cubes were easily bought back then, but would drop your framerate to Nil if blown up. Another way to drop the FPS was to attach your bot with as many flags as humanly possible. The more you have, the less amount of bots you'd see on the battlefield, because everyone with crappy computers were lagging real bad.\n\nThat was a fun time, and I really do miss those days. What with grinding for TP (talent or technical points, not real sure which) to grab that much needed weapon, block, or what have you. Then grind for RP just so you can buy the much needed blocks to allow you into the next tier. That's right folks, I said TIER, and there were 10 of them, 11 with Megabots.\n\nEach tier had its own set of blocks needed for you to stay, or else you'll end up in the next one with crap guns, blocks, and armour. Not to mention the fact that if your pilot seat is exposed, and gets nicked by a small shot, you were dead and could only whine about it. There was no "wait ten seconds to be instantly healed", only you, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for death. Sure. There were healers around this time, but they were more focused on the Mega and not your sorry ♥♥♥.\n\nThen came the "The Pit", which was okay, I guess. Never really got into it, and still don't. Would rather work as a team, rather than duke it out with four to nine other bots. However, they had their own set of problems. Such as instantly healing after getting to the top of the board. There was an exploit in there, where a person was able to have a continuous heal added to their bots if they made it just right. I'm not one to say how, but they patched it out within a couple of months.\n\nAfterwards came "Challenge Battle", but I'm pretty sure its referred to as "Battle Arena". Again, it wasn't my thing, even though it gave everyone a chance at better tactics and strategies. Not to mention the increased revenue for completing such a thing, and the introduction to callouts on the minimap. This also came with a bug, more of an exploit really. Where one team with superior firepower would "farm" the other team for points whilst waiting at their base. They wouldn't touch the main crystal, and simply went for the people who spawned in. Pretty sure there's a comic about it floating around Reddit with this.\n\nReally, though, this was a fun time to play Robocraft, until the majour ♥♥♥♥up everyone knows about. Such as the removal of Tiers (BIG MISTAKE, FJ), removing the way people gained their blocks, modules, armour, etc, and shoving everyone into what they called "Battle Ranking". Went away for a month, came back, and found it to be horrid. Then again, I stuck around just to see what else they did.\n\nWhat did they bring? Why, new weapons, armour, and modules of course. not to mention the removal of Megabots. I love Megas, and had two; one SMG and one Plasma. I miss them both, but FJ doesn't want them, and if they say "No", there's not a DAMN we can do about it beyond writing these reviews.\n\nFolks, the thing is, I'm not going to recommend this game to ANYONE. If you want to try it out, go right on ahead. The game had its ups and downs, but now its just copying CS;GO and other first person shooters with their loot crates. Not to mention the fact that they've stopped talking to us over on Reddit after all this ♥♥♥♥ popped into existence.

I have been playing this game for a long time since the very early days and it has given me almost 150 hours of fun. Unfortunately the latest update has turned the game into a completely joyless chore.\n\nI dont know what the developers were thinking but now the only rewards you get for doing well in matches are crates full of random junk which you then can turn around and recycle for 1/4 of what it costs you to  build that item.  90% of the crates have nothing of any real value in them and the recycler gives you so little in return that it hardly feels worth it to recycle the valuable items you get just because you don't need them right this second. FreeJam.... this is not the proper way to retain your players.\n\nThese kind of games are sort of like a job. You do the work, you get paid, you spend that pay on new blocks or items and you progress slowly.  Imagine your employer decides to change the way you get paid. Instead of giving you a paycheck, he or she gives you a crate full of random items that vary in value from day to day. Once a month you get lucky but most days you end up working all day for a box containing a snowglobe, a rusty nail, 3 candles and an empty can of spray paint.... That would kind of ♥♥♥♥ you off wouldn't it?\n\nIf this gets changed then I absolutely reccomend this game. With it the way it is now... steer way clear of robocraft\n","May 13","false","166.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

This at the begining might be fun but soon you notice that you can't just buy the stuff you need to build your robot. You would have to recycle your previous rewards in order to get a fraction of their wealth back as robits, with which you could buy your desired items then... This means, the game has developed away from it's initial freedom and appeal of a building game, to just farm a bit and then buy and build what ever you wish, into a total gamble. You are now totally dependent on luck with your drops and every time you get a loot crate, you are offered additional random drops as premium player. This basically goes entirely against the initial freedom the game was advertized for.\nThere are more issues right now, unbalanced weaponsystem and even very old glitches they never really got to fixing them but the general trend regarding this game strongly points towards becoming a moneygrab.\n\nThere are lots of problems, which were solved absolutely nicely before the "epic loot" update for example, since everyone wants the protonium crate now, people are playing also against their own team for the top spot on the leaderboard, resulting in teams not playing together anymore.\n\nAlso seal clubbing has become really common, bringing high endgame weapons into lower lever matches, to become the topscorer and thus also getting rewarded with the protonium crate... That is right, there is no difference right now, wether you win a match on your level or low level, does not matter, you get the same totally random generated protonium crate, which has the highest chance to give you some legendary items in theory but these chances are still so slim, it is almost always random crap, as well as in the other boxes.\n\nSo enjoy the game as long as you do but i can't recommend getting to invested in it's current state.","May 4","false","951.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Then the devs decided to destroy the aspect of creativity, make billions of new types of weapons that nobody asked for, (and are completely overpowered) and make it a complete pay to win cash grab. Guess how that went.\n\n99% of the positive reviews are from when the game was actually enjoyable. Also, if you're thinking "well at least they didn't screw up the ranking system" They did that too. They removed megabots which completely destroyed the idea of working towards the goal of creating a huge robot.\n\n"Could this get any worse?" a veteran robocraft player would say, and unfortunatley, it does. instead of having a tech tree where you gradually earn new parts as you level up you now have a crate system where you have to spend REAL money to get a random part.\n\nIf Robocraft would go back to what it was before, I would play it again.

Its had great improvements from the buggy server fixes to addition of new content. The reason i loved this game was because it was different. It allowed you to combine various items of different tiers and build something powerful.

You have a plethora or blocks, guns, wheels, turbines, etc to build your own robot any way you like.\n\nI just noticed there was an update (that plane looks awesome, going to install again and check it out!)\n\nThe only bad part so far is the limited maps. Seems to be about 2 different kinds of levels (desert and snow) with I think 2-4 differnt maps for each - gets boring fast.\n\nAlso, one bad thing is that people will abuse the higher level guns and build a minimalist vehicle with one higher power gun and just sit back and wreck everyone, so that gets a bit frustrating.\n\nHighly relies on team work.\n\nWould recommend. This game can only get better, and it's free!\n\nEdit: After making it to tier 10 after 100 hours in the game, it's pretty much lost it's fun.\n\nI am level 54 or so, so my CPU is limited to 1015. There are people with lvl 100 in tier 10, which can have much more stuff on their robot, which is a huge advantage.\n\nI am no longer interested in the game as it's only going to be repetetive from here on out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wormbones/recommended/301520/","wormbones","Kaptain Kek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wormbones/","73 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCame back from a long hiatus and the game design has changed so drastically that I no longer endorse this game. They had the perfect formula for progression and building strategy, but now it's nowhere near the tier it used to be on.\n\n(TL;DR alert) I've decided to update my review a little further to elaborate on why I don't play anymore. I used to enjoy logging in to play a few casual matches, get some tokens, and have a feeling of progression - but it's kind of lost on me now. The removal of tech tokens changed the 'skill tree' like aspect of natural progression, but the actual gameplay itself is what killed my love for the game.\n\nOriginally, the pilot seat was the 'vip' so to say when you were designing a machine. All of the other blocks had to be skillfully placed to prevent the source block under the seat from being destroyed, and also from becoming detached from the rest of the blocks (if a single block connecting a mass of blocks to the pilot seat was destroyed, the mass of blocks was destroyed too). Exploiting this in matches was the most rewarding thing in the game - some robots could withstand volleys of fire with only cosmetic damage, but there were also those with obvious weak spots. Shooting said weak spots and watching 75% of their machine disappear was the highlight of playing a rail gun, or any other weapon for that matter. It was the highlight of the game. The second most rewarding part of this was playing the executioner afterwards; you drive along looking for the remnants of their bot (usually a wheel or two and a pilot seat) to deliver the final blow.\n\nHow did this change? The removal of pilot seats and the addition of an 'auto heal' mechanic for downed robots. This absolutely DESTROYED the enjoyment of the game for me. I regularly ended matches with my gunbed functioning at below 15% health, and this was due to having 3 working wheels and a gun left as a result of proper building around the mechanics of how damage was done. Not having any healing reinforced the importance of actually building properly and also the importance for players to have medic bots. The poorly built plasma bombers can no longer be punished - a shot to the weak spot will not destroy 75% of their robot, and in the off chance you ground them they will just automatically heal back up and continue flying.\n\nCompletely ignoring the pay to win mechanics and other atrocities that have come in to the game as well, the gameplay itself is sufficient to never play this game again. It used to reward building skill, strategy, and accuracy but now it mostly reinforces mediocrity. I got destroyed all the time when I first started playing, but I did research and learned how to make good machines which eventually allowed me to make variations that would give me usually about 6 kills per game (no respawns when I played)\n\nI honestly don't even mind freemium models much, but I HATE when devs destroy a game which perfectly filled it's own niche.

Now I come back to find the speedy car a slow tank with no damage or health and its no longer T9... it's 11M?! WTF is 11m?!

And later one with the introduction of mech legs I often played armor blob mech and where standing next to the mega bot, taking the damage for our team.\n\nFor me the biggest "design" decision that broke the game was auto healing.\n\nBasicly every air unit I shoot down with rails was auto healing behind some hills where nobody could reach them.\n\nMy armor blob also was now way more useless.

I remember each platoon I was in. I made so many friends over the last year on this game, but after each update, some of my friends would leave out of boredom or not agreeing with the Devs. I was always sad when they left, but since I still liked the game I would stay and make new friends.\n\nFast forward to the Maximum Loadout update. I thought the game was at its best. You could make whatever you wanted, a giant helicopter that could both damage or heal, a frontline tank that could take more damage than anyone else, or even a stealth bomber to sneak behind the other team. No matter what you were, you felt useful to the team and could fill multiples roles for your team.\n\nI was having so much fun with my platoon, expirimenting with different loadouts and trying random builds and seeing how they worked. I could spend hours building an amazing robot and then use it in battle, perfect its flaws, and do whatever I wanted.\n\nIt was around that update when I reach Protonium 5, the highest league rank in the game. Admitidly, after playing for so long, I was getting bored with the game. I could at least enjoy playing the game with my high quality robots and my friends. (Probably 800 of those hours were with the same platoons, the same friends).\n\nAnd now, with this latest update, I find that I am the platoon member who is leaving. I am the friend that disagrees with the Devs. I can't help but feel bad about leaving my friends, but the game isnt what it used to be. I can't enjoy it. You could spend hours making something to have it beaten by 10 blocks with a hover and a flak cannon. There isn't any joy left in the game.\n\nI loved how the game used to be, like a boyhood dream of building with legos then fighting with them, but now its like my dad (Freejam), who owns the legos (my robots), just crushed all of my creations and the time I put into them.\n\nIf the game was like it was before, I would overwhelmingly recomend it, but as of its current state, do yourself a favor and don't play it.\n\nR.I.P.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/argleblarg/recommended/301520/","argleblarg","RIP Robocraft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/argleblarg/","63 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEDIT: Freejam is attempting to fix it, with much more balanced resell values/better loot, but it still doesn't fix the problem for me. The problem is the seal-clubbing and "overtiering" (yes, it's back in a way) that is occuring in the lower tiers, driving new players away, and the fact that the loot crates control what you can build if you have no Robits.\n\n...this saddens me.\n\nI LOVE this game. Well, LOVED it, that is.\n\nThe latest update completely ruined the game. RP were converted into "Robits", which would be fine if prices for everything weren't raised and recycle rates were incredibly low.\n\nThen there's the loot crates. Awful. I used to make at least half a million RP every match. If you do the conversions, Robits are your old RP value divided by 63. You don't get Robits at the end of every match, and have fun trying to make 8000 Robits (500,000/63) every match off of the terrible recycle rates from the parts you get in the Crates. We're talking resell value of around maybe 10%, and for cosmetics it's even lower- LESS THAN 1%.\n\nAnd then there's the "tier flattening." Freejam attempted to balance out the guns by making each tier have a different "ability" but have the same overall damage, and having everything unlocked from the start. Tier 1 SMG fires really quickly, but is short range and inaccurate, Mega SMG fires slowly but is accurate. But they failed at even doing that- if you do the math, the top tier weapons still do more damage, and that's assuming you hit your target with 100% accuracy on the low tier weapon. They also buffed some of the "specialty" weapons like the missile launcher and Aeroflak cannons- which leads to a huge problem. This change also completely removed the progression- the only thing that you unlock by leveling up now is more CPU.\n\nAs the tiers are now gone, Freejam removed Robot Ranking, so matches are now solely based on CPU. Here's where the huge problem comes in- missile launcher + rotor blade is around 300 CPU, meaning a super powerful weapon is being matched up against new players. And that's just one example- a lot of "exploit" bots like this exist now. There's even one as low as 80 CPU- top tier rail combined with lowest tier mech leg. That rail just completely destroys anything at that level.\n\nThis update was supposed to bring new players in while retaining veterans. They've accomplished neither. A lot of my friends that were relatively new to the game stopped playing, and I actually got somebody to start playing the day that Epic Loot hit. They hated it.\n\nPremium is now double price, and you can buy some protonium Loot Crates that have a CHANCE of giving you a good item. That's right, no longer do you buy GC as it doesn't exist- you buy Loot Crates which may not even give you what you want. Robocraft isn't fun anymore. It's digital gambling. Terrible recycle rates and scrawny payouts per match, coupled with inflated prices, is pretty much forcing you to buy the Loot Crates, or just "play well." With the current exploit bot situation, though, have fun "playing well" to earn a good Loot Crate. New players pretty much have to pray for a good item in a low tier Crate, just to survive.\n\nThat, though, isn't the final nail in the coffin at all. What is? Developer response.\nFrom the Freejam CTO himself, @sebify on Twitter: "Boring reviews on steam by who doesn't accept meta changes. Tiers won't come back, deal with it." If a few players were complaining, that would be one thing, but the entire fanbase is rapidly abandoning ship, turning to other games to get their Robocraft fix. It's apparent now that they just don't care about us. All they want now is money. They've become greedy, and now they're paying the price for it.\n\nFreejam isn't listening any more. They've turned Robocraft from a game with a ton of potential into just another failure.\n\nAnother review used this, and I quite like it- Epic Loot? More like Epic Fail.\n\nRIP Robocraft 2013-2016","April 30","false","161.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","1"

Bad updates, very very bad support - (No Email support aparently)\nThe game is ruined in my opinion. They removed all the fun. Grinding is no longer a thing of what it seems like. I've spend more than 70h on getting "Tier stars" to unlock the whole Tech tree. It's gone.\nAnd did i mention my money that i spend on Tier 10 Blocks? It's gone. Thanks Freejam. A bunch of scammers is what they are.\nRobocraft is no more. The "new" Robocraft is hilariously bad. I played this game back when Freejam was on fire and did a very good job of development. However. All this changed. Freejam is now basicly milking every single drop of money they can before this game will die.\nFreejam, if you see this. Give me my money back.

"Stay away from this game. Simply put, the development team (FreeJam) is utterly incompetent. There have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). Instead, FreeJam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. This accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. Sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, FreeJam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.\n\nOther major issues with the game:\n\n1) Building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. Nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. Any new player can slap something together in 5 minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. In fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, FreeJam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. Either they'll nerf your movement or make various components 10 times heavier, etc. Regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did "because FreeJam said so."\n\n2) Significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. Simply put, FreeJam rarely gets weapon balance 100% right, or even close to it. In the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. There are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out).\n\n3) FreeJam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. They won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. Instead, FreeJam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. Basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. Things like clans have been "on FreeJam's radar" since mid-2014 or earlier - and guess what? Still not implemented, and it is almost mid-2016. The sad part is, by the time FreeJam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this.\n\n4) Minimal skill required. If you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. FreeJam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. This might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.\n\nFreeJam: One step forward, two steps back. Always."","May 15","false","546.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","1"
