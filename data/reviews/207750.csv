You only have a small play zone to maneuver, with enemies coming in from the sides & top of your screen making for some intense close combat game play. The responsivness of your ship with the mouse is great giving you minute control over your position & graphically the enemies & weapons fire is easy to distinguish even when there is a lot going on, on-screen.\n\nEach song completed will grant you a random weapons upgrade drop, with a chance of a rare drop. These can be purchased (& upgraded) to increase your firepower of the four weapons slots on your ship & you can even change the angle of fire for each slot to customise your layout further which is cool. This is needed as you progress up the difficulty levels & to kill the random bosses needed to complete the story mode. Scoring is combo based, so the more you can kill in sequence (with less enemies escaping), will grant higher scores but stay nimble as each death will cost you a score penalty. Each kill also drops a bonus '♫' to pickup, granting health, power-ups & score increases so you need to be quick & get them all before they disappear for the best scores.\n\nI found all but the top two difficulty levels relatively easy; each difficulty level unlocks after killing three bosses. This can take some time making the start of the game feel rather dull to grind out the first few bosses, but if you stick with it, it becomes far more enjoyable later. For me, I just got a little tipsy off a few ciders, cranked up the volume & enjoyed some of my favorite tracks which certainly helped make the initial grind pass by much quicker :p .\n\nAlthough your music generates the enemies, you don't really get a sense of any pattern to the beat which would have been nice. For example, sometimes it goes into 'hardcore mode' in parts of songs you wouldn't expect & this seems to increase in frequency the higher the difficulty you go. It's not a big issue though, as you do get the feeling of randomness in the waves so each run feels different.\n\nRegardless of the few shortcomings, if you love your music & your shoot 'em ups it is very easy to waste away a few hours in ♪ Symphony ♪ liberating your music!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","June 7, 2014","true","9.6"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

This addictive and engaging casual shooter uses your music to configure the levels which you play. The game on itself is not very long... the story mode, at least, but as long as you want to just shoot something without complications and good challenge (do not forget the point of having your music integrated in the game), this little jewel will make wonders, so the real life of symphony is as long as big is your music library.\n\nThe mechanical is quite simple. You choose one song, and then, depending of its characteristics it throws to you to beat (and to strike you down mercilessly) one thing or other, and while you shoot and dodge cool lights you must collect inspiration points which raise your marker and at the same time repair your.... spaceship ?\n\nI bought it just for experimenting and i'm far beyond than pleased with it.","December 8, 2013","true","36.5"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

Gameplay is simply not good. Everything is pretty much the same colour and the screen can get very full. Audiosurf's stark contrasts made for gorgeous visuals. This is just a chaotic mess.\n\nYou can unlock and equip a variety of weapons but little information is given about them and the strategy seems to be mostly just holding down the mouse button and moving around.\n\nThere doesn't feel like a lot of gameplay difference in the songs. It seems to go from low intensity to high intensity and back with nothing in between, and often not in places you'd expect.\n\nThe interface is quite clunky, and so badly designed that in some places text actually overlaps. How that is still happening after multiple patches is beyond me, but it certainly doesn't leave a good impression.\n\nIt's not outright awful, and there's some nice ideas in there, but it just hasn't come together.","June 15, 2014","false","3.9"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

The visuals are frequently a confusing mess thanks to lack of contrast and effects overkill, and the deaths this causes are typically more of a frustration than actual punishment.  The play area is regularly overcrowded, with your ship being relatively huge, your hit box fairly large, and the consequences for mistakes being inconsistent (and typically leaving you wishing you'd just died instead with how crippled your weapons can become).\n\nI went in really wanting to enjoy the experience, but in the end I can't recommend this to anybody, especially on the same platform that brings so many people Audiosurf and Beat Hazard, either of which will give you a superior experience at a similar price.","November 27, 2013","false","6.6"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","35","47","0","3"

To those not yet familiarized with this style, it consists of procedurally generated levels, and this procedure utilizes songs chosen by the user to create the levels. If you use the same song, it will always create the same level (if the difficulty chosen is the same, obviously).\n\nThe game is superb. The graphics and level of content in this game will keep you busy for a LOT of time. There is a lot to unlock and do in this game: you beat songs to get items, then you need to collect Kudos and Inspiration to unlock and upgrade these items. There are a lot of unlockables in this game and each song will unlock something;\n\nAn extremely enjoyable gameplay that is relaxing at earlier difficulties, but also can be very challenging at the hardest ones. The leaderboard system is awesome, it takes into consideration every aspect of your performance, including your ship power (the higher the power the less points you get). You can (and should) make ship builds in this game using the weapons and upgrades for optimal performance when beating songs.\n\nControls are straight-forward, you can even put auto-fire on separate weapons in your ship meaning it will fire without the need to press the left mouse button.\n\nThere is a bug which causes the game to crash when analyzing any MP3 songs, I have never seen anyone else with this issue though. All other music file extensions run just fine.\n\nLast but not least, another cool aspect of the game: To unlock difficulties you need to beat "demons" which randomly invade your songs. Those are pretty cool to fight (and challenging, too).\n\nRecommended!\n\n\nMy scores:\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nControls: 10/10\nContent: 10/10\nStory: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\nBugs: -1\n\nOverall: 47/50","January 7, 2014","true","11.2"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

The game's framing device involves an interdimensional demon that consumes music, but this is really just an excuse for me to blow up little Vertex graphics space ships while I listen to Iron Maiden (Not that anyone should need an excuse for that kind of activity).\nAt its heart, Symphony is basically a bullet-hell shooter. The ship is customizable, with four spaces for weapons and numerous different firing patterns to unlock and upgrade to even the playing field. Each song is deconstructed by the game and translated into patterns of enemies and intensity levels based on the changes in tempo and harmony.\nUnfortunately, a number of flaws continually gnaw at me while I play; firstly, several of the enemies can absorb an absolutely obnoxious amount of damage before breaking, meaning that the game's feature to aim weapons in different directions is largely an exercise in frustration. On just medium difficulty, even the fast-moving triangle shaped foes are hard to take down without several direct hits from high-powered weapons. Assuming you do manage to break several foes in a row, enemies swarm the screen in rhythmic patterns, each one in a wave flying in the same path. This means that picking up dropped notes for score means you have to fly into the next enemy in the wave, as it'll take the same path as the one you just shot down. Meanwhile, enemies entering the screen will fire projectiles that can be very hard to distinguish from the pulsing colors of the background.\nThe game allows players to acquire copies of weapons they like and upgrade them for higher power, but then punishes the player for upgrading by penalizing your score while using stronger weapons. Higher difficulty levels allow for stronger weapons and a better score bonus, but the scaling is slanted sharply, with enemies gaining far more strength than the player.\nI'm still issuing a reccomendation, because Symphony still has a lot going for it in the creative department, but there some definite shortcomings that prospective players should be aware of.","August 2, 2015","true","2.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","2"

Honestly, every level feels the same. I can play some insane Techno and it's pretty lame most of the way through. I play something soothing and it's the same deal. This game is overrated in my opinion.\n\nThe vertical scrolling is a let down because your ship will move as fast as your mouse does, you level up and expand your ship, which is a big let down because it's basically just a game to grind with no skill involved, and there are little to no enemies that make the gameplay unique on any situation unless you're fighting a boss!\n\nThis game is not impressive.","April 3, 2015","false","1.1"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","30","47","0","1"

Here's the thing. Some time after installing this game, I noticed that someone had installed a user named "Matt" on my system. I couldn't see this from my own computer, but from another computer on my LAN it was all too apparent. Google ultimately led me to a Steam thread regarding this game identifying the issue in January, 2013. I discovered the hidden user over my Lan in December, 2013. In at least one entire year's time, it had not been fixed and no attempt had been made to inform customers before, during, or after purchase. Since the dev had not been forthcoming with a fix, an explanation, and an apology right there on the store page or the forums over the course of an entire year, I can only presume a. the dev does not really care about his customers or his image, b. the dev has done it intentionally for some unexplained reason, or c. both. In any event, I uninstalled it from my computer and advise you to skip it.\n\nCorrection: The dev finally did post an explanation and an apology in the forums after my complaint in December, but I have to say I agree with user Bloodshed regarding the impact of the dev's error in judgment. I enjoyed playing the game, but I'm still bothered by the way that players have been impacted, and as Bloodshed states (http://steamcommunity.com/app/207750/discussions/0/630799905146964256/) I can imagine a good number of people may never discover the cause of the problem or may have spent money trying to get it resolved. Hopefully, none of those people were taken in by the increasingly popular tech scams out there.\n\nSo there you have it--fun game, but a grievous error in judgment. I will never reinstall this game on my system. Whether you trust the dev or not is entirely up to you. I appreciate the effort that the dev is making, but I'm not sure I enjoyed the game enough to risk restoring trust. How would you feel if you were having family computer time and someone asked you who this Matt was that is on the home network? If the original message(s) regarding this issue hadn't been posted on the Steam forums by other customers and if I hadn't been lucky enough to discover it, I might never have resolved this issue. I can see the potential of this creating a very frustrating experience for average casual gamers.","March 14, 2014","false","13.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","4"

You get infinite lives, anyway!  Plus, it's not like it matters half the time, anyway, because your shots can be upgraded to so overpowered that you kill everything before you even realize it's there, and firing in all directions. It's such that "play" largely involves just collecting powerups with proper timing to keep a chain alive.\n\nSince score is the only thing that determines how well you did, (you can "beat" a song by simply walking away from the keyboard for the full length of the song, no participation required,) then collecting note powerups at the precise timing to keep a chain alive is literally the only thing (besides purposefully underpowering your ship to up a challenge modifier) that exists as a means of judging skill.\n\nI would only recommend it to people who really love their music library, and just want even more excuse to listen to it.","November 1, 2014","false","10.8"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","18","29","2","1"

I really really do.  But I just cannot do it.\n\nStarting with the good things:\n- The game does a very good job creating levels based on the music.  I feel like it's really responding to the beats, tempo changes, and dynamics of a particular song.  It feels like each level was tailored to that song.\n- At lower levels, it's a very good pseudo-bullet-hell game and more enjoyable because it has your own music.\n- The weapon customization and points scaling to the power of your ship gives plenty of challenge and allows for different play styles.\n\nNow the bad things that make me ultimately not want to recommend this game all revolve around its status as a pseudo-bullet-hell game, mostly at the higher difficulties.  Bullet-hell games are supposed to be hard--even infuriating--but they are also fair.  This one is not.  Allow me to explain:\n- Your ship's hitbox is NOT equal to its visual size.  Time and time again I was taking damage from enemies that did not physically touch my ship, but hit an outer corner of the (I assume) rectangle that makes up your hitbox.  When there are 20+ enemies to dodge, it becomes really problematic knowing you have to clear out more space than your ship is big.\n- There seems to be no consistency for damage.  Sometimes I can sandbag 4+ collisions and survive, other times it's a one-hit-KO.  Or I can take 2-3 bullets and survive, other times I'm outright dead.  I tried to pay attention to the enemies that damage me, to see if it was different enemy classes, but as far as I can tell, it's not.  It seems honestlly to be a total crapshoot if a hit will kill or not.\n- The weapons, while varied, lack power on the higher levels.  You basically have to use the "furia" weapons (roughly a 5% drop rate per song) in order to stand a chance on the highest level.  Often I was finding that I literally could not destroy a wave of enemies before they got to the bottom of the screen (and this is without contending with the other 20+ enemies on screen at the time).  You basically have to grind until you get the rare-and-slightly-more-powerful weapons for the hard difficulty to be doable (at least as far as completion is concerned, maybe not survival).\n- Lots of enemies spawn behind you, which is fine as some weapons shoot backwards.  But for some reason, while you can rotate your weapons, you cannot flip them to shoot backwards, so your ship is just naturally weaker firing behind it than in front of it.  This becomes a problem when 1/3 of the enemies spawn at the bottom of the screen (especially the larger ones, which brings me back to the hitbox issue) and your strongest weapons literally cannot hit them.\n\nSo to summarize, I want to like this game, but I do not.  If you're not so obsessed with the shooter aspect, you'll probably love it, and I get that.  But I just cannot recommend it on these grounds.","April 18, 2014","false","6.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Symphony isn't really a music game for the most part. It's more of a mediocre shmup you can play with your music serving as the background noise, with the action on screen's intensity matching that of the music's volume.\n\nFrom the get-go, the game is a terribly frustrating affair. The interface for importing and selection of songs is a mess that requires far too much to get working and not even close to enough sorting options. The game's a frustrating affair before you're even playing it.\n\nOnce you've finally wrangled your music collection together and selected a song, Symphony is a fairly simple top-down shmup seemingly created with the "How To Not Make A Good Shmup" handbook close at hand. The playfield is constantly littered with enemies with very little room to move, and your player ship is entirely too big to work for the fast-paced action this game is trying to provide. The game's visuals are also often a huge problem, offering little to no contrast between the color of playfield (based on the music's intensity) enemy units, and ESPECIALLY enemy bullets. It becomes a chaotic mess that's impossible to discern and frustrating to try and stick with.\n\nSkip it and stick to AudioSurf, where more than the intensity of the music you're listening to matters and it's much easier to not only see what you're doing, but actually be played as well.","May 30, 2014","false","1.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuxtonFael/recommended/207750/","HuxtonFael","Haxton Fale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuxtonFael/","225 products in account","Symphony is a terribly mediocre game.\nSong picker is clearly not the best thing ever, caching your entire library instead of letting you browse through folders, and supporting only filtering by artist or album. The interface is also full of bugs, with Kudos or Inspiration meters either floating off the screen or overlapping with text. And then there are also hover detection issues, with some items not being completely selectable unless you find that specific area where clicking works.\nIn terms of gameplay itself, the game encourages you to move on to the next difficulty level as soon as you unlock it, giving you just enough kudos to upgrade - and then becomes frustratingly hard, with chaotic and overcrowded game area with no place for you to survive, not to mention hitting anything before dying. Not that you would know what killed you - with the default graphic settings, your bullets' and the enemies' bloom mix together creating a lighty mash where nothing is discernible, including bullets headed your way. There's no guide to the enemies eitheryou have to observe them in this weird mix and try to see what they are doing and guess what to do in return before you die. And then there are bosses, which increase the frustration even further, because 1) you can't choose when or where to fight them, so an appearance of one can simply ruin your chance of a decent scire and 2) they are a bit like tougher versions of some of the enemies you see, but much more deadly and much harder to kill, designed to minimize your breathing space as much as possible. That's not nice.\nSymphony seems like a music game, while it's simply a music-based shmup, with no rhytm in the gameplay to speak of (the tempo of the game has very little relation to the actual tempo of the music). Heck, even the starting settings favour SFX over music.\nThe game would be very nice to play every now and then if it didn't force you to progress by making the boss fights unavoidable (the boss is in this song you like to play? Tough luck, you have to either fight him or not play the song at all). It could also be a better music game or a better shooter, instead of trying to be both at the same time, with something more added on, and failing at it.","November 30, 2013","false","5.7"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","32","57","0","3"

Luckily you can repair it via collecting "Music Notes" (dropped points) from enemies one has shot to death after your ship lost part of itself (took damage).\n\nNotice, any audio over 1:30 minutes will do, so for you oddballs out there who feel like playing to audiobooks or whatever else you come up with, have fun.\n\n\n\nIn Depth:\n\nWarning... there are probably spoilers (if you think there can be spoilers for a shoot 'em up that is not a bullet-hell)... they are more of descriptions of how the game works... which is why I think it is good...\n\nAny audio over a minute thirty long can be used to play the game.\n\nOne have 4 guns that are individually rotatable, all of which they can individually be bound to left click to fire, right click to fire, or always (infinite) fire... the game can be really easy on the fingers due to the infinite fire mode.\n\nOne can move ones' ship around the screen with your mouse much like you would a cursor.\n\nEach of those 4 guns and the parts of ones' ship they mount to can be destroyed, as well as the entire ship itself if the center of it gets hit. The ship comes with 4 stock guns. All weapons can be upgraded to level 5 (the higher the level the deadlier of course) based off of points/point goals on songs that you finish playing through.\n\nOnes' ship usually loses parts/gets destroyed when you crash into enemies or on the occasions' they shoot you (or you get to close to certain units and they blow up).  Luckily you can repair it via collecting "Music Notes" (dropped points) from enemies one has shot to death after your ship lost part of itself (took damage).\n\nWhen one dies one respawns seconds later (may feel like forever if your invested in the level) and as one defeat bosses that randomly get attributed to songs one plays. Each boss unlocks part of a sheet of the Symphony of Souls. Each page represents a higher difficulty level to unlock... so yes... one starts off weak, but sit back and enjoy the audio whilst it is easy if you are a Hardcore player, otherwise keep it easy or do as you wish.\n\nThe game comes with pre-stocked music from a handful of genres... but I shall not review it, for everyone has their preferences and it is limited compared the amount of music one loves that one will probably add to it to play.\n\n\n\nThe long opinion filled babble-esque review follows that might have as many "spoilers," if not more, as above:\n\nYou may actually listen to rather than just hear your songs for once since your focusing on playing your song rather than having audio in the background as you focus on something else.\n\nPlaying a game whilst having an excuse to listen to your (favorite) music without having to listen to the games audio... always grand... but there is nothing like playing a shooter that integrates and interacts with your music/audio files that are a minute in a half or longer. The proof the game interacts is the pace of the enemies, color of the background, and the subwoofer weapon...\n\nThis game is unique in that it has 4 weapon slots and one can customize which way the weapons face on the ship, the ships weapons (and ship itself) can be destroyed... but as long as the ship remains intact, one can collect music (drops) from deceased enemies to repair ones' ship. One can also configure any of the weapons to independently of one another fire with the left/right mouse buttons and infintie fire (2 guns on left click, the 3rd on infinite fire, the 4th on right click, sure, all on any of them, all the power to you,  etc.)\n\nOne can upgrade weapons, but if one is not very good at the game, one simply has to play more songs on the lower difficulty levels to get the points required to upgrade weapons. 2 point systems, one is based off the score you received upon finishing a level, and the other is based off reaching set scores for that difficulty for that song... both of which are required to upgrade weapons... the former of the two is only required to unlock weapons... and there is only 1 weapon unlock per song.\n\nEvery song is processed by the game the first time you play the song, in order to generate that level (difficulty is irrelevant). The processing process also decides if a boss will be attributed to that song (thus there will never be a boss on a level you have not played). There is a timer to defeat the boss, if one fails to defeat the boss may move to a different difficulty level in the same song, but will still be attributed to that song.\n\nOne unlocks (parts of) sheet music... the Symphony of Souls... as one does so one unlocks higher difficulties. The bosses get progressively harder to defeat. When one defeats a boss that song is freed (no fighting a boss on that song again).\n\nIs that enough babbling? Now go play the game to Portal's "Still Alive" song(s)... they are free after all... Steam Music... and yes there is a way to download them without having the game installed... it is just a pain for it requires console commands... you might catch that the game is out of Beta on time...

Except on this case, I actually like it! I won't presume to understand throughly the connection between the shooter-gameplay and the music, but it works.\nThe gamplay itself is pretty simple ("Space Invaders" style shooting), yet the intensity of the ingame-action is directly linked to the intensity of the music.

Since you have the game use your own music library, you're going to enjoy the soundtrack too. :P\nFor the bottom line, I say - this is a very cool, spicy and refreshing "Space Invaders" style shooter. If you like that idea, get this game, it's definitely worth it!","September 8, 2013","true","9.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As you play through your library of music, you will unlock different pieces of equipment to build ships out of. Each piece has a specific response to music, so a subwoofer launcher will fire a huge burst every time there is a strong bass note. This novel interactivity between the ship and music means you can design a ship to specifically be most effective with a certain song or genre.\nIt’s a super cool concept and I really enjoy being able to play a game that connects with my music library in this way.","December 4, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I got this version as part of a bundle sale. Anyways, on to the review.\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I was fascinated by the idea of a musical shooter game because I loved playing Galaga as a kid and I love music games, including AudioSurf, Stepmania, and more recently, Sequence. So I bought this as part of a sale and needless to say, after an hour of playing the game, I was hooked... and then I lost interest. Just read the pros/cons.\n\n+++Pros+++\n+ Great idea for a music game, but there's a catch.\n+ Great visuals, definitely sets the "music" tone.\n+ Neat weapon customization, but, like the first pro, there's a catch.\n\n---Cons---\n- Occasional textual glitches.\n- The weapon customization comes off to be quite dull & limited when you realize how many unlockable weapons there are (I found like eight plus a stronger version of them) and only one unlockable power-up pickup.\n- Towards the end of the game, the difficulty becomes so frustrating that most of the choices of weapons will be omitted and you'll be practically forced to use a few certain weapons, and even those aren't good enough. You'll die and lose points a lot.\n- I don't feel as if the songs I pick really have an effect on the way the game is played. Sure the higher-adrenaline songs have faster/more enemies, but I feel like the beats to the music don't really affect the gameplay. Audiosurf had pickups based off the music beats and Sequence had you hit the arrow keys to the beat of the song.\n- Lots of potential that I feel went wasted, at least for a music game.\n\nDid I like Symphony? At first I did, and even with all those cons, I feel Symphony could be a time-waster game, but it's not worth the $9. I'd buy it on sale for like $2.50. Unfortunately as the game gets on, it gets worse, and those flaws get more and more noticeable.","April 5, 2014","false","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a very interesting take on "Powered by your music" type games, and the powerup system being unlocked by playing songs is a very interesting idea. That and it's a lovely arcade-style top-down shooter.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm going to have to give this a negative review based on the UI alone.\n\nSeriously, the UI (User Interface) for this game is downright AWFUL. It only displays three songs at once, which wouldn't be an issue if there was a "Select from Windows Explorer" option. Beat Hazard and Audiosurf both have this and it makes life so much easier. On top of that, the controller support in the menus is also rather poor, with the "cursor" frequently going exactly where you DON'T want it to. It honestly feels like a mobile port the UI is so awful. Beat Hazard has a mobile port and the UI for that game isn't even this bad.\n\nThere isn't even a way to search for songs I've found, so have fun scrolling down the list for eternity.\n\nPick this up ONLY if they ever fix the interface. The UI is just so cumbersome it makes the entire game unenjoyable.","January 14","false","1.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You might be annoyed by the fact that harder difficulties are initially locked, but once you reach them you're in for the ride of your life. Nods in the achievements and the structure of the light story clearly show that this is a game by music lovers to music lovers.\n\nI've played with classical, electronic, and jazz and have gotten great levels out of all of them, with significant variance in the design (the key features being the speed of enemies affected by the tempo and the number of enemies by the volume).\n\nHonestly I was shocked to check the Steam usage stats and see just how few people play this game on a regular basis. I would wholeheartedly recommend it. I would alse recommend the Extra Credits youtube vid on the game-- it was what got me to buy the game in the first place!\n\nCaveats:\nIf you've already got Beat Hazard or similar, well, the gameplay is somewhat similar (action shooter to music).\n\nThe actual area your ship is in is smaller than it seems, and your hitbox is larger than it feels like it should be. The counterpoint to this is that picking up points repairs your ship, and oftentimes you won't die from one hit. Still, the ship size gets annoying, especially with higher enemy densities and higher difficulty settings.\n\nWeapon drops are seemingly by random chance, though if you have enough music this won't be a major issue until the late game, when Furia (rare) weapons become more important. Level 5 standard weapons will get you through, but it's certainly harder. In my experience this wasn't a huge issue, as Furia weapons dropped often enough, but if you're unlucky...\n\nOverall I give this game a Recommended/10.\n\n","January 15, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This game plays out how a music rhythm game should play. It matches your music quite well with streams of enemies and things to dodge. It also gives easy features on finding songs in your library (especially if it's large like mine (20000+)). Only draw back, I wish it had a search bar feature to find music.

It's certainly a better story than most games of the genre, but it's definitely nothing to write home about.\n\nSymphony turns your music library into the levels you play, by scanning the tracks and basing the level pacing and enemy layouts on the raw audio data. Louder parts in a song cause the level to turn red and speed up. Tempo changes cause the level and enemies to scroll at a faster or slower speed. Time signature affects what enemies spawn and in how many. There's a surprising amout of variety with each and every song you play, meaning that Symphony is more than just shooting things to a custom playlist.\n\nEach completed level nets you points, which allow you to purchase upgrades for your ship. Once your ship is decked out and you've put about 30 minutes in, you'll happily breeze through the levels, although the learning curve tends to rise sharply in the highest difficulties. The bosses, however, can be downright unfair, especially if you haven't chosen the right song, such as when I was confronted with a boss during a run of Blink-182's "All the Small Things" which runs a little over 2 minutes and gives you almost no time to defeat a boss. Aside from that, the bosses boast very overpowered attacks and take up a large portion of the playing field. Thankfully, however, the bosses are few and far between.\n\nSymphony could have easily been a one-trick pony: a shooter that runs on YOUR music. However, the concept is so well-executed that it rarely becomes repetitive, and the game's reliance on your music makes it hard for you to become bored. Pick this game up if you want a dymanic bullet hell shooter or just love listening to music while doing just about anything.","February 9, 2014","true","40.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides modded servers in TF2.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun and entertaining, but the gameplay could use a load of improvements.\n\nYou can't control the ship's directional shots, you can only rotate the (for lack of a better word) 'cannons' before you start a song.\n\nThe enemies are so ♥♥♥♥ing Over-Powered, and most of the time, they come from behind you, and you can't do ♥♥♥♥, because you can't change the direction your ship's shooting towards, and when dodging enemies from above, I often go downward and ♥♥♥♥ing crash into the ♥♥♥♥ing ships that are below me that I can't ♥♥♥♥ing hit.\nThe game does have Xbox360 controller support (Thankfully!), but not full controller support -- In the menus you have to use your mouse, and even to pause the ♥♥♥♥ing game you have to let go of your controller to press the 'esc' button on your keyboard.\nIn the middle (Usually in the beginning, though) a ♥♥♥♥ing demon will interrupt your 'fun', and challenge you. It gets really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying when I just want to play a ♥♥♥♥ing song and not battle a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss. Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥? Add a ♥♥♥♥ing 'Boss Mode' to the ♥♥♥♥ing game, if you really want to show off those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses.\nIt seems as if all of the enemies have random amounts of health, because when I shoot one enemy 3 ♥♥♥♥ing times, it goes down, but another (Same kind of enemy) only takes 1 or 2 hits.\nThe game is so ♥♥♥♥ing confusing.\nYou can't purchase new weapons, you can only "Unlock" them... And most of the time, the unlocked ones are complete ♥♥♥♥.\nIt only has 'Story-Mode', and lacks a relaxation/free-play mode. (Free-play meaning no ♥♥♥♥ing story, relaxation meaning easier/no enemies and just to enjoy the view.)\nThe songs have to be, at least, 1:30 in order to "Create level."\n\nHowever, the game does look really radical... I'll give it that.\n\nBottom line: The game's only worth $4.99, if that.\n\nMaybe if the game had:\nFULL controller support,\nDirectional controls,\n(Doesn't matter, but it's always better with) Multiplayer,\nEasier enemies/less OPed enemies,\nAnd a ♥♥♥♥ing free-play mode,\nIt'd be worth $8.99,\nBut not how it is right now.\n\nIf you like the look (Or just) this game, try out Beat Hazard, if you don't already have it.\nThe gameplay is better, has Full Controller Support, you can purchase perks, have less OPed enemies, (they do have bosses, but the game warns when one's coming, and it's not a ♥♥♥♥ing demon that starts talking and sounds like a broken record player being voiced by Mel Tillis,) the game is still getting updated, with new DLC on the way, and is just overall more fun.\n\nP.S: Don't EVER use the ♥♥♥♥ing Shotgun, because it sucks more ♥♥♥♥ than a ♥♥♥♥♥ on a busy day.","March 21, 2014","false","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Just kidding, the game only has a look at you're music and turns it into a shooting like Space invaders arcade game). I don't know how the game does it but it actually reads you're music and turns all the music notes into (They look like Space invaders to me!) enemies which you need to kill so the note restores back to it's song (Well, after the song has finished, it goes back to normal anyway). The idea is that this game is all about unlocking new weapons for you're 4 gunner ship (Lazers, shotgun, missiles, you name it and it will be there).\nAfter going through some songs you're bound to see something of what is called the DEMON, which is basically this viruses slave that got into you're music which turned everything bad (No, not a real virus xD Your pretty safe there) and you just need to show him whose boss of the music. Pretty simple? WRONG!\nThe bosses get harder as you defeat one after the other. SPOILER ALERT! -You are given this sheet of music at the beggining of the game which is called the Symphony and it's been taken over by the DEMONS. You're job is to go around all of you're music and Kill each DEMON on SIGHT. After killing a demon, you will have restored some of the symphony of 5 forsaken pages which contain 4-5 DEMONS ON EACH PAGE! Where I am is at the 4th DEMON on Page 3, so hofully it won't be too long before I face the big guy (The ultimate showdown boss fight). -- End Spoiler.\nSo can I recommend this game to you? If you're gamer who loves you're music then this may be yours. If you are more the adventure/action type player... Probably not. But I'm going to recommend it "YES" simply because I had a good time playing it.","March 24, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

And I'm glad I did—it scratches the same itch as Audiosurf, running your digital music through some algorithm or other to generate levels. But Symphony takes the conceit and whacks a manic shmup into it, and the result is a lot of fun.\n\nThe plot: Seems there's some demonic entity thing which is devouring the souls of the composers in your music collection or something...yeah it's dumb but just go with it, it's an arcade game. You fight off its many minions with the occasional boss fight interspersed, blasting them to smithereens while listening to your music. As the intensity of your music increases, the colors get brighter, enemies move faster and are harder to kill, and your motions become more spasmodic as you try to kill everything while collecting all the powerups.\n\nIt's similar in concept to bullet hell/danmaku/Touhou/what have you, but you will not be threading the needle here. The hitbox consists of your entire ship, and brushing up against enemies or their fire results in losing an outrider section of your craft—as well as the gun mounted on it. However, your craft can easily be repaired by picking up powerups in the form of musical notes. This, coupled with the occasional invincibility powerup, makes ramming enemies a totally legitimate strategy in a pinch.\n\nDifficulty scales up at a controlled enough rate that you're able to maintain a consistent degree of challenge even as your weapons get bigger and badder. Between plays you're given the option to configure and upgrade your craft's weaponry, and it's here where the gameplay is at its most strategic—do you want to focus heavy fire to forward, quickly taking down more powerful enemies? Load up on rapid-fire elements and send glowing hot plasma hurtling in eight directions at once to mop up the weenies? Close-quarter shotgunning? Long-range missile batteries? All are available to you, and all are viable.\n\nSong selection's not the most intuitive thing, and if like me you're more likely to stream music than keep 5 GB of it lying around on your hard drive you may find the selection a bit thin. The plot's whisper-thin—not a bad thing in itself, it only needs to be substantial enough to give you a reason to shoot stuff. But the prime villain keeps popping up to chat about thie insubstantial plot, often while you're in the middle of a level and would rather see what you're doing. But these are fairly minor quibbles, not enough to ruin the experience. Symphony is an enjoyable shooter that's as exciting as the music you pump through it, and at this stage in its life it's a cheap pickup. Have fun with it.","November 22, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. (TL:DR at the bottom)\n\nFirst, let me say, the menus look great, and are easy to work with. There's tons of weapons to add to your ''ship'' as you fight against enemies.\n\nHaving said that: The graphics can sometimes become confusing. You don't always have fully control over everything, as you simply cannot see everything. Dying simply because you didn't see an attack coming might happen to you a lot, but, on the other end, you have unlimited lives. The controller support, which was later added, feels rushed and unnatural, and isn't without bugs.\n\nThe storyline isn't exactly clear. Personally I have no problems with that, IF there was a way to avoid it. I don't want to go all deep on that, because I haven't played through it for 100% yet, and there may still be stuff to come. I'm at 40% now, and I still don't know why someone would want to infect my music library. On the store page I can't find it either.\n\nA bigger issue is when you try to play a few songs. It scans the song you want to play, and lets you. As an example, I've taken the songs ''3:45 - No sleep'' by the Cardigans, a really, really slow song, and Young, by Tulisa, a fast dance track, with lots of variation. The enemies were moving faster and coming in at a much higher rate in the song by The Cardigans (Which is also, looking at Beats per minute, a much, much slower song) than when playing the dance track. This didn't happen on 1 occasion: Loading up another few songs gives the same impression. Other than some detections in beats, used for weapons, the game doesn't really seem to be doing anything with the song, other than playing it.\n\nTL:DR,\nPros:\n- Nice menus\n- Lots of customisations\n- Graphics do look nice and run well on my mediocre system\n\nCons:\n-  Graphics may become confusing\n- Game does not seem to actually be using the library\n-  Controller support feels rushed in and unnatural\n- Plot might/has holes in it\n\nFinal verdict: It's good if you want an arcade shooter. If you want to be interacting with your music library, take a look at Audiosurf instead.","March 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Ships come in from the sides way too quickly, frequently making it impossible for you to collect kudos (or whatever they call it) on the higher difficulties. The worst part is that it seems like every song I play when I pick a new artist (I mean, literally, everytime I play a song by an artist I haven't played before) it is invaded by a "demon", which is this game's version of a boss (just a really not fun to kill boss). The actual way the boss comes in is annoying, you're shooting ships then your screen turns red, your ship drifts off to the side and you can't control it, and there's some distorted voice saying nonsense for 30 seconds. Then, you are forced to fight a  boring demon who at best is super easy to beat and just takes up the whole song and at worst is difficult to beat (but in a stupid way) and you have to play it again after he runs away!

As these are a must have for higher difficulty levels and preferably you'd want 4 of your preferred type, or at least 2 of two different types, they end up being the only resource that actually matter. Everyghing else you will be piling up while trying to get those weapons. As at least for me you'd get one of the rare weapon types every 20 songs or so, be prepared to play quite a bit if you want to maximise your ships potential.\n\nThe leaderboards, while nice and balanced for having every song (and variant of a song), as well as different difficulty levels, scored separately are also fairly useless unless you play the inbuilt tracks. For the most part you can expect to be the only one to have a score in the songs you play and if you happen to hit one that someone else has played, there won't be many names on the list. Of the 9001 songs listed on the game homepage, only 549 have more than 20 scores..\n\nOn the whole Symphony is a nice idea for a game, but it ends up having more annoying problems than good ideas or novel implementations.

It's good for killing time and listening to your music while you blow things up, but as far as rhythm games go, I prefer Audiosurf. Here's why:\n\nSymphony imposes a nonsense "story" over your songs with boss fights and irksome voice acting that interrupts the flow of the music and the gameplay. It's a digitally-altered demonic voice talking to you about how he's captured the souls (seriously, take a shot every time you hear him say the word "soul" -- you'll die of alcohol poisoning) of your music's composers. Dumb and unnecessary.\n\nSymphony's gameplay also scales poorly, much like an amputee mountain climber. The first two difficulty levels are a gentle to moderate ride, getting hectic in the intense parts of the song and relaxing otherwise, which is reasonable. The third difficulty level and beyond turns this rhythm game into a bullet hell lightshow. Enemy weapons become instant kills, and you'll rarely see them coming because of the flaring light effects spewing forth from your weapons and the multitude of onscreen explosions.\n\nAt the higher levels, the game no-longer seems to be in touch with the music. You can play the gentlest song in your library and you'll still have enemies spawning in swarms at the edges of your screen.\n\nIt looks like a neat and attractive game at first, but quickly becomes frustrating or boring. The visual effects are nice, but they just make it harder to see enemies, laser balls, music note beams, and red rings of death (not the XBox kind).\n\n4/10.","June 5, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I like the idea of getting new weapons from every song. I like how you can custome your ship and the directions your weapons fire, and how that really makes you have to move around a lot.\n\nThe actual execution of the game is awful. Ships come in from the sides way too quickly, frequently making it impossible for you to collect kudos (or whatever they call it) on the higher difficulties. The worst part is that it seems like every song I play when I pick a new artist (I mean, literally, everytime I play a song by an artist I haven't played before) it is invaded by a "demon", which is this game's version of a boss (just a really not fun to kill boss). The actual way the boss comes in is annoying, you're shooting ships then your screen turns red, your ship drifts off to the side and you can't control it, and there's some distorted voice saying nonsense for 30 seconds. Then, you are forced to fight a  boring demon who at best is super easy to beat and just takes up the whole song and at worst is difficult to beat (but in a stupid way) and you have to play it again after he runs away! I've looked everywhere for an option to turn off the demons but can't find it anywhere.\n\nFinally, the UI is terrible. There's no folder system, you have to browse by filters, and even then you can only have one filter. When other games that build on your music have very robust folder systems, limiting you to a very minimal filter system is pathetic. And it takes FOREVER to change the filter.\n\nIt has some merits, but when you could just play audiosurf or beat hazard, why bother with this amateurish attempt? If someday they get rid of the demons and improve the UI, it might be worth a shot. Until then, just spend your time with something actually good.","June 3, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Any other combination is a recipe for a disaster.\n\nThe "storyline" of the campaign is cringeworthy at best and doesn't end up making much sense in the end. Thankfully it is mercifully brief. Oddly enough for a music based game, the music seems to affect the game surprisingly little during gameplay. While enemies do speed up and slow down with the music, how much their speed changes seems to have little to do with the soundtrack. In a slow song a moderately fast piece is enough to send the enemies to supersonic speeds that they might not reach at all in a song that has faster but unchanging beat throughout.\n\nThere are some nice ideas, like not getting points for destroyed enemies but from collecting the notes they drop and healing yourself from those same notes.\n\nThere are far more annoying features though, like rare, more powerful weapon types, that you get randomly. As these are a must have for higher difficulty levels and preferably you'd want 4 of your preferred type, or at least 2 of two different types, they end up being the only resource that actually matter. Everyghing else you will be piling up while trying to get those weapons.

To those not yet familiarized with this style, it consists of procedurally generated levels, and this procedure utilizes songs chosen by the user to create the levels. If you use the same song, it will always create the same level (if the difficulty chosen is the same, obviously).\n\nThe game is superb. The graphics and level of content in this game will keep you busy for a LOT of time. There is a lot to unlock and do in this game: you beat songs to get items, then you need to collect Kudos and Inspiration to unlock and upgrade these items. There are a lot of unlockables in this game and each song will unlock something;\n\nAn extremely enjoyable gameplay that is relaxing at earlier difficulties, but also can be very challenging at the hardest ones. The leaderboard system is awesome, it takes into consideration every aspect of your performance, including your ship power (the higher the power the less points you get). You can (and should) make ship builds in this game using the weapons and upgrades for optimal performance when beating songs.\n\nControls are straight-forward, you can even put auto-fire on separate weapons in your ship meaning it will fire without the need to press the left mouse button.\n\nThere is a bug which causes the game to crash when analyzing any MP3 songs, I have never seen anyone else with this issue though. All other music file extensions run just fine.\n\nLast but not least, another cool aspect of the game: To unlock difficulties you need to beat "demons" which randomly invade your songs. Those are pretty cool to fight (and challenging, too).\n\nRecommended!","June 14, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I said it. The dialogue interrupts the music (seriously?), the bosses are spammy and/or cheap, and the sounds they make are never in the same key or rhythm as the music.\n\nThere's no way to set up a playlist, or sort music by artist+album etc. Makes this feel less like a game than a tool or a toy.\n\nYou need to sign in to something for the leaderboards. I never looked into it, because I can't be RSed.\n\n\nOn to the good things: it's a simple shmup that's nice to look at, you get to listen to whatever music you like while you play it, and the game will fit the music, for the most part. The permanent, swappable upgrades are cool, too.\nThere's no need to go too wordy on what's good here.\nDid you like Galaga but wanted _more_ and wanted to listen to, say, Erasure or Slayer and actually have it work? Well, then get this.\n\nThere are better games for free, but they don't make a shmup level out of Legendary Pink Dots songs for you!\nPut simply: fun toy.","July 18, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Implementing random drops make players want to try new songs, but rare drops are too few and far between to want to keep trying for them, and buying upgrades makes getting new weapons pointless. Pre-scanning your music collection (I imagine, since you can't play the game otherwise) takes some of the load times out of the game, but not using the directories that the music is saved to makes finding songs more difficult than it needs to be. The game is beautiful, but enemies will always attack in the same patterns, and most of the music and tempo based game mechanics are incredibly superficial. The story feels entirely tacked on, with finding the symphony pieces utterly inconsequential to gameplay. Boss battles completely disrupt the flow of playing through songs, and are not the least bit fair to fight in later levels.\n\nThis game certainly has potential, but as it is now, it feels too in-cohesive to be great.","June 24, 2014","false","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Half the time I had no idea what I was doing in the game. Sure the main thing of a shooter is to shoot enemies, but even that needs to have a goal or objective. Symphony gives the story of how your music is being attacked by muisc demons and these mosnter are it's supposed minions. That's the context but I've not actually felt any motivation for shooting them.\n\nThis is an issue with the enemies themselves. They are not very memorable and are boring. They fly by in eradic manners that does not emulate the music at all and never seem to be very fun blowing them up. Sometimes it becomes a chore as they are not very difficult to put down but they have a high amount of health and require many bullets before they are destroyed\n\nMusic being the main selling point of this game, this game seems to use little or none of the muisc itself. Either that or the music annaylse algorithum is borked... I never felt like the game is influenced by music. Rock music has high ammount of muisc, quiet music has slow lesser amount of enemies.... Other than that the variation between songs is non existant.\n\nThe visuals at first was really pretty, I like the crystaline structure as it has a very clean serene feeling to it... unfortunately this gets boring and annoying fast. They never really take anything of the structure to create an environment, the enenmies conisst of boring shape that are repeated with no variations or imagination and the colour can be distracting and annyoing as it blends the bullets and enemies so that it becomes unnoticeable when they are shooting and ramming into you.\n\nThe weapon unlocking systme and progression can only be described with the pace of molasis. It's confusing, makes little sense, and doesn't feel very rewarding to progress. Why, because it unlocks more of the same thing without variations.\n\nBut the bottom line is, Symphony is not a muisc game, it's not visually appealing, and take away the gimmick aspect it's not a very well made game either.","October 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The goal of the game is, aside from getting to the end of whatever song you're playing, to shoot as many enemies as you can without getting killed yourself, and pick up points that drop from them. The types of enemies that spawn, as well as their intensity and flight patterns is based on the type of song you're playing, and how calm or intense that song is. Although you have infinite lives, the consequences for dying become steeper as you play on harder difficulty levels. Additionally, enemies also become stronger and more aggressive, leading to Symphony being a much less casual game than one would expect at first glance.\nMy favourite aspect of Symphony is the art style. While simplistic, with most objects being just prisms of light, it is also very remarkable and unique.

Beat Hazard was a little further removed, with enemy spawns seeming to have little correlation to anything, but the weapons, game speed, and visuals all flexing along to the music.\n\nNow we have Symphony, a game that is almost entirely removed from any relevance to the music being played. It's a decent shmup, letting you customize your ship with weapons and powerups unlocked through completing more songs in your library and successive difficulties opening up via occasional boss battles. It just happens to be playing your music in the background.\n\nIt controls well enough and runs nice and smoothly but ironically, I actually have MORE trouble figuring out what keeps blowing me up than I did in Beat Hazard, which is quite a feat.\n\nIt's alright I guess but given that they're all in a similar price range I'd recommend either of the other two before this one.","April 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You think you can move around something, but for some reason you still get damaged or even killed by that something.\nEven more annoying is the unlock system: Finish a song and you get a random (mostly weak or useless) weapon.

There were rare instances when the frenetic combat and the pounding beat seemed to synchronize, but more often than not the two bore little similarity to one another.

Noob (Nightmare Lyra)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmarelyre/","406 products in account","Symphony is a shoot-em-up space ship type game where you use your music to generate levels. If that sounds like Beat Hazard to you, then yes it does, only this is nowhere near as fun as Beat Hazard.\n\nRight of the bat the game loses points for trying to shoehorn story elements into a game that really don't need it and is happy to interrupt your game at annoying times with unskipable "cutscenes", which is nothing but some glowing eyes popping up on the screen and trying to be intimidating before you get a popup message about "how evil this thing is and it is destroying your music, you need to stop it". Cheesy bad stories like that can have their charm, but in this case it's just unecessary and kinda lame. The tutorial of the game is also mandotory and also very happy to interrupt and annoy you.\n\nI will give them credit for trying a interesting approach to the gameplay, by having your ship set at a fixed angle and the enemies coming in from the side most of the time, making dodging a bigger part of the game than in some other similar games where it is more about downing the enemy before it comes close to you, but all in all not being able to turn your ship becomes more annoying than a fun challenge really quickly. It's not even particularly hard, you have infinite extra lives and you regain health from picking up enemy drops, it's just mildly annoying. The weapons you unlock for beating songs really don't do much to change up gameplay beyond doing more damage or having different ammo either, and after 3 songs, one which included a boss battle, I was already bored.\n\nThe song setlist sorting is also poorly handled. Instead of the system used in Beat Hazard where you load one and one folder and can freely decide which subfolders to use, this game will automatically use ALL subfolders in a selected folder no matter what, so if you have all your music saved in the "My Music" folder but have subfolders in there with song stems, multitracks, demo versions etc. look forward to having to scroll through pages of stems. This is somewhat combated with available filters for albums and songs, but that doesn't help when it comes to WAV files who don't have that info saved in the files. Oh yeah, you also need a arbritary additional login inside of the game for your scores to be uploaded, which is just odd.\n\nI don't think the music gimmick was handled very well either, and I never felt like the music I picked had much to do with how the levels turned out. Seemed to be the same enemies and same lightshow no matter what I picked, and I wish they would have done more to make it feel like the music matters.\n\nAll in all, a mediocre game that I don't know why it exist in a world that already has Beat Hazard, a much better shoot-em-up spaceship game that uses the music gimmick to much better effect. It's ok if you like the genre and see it on a 70% sale, but it's not worth the current asking price IMO.","May 29, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, I'm referring to Beat Hazard.\nWhile Beat Hazard is certainly fun, the tiered unlock system leaves something to be desired. In Symphony, all items, whether they're ship weapons or power ups picked up in the game are generated per song. So each song is its own item, which can be unlocked or not, and upgraded or not. Oh, the choices.\nOther than that it's pretty straightforward. Lots of flashy neon graphics and the use of your own music means the replay value is high.

It's very, very fast paced and can be surprisingly difficult- and very stressful at times. I've never played Touhou or Ikaruga or anything of that nature (and I don't plan on doing so) but it's similar to that, from what I've seen of those games. Even when the mouse sensitivity is at 100%, I found my hand moving all over the mousepad and sometimes sticking to the mousepad when my hands got sweaty, thus straining my wrist.\n\nThere are some good concepts passed around such as an underlying story, unlockable items, a customizable ship, and an interesting difficulty system but ultimately, playing this game is more stressful than liberating. Integration of musical terms, pieces, and historical composers was definitely interesting. Also, the interaction between the software and the music is definitely novel (intriguing), with certain weapons and elements firing in tandem with certain musical elements and pacing of course following sound intensity and tempo.\n\nAnother thing I found interesting was how this game makes you feel like you have little control over the music you own, which  I guess means that the premise of the game (fighting for the liberation of your music) really does work. My music, however, to me is very personal. I bought and own this ♥♥♥♥ and I will declare ownership and mastery over it if I please. My music also felt skinned when in menus which have their own non-mutable soundtrack. The song browser was also inferior to the one in Audiosurf/Audiosurf 2.\n\nIn the end, it just doesn't match Audiosurf and Audiosurf 2, both of which are pleasantly engaging and exhibit an unparalelled experience in this genre.","September 29, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everytime I played a song on this game, I enjoyed myself. (Except when the hardness was too high or the song was slow. But we'll get to that later.) If you want a honest review, here it is.\n\nThe game is fun, a bit repetitive, but fun. I'm going to break this review down into three sections. Gameplay, Story, and Graphics.\n\nGameplay: The game is hard, challenging, and a thrill to play. If you have a mixed music library like I do it will be a great game. However, I do need to mention you have to buy a 1$ DLC to play with Itunes music. But since I got this game in a bundle, it was not a problem to pay a dollar for it. There is an assorted amount of mini-demons just waiting to be attacked, and while easy by themselves. The challenge comes when they attack you on all sides and you cannot hold out. Now while song to song was fun it does get repeatitive. Although it does calibrate your music to each level, the same mini-demons appear and do basically the same patterns in differnet places or number based on the song. Which is my first negative thing to say about the game. The game does shine however when the Demon battles comes every once in a while. These are exciting, especially with Rock music or J-pop playing in the background of an all out battle. All the demons have obvious weaknesses, it's just a challenge of exploiting them. Especially the last boss, who will non-stop shoot and only stays exposed for maybe two seconds. Overall, the game is fun but you need the right music. ANY SONG THAT IS SLOW WILL NOT BE FUN OR CHALLENGING. REMEMBER THIS BEFORE CHOOSING A SONG. One last thing to mention is difficulty. The game as I said before is hard, but becomes easier the more you play. As you upgrade your ship, you'll notice that impossible song you played before was the simpliest thing you need. It just takes time.\n\nStory: Believe it or not this game has a story that I was not aware of at the time I got this game. It's simple. There is a demon, he wants to take over world with the Symphony of Souls. You have to stop him. Even though this story was so simple however, I still found it exciting everytime the main villian takes over your screen and talks to you. With a simple story, I have to say they executed it well by mixing it in fine with the actual game. Could it have been better? Probobly. Was it good for this game? No doubt about it.\n\nGraphics: I don't like to talk about graphics, because really I don't care about graphics. So long as it has good gameplay and story... (Wait? Didn't this game have both? It did didn't it!) The graphics are great, had no problems, no bugs, no glitches, everything ran smoothly.\n\nOverall, it's a good game. Especially for the price I payed. (1.33) I think it does everything it promises and overall is fun.\n\nIf you didn't read the full review here's the jist of it.\n\nPositive\n+Extreme Replayability\n+Challenging\n+Story is Good\n+Graphics are Great\n\nNegative\n-Wish Story Could Be Deeper (Infinite Symphonies? What does that mean?)\n-Overly Repeatitive\n\nI give this game a 7/10. Get it","August 12, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Second, the mouse movements while navigating for songs (or when not playing a level in general) is finicky (to be fair, patches have been released, so EmptyClip is aware of this).

Symphony joins Beat Hazard, Audiosurf and the Polynominal in my growing collection of games that have me fight my own music, and I love it so far. In symphony an unspoken force has taken the world's greatest composers hostage and seeks to conqueor the world through music. You have to stop them by shooting them to hell with neon guns and seizure inducing weapons that will set your screen ablaze. Symphony uses your music to generate an enemy attack pattern that grows more intense as your music intensifies. Your vessel can be armed and upgraded to the teeth with the spoils gained. It's is as awesome as it sounds, but there are some minor gripes. Such as how the enemy attacks are hard to spot and navigating the menu to upgrade your weapons is bit cumbersome.

Although it's actually a fair bit better than that makes it sound...\nBasic idea is a top to bottom scrolling shoot-em-up where the levels are generated from your music collection. There is a little more to it though as you can gain more weapons and upgrade them by beating more songs. There is a kind of storyline as well but it's pretty throwaway imo. Would have enjoyed the game just as much without it.\nThe graphics are gorgeous and everything is synched amazingly well to both the sound and mood of the music. After the first few games I though it was a little boring but upping the difficulty level soon put me right on that score. (I played TEN songs on EASY before making it through without bying at least once!)\nI'm not sure it'll have much longevity but it's certainly a fun one for a while.","December 15, 2012","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the later games to be released, Symphony, is essentially a 2D shooter, but unlike Beat Hazard, the interface and style are much cleaner and based more around wire-frames and softer light effects. There is no ability to rotate your ship, however weapons attached to your ship (which I'll get to in a moment) can be rotated to shoot towards any direction.\n\nI compare this game mostly to Beat Hazard, as there is a sense of progression - you play songs, and upon completing a song unlock a weapon you can add to your ship. There are approximately eight weapons, which can be upgraded several levels to increase their power, and also 'super' variants of these weapons which are more rare unlocks and cost significantly more to upgrade. Upgrades are facilitated by spending points earned by playing songs. Playing songs on higher difficulty, with stronger enemies and an overabundance of them, earns more of these points. There are also two 'weapons' that appear as random drops on the play-field, and they can be upgraded as well.\n\nThis progression adds some time to the game, which for some can be a plus - compared to the more free-form style of Audiosurf. There is a story mode which isn't optional, however at any time you are free to choose which songs you play. After vanquishing the final 'boss' enemy which randomly appears during one of your songs , you can continue to play without that hinderance. Progressing through the story also unlocks difficulty levels.\n\nI admire the attempt to extend play-time through the use of a progression system, where the weapon unlocked by each song  is random, encouraging one to essentially grind through songs to secure desired weapons. The grinding itself should be organic anyway - the point of playing the game is enjoy one's music, is it not?\n\nWhile some aspects of the game are procedurely-generated, it's inevitable that at some point one will have 'seen it all', so to speak, and after that point it becomes a matter of how much one enjoys the mechanics. There are scoreboards for individual songs, although I don't find them to be as populated as Beat Hazard or Audiosurf. One thing I think would be nice would be a scoreboard for overall points accumulated, similar to the one provided in Beat Hazard.\n\nI can't speak towards the longevity of the game since that's based more around personal preferences; I do feel as though it's a finished project, however some DLC (free or not) that adds more weapons and enemy types would certainly extend its lifespan. As it is, you can see I've played around 80 hours (I believe), and I likely won't be picking it up again any time soon. I do enjoy these games, but find myself consistently coming back to Audiosurf (which is more thrilling and random), and rarely Beat Hazard (for the challenge and overall leaderboard).\n\nI would recommend this game for those who like the genre, and perhaps even fans of the 2D shooter field, however to those people I'd recommend Beat Hazard as a more intense experience. This game gets a thumbs up from me, even if it unfortunately has a limited life cycle.","April 24, 2014","true","71.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't expecting it to have a story, but it does. I give it kudos (haha. Kudos. You know. Point you get in the game. hahaha. ahem.) for having a nice story. The story is about a demon possessing the souls of the composers of your music and you need to defeat them as you you go along while playing. They appear in some songs and you fight them. Each time you beat one, you unlock a little bit of the symphony of souls, unlocking a new difficulty. I like the difficulty names. They are named after the italian words for how loud or soft you would play or sing on an instrument (pianissimo, piano, mezzopiano, mezzoforte, forte, fortissimo). The gameplay mechanics are decent, but they lag on my computer. It isn't as good as say beat hazard or audio surf, but it isn't bad either.  I enjoyed this game, but not too much.

Purpose.\nIn audiosurf, you're just collectng blocks for the sake of it. There's no real rhyme or reason as to why you are, you just are.\n\nIn this game, you fight against monsters who use your music against you, taking it away, and making you weaker. The intro struck me because the game throws you straight in front of these two glowing eyes and a glitchy demon voice, explaining how, 'Music is the product of intelligent beings' and how it's his gateway.\n\nYou fight to free parts of "The Symphony of Souls" which was created by the demon, or whatever he is for that manner, and his subordinates, who, coincidentally, are abducted composers. Go figure.\n\nThe weapon system is very cool, the fact that you can choose four different weapons, each working a different way, to fight off the waves.\n\nThe leaderboard system is interesting as well, because, the weaker you are, the higher your base score multiplier.\n\nYou also unlock different difficulty levels as you free parts of the Symphony.\n\nNow for the breakdown:\n\nPros:\nStory\nBuilt in song library\nFleshed out weapon system\nWeapon Customization (Upgrades, Rotration, firing type, etc)\nBosses\n\nCons:\nYou Die, A Lot (Unlimited lives though)\nHaving your own music makes the geme more personal\nLeaderboards don't always recognise songs\nMildly annoying firing effects\n\ntl;dr Veterans and newbies alike will enjoy this game that fuses elements of classic vertical shooters, and rhythm games","October 27, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy your current library of songs, you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe premise is basically a turbo-Galaga or Raiden, but instead of invaders from space, it's invaders into your musical library, with demons stealing the souls of your composers via their musical creations. Somehow you have a ship to save your music, but only while listening to it. Individual songs, once played through, unlock a powerup of some kind. These powerups can be upgraded as you rack up points.\n\nThe good points of this game:\n1) The way the enemies behave according to your music. If your music starts slow or comes to a lull during a song, the enemies mellow out slightly; the opposite is true if the music picks up and becomes more intense.\n\n2) The fact that your ship is customizable is really attractive. You can rotate the direction from where your weapons shoot, customize how the weapons are fired (click, auto attack, left or right mouse button, etc), and mixing and matching the items you unlock.\n\n3) Enemies are simple but varied. Heavier armored baddies slog downward toward you while weak and tiny baddies zoom everywhere. Enemy attacks are pretty ruthless, as most of them can one-shot you, though if they touch your ship your ship will be damaged but the smaller baddies will die on contact.\n\n4) Periodic and seemingly random boss battles show up during songs.\n\nThere were a few things I noticed that could be problems down the road.\n\n1) There are "levels" to each song. You play through seven difficulties of all your songs, each with baddies that scale appropriately. If you're playing this to get highscores, playing through songs that you don't care for or ones that you hate (because we all have artists that make that one song we can't stand) will make life a bit miserable for you as you play through each level of the song.\n\n2) The behavior of the enemies during a song is great, but is all reliant on the quality of the mastering during production/recording. I can see this be a bit of a drag when it comes to older albums or anything that hasn't been recently remastered. Also, "intensity" isn't necessarily a description of the song, as I had a couple play-throughs were a few Red Hot Chilli Peppers songs were a bit more insane than, say, a Dimmu Borger song.\n\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game and I'm glad I found it. If you've ever enjoyed any kind of rail-shooter, pick this one up and dust off your playlists. It's a great time killer and a great way to reconnect with some old songs you may not have listened to in awhile and, just maybe, go and look for some newer stuff to add to your musical collection.","August 24, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Creating its levels from your music library, it creates levels perfectly tuned to the music as if it were personally made, going in my opinion, way beyond the capabilities of Audiosurf in terms of level design. The controls with mouse and keyboard work well too, but a lack of controller support has me wanting. With an upgrade system and all for your ship, it only entices you more to play one more song. The only issue that I have with the game is the fact that you have to pay extra to access your itunes library which brings the entire price up to 10 USD.

It is really addicting in the beginning, because you'll be playing songs to unlock weapons for your ship and getting points to upgrade them. I really like that you can rotate the weapons around to make them shoot at different angles in the ship customization. The game is pretty easy, since you have infinite lives; so you can't fail. Each death however, does reduce your score and thus earn you less points.\n\nHowever the game does come with many flaws. The first annoyance is that there is no search feature for songs, like in Osu! So if you have a large library of songs, you can't use a search function to find the song you want to play. There is a filter system, but it's not optimal at all.\nAs for actual gameplay, some of the design choices will annoy you, your ship has an amazingly large hitbox and you barely have space to actually manoeuvre around. Enemies will spawn in front and at the side, so sometimes you will have absolutely no room to move at all. Some of the hits can one shot you. There are so many flashy particles on screen that you sometimes can't see the enemies or bullets coming.\nDying is one of the worst feeling ever, not because you lose points, but it feels like an eternity. When you die, you want to jump back right in, but instead you have to wait for quite some while before you respawn. When you respawn, you don't clear the screen of enemies, so if there are a lot of enemies left on screen, you'll end up dying again.\nAs you progress further into the game, it only goes downhill from there. At higher difficulty, more enemies spawn with higher hitpoints, making it frustrating to move around and survive. It does give you more points, but by the time you unlock the final difficulty, you would already have unlocked the normal weapons and upgrades you want. The only motivation for you to play the songs after 7 hours of playtime is to either hope for a rare weapon (which is just a more powerful version of the normal weapons you can unlock) or to progress the 'story' of the game.\n\nOveral I did had some fun with the game, but it comes with many annoyances. If you don't have a lot of music or don't like to listen to music, I wouldn't recommend the game; you need over 100 songs at least to fully enjoy the game. Also if you a hardcore Shoot 'Em Up player (like TouHou), you probably won't enjoy this game either. The game isn't 'challenging', but it is fun to shoot at stuff and get better weapons.\n\nI rate this game 63 out of 100 points.","November 19, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To start i've found that the game flows with your music much better than the other two. Beat Hazard didn't work the music element very well in my opinion, the screen looked neutrally cluttered on all sections apart from quiet ones, and enemy pattern changes wern't that noticable. In Symphony enemies constantly enter the screen to the beat, the dynamics change the speed and intensity of the enemies and your ship, and the world colour changes from a cool blue to a raging red. I also have to give it credit for having some sort of level progression. While Audiosurf and Beat Hazard were pretty much about picking a song, getting a score and that's that, Symphony has you playing a number of songs to eventually reach a boss battle within that certain artist. On top of this every time you complete a song you unlock a random item or weapon to attach to your ship, and you also have a small chance of unlocking rare and more powerful weapons if you're lucky. These can be upgraded to help you in the higher difficulty levels. Symphony just goes a lot deeper than the other two and is definitely worth a look.","August 28, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty good.\n\nA pretty good 2-D Galaga style shooting game which uses your own mp3 music files to control the number of enemies on screen and the speed with which they move. There are as many levels as you have mp3 files to play but despite that, the game becomes highly repetitive early on as the enemies only have a few patterns to their movement. There are several difficulty levels which help keep the game from becoming frustrating but the game's story kept me wanting to complete it for no other reason than so that I would not be pestered by the game's random boss fights. The game's goofy story is really more of an encumbrance to this game but it is still quite fun to play in between times. It would be more fun if one could change the game's somber, sad menu music (ironic for a game based on your music files) but the game's neon-saturated graphics are beautiful and impressive and the game runs well with no major bugs and few minor ones. Pretty good overall but not solidly good.

There are some things that make Symphony stand out.\n\nAt first launch of the game, an "unknown entity" has seized control of your music, and you must liberate your library by defeating 5 bosses. Not only does this game have an arcadey feel like AudioSruf and Beathazard do, but it also incorperates a story, which I think is really cool.\n\nWhen you play a round of one of your songs, you will die, however the song won't end and you'll be able to continue to the end of it (but your score will take a hit). After completing a new song you'll unlock a new weapon, and if you have enough Kudos and Insperation (earned by completing more songs), you can buy it and be able to equip it on your ship. So having a large music library is an advantage. Your ship can hold 4 weapons in any configuration you desire. You can even change the angle these weapons can fire, and the firing mode (fully automatic, semi-automatic, manually etc.), so there is a TON of varation to be experimented with.\n\nThis game supports all the formats you need (.MP3, OGG, FLAC, .WAV, and .AIFF are officially supported). Symphony will not play any song that is less than 1:30 minutes long, but there is no maximum cap.\n\nI love AudioSruf and Beathazard, but IMO this game has a lot more going for it, and I highly recommened it.\n\nFor Linux players, this is a good working port.

To get new weapons, you need to play different songs. Some weapons are rare, so that's one "trick" that increases the game's lifespan.\n\nIn order to get more difficulty levels (and to have some sort of story line, I guess) , you need to collect "composer's souls" to fully restore the Symphony of Souls. There are 5 pages, each page gives you a higher difficulty.\n\nIn order to get these souls, you need to kill the "demon" which randomly pops up in song.\n\nIf you want a game which uses your music library, get this rather than Audiosurf.","August 6, 2012","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/recommended/207750/","ViperZeroOne","ViperZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/","274 products in account","I'm not sure how to really explain this game.  It's kinda like a top-down space shooter, but takes place on a stationary square area.  You move your ship around with the mouse, shooting enemies on static paths while avoiding being shot or run into yourself.  The game comes with a series of music, which I haven't really listened to, but the best part is you can use your own music library.  Each song is a "level" where you earn 2 different kind of points in order to unlock better weapons and abilities.  The difficulty also incresaes with each level completed, and you can even select various difficulties if your song allows it.  The enemies, who have "infected" your music library, basically react (speed & agressiveness) to the music.  If you're familiar with the songs you can somewhat anticipate when things will get a bit more rough.\n\nGame explaination aside, I find this a pretty fun game to pass the time.  Each level is literally the length of the song, and the occasional "boss duel" breaks up the staleness of doing virtually the same fight over and over again.  The only downside I found to the game is during the enterance and exit of a boss duel when the "eyes" take over the screen but the action isn't stopping in the background.  It's very hard to see what you're doing and stay alive when the voice is exclaiming "Ahhhhh!"...\n\nThat said, because you can use your own standard MP3 music files, I find this game very enjoyable and would honestly recommend it to anyone who loves mixing music with gaming.","June 24, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The subwoofer is actually the best music weapon since it automatically fires to the bass in the song that is currently playing.\nIt's true that in harder difficulties the play area is filled with enemies while also being too small while your ship is too big so you get hit a lot.

I’ve played Beat Hazard to death, Gradius, R-Type and other games of the SHMUP genre and I imagined Symphony would be just as awesome, but it didn’t live up to my expectations.\n\nThe gameplay starts with the easiest difficulty and you climb your way up. Within each level you kill ships of various forms that move according to the music. The faster the beat, the faster the enemy ships but the more score you can get. As you defeat bosses and unlock more pieces of the Symphony of Souls, you unlock more enemies as well as additional changes to earn more inspiration and kudos (currencies used to buy ship guns and upgrades).\n\nEach song has one hidden weapon or perk that is revealed once the song is finished. Upon beating the song, one has the opportunity to buy it at that point or later. The player ship has four gun slots that can be customized to the player’s preference. Controls are simple and there is no death (not finishing the song) but one might not get any rewards.  However, thanks to the above SHMUP games I’ve played before, there are some things that I expect that don’t happen or aren’t logical in the game. Others might find some of these quirks desirable and enjoyable but sadly I don’t. Some of these I can work around while others are just plain frustrating.  So personally I wouldn’t recommend it, but if it’s your cup of tea you may enjoy it. Here are the quirks that I don’t like.\n\nOne example is if you play a harder difficulty, you should get more inspiration and kudos. However, the amount of inspiration you get decreases after the third difficulty, and I can only wonder if the hardest difficulty gives you even more  than the third. On the other hand, you do get crazy amount of kudos which, while nice, isn’t needed too much in upgrades. By playing enough songs to get to the fifth difficulty, I accumulated more kudos than I seemed to need, making the harder difficulties only worth it for score and not for resources. Boss unlocks still happen at lower difficulties which makes sense, for those that aren’t good with the genre.\n\nShip parts seem to consist of mainly subwoofers (guns that fire to the beat of the music), shotguns, and the occasional rocket launcher. One unlocks the ability to buy a single gun or perk that appears when a song is beaten. While these guns are better than nothing, the guns I want, double guns, seem to be far and few between. One might assume this isn’t a problem once the ship is loaded the way you want, but unfortunately it is. Given each difficulty, you get a score multiplier, determined by the attack volley total of your guns. As the difficulty increases, the strength of the guns can increase without having the multiplier dip below 1. Because guns can’t be de-leveled, this leads to a perplexing problem. If I play at a higher difficulty and switch down, I’m too strong so I can only equip one or two of the guns. Given the gameplay mechanics, if I get hit in that spot I lose the gun until I can pick up another note, which without guns is very hard to do. With multiple weaker guns, I can take a hit but I can’t de-level. There’s no store either, so I’m left with lots of crappy guns I can buy that I probably don’t want to use, or I end up using only one good gun.\n\nFor now I have the invincibility and bomb perks which make me invincible for a few seconds so I can melee ships (for no musical note) and create an explosion that takes out a good chunk of the screen, respectively. My main issues are the inability to store bombs, and bombs that kill the user. For the first issue, bombs are sometimes dropped when you kill a chain of enemies. The problem is that I might just run into the bomb, because I want the musical note that the enemy dropped. However, the bomb activates as soon as I touch it, so this leads to a waste of a bomb. Worse yet is when the bomb spawns on the spawn point and I hit it once I spawn. Bombs might not even spawn at the most useful times, forcing the player to evade the item if they want to avoid using it, leading to a weird play style of avoiding powerups. Similar issues exist for the invincibility so I wish there was a way to store it, as oppose to littering the screen and avoiding stuff. If nothing else, make the bomb smaller and possibly force the user to stay on it for a second, as opposed to just activating on impact.\n\nFor the second issue, a bomb grants no invincibility. However, there is one type of enemy which explodes on impact. This leads to one’s death if one runs into a bomb while this enemy is close, creating another powerup-related problem. Shots are not destroyed, making it difficult to evade if one doesn’t notice the shot fired just before they die. In rarer cases, I’ve gotten four bombs in a row and getting one would kill me, limiting my motion. Related to this issue is that score does NOT increase unless one picks up notes.  Because of this, at harder difficulties the game turns into running into the crowd just to get notes.\n\nSome of the comments above exist because this game doesn’t follow the norm, and it is indeed a fallacy to assume that games should follow the norm. However, at least give me the ability to downgrade weapons and logically make it so that harder difficulty results in both more kudos AND more inspiration. A weapon store or at least a preview ability to know what I will unlock would be nice. Possibly give me a store too and a smaller ship hit box, but that might be asking too much.\n\nDespite all the ranting and blocks of text, it is a beautiful game with awesome boss fights that show up and create a story about your music. Customizing ships with different guns is an excellent feature that some games might overlook, although it can make the game really easy too. Moving with the beat and shooting enemies is always fun, but can also be annoying in strange ways due to the above. Yet, that’s always not a bad thing.  Perhaps I’m too used to certain things existing in this genre, but that’s how I roll. In all likelihood I’ll get to the last difficulty and stop.\n\nEDIT 1:Another issue I've found is the lack of audio cues for when invinciblity will fade. This leads to the rare, ram into your death scenario which rarely helps considering how there's roughly a five to ten second delay penality for getting a new ship.","April 12, 2014","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kinda like a top-down space shooter, but takes place on a stationary square area.  You move your ship around with the mouse, shooting enemies on static paths while avoiding being shot or run into yourself.  The game comes with a series of music, which I haven't really listened to, but the best part is you can use your own music library.  Each song is a "level" where you earn 2 different kind of points in order to unlock better weapons and abilities.  The difficulty also incresaes with each level completed, and you can even select various difficulties if your song allows it.  The enemies, who have "infected" your music library, basically react (speed & agressiveness) to the music.  If you're familiar with the songs you can somewhat anticipate when things will get a bit more rough.\n\nGame explaination aside, I find this a pretty fun game to pass the time.  Each level is literally the length of the song, and the occasional "boss duel" breaks up the staleness of doing virtually the same fight over and over again.  The only downside I found to the game is during the enterance and exit of a boss duel when the "eyes" take over the screen but the action isn't stopping in the background.  It's very hard to see what you're doing and stay alive when the voice is exclaiming "Ahhhhh!"...\n\nThat said, because you can use your own standard MP3 music files, I find this game very enjoyable and would honestly recommend it to anyone who loves mixing music with gaming.","June 24, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the base concept is great there are numerous problems which make the game the 'barely recommended' in my opinion.\nThe concept is that you import you own music into the game and the enemies react to your music. Kind of like Audiosurf where the blocks appear to the beat of the music. The problem is that while in Autiosurf the mechanism work pretty well, in Symphony it's not really. Sure the pace of the enemies grows as the music arrives to a faster part, but other than that nothing and it's somewhat disappointing.\nBut even with the primary feature it could be a fun game, but the greater issue is that the game is really repetitive after 1-2 hours basically and there is very little content to play around.\n-There are few weapons, most of them are puny and you would not use it anyway.\n-You will keep looting the same ♥♥♥♥ from music (same weapons that you have like 50)\n-No ship customization, or choose/build your own ship\n-Only 3 power ups (invincibility, bomb, "power up")\n-Same bosses over and over again\n-Few enemy types who arrive in the same pattern\n-and so on...\nSo you can see that there are problems with the game that overshadow the great concept which this game has.\n\nI would only recommend if you can get it for a low price of 1-2 EUR, because the overall game if Fun for a time, but it fails in some levels of detail and mechanic as explained above.\n\n5/10","March 14, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would thoroughly reccommend this game to anyone who likes music.","June 17, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got to admit, that I’m quite unfamiliar with the genre of Shoot ‘Em Ups, so keep this in mind when I criticize the gameplay.\nThe engine of this game generates levels out of your music library. So the same song, on the same difficulty level, will always play out the same. This engine works really good. The intensity of the song reflects directly in the gameplay (and visuals). The aggressiveness of enemies changes with the intensity of the song. The intensity level is always in relation to the song, so even high-speed heavy metal songs have phases of “slower” gameplay and less aggressive enemies. Enemies enter the “battlefield” according to the rhythm of the song, fire their weapons accordingly and their general speed changes with the intensity of the song. The art style is gorgeous, in my opinion. The bright neon colours reflect the intensity of the song and enemies. The problem with this reduced art style is that enemy projectiles can be hard to see on the red background. And I felt sometimes like the game just randomly killed me. Especially on harder difficulties, when a lot of enemies race around the screen, the game can get really confusing and even frustrating. At times there are so many enemies on the screen that there is almost no room to navigate any more. This, however, is a problem exclusive to the higher difficulties. As I said before, this might be due to my inexperience with this genre.\nAfter all I got ( and still get) a lot of fun out of this game. On lower difficulties it’s just beautiful to see the engine at work and it is definitely fun as hell to shoot your way through your favourite songs.","June 17, 2014","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kinda like a top-down space shooter, but takes place on a stationary square area.  You move your ship around with the mouse, shooting enemies on static paths while avoiding being shot or run into yourself.  The game comes with a series of music, which I haven't really listened to, but the best part is you can use your own music library.  Each song is a "level" where you earn 2 different kind of points in order to unlock better weapons and abilities.  The difficulty also incresaes with each level completed, and you can even select various difficulties if your song allows it.  The enemies, who have "infected" your music library, basically react (speed & agressiveness) to the music.  If you're familiar with the songs you can somewhat anticipate when things will get a bit more rough.\n\nGame explaination aside, I find this a pretty fun game to pass the time.  Each level is literally the length of the song, and the occasional "boss duel" breaks up the staleness of doing virtually the same fight over and over again.  The only downside I found to the game is during the enterance and exit of a boss duel when the "eyes" take over the screen but the action isn't stopping in the background.  It's very hard to see what you're doing and stay alive when the voice is exclaiming "Ahhhhh!"...\n\nThat said, because you can use your own standard MP3 music files, I find this game very enjoyable and would honestly recommend it to anyone who loves mixing music with gaming.","June 24, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the later games to be released, Symphony, is essentially a 2D shooter, but unlike Beat Hazard, the interface and style are much cleaner and based more around wire-frames and softer light effects. There is no ability to rotate your ship, however weapons attached to your ship (which I'll get to in a moment) can be rotated to shoot towards any direction.\n\nI compare this game mostly to Beat Hazard, as there is a sense of progression - you play songs, and upon completing a song unlock a weapon you can add to your ship. There are approximately eight weapons, which can be upgraded several levels to increase their power, and also 'super' variants of these weapons which are more rare unlocks and cost significantly more to upgrade. Upgrades are facilitated by spending points earned by playing songs. Playing songs on higher difficulty, with stronger enemies and an overabundance of them, earns more of these points. There are also two 'weapons' that appear as random drops on the play-field, and they can be upgraded as well.\n\nThis progression adds some time to the game, which for some can be a plus - compared to the more free-form style of Audiosurf. There is a story mode which isn't optional, however at any time you are free to choose which songs you play. After vanquishing the final 'boss' enemy which randomly appears during one of your songs , you can continue to play without that hinderance. Progressing through the story also unlocks difficulty levels.\n\nI admire the attempt to extend play-time through the use of a progression system, where the weapon unlocked by each song  is random, encouraging one to essentially grind through songs to secure desired weapons. The grinding itself should be organic anyway - the point of playing the game is enjoy one's music, is it not?\n\nWhile some aspects of the game are procedurely-generated, it's inevitable that at some point one will have 'seen it all', so to speak, and after that point it becomes a matter of how much one enjoys the mechanics. There are scoreboards for individual songs, although I don't find them to be as populated as Beat Hazard or Audiosurf. One thing I think would be nice would be a scoreboard for overall points accumulated, similar to the one provided in Beat Hazard.\n\nI can't speak towards the longevity of the game since that's based more around personal preferences; I do feel as though it's a finished project, however some DLC (free or not) that adds more weapons and enemy types would certainly extend its lifespan. As it is, you can see I've played around 80 hours (I believe), and I likely won't be picking it up again any time soon. I do enjoy these games, but find myself consistently coming back to Audiosurf (which is more thrilling and random), and rarely Beat Hazard (for the challenge and overall leaderboard).\n\nI would recommend this game for those who like the genre, and perhaps even fans of the 2D shooter field, however to those people I'd recommend Beat Hazard as a more intense experience. This game gets a thumbs up from me, even if it unfortunately has a limited life cycle.","April 24, 2014","true","71.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I’ve played Beat Hazard to death, Gradius, R-Type and other games of the SHMUP genre and I imagined Symphony would be just as awesome, but it didn’t live up to my expectations.\n\nThe gameplay starts with the easiest difficulty and you climb your way up. Within each level you kill ships of various forms that move according to the music. The faster the beat, the faster the enemy ships but the more score you can get. As you defeat bosses and unlock more pieces of the Symphony of Souls, you unlock more enemies as well as additional changes to earn more inspiration and kudos (currencies used to buy ship guns and upgrades).\n\nEach song has one hidden weapon or perk that is revealed once the song is finished. Upon beating the song, one has the opportunity to buy it at that point or later. The player ship has four gun slots that can be customized to the player’s preference. Controls are simple and there is no death (not finishing the song) but one might not get any rewards.  However, thanks to the above SHMUP games I’ve played before, there are some things that I expect that don’t happen or aren’t logical in the game. Others might find some of these quirks desirable and enjoyable but sadly I don’t. Some of these I can work around while others are just plain frustrating.  So personally I wouldn’t recommend it, but if it’s your cup of tea you may enjoy it. Here are the quirks that I don’t like.\n\nOne example is if you play a harder difficulty, you should get more inspiration and kudos. However, the amount of inspiration you get decreases after the third difficulty, and I can only wonder if the hardest difficulty gives you even more  than the third. On the other hand, you do get crazy amount of kudos which, while nice, isn’t needed too much in upgrades. By playing enough songs to get to the fifth difficulty, I accumulated more kudos than I seemed to need, making the harder difficulties only worth it for score and not for resources. Boss unlocks still happen at lower difficulties which makes sense, for those that aren’t good with the genre.\n\nShip parts seem to consist of mainly subwoofers (guns that fire to the beat of the music), shotguns, and the occasional rocket launcher. One unlocks the ability to buy a single gun or perk that appears when a song is beaten. While these guns are better than nothing, the guns I want, double guns, seem to be far and few between. One might assume this isn’t a problem once the ship is loaded the way you want, but unfortunately it is. Given each difficulty, you get a score multiplier, determined by the attack volley total of your guns. As the difficulty increases, the strength of the guns can increase without having the multiplier dip below 1. Because guns can’t be de-leveled, this leads to a perplexing problem. If I play at a higher difficulty and switch down, I’m too strong so I can only equip one or two of the guns. Given the gameplay mechanics, if I get hit in that spot I lose the gun until I can pick up another note, which without guns is very hard to do. With multiple weaker guns, I can take a hit but I can’t de-level. There’s no store either, so I’m left with lots of crappy guns I can buy that I probably don’t want to use, or I end up using only one good gun.\n\nFor now I have the invincibility and bomb perks which make me invincible for a few seconds so I can melee ships (for no musical note) and create an explosion that takes out a good chunk of the screen, respectively. My main issues are the inability to store bombs, and bombs that kill the user. For the first issue, bombs are sometimes dropped when you kill a chain of enemies. The problem is that I might just run into the bomb, because I want the musical note that the enemy dropped. However, the bomb activates as soon as I touch it, so this leads to a waste of a bomb. Worse yet is when the bomb spawns on the spawn point and I hit it once I spawn. Bombs might not even spawn at the most useful times, forcing the player to evade the item if they want to avoid using it, leading to a weird play style of avoiding powerups. Similar issues exist for the invincibility so I wish there was a way to store it, as oppose to littering the screen and avoiding stuff. If nothing else, make the bomb smaller and possibly force the user to stay on it for a second, as opposed to just activating on impact.\n\nFor the second issue, a bomb grants no invincibility. However, there is one type of enemy which explodes on impact. This leads to one’s death if one runs into a bomb while this enemy is close, creating another powerup-related problem. Shots are not destroyed, making it difficult to evade if one doesn’t notice the shot fired just before they die. In rarer cases, I’ve gotten four bombs in a row and getting one would kill me, limiting my motion. Related to this issue is that score does NOT increase unless one picks up notes.  Because of this, at harder difficulties the game turns into running into the crowd just to get notes.\n\nSome of the comments above exist because this game doesn’t follow the norm, and it is indeed a fallacy to assume that games should follow the norm. However, at least give me the ability to downgrade weapons and logically make it so that harder difficulty results in both more kudos AND more inspiration. A weapon store or at least a preview ability to know what I will unlock would be nice. Possibly give me a store too and a smaller ship hit box, but that might be asking too much.\n\nDespite all the ranting and blocks of text, it is a beautiful game with awesome boss fights that show up and create a story about your music. Customizing ships with different guns is an excellent feature that some games might overlook, although it can make the game really easy too. Moving with the beat and shooting enemies is always fun, but can also be annoying in strange ways due to the above. Yet, that’s always not a bad thing.  Perhaps I’m too used to certain things existing in this genre, but that’s how I roll. In all likelihood I’ll get to the last difficulty and stop.\n\nEDIT 1:Another issue I've found is the lack of audio cues for when invinciblity will fade. This leads to the rare, ram into your death scenario which rarely helps considering how there's roughly a five to ten second delay penality for getting a new ship.","April 12, 2014","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably yes.\n\nThis game is very similar to Audiosurf, but while 'Surf tests your reflexes, Symphony goes after both your reflexes and your ability to adapt/powerplay. You basically play through your music library, first to stop an interdimensional nameless menace that threatens this existence, and once you've beaten it, to improve your scores and acquire rare arsenal.\n\nThe concept is pretty neat, the story gets you along without cluttering anything at all (albeit a bit short) and while the gameplay is simple, this game has the best replayability ever: every new song, every new track you acquire is a new challenge. You could keep playing this game for years. I know I will.\n\nFor a casual game, you can't get better. Infinite replayability (even once you have acquired all rare weapons) and a solid challenge for everyone.\n\nCons? No gamepad support, and you have to buy a $1 USD add-on to be able to play your iTunes songs natively. And it all depends on what kind of music you have and play with this (electronic/really heavy metal/up-beat rock are among the best genres you can use with Symphony).","June 23, 2014","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To start i've found that the game flows with your music much better than the other two. Beat Hazard didn't work the music element very well in my opinion, the screen looked neutrally cluttered on all sections apart from quiet ones, and enemy pattern changes wern't that noticable. In Symphony enemies constantly enter the screen to the beat, the dynamics change the speed and intensity of the enemies and your ship, and the world colour changes from a cool blue to a raging red. I also have to give it credit for having some sort of level progression. While Audiosurf and Beat Hazard were pretty much about picking a song, getting a score and that's that, Symphony has you playing a number of songs to eventually reach a boss battle within that certain artist. On top of this every time you complete a song you unlock a random item or weapon to attach to your ship, and you also have a small chance of unlocking rare and more powerful weapons if you're lucky. These can be upgraded to help you in the higher difficulty levels. Symphony just goes a lot deeper than the other two and is definitely worth a look.","August 28, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is essentially Galaga except you can listen to your own music. Problem is, it's basically like playing Galaga while listening to a song on your iPod. Music barely effects how the game plays out. A lot of songs don't work well unless they have very distinct, strong beats or speed up very dramatically. During parts where the music speeds up a lot the screen turns red and enemies spawn faster and that's about it. Every song plays out pretty much exactly the same, and the game also occasionally throws the same boss at you over and over which you need to beat just to unlock the next difficulty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakemagic/recommended/207750/","cakemagic","cakemagic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakemagic/","121 products in account","Good for casual fun\nThis game is fairly entertaining and good if you want to blow something up while listening to your music. It is really addicting in the beginning, because you'll be playing songs to unlock weapons for your ship and getting points to upgrade them. I really like that you can rotate the weapons around to make them shoot at different angles in the ship customization. The game is pretty easy, since you have infinite lives; so you can't fail. Each death however, does reduce your score and thus earn you less points.\n\nHowever the game does come with many flaws. The first annoyance is that there is no search feature for songs, like in Osu! So if you have a large library of songs, you can't use a search function to find the song you want to play. There is a filter system, but it's not optimal at all.\nAs for actual gameplay, some of the design choices will annoy you, your ship has an amazingly large hitbox and you barely have space to actually manoeuvre around. Enemies will spawn in front and at the side, so sometimes you will have absolutely no room to move at all. Some of the hits can one shot you. There are so many flashy particles on screen that you sometimes can't see the enemies or bullets coming.\nDying is one of the worst feeling ever, not because you lose points, but it feels like an eternity. When you die, you want to jump back right in, but instead you have to wait for quite some while before you respawn. When you respawn, you don't clear the screen of enemies, so if there are a lot of enemies left on screen, you'll end up dying again.\nAs you progress further into the game, it only goes downhill from there. At higher difficulty, more enemies spawn with higher hitpoints, making it frustrating to move around and survive. It does give you more points, but by the time you unlock the final difficulty, you would already have unlocked the normal weapons and upgrades you want. The only motivation for you to play the songs after 7 hours of playtime is to either hope for a rare weapon (which is just a more powerful version of the normal weapons you can unlock) or to progress the 'story' of the game.\n\nOveral I did had some fun with the game, but it comes with many annoyances. If you don't have a lot of music or don't like to listen to music, I wouldn't recommend the game; you need over 100 songs at least to fully enjoy the game. Also if you a hardcore Shoot 'Em Up player (like TouHou), you probably won't enjoy this game either. The game isn't 'challenging', but it is fun to shoot at stuff and get better weapons.\n\nI rate this game 63 out of 100 points.","November 19, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays a bit like Galaga, although you have much more control over how you move your ship. The music you chose changes when the enemies enter the screen and how fast they move, and sometimes alters their firing patterns. It's kinda hard to pick up on when it's happening, though. The effect is far more apparent and noticible on something that focuses on a strong beat rather than other instruments (Teeth by Lady Gaga is a good example of where you can see it easily). Progression is rewarding, as you unlock weapons and items to buy after beating any new song, and then use those to customize your ship. The biggest downside is that, as of right now, it's still somewhat buggy and a CPU hog, but the dev is working with the Steam community daily to put out new betas and fix these problems.\n\nNot the best .mp3 game, but still pretty good.","September 3, 2012","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got to admit, that I’m quite unfamiliar with the genre of Shoot ‘Em Ups, so keep this in mind when I criticize the gameplay.\nThe engine of this game generates levels out of your music library. So the same song, on the same difficulty level, will always play out the same. This engine works really good. The intensity of the song reflects directly in the gameplay (and visuals). The aggressiveness of enemies changes with the intensity of the song. The intensity level is always in relation to the song, so even high-speed heavy metal songs have phases of “slower” gameplay and less aggressive enemies. Enemies enter the “battlefield” according to the rhythm of the song, fire their weapons accordingly and their general speed changes with the intensity of the song. The art style is gorgeous, in my opinion. The bright neon colours reflect the intensity of the song and enemies. The problem with this reduced art style is that enemy projectiles can be hard to see on the red background. And I felt sometimes like the game just randomly killed me. Especially on harder difficulties, when a lot of enemies race around the screen, the game can get really confusing and even frustrating. At times there are so many enemies on the screen that there is almost no room to navigate any more. This, however, is a problem exclusive to the higher difficulties. As I said before, this might be due to my inexperience with this genre.\nAfter all I got ( and still get) a lot of fun out of this game. On lower difficulties it’s just beautiful to see the engine at work and it is definitely fun as hell to shoot your way through your favourite songs.","June 17, 2014","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the logo, it looked like it was going to be boring as hell and pretentious. But once I installed and got it going, I was pleasently surprised. This game takes a unique concept-scan every single music file on your hard drive (iTunes music is excluded because .AAC files aren't compatible-the only downside), and create a bullet hell game about a horde of demons invading music-your music. Sounds ludicrous enough, but what really makes this game work is that not only each "level" designed like a traditional bullet hell game, but you get to play it as your music's blasting in the background with varying difficulty depending on the song.

Purpose.\nIn audiosurf, you're just collectng blocks for the sake of it. There's no real rhyme or reason as to why you are, you just are.\n\nIn this game, you fight against monsters who use your music against you, taking it away, and making you weaker. The intro struck me because the game throws you straight in front of these two glowing eyes and a glitchy demon voice, explaining how, 'Music is the product of intelligent beings' and how it's his gateway.\n\nYou fight to free parts of "The Symphony of Souls" which was created by the demon, or whatever he is for that manner, and his subordinates, who, coincidentally, are abducted composers. Go figure.\n\nThe weapon system is very cool, the fact that you can choose four different weapons, each working a different way, to fight off the waves.\n\nThe leaderboard system is interesting as well, because, the weaker you are, the higher your base score multiplier.\n\nYou also unlock different difficulty levels as you free parts of the Symphony.\n\nNow for the breakdown:\n\nPros:\nStory\nBuilt in song library\nFleshed out weapon system\nWeapon Customization (Upgrades, Rotration, firing type, etc)\nBosses\n\nCons:\nYou Die, A Lot (Unlimited lives though)\nHaving your own music makes the geme more personal\nLeaderboards don't always recognise songs\nMildly annoying firing effects\n\ntl;dr Veterans and newbies alike will enjoy this game that fuses elements of classic vertical shooters, and rhythm games","October 27, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every now and so often you are confronted by a boss fight, which when beaten unlocks part of a music page. The aim of the game is to unlock all the music sheets and rid the Universe of the big bad honcho.\n\nEnemy variety is lacking and the game can become monotonous.

There are some things that make Symphony stand out.\n\nAt first launch of the game, an "unknown entity" has seized control of your music, and you must liberate your library by defeating 5 bosses. Not only does this game have an arcadey feel like AudioSruf and Beathazard do, but it also incorperates a story, which I think is really cool.\n\nWhen you play a round of one of your songs, you will die, however the song won't end and you'll be able to continue to the end of it (but your score will take a hit). After completing a new song you'll unlock a new weapon, and if you have enough Kudos and Insperation (earned by completing more songs), you can buy it and be able to equip it on your ship. So having a large music library is an advantage. Your ship can hold 4 weapons in any configuration you desire. You can even change the angle these weapons can fire, and the firing mode (fully automatic, semi-automatic, manually etc.), so there is a TON of varation to be experimented with.\n\nThis game supports all the formats you need (.MP3, OGG, FLAC, .WAV, and .AIFF are officially supported). Symphony will not play any song that is less than 1:30 minutes long, but there is no maximum cap.\n\nI love AudioSruf and Beathazard, but IMO this game has a lot more going for it, and I highly recommened it.\n\nFor Linux players, this is a good working port.

Although the base concept is great there are numerous problems which make the game the 'barely recommended' in my opinion.\nThe concept is that you import you own music into the game and the enemies react to your music. Kind of like Audiosurf where the blocks appear to the beat of the music. The problem is that while in Autiosurf the mechanism work pretty well, in Symphony it's not really. Sure the pace of the enemies grows as the music arrives to a faster part, but other than that nothing and it's somewhat disappointing.\nBut even with the primary feature it could be a fun game, but the greater issue is that the game is really repetitive after 1-2 hours basically and there is very little content to play around.\n-There are few weapons, most of them are puny and you would not use it anyway.\n-You will keep looting the same ♥♥♥♥ from music (same weapons that you have like 50)\n-No ship customization, or choose/build your own ship\n-Only 3 power ups (invincibility, bomb, "power up")\n-Same bosses over and over again\n-Few enemy types who arrive in the same pattern\n-and so on...\nSo you can see that there are problems with the game that overshadow the great concept which this game has.\n\nI would only recommend if you can get it for a low price of 1-2 EUR, because the overall game if Fun for a time, but it fails in some levels of detail and mechanic as explained above.\n\n5/10","March 14, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a shmup type of scrolling shooting game, where you have to liberate your music. And by "Liberating your music", i mean it by, you can use your OWN custom music of your choice, which then gets generated the level of the music, and you must destroy little "musical notes" (the enemy ships) in order to "liberate your music".\n\nNow this game, 65% of the time, does a REALLY good job at analyzing your music. The more intense your music is, the more aggressive the enemies. And if your music's rhythm is audible (loud and steady percussion), the enemies will spawn and attack on rhythm beats.\n\nAnd now before anyone compares this to Beat Hazard, lemme tell you some stuff about this game:\n- It's simpler\n- Has no epileptically dangerous flashing effects, but still looks pretty\n- I don't like Beat Hazard, mostly because of the 2nd reason above.\n- And Beat Hazard sucks\n\nIf you have a good amount of Dance, Pop, Electronic, and even Classical music, give this a try, and start liberating your favorite music from the evil Demon, trying to possess your music's soul!","September 16, 2013","true","58.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is essentially Galaga except you can listen to your own music. Problem is, it's basically like playing Galaga while listening to a song on your iPod.

During parts where the music speeds up a lot the screen turns red and enemies spawn faster and that's about it.

Unlike most shooters which have a preset sequence of levels and enemies, "Symphony" takes that aspect to a new level by having YOUR music be the means by which the game determines the enemy roll-call. Now you can blast enemies listening to anything from "Freebird" to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, in lovely blues, purples, reds, and oranges of many hues.\n\nBut how does it work? "Symphony" reads whatever audio file you ask it to read, takes note of its tempo, number of notes, duration, and dynamics, then creates a swarm of enemies that will come flying in. The number of enemies and their pattern depends on what point in the song you are at. A moment where things start getting more intense on screen could include a sudden screaming session by the band's vocalist, or a swell of crescendos. Then, the game may decide to dial it back when things calm down and the orchestration thins out. The game is good at making enemies that respond to the music, both in number and movement.\n\nThe level of customization that comes with your ship is pretty expansive. Each upgrade has some aspect about it that makes it a possible candidate for your ship. Some are straight lasers which is helpful for accuracy, but lack power. Others like the Subwoofer can take out some of the game's stronger enemies pretty easily, but trying to master them is easier said than done. You can also tilt the direction in which some upgrades fire. There is no "universal weapon" that will smite anything at anytime, so experimentation is recommended and encouraged.\n\nAs the ship gets damaged, you will lose upgrades, but they are replenishable by picking up notes from fallen enemies. Also, the level of upgrades you have affects your ability to get the game's currency, which is required for purchasing new weapons and/or upgrading them. Since the potential for what the game could throw at you is huge, you may find one particular group of upgrades fail at one song, despite them working in another. This will become more evident as the difficulty levels get higher. Sometimes the game feels a little cheap with what it will throw at you. Enemies are stronger, shielded, more numerous, more "special enemies" come out, etc.\n\nThe other slight criticisms I have are for 1) the audio itself. While it was fun to blast enemies to my favorite Beatles and JS Bach tracks, I found the sound effects to outweigh the music a little too much. After all, the music is the game's main gimmick, so I was surprised that the base audio for the music wasn't quite high enough. Though I'll admit, this is more for my personal audio aesthetic, so make of that what you will. The other is 2) the scanning. While I have no issue with scanning the songs for the actual levels, "Symphony" sometimes will not recognize songs in my iTunes library. I have done rescans and whatnot several times, but with no luck. This cut down my options for tracks from about 3400 to around 900. Still plenty to choose from, but WOW! It also won't recognize tracks under 90 seconds.\n\nIn short, "Symphony" is a wonderful new spin on the shooter genre, and despite the shortcomings, particularly with available tracks to the number of tracks to scan, it is a welcome addition to my Steam library. Anyone with a large music collection, or a fan of shooters, will most likely enjoy this game. I certainly did.\n\n***1/2/**** (high recommendation)","October 3, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A vertical SHMUP that hardly seems like it's powered by your music and something that I wish could have just been better overall.\n\nIt's playable with both a controller and a mouse however with a mouse you have a lot more control on where your ship goes because the ship moves as fast as you move your mouse. In the options menu you can change the sensitivity of the in-game mouse but for some reason, because I thought the sensitivity wasn't high enough, every time I change the number it always reverts to the default setting whenever I restart the game. I could still move around fine with its default setting but it really shouldn't revert each time I start the game and I'm not sure if that's just on my end.\n\nThroughout the entire game you use your music as levels for a vertical shooter. Choosing songs to be up for selection is a bit of a task. To pick a song you have to select a folder (or folders) with your music in it. The game will scan the folder for the songs (even songs within subfolders). In order to get a song up for selection from said folder you'd have to go to "Filtering Options" and select either "Filter by Artist", "Filter by Album", or "No Filter" (all the songs in the folder will be up for selection listed in alphabetical order starting with the artist name then song). If you select "Filter by Artist" or "Album" you'd then have to manually select the artist or album from where the specific songs you want comes from and if you want to go through a different song by a different artist or album then you'd have to select what album or artist that comes from.\n\nEnemies appear from the side & on top of the screen moving around on the field in specific patterns. Their timing popping in is based on the song chosen though often times the enemy spawning and rhythm are a bit inconsistent. Enemy movement speed is highly based on the intense parts of a song so if it's constantly mellow then enemy movement is generally slower However I found that some songs even with much higher BPM slow down enemies more than a slower song. In the higher difficulties enemies come in in higher numbers. With all that together the game would feel more like a vertical shooter with your music in the background and less like a shooter actually powered by your music.\n\nAfter a song has been completed you earn an unlockable item for your ship and two sets of points which are used to unlock and/or upgrade said items. Of course depending on how you do per song you get more points for upgrading. Each locked item earned are permanently locked to that song file so if you want something different you'd have to go through a different file and hope you get something you'd want; a basis for grinding. All but two of the items you can unlock are shooty-shoots for your ship. The two items are just pick-ups that, when unlocked, will be dropped randomly from destroyed enemies and used instantly as soon as they're grabbed. One item is a nuke of sorts that destroy all enemies within its range and will have a wider range the more it's upgraded. The other item is a temporary invincibility thing that just allows you to not take damage of any kind until its time runs out and the more that's upgraded the longer it lasts.\nIf you wanted to unlock an item you've acquired on an earlier song you'd have to remember what song you've played and what that item had because in order to even unlock an item you have to do so from the song list and not the list of items acquired.\n\nAs you go through the higher difficulties you'll practically need better items and better upgrades on those items to even stay alive as enemies will have more health, come in higher numbers, and will have patterns that heavily limit your movement.\nThere's little to no skill involved (until maybe the later difficulties) since practically all of the weapons you acquire only require you to hold the buttons down to keep shooting and you don't really move around very much to stay alive especially if you have proper equipment. There's even a setting where you can have selected weapons of your choice to be set on auto-fire as well as an option to rotate your weapons to fire at a set direction in the Edit Ship menu. There's only one type of enemy in this game that punishes you for shooting when you shouldn't but they spawn pretty uncommonly. You can't really lose in this game either per se because each time you die you always respawn with only a few thousand points lost as punishment per death so you're really only staying alive for a higher score.\nTo get points for your score you have to pick up these musical notes that an enemy drops after it's been destroyed by your weapons. As well as adding to your score the notes also repair damage your ship takes. The ship can take as much damage and constant repairs as it wants so long as the center isn't touched.\n\nAt first I thought the visuals were alright even if it did seem highly excessive on the bloom despite it being set to OFF in the options but as I kept playing through higher & higher difficulties alongside somewhat more intense songs (so an increasing number of enemies coming in at a very rapid rate) and with upgraded weapons that fire loads of bullets it becomes less pretty and more of a clutter of baddies, gunfire, and bloom making it a little bit tougher discerning where what is. The screenshots on the store page I think are fair examples of this.\n\nThere's a somewhat good idea behind this I think but I didn't get much enjoyment from it especially when there are similar and more presumably enjoyable games to compare it to.","October 19, 2015","false","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy your current library of songs, you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe premise is basically a turbo-Galaga or Raiden, but instead of invaders from space, it's invaders into your musical library, with demons stealing the souls of your composers via their musical creations. Somehow you have a ship to save your music, but only while listening to it. Individual songs, once played through, unlock a powerup of some kind. These powerups can be upgraded as you rack up points.\n\nThe good points of this game:\n1) The way the enemies behave according to your music. If your music starts slow or comes to a lull during a song, the enemies mellow out slightly; the opposite is true if the music picks up and becomes more intense.\n\n2) The fact that your ship is customizable is really attractive. You can rotate the direction from where your weapons shoot, customize how the weapons are fired (click, auto attack, left or right mouse button, etc), and mixing and matching the items you unlock.\n\n3) Enemies are simple but varied. Heavier armored baddies slog downward toward you while weak and tiny baddies zoom everywhere. Enemy attacks are pretty ruthless, as most of them can one-shot you, though if they touch your ship your ship will be damaged but the smaller baddies will die on contact.\n\n4) Periodic and seemingly random boss battles show up during songs.\n\nThere were a few things I noticed that could be problems down the road.\n\n1) There are "levels" to each song. You play through seven difficulties of all your songs, each with baddies that scale appropriately. If you're playing this to get highscores, playing through songs that you don't care for or ones that you hate (because we all have artists that make that one song we can't stand) will make life a bit miserable for you as you play through each level of the song.\n\n2) The behavior of the enemies during a song is great, but is all reliant on the quality of the mastering during production/recording. I can see this be a bit of a drag when it comes to older albums or anything that hasn't been recently remastered. Also, "intensity" isn't necessarily a description of the song, as I had a couple play-throughs were a few Red Hot Chilli Peppers songs were a bit more insane than, say, a Dimmu Borger song.\n\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game and I'm glad I found it. If you've ever enjoyed any kind of rail-shooter, pick this one up and dust off your playlists. It's a great time killer and a great way to reconnect with some old songs you may not have listened to in awhile and, just maybe, go and look for some newer stuff to add to your musical collection.","August 24, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can customize your spaceship with up to 4 weapons, which can be automated and oriented in different directions. Nothing very new for now,\n\nThe originality is somewhere else: the music makes the level. Before starting a level, you have to choose a music in the list: the rhythm and the length of the music will be the main parameters of the level you will play, in addition to the chosen difficulty. The enemies will appear according to the rhythm of the music (typically, there will be more enemies or they will be faster during the chorus). The length of the level will be the one of the song. The music also define the objectives of the level (different amount of points, rewarded by some medals).\n\nThe best of this concept : you can synchronise your musical files, like your favorite playlist for example, which makes the game more interesting. Indeed, you know your songs, you like them, you know when the best part will come, the funniest moments when all the enemies will appear : you experience differently the game and your song at the same time, and this is awesome.

Unlike most shooters which have a preset sequence of levels and enemies, "Symphony" takes that aspect to a new level by having YOUR music be the means by which the game determines the enemy roll-call. Now you can blast enemies listening to anything from "Freebird" to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, in lovely blues, purples, reds, and oranges of many hues.\n\nBut how does it work? "Symphony" reads whatever audio file you ask it to read, takes note of its tempo, number of notes, duration, and dynamics, then creates a swarm of enemies that will come flying in. The number of enemies and their pattern depends on what point in the song you are at. A moment where things start getting more intense on screen could include a sudden screaming session by the band's vocalist, or a swell of crescendos. Then, the game may decide to dial it back when things calm down and the orchestration thins out. The game is good at making enemies that respond to the music, both in number and movement.\n\nThe level of customization that comes with your ship is pretty expansive. Each upgrade has some aspect about it that makes it a possible candidate for your ship. Some are straight lasers which is helpful for accuracy, but lack power. Others like the Subwoofer can take out some of the game's stronger enemies pretty easily, but trying to master them is easier said than done. You can also tilt the direction in which some upgrades fire. There is no "universal weapon" that will smite anything at anytime, so experimentation is recommended and encouraged.\n\nAs the ship gets damaged, you will lose upgrades, but they are replenishable by picking up notes from fallen enemies. Also, the level of upgrades you have affects your ability to get the game's currency, which is required for purchasing new weapons and/or upgrading them. Since the potential for what the game could throw at you is huge, you may find one particular group of upgrades fail at one song, despite them working in another. This will become more evident as the difficulty levels get higher. Sometimes the game feels a little cheap with what it will throw at you. Enemies are stronger, shielded, more numerous, more "special enemies" come out, etc.\n\nThe other slight criticisms I have are for 1) the audio itself. While it was fun to blast enemies to my favorite Beatles and JS Bach tracks, I found the sound effects to outweigh the music a little too much. After all, the music is the game's main gimmick, so I was surprised that the base audio for the music wasn't quite high enough. Though I'll admit, this is more for my personal audio aesthetic, so make of that what you will. The other is 2) the scanning. While I have no issue with scanning the songs for the actual levels, "Symphony" sometimes will not recognize songs in my iTunes library. I have done rescans and whatnot several times, but with no luck. This cut down my options for tracks from about 3400 to around 900. Still plenty to choose from, but WOW! It also won't recognize tracks under 90 seconds.\n\nIn short, "Symphony" is a wonderful new spin on the shooter genre, and despite the shortcomings, particularly with available tracks to the number of tracks to scan, it is a welcome addition to my Steam library. Anyone with a large music collection, or a fan of shooters, will most likely enjoy this game.

The game will scan the folder for the songs (even songs within subfolders). In order to get a song up for selection from said folder you'd have to go to "Filtering Options" and select either "Filter by Artist", "Filter by Album", or "No Filter" (all the songs in the folder will be up for selection listed in alphabetical order starting with the artist name then song). If you select "Filter by Artist" or "Album" you'd then have to manually select the artist or album from where the specific songs you want comes from and if you want to go through a different song by a different artist or album then you'd have to select what album or artist that comes from.\n\nEnemies appear from the side & on top of the screen moving around on the field in specific patterns. Their timing popping in is based on the song chosen though often times the enemy spawning and rhythm are a bit inconsistent. Enemy movement speed is highly based on the intense parts of a song so if it's constantly mellow then enemy movement is generally slower However I found that some songs even with much higher BPM slow down enemies more than a slower song. In the higher difficulties enemies come in in higher numbers. With all that together the game would feel more like a vertical shooter with your music in the background and less like a shooter actually powered by your music.\n\nAfter a song has been completed you earn an unlockable item for your ship and two sets of points which are used to unlock and/or upgrade said items. Of course depending on how you do per song you get more points for upgrading. Each locked item earned are permanently locked to that song file so if you want something different you'd have to go through a different file and hope you get something you'd want; a basis for grinding. All but two of the items you can unlock are shooty-shoots for your ship. The two items are just pick-ups that, when unlocked, will be dropped randomly from destroyed enemies and used instantly as soon as they're grabbed. One item is a nuke of sorts that destroy all enemies within its range and will have a wider range the more it's upgraded. The other item is a temporary invincibility thing that just allows you to not take damage of any kind until its time runs out and the more that's upgraded the longer it lasts.\nIf you wanted to unlock an item you've acquired on an earlier song you'd have to remember what song you've played and what that item had because in order to even unlock an item you have to do so from the song list and not the list of items acquired.\n\nAs you go through the higher difficulties you'll practically need better items and better upgrades on those items to even stay alive as enemies will have more health, come in higher numbers, and will have patterns that heavily limit your movement.\nThere's little to no skill involved (until maybe the later difficulties) since practically all of the weapons you acquire only require you to hold the buttons down to keep shooting and you don't really move around very much to stay alive especially if you have proper equipment. There's even a setting where you can have selected weapons of your choice to be set on auto-fire as well as an option to rotate your weapons to fire at a set direction in the Edit Ship menu. There's only one type of enemy in this game that punishes you for shooting when you shouldn't but they spawn pretty uncommonly. You can't really lose in this game either per se because each time you die you always respawn with only a few thousand points lost as punishment per death so you're really only staying alive for a higher score.\nTo get points for your score you have to pick up these musical notes that an enemy drops after it's been destroyed by your weapons. As well as adding to your score the notes also repair damage your ship takes. The ship can take as much damage and constant repairs as it wants so long as the center isn't touched.\n\nAt first I thought the visuals were alright even if it did seem highly excessive on the bloom despite it being set to OFF in the options but as I kept playing through higher & higher difficulties alongside somewhat more intense songs (so an increasing number of enemies coming in at a very rapid rate) and with upgraded weapons that fire loads of bullets it becomes less pretty and more of a clutter of baddies, gunfire, and bloom making it a little bit tougher discerning where what is. The screenshots on the store page I think are fair examples of this.\n\nThere's a somewhat good idea behind this I think but I didn't get much enjoyment from it especially when there are similar and more presumably enjoyable games to compare it to.","October 19, 2015","false","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty good.\n\nA pretty good 2-D Galaga style shooting game which uses your own mp3 music files to control the number of enemies on screen and the speed with which they move. There are as many levels as you have mp3 files to play but despite that, the game becomes highly repetitive early on as the enemies only have a few patterns to their movement. There are several difficulty levels which help keep the game from becoming frustrating but the game's story kept me wanting to complete it for no other reason than so that I would not be pestered by the game's random boss fights. The game's goofy story is really more of an encumbrance to this game but it is still quite fun to play in between times. It would be more fun if one could change the game's somber, sad menu music (ironic for a game based on your music files) but the game's neon-saturated graphics are beautiful and impressive and the game runs well with no major bugs and few minor ones. Pretty good overall but not solidly good.

To start i've found that the game flows with your music much better than the other two. Beat Hazard didn't work the music element very well in my opinion, the screen looked neutrally cluttered on all sections apart from quiet ones, and enemy pattern changes wern't that noticable. In Symphony enemies constantly enter the screen to the beat, the dynamics change the speed and intensity of the enemies and your ship, and the world colour changes from a cool blue to a raging red. I also have to give it credit for having some sort of level progression. While Audiosurf and Beat Hazard were pretty much about picking a song, getting a score and that's that, Symphony has you playing a number of songs to eventually reach a boss battle within that certain artist. On top of this every time you complete a song you unlock a random item or weapon to attach to your ship, and you also have a small chance of unlocking rare and more powerful weapons if you're lucky. These can be upgraded to help you in the higher difficulty levels. Symphony just goes a lot deeper than the other two and is definitely worth a look.","August 28, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike most shooters which have a preset sequence of levels and enemies, "Symphony" takes that aspect to a new level by having YOUR music be the means by which the game determines the enemy roll-call. Now you can blast enemies listening to anything from "Freebird" to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, in lovely blues, purples, reds, and oranges of many hues.\n\nBut how does it work? "Symphony" reads whatever audio file you ask it to read, takes note of its tempo, number of notes, duration, and dynamics, then creates a swarm of enemies that will come flying in. The number of enemies and their pattern depends on what point in the song you are at. A moment where things start getting more intense on screen could include a sudden screaming session by the band's vocalist, or a swell of crescendos. Then, the game may decide to dial it back when things calm down and the orchestration thins out. The game is good at making enemies that respond to the music, both in number and movement.\n\nThe level of customization that comes with your ship is pretty expansive. Each upgrade has some aspect about it that makes it a possible candidate for your ship. Some are straight lasers which is helpful for accuracy, but lack power. Others like the Subwoofer can take out some of the game's stronger enemies pretty easily, but trying to master them is easier said than done. You can also tilt the direction in which some upgrades fire. There is no "universal weapon" that will smite anything at anytime, so experimentation is recommended and encouraged.\n\nAs the ship gets damaged, you will lose upgrades, but they are replenishable by picking up notes from fallen enemies. Also, the level of upgrades you have affects your ability to get the game's currency, which is required for purchasing new weapons and/or upgrading them. Since the potential for what the game could throw at you is huge, you may find one particular group of upgrades fail at one song, despite them working in another. This will become more evident as the difficulty levels get higher. Sometimes the game feels a little cheap with what it will throw at you. Enemies are stronger, shielded, more numerous, more "special enemies" come out, etc.\n\nThe other slight criticisms I have are for 1) the audio itself. While it was fun to blast enemies to my favorite Beatles and JS Bach tracks, I found the sound effects to outweigh the music a little too much. After all, the music is the game's main gimmick, so I was surprised that the base audio for the music wasn't quite high enough. Though I'll admit, this is more for my personal audio aesthetic, so make of that what you will. The other is 2) the scanning. While I have no issue with scanning the songs for the actual levels, "Symphony" sometimes will not recognize songs in my iTunes library. I have done rescans and whatnot several times, but with no luck. This cut down my options for tracks from about 3400 to around 900. Still plenty to choose from, but WOW! It also won't recognize tracks under 90 seconds.\n\nIn short, "Symphony" is a wonderful new spin on the shooter genre, and despite the shortcomings, particularly with available tracks to the number of tracks to scan, it is a welcome addition to my Steam library. Anyone with a large music collection, or a fan of shooters, will most likely enjoy this game. I certainly did.\n\n***1/2/**** (high recommendation)","October 3, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/207750/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A vertical SHMUP that hardly seems like it's powered by your music and something that I wish could have just been better overall.\n\nIt's playable with both a controller and a mouse however with a mouse you have a lot more control on where your ship goes because the ship moves as fast as you move your mouse. In the options menu you can change the sensitivity of the in-game mouse but for some reason, because I thought the sensitivity wasn't high enough, every time I change the number it always reverts to the default setting whenever I restart the game. I could still move around fine with its default setting but it really shouldn't revert each time I start the game and I'm not sure if that's just on my end.\n\nThroughout the entire game you use your music as levels for a vertical shooter. Choosing songs to be up for selection is a bit of a task. To pick a song you have to select a folder (or folders) with your music in it. The game will scan the folder for the songs (even songs within subfolders). In order to get a song up for selection from said folder you'd have to go to "Filtering Options" and select either "Filter by Artist", "Filter by Album", or "No Filter" (all the songs in the folder will be up for selection listed in alphabetical order starting with the artist name then song). If you select "Filter by Artist" or "Album" you'd then have to manually select the artist or album from where the specific songs you want comes from and if you want to go through a different song by a different artist or album then you'd have to select what album or artist that comes from.\n\nEnemies appear from the side & on top of the screen moving around on the field in specific patterns. Their timing popping in is based on the song chosen though often times the enemy spawning and rhythm are a bit inconsistent. Enemy movement speed is highly based on the intense parts of a song so if it's constantly mellow then enemy movement is generally slower However I found that some songs even with much higher BPM slow down enemies more than a slower song. In the higher difficulties enemies come in in higher numbers. With all that together the game would feel more like a vertical shooter with your music in the background and less like a shooter actually powered by your music.\n\nAfter a song has been completed you earn an unlockable item for your ship and two sets of points which are used to unlock and/or upgrade said items. Of course depending on how you do per song you get more points for upgrading. Each locked item earned are permanently locked to that song file so if you want something different you'd have to go through a different file and hope you get something you'd want; a basis for grinding. All but two of the items you can unlock are shooty-shoots for your ship. The two items are just pick-ups that, when unlocked, will be dropped randomly from destroyed enemies and used instantly as soon as they're grabbed. One item is a nuke of sorts that destroy all enemies within its range and will have a wider range the more it's upgraded. The other item is a temporary invincibility thing that just allows you to not take damage of any kind until its time runs out and the more that's upgraded the longer it lasts.\nIf you wanted to unlock an item you've acquired on an earlier song you'd have to remember what song you've played and what that item had because in order to even unlock an item you have to do so from the song list and not the list of items acquired.\n\nAs you go through the higher difficulties you'll practically need better items and better upgrades on those items to even stay alive as enemies will have more health, come in higher numbers, and will have patterns that heavily limit your movement.\nThere's little to no skill involved (until maybe the later difficulties) since practically all of the weapons you acquire only require you to hold the buttons down to keep shooting and you don't really move around very much to stay alive especially if you have proper equipment. There's even a setting where you can have selected weapons of your choice to be set on auto-fire as well as an option to rotate your weapons to fire at a set direction in the Edit Ship menu. There's only one type of enemy in this game that punishes you for shooting when you shouldn't but they spawn pretty uncommonly. You can't really lose in this game either per se because each time you die you always respawn with only a few thousand points lost as punishment per death so you're really only staying alive for a higher score.\nTo get points for your score you have to pick up these musical notes that an enemy drops after it's been destroyed by your weapons. As well as adding to your score the notes also repair damage your ship takes. The ship can take as much damage and constant repairs as it wants so long as the center isn't touched.\n\nAt first I thought the visuals were alright even if it did seem highly excessive on the bloom despite it being set to OFF in the options but as I kept playing through higher & higher difficulties alongside somewhat more intense songs (so an increasing number of enemies coming in at a very rapid rate) and with upgraded weapons that fire loads of bullets it becomes less pretty and more of a clutter of baddies, gunfire, and bloom making it a little bit tougher discerning where what is. The screenshots on the store page I think are fair examples of this.\n\nThere's a somewhat good idea behind this I think but I didn't get much enjoyment from it especially when there are similar and more presumably enjoyable games to compare it to.","October 19, 2015","false","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice slow classical music will not give you that much of a challenge, classic rock (CCR, Rolling Stones, Journey, etc..) will will pick things up a bit, Metal/Thrash (Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer, etc..) will have you question your choice of music and Death Metal (Cradle of Filth, Nile, Six Feet Under, etc..) will be very difficult.  The best music to play with (my opinion) would be Power Metal (Anubis Gate, HammerFall, ManOwaR, etc..).

Many games have tried to create an environment where the world reacts to the music playing, and Symphony kinda does that. It analyzes your music saved to your machine (For which I give them props. I like how we're not limited to the music already within the game) and supposedly coordinates enemy amount, aggression, and type to the music. From what I can tell, it only analyzes volume changes which seems a bit lacking because bass-heavy songs will yield easier enemies than the song's beat will imply.\n\nI wish it had more variety to the difficulty modes whilst playing (The color changes indicating enemy's aggresion). Three difficulties just doesn't seem like enough. I don't know about later stages in the game, because I've only gotten to the Mezzo-Piano difficulty, which leads me into my next point.\n\nHow do you save this game? There's no save button in the menus, and there's no autosave function after every completed song, so how am I supposed to save progress? I signed up for that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t service they have in-game which I thought would allow you to save your game. but so far I can't tell if it worked. "Continue" on the main screen is still grayed out so I'm convinced there just isn't a save funciton in this game which is really, really bad. Playing for an hour only to accidentally go back to the home menu and losing all your progress because you clicked RMB makes this game feel like a waste of time, even though the actual game part of it is awesome. And yes, who in their right mind makes RMB a previous menu key? At least it's not active during gameplay, just in the menus.\n\nBut as for the actual game, Symphony is pretty cool. The colors are bright and vivid, and the explosions are just the right size. The glow effect from some weapons can prove to be distracting (Level 3 Scatter Cannon cough cough) but it is manageable after you get to recognize enemy ships. I experienced my mouse sensitivity suddenly skyrocketing a couple times but I believe that is a problem on my end as I've had it happen to me in other games as well.\n\nCustomisability is lacking in the aesthetics department, but all weapons look and feel diverse excluding the rare versions of the same weapon. I wish we could customize the look of our actual ship, instead of having the same falcon-like body throughout the game.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10 - While I thoroughly enjoy this game, the lack of an obvious save feature really breaks the balance between having an awesome game and a pile of crap. The game part of Symphony is very good and fun to play, and the diversity of weapons is great, and the art style is just hands-down beautiful, but god damn, they just couldn't get the menu system right! No obvious save button turned this gem of an Indie game into a pile of crap. HOWEVER, it is a very pretty and well polished piece of crap. If this game goes on sale, get it. You'll have fun for a couple minutes or hours before you lose your save game.\n\nAfterthought: Locating your music files is weird. You have to use an in-game explorer to find your music folder which is weird. I think they should've just let it open Windows Explorer or whatnot instead.","February 8","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play in a shoot-em-up stylized futuristic environment with your very own music! Though the only downside is that you can't play multiplayer which I think would be even better but it's still fun to play alone.\n\n9.1/10 - GOOD","February 8","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is absolutely fenomenal. It takes music from your library and generates a level based on each of your songs. This is great becasuue the mood and pace of the song always match the level. The weapons are amazing and all look cool bu i can't help but think that the Rocket Packs and Crescendos are useess. I can't flaw it apart from that because it is so good..","February 21","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hearing music while shooting down enemies is a blast to enjoy. And since you can put in any music you want, as long as it is between 1:30 - 10:00, especially video game music, it adds replayability to it!\n\nI did hear that Beat Hazzard's better, but I haven't played that, and when I play it, I might say the same thing about it!
