Gameplay MOSTLY of a moderate difficulty, with only a few bosses and levels presenting a hard challenge. I found my hands trembling from adrenaline rush when fighting bosses from Flight of the Dragon and Night over Europe, I must say :)\n\nThere is, however, a BIG problem with this game. Since it was originally designed to have micro-transactions, it has a progressively steep price for upgrades, which forces you to grind easier missions over and over again. Also, ingame currency is needed to unlock each successive chapter in story, which leads to even more grinding. While such approach is unfortunately acceptable on mobile, it translates badly to PC, especially since you don't even have an option to pay instead of grind here. However, the game keeps its save file in plain-text format, and it's very easy to edit it, so if you find yourself tired of grinding, just go ahead and give yourself 10000 medals :)\n\nDespite the problems, I still give this game a thumbs up, because I had fun playing it.","October 7, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
