(Except for the platforming at the top of world 1, but we won't talk about that.)\n\nPros of this game:\n\nFantastic Soundtrack\nSimple controls for Keyboard and Mouse\nIntelligent design for levels\nMotherflippin' grappling hooks!\n\nCons of this game:\n\nShort game for its current price. (I'm sure this will change as development moves further.)\nThe little cracks on the ground I keep tripping on.\nLack of current story.\n\nAll around, this game is exactly what I wanted. A simple platformer that sends you to another world.\n\nUpdate Edit after 1/22/2016 update:\nYou know, when I said we're not going to talk about the platforming at the top, that's not an invitation to make it harder.","January 11","true","3.2"," 61 of 69 people (88%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","88","61","69","31","5"

Mine will be delivered in June, and if I feel like I need to add to this, I will.\n\nOriginal Review\nWindlands is a very  infuriating  peaceful game. Though it only has one level, the game is still very new on Steam and the developer has recently updated the game to include a challenge level. With a VR headset, you will  get paranoid of heights  enjoy the game more fully and it will be a much better experience. A controller is also recommended (especially a Steam controller), so you  can rage at the camera controls  can move much more fluidly.\n\nUpdate 2/6/16\nThe game now includes another challenge level that is much more fun than the old one. This one focuses almost solely on swinging, which to me is the best part about this game. Also, the  unfair  time-consuming platforming at the top of the jungle level  is  has been claimed to be more fair. I haven't been up there since the update, but I believe it is much better.\n\nUpdate 3/2/16\nThere is now a  deathtrap  city level in addition to the jungle one. I haven't explored much of it, but as far as I know it requires skill and patience.  DO NOT PLAY WITH A TRACKPAD  Remember, a mouse or Steam controller will greatly increase your ability to play this level.\n\nUpdate 4/15/16\nNow that the game has been fully released, I took the time to complete both the city level and the sky level. Again,  DO NOT PLAY WITH A TRACKPAD  a mouse is recommended for optimal play. The advanced rope is a necessity, so farmiliarize yourself with it before heading into the sky levels. There is lots of  rage  platforming, and you will find yourself  restarting over and over  enjoying the game and feeling triumphant with every jump.\n\nOverall Review: This game is amazing, 10/10.","January 24","true","13.7"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","93","51","55","66","1"

I can't think of another VR experience as polished and fun as Windlands. It's the first VR game I played that actually felt like a game and not a gimmick. An experience that gave me super powers like Spiderman and Superman combined. This game even in it's infancy ranks in my top 10 favorite games of all time, because it's one of the only games that made my mouth drop at the sheer possibilities that VR offered. The game is easy enough to play, and difficult to master. I can't give enough thumbs up to this game, damn, I'm afraid of heights but this game makes me wanna climb even higher.","January 27","true","52.3"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","2"

And then realized that I didnt review the game here. Ill just copy+paste my comment:\n\nThis game is like the opposite of the big launchtitles for oculus rift. Maybe mostly to Luckys tale.\nThe other games is made to make VR look AAA from a aesthetic angle, but the core mechanics is not so deep that it would make you continue playing after finishing the game, and you basically already master the game from the first minute.\nWindlands is skillbased and you continually master it more and more. The more you get gud the more fun it gets. It gets very punishing a bit into the game, and at the same time the level of mastery you achieve makes you able to pull of the craziest stunts.\nI spent a lot of time with Dark Souls 1 cause of the depth of the mechanics, and Windlands, not Chronos, is filling that spot for me when it comes to vr. Going from sensing that something is impossible, to the sense of achievement, then to the sense of mastery.\nThe mechanics are soo well made, soo fine tuned, and gives the game a very strong personality.. This game is really for the harcore gaming crowd and speedrunners, not for showing of VR to casual gamers.\n\nOh. I should add that the simple aestetic of the game lets everything in the level be rendered with the same textures no matter how far away it is. This is really important for VR. If the resolution of textures keep changing based on your distance to them, and if things objects just pop out of nothingness at a certain distance, it breaks immersion a lot in VR. It seems to work on normal computergames, but in VR it really disturbs.\nThe levels in Windlands are huge, but there is never any popping up. I tried Subnautica, and there the textures and objects are constantly popping up around you, and you cant look in the distance to see whats there. You will only find out if you get close. It might look like the graphics are good if you take a screenshot, but really they suck for VR.\n\nThe consistency of the world, that you can see whats in the distance and go there without the object changing, is what makes the graphics in Windlands really good for VR.\n\nThe only thing this game lacks is multiplayer (and the possibility to climb moving titans).","April 4","true","3.6"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","1"

BUT i know this game is in Early Access and im willing to over look the price part. Because I have been waiting for YEARS to play the "Full Version" of this game. I was that guy who got the broken demo build of the is game when the demo first came out. I played that demo alot, even though it was a small world with three crystals i still was entertained for days on end. and if you are wonder what i meant by "broken build of the demo" let me explain what i mean. After you get the 3 crystals a door opens and a beam was supposed take you to the top so you can finish a final challange and then get too the top and win. But on this build the beam didn't work so i kinda gave up on the game for a bit but eventully came back and found a way up, which took hours of trying but i eventually got it XD I even uploaded a video showing how to get up, but little did i know like a week after i got the build another one came out and fixed the problem so some guy told me in the commets they fixed it, so needless to say that video isnt up anymore. (ps: i still have the broken build Xb) oh and I dont even have an hour on this game because i got all the crysals so quickly. and if you dont belive me look and my screen shots. but enough bragging :b Im definitely looking forward to the many updates to come and when the Full full game is released then i will make my final judgments.\n\nBut for what its RIGHT NOW i do not think its worth the price. hope this helped ;D","January 10","true","1.6"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","36","53","4","0"

I'll admit I was very uncomfortable playing this game with the Vive to start but it did get better after several (very) short plays. The key to this is playing just until you're uncomfortable and then taking the headset off and resting. For me it went\n1) Made it out of the main hall and jumped\n2) Grappled a few trees, missed the ground and fell\n3) Try to make it a little farther each play\n4) Get to the main hub and realize that you've been playing continously for half an hour just jumping and swinging.\nThis all works much better seated to start as I still sway and occasionally almost fall standing, but I don't feel immdeiately sick playing now and "sick" now translates to mild discomfort.\nThis game is a must have once you get over the initial acceleration sickness and if you can move without any abrupt stops or starts, I honestly don't think the movement would be an issue at all.","April 21","true","2.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

The large floating blocks of coloured stone, grass and trees create a fantastic environment for swinging around using your super stretchy arms. As many of the current negative reviews point out though - this game is not easy at present! Momentum must be built up with run ups and landing on the teflon coated platforms requires planning to avoid sliding off into oblivion.\n\nControlling your mute spiderman is done (on xbox controller) by using the thumbsticks for movement and orientation, whilst using the right and left triggers for flinging out your respective arms. The press and hold method in order to keep your hands stuck to the desired bit of foliage is intuitive but I wish I'd had clearer indication that holding the 'B' button would stop the arms reeling in and unwind to their maximum length. Using this made accessing certain areas much less frustrating and more enjoyable.\n\nThe difficulty curve of the only map where you can collect the blue crystals is perfect when it represents the whole game. It will however be interesting to see how the developer fleshes the concept out into a full game without compromising what currently makes this game great.\n\n\nPros:\n- Great minimal art style enchances the game by making objectives clear\n- Matching minimal sound/music creates atmosphere\n- Easy to learn, hard to master gameplay\n- Works flawlessly on Rift dk2 (runtime 0.8 on GTX 760)\n\nCons:\n- Sharp learning curve for first level\n- Little variation beyond accurate platforming\n- Lonely world\n- Currently not a lot of content","February 17","true","5.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I have not played it in "normal mode". ~~\n\nIt's extremely fun using the motion controllers to swing from tree to tree, and you can get a real sense of vertigo and panic when on a ledge or falling. It is definitely the kind of game that could get someone motion sick if they aren't up for it. It took me about 3-4 minutes of controlling before I got used to it. A day later, I loaded it up and didn't even need to get used to it. I don't get motion sick at all playing this, and enjoy it quite a lot. Please note: that's just me. Others might still get sick, I don't know for certain how it will affect the average person.\n\n+ Seems like there's a lot of content for $20. I would say it's absolutely worth it.\n+ You don't want to stop playing for a long time\n+ Excellent art design that compliments VR immensely\n~ Some aspects of the game seem a little rough around the edges, particularly UI, but a lot of it feels very polished for an early access game.\n- Locomotion system, while not uncomfortable, can be hard to control. It feels like I'm sliding when moving with the pad, and that can make it hard to land on small platforms. Using the grappling hooks is always my preferred way to get around, but that's not always an option.","April 8","true","1.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I can only assume that this is enhanced when you play it on the Vive because you're constantly moving, adjusting, watching your step, and swinging your way across a level to hidden collectibles and objectives.\n\nInitially was on the fence about this game, but I was able to find the right settings for me to allow me to play this game without feeling ill. I think it had to do with turning the comfort VR OFF. The smooth movement seems like it would be fine as we're so used to it in traditional controller-based and non-VR games, but the acceleration it does in VR when you turn is not fun after a while and has a cumulative effect on your body. I was sweating and not feeling well in my stomach after 1.5 hours the first go-round. The next session, I turned the comfort VR setting back on (so turning is done in increments) and I was able to play for hours without much discomfort at all and was able to truly enjoy the experience.\n\nThe one thing I feel like could be improved somewhat is the response to the direction pad inputs. Sometimes it feels like it's too sensitive and other times I cannot get it to do what I want. It's usually sensitive in the game world when I'm trying to turn and stiff in the menus.\n\nOther than that, I really do recommend this game. I think it has more meat on the bones than a lot of other games that were Vive ready on launch day!

Joystick locomotion does not work well on the Vive. Not only can it be very sickening, but the controls themselves feel unresponsive. Most of the time this doesn't matter, as the grappling hooks are the main locomotion solutions, however the horrible joystick locomotion REALLY rears its head when the game uses jumping-platforming instead of the hooks. Why is standard platforming even apart of this game? It is incredibly frustrating and not fun. I hope they remove those sections.

Whenever I write "VR" I am talking about the experience in an Oculus Rift DK2. Reults might differ in other HMDs)\n\nTL;DR : Forget Lucky's Tale, THIS is the game you want to experience in VR. You don't own a VR Headset? doesn't matter ... get the game anyway. It is awesome1\n\n* The soundtracks are, as they say, "enchanting"\n\n* The graphics are stylised in a semi-cartoony/polygonal-retro way, but this works very well in two ways : the world looks alien by default and the framerate is great (both in VR an 2D) even on weaker rigs.\n\n* graphics and soundtrack don't mean much if the gameplay is lacking though, and Windlands just shines. It is a purely explorational/jump puzzle game (at least the demo was and the early-access game, as far as I can tell, follows the same formula). Movement is done by running, jumping, wall-jumping and by using the two extensible hook-arms you receive after a minute of gameplay. You can throw each of you arm in a straight line for some impressive distance. If the ending hook hits a tree the arm will start to retract again, moving you along. you can now use your second arm to swing from tree to tree, or just hang on one arm and then swing around to gain momentum ... there are a couple of ways to use that mode of locomotion, epecially in conjunction with the wall jumping ability.\nThe world itself is quite freeform. There are levels and you get heavy hints as to where to go next, but nothing stops you from just soaring around and try to reach places not particularly meant to be reached.\n\nAs I said, this works very well and is very good in 2D too. That said, the game shines in VR. First of all there are toggeable comfort options (static cockpits and overlays, comfort turning) and Menus are readable and useable from VR too. The VR framerate in the demo was very good on a Q6600 with a GTX660 in it (I don't have that computer anymore so I can not test the full game with it). The VR display options are currently native 0.8 Oculus Rift and SteamVR.\nDue to the very high framerate achieveable along with the comfort options this is one of the few first person/no cockpit games with doesn't seem to post a serious problem even for sensitive people.\nOn a purely visual level, the game is just breathtaking in VR, especially if you have trouble with heights. AS everything VR : you need to experience it to understand. Thankfully there IS a Windland demo, so if you haven't yet then go grab it and try it out.\n\ngo back tot eh TL;DR for the result :D","January 8","true","6.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

It can be played without, but I feel it can only be fully enjoyed with an Oculus Rift, as the immersion you feel is unparallelled to any other vr experience I've tried.\n\nIt is level based. You can create a save file, and progress through large stages, progressing to checkpoints. In the few hours I've played so far, I've enjoyed it and I am excited to see how much they have added to this game. They focus a bit more on jumping in this version, as they have eliminated grass as a grapplable substance. You can no longer cheese your way up mountains where you shouldn't be allowed to go.\n\nThis is a very immersive platformer with the potential to become one of the best VR games of the next year. There is plenty of butt-clenching tension to be had as you jump and grapple over long distances, trying not to fall into the sandy abyss and die.\n\nThis is much more of a structured game than the demo with much more content, and I eagerly await updates.","January 8","true","5.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Now that it is finally complete, I've been able to go further in for the first time with the Vive.\n\nWindlands is a first person platformer in a sense, with a unique way to move around the world. Early in the game you will acquire two grappling hooks, which are the only tools you'll need to navigate the world. The core gameplay is based around finding collectibles dotted around the world, and you'll use the grappling hooks in a style reminiscent of the Manoeuver Gear in the anime series Attack on Titan. You can pick up a lot of momentum once you get skillful using the hooks, and when you do it's thrilling.\n\nOn the Vive it is a much richer experience, mostly due to the decoupling of aim and head orientation, and the ability to fire two hooks simultaneously. This gives you a lot more control over where you will end up and more awareness of your surroundings as on the Rift you must always be looking directly at where you want your next hook to go. You will have a good experience on either headset system however as I enjoyed my time with it using the Oculus DK2.\n\nAs many others have mentioned the game does use traditional locomotion controls in contrast to the more commonly used teleport mechanic in many other VR games. I have not personally experienced nausea playing this game on the Vive, but others may be more susceptible to it with this form of movement.\n\nHowever, I have also opted not to use the game's controls for yaw rotation, instead physically turning for the same effect. It would be good if the controls for strafing and yaw rotation could be optionally disabled as sometimes I do accidently hit these functions accidently. It is worth mentioning that though the game lacks a teleport mechanic it does offer a plethora of other comfort mechanics such as comfort turning, and various static frames of reference that surround your character.\n\nOverall I have found this to be a fun game with a thrilling system of movement and attractive, colourful Wind Waker aesthetic. It is one of the more substantial offerings currently available for the VR launch, particularly for the Vive which at the moment has a lot of simple demos.","April 13","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

You get a challenging, energetic platformer that throws plenty of challenges at you. Swining around in VR is exhilarating.\n\nI do have my critisisms though, mainly about the level design. A few years back there was a large Windlands demo level released that I absolutely loved, and the main game never quite equalled it in terms of level design. I think it's because the levels in the main game are so disjointed. They play like a series of challenge maps, instead of really exploring an interestingly connected world which I liked about that demo. Also I really hoped to see more life in general throughout the levels. The demo map hinted at all kinds of dynamic stuff to come that never seemed to have made it into the final game.\n\nSo in the end Windlands is a fun game to play, especially in VR.

Which is super beautiful, might I add.\n\nThe movement feels slippy slidey, which isn't terrible. There have been worse ice physics in other games. This, once you get the hang of it, feels okay. The grappling aspect...hoo boy, is it fun to just grapple onto stuff and swing around like Spiderman...my one tiny gripe is you can only hook onto bushes and tree leaves.\n\nI feel like the art style compliments the gameplay. Light-hearted cartoony, but not to the point of being silly. Like it gives off no sense of urgency, and makes you want to explore and take in the scenery. The music fits nicely as well.

When you look at the stats and see that you have collected 70/130 runes (this is an example) it gives a feeling of distance to what you have accomplished. It would be more exiting if you got some more rewards. If every rune had its own identity and its own name it would make the game so much better. Then you could look at the stats and say "hey, I missed *The mighty rune of runes*". I feel that would be great and if you could get some artwork or some thing with every rune it would be even more awesome!

I like the challenge of collecting all the items in this world. What I feel is missing is some kind of reward for doing the tasks that the game gives you. When you look at the stats and see that you have collected 70/130 runes (this is an example) it gives a feeling of distance to what you have accomplished. It would be more exiting if you got some more rewards. If every rune had its own identity and its own name it would make the game so much better. Then you could look at the stats and say "hey, I missed *The mighty rune of runes*". I feel that would be great and if you could get some artwork or some thing with every rune it would be even more awesome! Maybe even have a folder or mod so that that the player could add there own artwork to pop up when a new rune is collected. These are my thoughts and I love this game.","May 15","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I thought I would get strong nausea / motion sickness, but much to my surprise, I didn't. It does feel weird sometimes but the strong sensations that swinging in the air provides help to overcome that.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, the movement is also a bit weird in a few occasions (subtle grappling from beneath trees, running has a LOT of inertia), but it works well enough. It would be nice if the touchpad was implemented better, though.\n\nThe visuals could benefit from improvement; they are pretty primitive and there's one effect that I dislike (the bloom is too saturated), but they work well enough.\n\nI would really recommend playing this; if you find out it gives you nausea, that it's too much for you, you can always refund it.

Soon you begin to gain skill and find yourself reaching areas with confident jumps and swings (well most of the time).  The game demands this skill as you progress - and it is one of the games strengths; the skill advancent is one of the best. if not the best, i have experienced for a platform style game.\n\nThe use of VR is amazing.

This one both tests your susceptibility to VR motion sickness as well as your fear of heights!! But if you have the stomach for it, the feeling of swinging through the air is nothing short of exhilarating!! At first, the movement was very unsettling. I started just moving around in short spurts and soon got use to it. I don't feel like it was motion sickness I was experiencing as much as it was pure nervousness from the heights and not wanting to miss jumps. LOL The most intense moment I've had in VR was when I strung my first few swings together. It was so exciting, I would almost compare it to the time I got to drive an Indy car around Charlotte Motor Speedway for a few laps. My heart was racing, my palms were sweaty, and I couldn't wipe that silly grin off my face!\n\nIf it messes with you at first, just try it in small doses and you can probably get yourself more comfortable.

My first review. Playing this on the Oculus Rift CV1 is an amazing experience. At times it's an almost meditative experience, but for the most part it's just an awesome game.\n\nI'm scared of heights. When I play this game and get a really solid spider-man style rope swing in, I get a bit of an adrenaline rush. It's faded as I've played more, but I still leave with my palms sweaty.\n\nThis game might not be ideal if you're super prone to motion sickness because it's heavy on movement. That said, it's my favorite game so far on the CV1.\n\nI really look forward to more time trials, and being able to compare time (competition.. the ultimate in replay value..).

I found myself leaning as if I was keeping my balance on a tight turn. If you own a Vive or Rift, you should definitely get this game. I have played it in the past, but it really reaches a new level with the vive controllers. If you are on a Rift CV1 it is still great with the xbox controller, but you will really have a blast once you get your Touch controllers. I have not tried in flat non vr mode. As others are saying it might cause sim sickness, though it is surprisingly comfortable considering you are swinging around at high speeds. Give it a shot you might be surprised with what your stomach can handle with a game from a dev that is clearly attuned to what seems to make people sick and what doesn't while seemingly not sacrificing the movement mechanics.","April 29","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoy using momentum and grappling hooks to soar through levels with rich history, then you're in for a treat! The controls are almost like a car or on ice; you can't start fast or strafe fast, it's all a momentum build up, so basically you're on ice. Normally, controls like that drive me insane (and trust me it kinda has), but the accuracy and percision that the grappling hooks add make the game incredibly enjoyable.

Windlands cashes in on this incredibly fun movement mechanic by building a collectable-oriented game in a unique and beautiful world. Once you spend a few hours in the game, you can learn to chain both grapple hooks and wall jumps together in a way that a) works really effectively in an HMD to create a sensation of vertigo and b) makes Peter Parker look amateur.\n\nThere's a number of collectables and some beautiful scenery that you just want to get out and explore by itself. Other than that, it's up to you to make your own fun. The camera controls can be a bit hard to use and disorienting, especially in an HMD,  but I've thrown a few hours into the demo that came before this release, and I plan to throw a few dozen more into it now that it has some persistent progression and multiple levels.\n\nIf you have a VR HMD, this is one of the best titles for it. If you don't, it's a harder sell and you may want to wait for the game to mature a bit more before buying it.","January 11","true","2.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It may feel like a floaty first-person platformer at first (that sounds awful, I know), but once you become comfortable with the grappling mechanics you will be launching yourself over long chasms, chaining tarzan swings together, and walljumping up sheer cliffs. It's a visceral experience that, for me at least, has never once made me nauseated or dizzy, even with all comfort options off (i.e., I use smooth turning, no cages).\n\nThe only downside at the moment is the limited number of levels (intro area, hub, one large level). If you're unsure this game is for you, the free demo is still available on Oculus Share. I didn't get in on the Indiegogo campaign, so I'm glad to support the developers during early access.\n","January 9","true","6.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is completely based around momentum which at start feels really slidey and a bit off. However you quickly realise it kinda makes sense because in real life when you start running forward and want to stop you don't just dead you kidna slow yourself down. Which is what the game done perfectly. Once you get into the game and after a little bit of practice you are swinging from tree to tree with ease. One major pointer is not to use both hooks all the time because using just one hook allows you to "swing" a bit better rather then being pulled directly into the object you're attached too. This is more of a first impression  kind of thing considering at the moment i only have just over 30 minutes on the game.\n\nedit: I have from what im aware actually already completed the game within the 30 minutes of playing it. With that said, DAMN this game needs more content.","January 14","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The only flaws i can find is the momentum and some of the platforming part you can't actually jump high enough to get to some of the areas you're supposed to be able to jump to. Maybe you should only slide on certain surfaces like the white surface and not the dirt and grass?","January 15","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A face-locked message just says to "keep exploring".\nGeneral lack of polish for a 'finished' game costing $20\nVery *very* poor Vive control implementation set by default.

So this game is pretty awesome.  You get to fly around a big area.  You swing from ropes that you throw out like Spiderman's webs, You jump really high, you wall-jump, and overall just fly.  It's really fun.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI do NOT recommend getting this game due to the frustration that you will face in THE FIRST ♥♥♥♥ING WORLD.  You go through a short introductory stage, get into the main hub, and go to world 1.  From there, you have to collect 3 artifacts within world 1 in order to unlock world 2.  The first 2 artifacts are fine.  They are not that bad to collect, which is how it should be considering you are still being introduced to the concept of the ropes and how to use them.  Then the developers say, "Hey, this is too easy if we give the player the gimick that our ENTIRE GAME IS BASED ON.  So how about we take it away and leave the player, who is still trying to learn the ♥♥♥♥ing game, with our stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t slidey ♥♥♥ mechanics of the standard platforming of the game.  AND THEN, let's put them through a huge ♥♥♥♥ing gauntlet of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ platforming that will ultimately ♥♥♥♥ them the ♥♥♥♥ off!  And they have to do this BEFORE unlocking the SECOND world!!  DOESN'T THAT SOUND LIKE A GREAT IDEA??"\n\nWELL THE ANSWER IS ♥♥♥♥ING NO!!!!!!  It is a HORRIBLE ♥♥♥♥ING IDEA!!  Why the ♥♥♥♥ would you create a fun mechanic for your game and then take it away and leave the player with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing slidey, inconsistent, inaccurate platforming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?????  Seriously!  Who failed the Game Designing for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ course?  All of you?  Yeah that makes sense.\n\nJesus Christ.  I want to like this game.  I like the first 2 artifacts.  The gameplay is challenging but fun.  With some practice, everything can flow very smoothly.  The last artifact before unlocking the next world is like a giant middle finger to the player.  The slightest misstep means falling a mile and a half to your death.  In a recent update, they did make a few more checkpoints, but then they also changed the last few jumps to get to the last artifact in world 1.  The platforming in this section is INCREDIBLY awkward.  It is extremely aggravating (in case you couldn't tell from my rant).  And it makes the game not worth playing.  And this is coming from someone who plays and enjoys platforming games.  I have been through over 70 brutal hours of Super Meat Boy, and that is not including the 100+ hours I spent in it on Xbox, along with plenty of other platforming games.  The platforming in this game is loose, it slides around, it's awkward, it takes ages to get something right, it is just generally bad.  So that leaves my utterly confused as to why the developers thought it was a good idea to strip the player of the thing that makes this game good, and leave them with only the bad.  Most people will get too frustrated and quit before passing world 1.\n\nNot worth $20\nNot worth $10\nMaybe worth $5","February 15","false","5.5"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","1","9","2","7"

I've been following this game since it's first demo was released, and it continuously gets better.  While the original demo focused on free-form exploration, this version blends in much more intense platforming sections while still encouraging you to creatively tackle each objective.\n\nThe only real downside at the moment is that the game seems to stutter noticeably when too much is on the screen. Each indivdual section of the main map consistently gets 90 FPS, but looking accross the map(an awesome view) can introduce a significant amount of judder.

For being in early access, the game is beautiful, complete with wonderful graphics, detailed maps, and a great soundtrack. It does however, have a few bugs, but they don't really detract from the overall feeling (if anything, they only make the game more challenging).\n\nThe grappling hooks took me a little bit to get used to, but once I got the swing of things (pun definitely intended), I found it easy to jump from tree to tree. It would be nice however, if you could grapple on to grass or wood as opposed to just the leaves of trees and bushes. Most of the time, this wasn't an issue, with the exception of the tower in world one.\n\nOn that same subject, the tower in world one proves to be extremely challenging, as it's all platform based as opposed to using your grappling hooks. I don't think this would be too much of an issue, but a few bugs make it almost impossible to complete. The physics are a bit off when you try to come to a short stop, as I came sliding forward a few times like I was on ice. There's also an issue on some of the platforms where there are little divets. Whenever I tried to take a running leap, I would sometimes get stuck in said divets, and not perform the intended jump.\n\nBut like I said before, I was forgiving knowing that the game is in early access. It's still a complete blast to play, and I could honestly spend hours exploring around the maps. I cannot wait to unlock more worlds, get the kinks worked out, learn about the story line (and those tablets you pick up), and continue to play this game as it evolves!","January 19","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been following this game since it's first demo was released, and it continuously gets better.  While the original demo focused on free-form exploration, this version blends in much more intense platforming sections while still encouraging you to creatively tackle each objective.\n\nThe only real downside at the moment is that the game seems to stutter noticeably when too much is on the screen. Each indivdual section of the main map consistently gets 90 FPS, but looking accross the map(an awesome view) can introduce a significant amount of judder. Hopefully this gets further optimized in the coming months.\n\nHeadset: DK2\nGraphics Card: GTX 970","January 10","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BUT this game would be awesome to play. I can see that the developers put much time and love into this game and I recommend this to everyone that has no problems with VR- or motion sickness. Sadly for me unplayable.","June 4","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
