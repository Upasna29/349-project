We wake up every morning with a commanding voice that, like it or not, pushes us to face trials increasingly difficult to get a prize. A voice that we find strange and that we don't know if we could trust. A voice that can come from the outside but also from our own unconscious. We never know if the final prize is real but we are armed of portals. But what are the portals if not the ability to be able to see the world from different perspectives? The portal is the human ability to abstract being able to immerse himself in aspects of the world that had been hidden by the limitations of the senses.\n\nOk, if you're already confused, I understand.\n\nJust buy the damn game.","November 6, 2015","true","3.7"," 207 of 226 people (92%) found this review helpful 124 people found this review funny","92","207","226","124","9"

Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty.  However after some time, my boss began acting strange.  It started with the lying.  Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous.  I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.\n\nEventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal.  My boss promised me cake  when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it.  I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence.  I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.\n\nThen one day, my boss had a surprise for me.  He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work.  Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube.  At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it.  We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.\n\nI thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death.  My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing.  My boss said something about "symptoms of enrichment center testing" and "perceiving inanimate objects as alive" but I paid no attention.  I knew this was love.  I knew this was real.\n\nWe continued on together for a while.  The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me.  I tried talking to it, but I received no response.  My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute.  I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.\n\nThis revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death.  After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship.  But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.\n\n"However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.  Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator."\n\nI gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator.  I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks.  I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.\n\nMy boss continued on as if nothing was wrong.  "While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you."\n\n"You could never be a burden to me!" I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest.  But then I remembered.  Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me.  I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake.  And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...\n\nI hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor.  I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator.  It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it.  Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames.  Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat.  I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty.  But then I remember the Cake.  And the Cube slipped from my hands.\n\n"You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record," said my boss.  "Congratulations."\n\n11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again.","June 22, 2015","true","3.5"," 235 of 262 people (90%) found this review helpful 265 people found this review funny","90","235","262","265","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crazygpu2/recommended/400/","crazygpu2","CrazyGPU without GPU...","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crazygpu2/","184 products in account","Portal is a first person action game of logic and strategy developed by Valve in 2007 and released in a package called The Orange Box .\n\nThe player wakes up in a glass room , the Aperture Science development center, where he is subjected to a series of experiments until ...... well I will not spoil the  game ....\nEach experiment is guided by Glados voice, the mainframe development center computer. Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years. That computer has more personality than many humans from other games.\n\nThroughout the game the player acquires a portal gun. This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance. You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement.\n\nThe game is a marvel of Valves creativity. Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history. The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud. No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended. It is an ode to creativity.\n\nIts sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game. The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications.\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.\n\nNow that I've finished the review I want my cake ! .\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESPAÑOL\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPortal es un videojuego de lógica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box.\n\nEl jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que …… no les voy a arruinar el juego....\nEn cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo. Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los últimos años. Esta computadora tiene más personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos.\n\nA lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales. Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos lógicos para seguir adelante. Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la física, la posición y el movimiento.\n\nEl juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve. Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia. Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir. Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocionó tanto. Es una oda a la creatividad.\n\nSu secuela, el Portal 2 amplía el concepto del juego y lo hace mucho más largo, convirtiéndolo en un juego independiente. El Portal 2 fue nombrado Juego del Año en 2011 por diversas publicaciones.\n\nEl juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX.\n\nAhora que terminé el review quiero mi torta!.","November 25, 2013","true","4.2"," 211 of 233 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","211","233","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/400/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","Portal is definitely a one-of-a-kind type of game. It's quirky at best, but it also remains clever, resolute and perfectly presented to those with likings for a quick-wit and a scientific explanation for including physics in a well-thought out and intelligent game, all with a touch of dark humour. It's quite rare to see a Steam user with a huge game library that doesn't include Portal nowadays. Heck, this game was my very first purchase.\n\nYou awaken in the deserted Enrichment Center of Aperture Laboratories; a fictional science research corporation, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Known for the creation of the handheld portal gun, as well as the heavy rivalry the complex has between the Black Mesa Research Facility. (The scientific complex focused in Half-Life. Half-Life and Portal both share the same universe.) in Portal, you play as the silent protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as you are challenged to navigate through a series of cryptic chambers, all the while being accompanied by the voice of the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GlaDOS for short.) which the sociopathic robot subsequently reveals the rest of the plot to the player, through various and long-winded narration throughout the game. And what is this reward you get for all this mind-wrecking work? Why it's none other than cake!\n\nWhile on the subject of sweet chocolate butter-milk frosting, assembled with maraschino cherries on top, this all turns out to be a crude lie, and you're sent to be burnt to a crisp by GlaDOS. As you narrowly escape death, you navigate through the many things that Aperture Laboratories would have wanted to keep as a secret to the rest of the world. You soon (or later, as this game has a way of messing with your head.) find yourself exploring the air vents, empty corners with obscure writings on the wall, the sewers of the facility, as well as the abandoned, deserted offices of those who mysteriously left the complex, along with empty food supplies and crude drawings that uncovers a much darker history of the laboratories.\n\nWhat strikes me most surprised is this game's ingenius concept and profound knowledge of linear momentum and physics. Your only weapon in the game, if you can call it a weapon, is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. It's main and only ability is to create two distinct portals, an orange and blue portal, which both create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Keep in mind that neither portal are both an entrance or an exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. This unique concept will soon be taken to the test, as you explore, solve and escape through 19 mind-wrecking chambers all the while keeping your distance both far and dangerously close to heavily armed turret bots.\n\nBut, you're not alone in this deranged prison of a laboratory, your square-buddy (and probably only buddy.) known as the Companion Cube, will accompany you throughout a few of these chambers, as it has a handful of most needed traits; involving you using it as an extra step for those hard-to-reach places, using it as a shield against deadly laser spheres and deflecting them into switch mechanisms, and even going as so far to hold out weight-activated button switches. Sadly, with every chamber completed thanks to your Companion Cube, you will have to eventually abandon it and leave it for trash, in the Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. What a true friend to the end!\n\nWhen cracking down to the lifespan of this game's story, it's actually pretty short. But, with each new chamber you progress through as well as the difficulty beginning to rise at a much faster pace, the longer the chambers will begin to mess with your head and could leave you stuck for a good couple of hours, completely stumped. I'm guilty to say that I even needed a guide to deal with a couple of these cryptic and twisted chambers. But then again, that really ruined the experience for me a little, considering I like to figure things out much more independently. So, if you can unwrap things around your mind quick and efficiently, you may experience the amazement and creativity for yourself. I'm pretty jealous in fact.\n\nThis game is a big recommendation for me. The scientific aspect of portal and three-dimensional space used in this game is best described as baffling. Valve must have been truly blessed to ever release this game, as it touched the hearts of kids, adults and professional scientists alike.","August 30, 2014","true","16.7"," 118 of 128 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","118","128","4","0"

While short, its puzzles make it an interesting game so much so that you'd immediately want to do a 2nd walkthrough. Also, there is a way to replay several of the so-called "chambers" but in a more difficult version.\n\nI'm not sure if this has mods like its sequel - nevertheless, it's worth completing this one before moving on to the next as the puzzles are even more difficult and diverse in Portal 2.\n\nI like how the game has a background story while it would not be necessary, at all. It has an excellent antagonist in the form of an A.I. called GLaDOS.\n\nPortal is a memorable experience and if you liked Half-Life you should pick up this Valve product, as well.\n\nOh, you didn't like Half-Life? Then, please go and have a cake. :)\n\nPS: I'm not sure why I have zero hours logged for this game. Probably because the logging system was introduced after I completed Portal.

This is the game that introduced us to Chell and super-computer GLaDOS, the villain with a stinging sense of humor, whose main operative seems to center around ensuring Chell be mangled and mamed rather than applauded for her quick thinking and wit. Chell takes on the role of the proverbial lab rat and her short but intensely enjoyable journey centers mostly around solving an increasing set of twisted-logic conundrums that are thrown her way all the while having a slice of utopia cake dangled in front of her nose in order to encourage her to push on .\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340293307\nPortal - the highlight of the Orange Box that released in 2007 - went on to win many game industry and publication GOTY awards and deservingly so. Things only got better when the full sequel released in 2012 to just as much acclaim and industry awards. Since Portal was more of a concept game - a game set within the confines of the Half-Life universe - it's not a particularly long one. I believe Valve was testing the waters with this title to see how such a first person puzzler would do in the fickle market dominated by first person shooters and open world brawlers. It plays splendidly and is incredibly funny - particularly Ellen McClain who takes on voice responsibilities for GLaDOS.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=336804066\nEverything from the script to the puzzle gameplay is utterly perfect and it spawned the classic meme "The cake is a lie" that is still just still as prevalent in Gaming Popular Culture today as it was back in 2007. It closes out with one of the most hysterical closing theme tunes you are likely to ever hear which ends up being the cherry on top of what is already a very delicious sundae.

Well, if you've heard nothing but great things about it, that is. Because this is easily one of the greatest puzzle games to ever be created. Hell, it may even be one of the greatest games created, period. It's like 'Half Life 2' but on crack! You thought crack was bad for you, didn't you? Well it turns out that crack is good when combined with elements of puzzle solving and first person shooters.\n\n'Portal' may be short, but it's pretty damn cheap too. And when you take into consideration the difficulty of the added challenges after you've completed the story, it should take a decent amount of time to complete.\n\nNevertheless, it's refreshing to see a first person 'shooter' without bullets and if you haven't picked this game up that's something that you should probably be doing right about now.","March 28, 2015","true","5.4"," 70 of 88 people (80%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","80","70","88","26","1"

If you don't know it already, the basic premise is having a gun capable of shooting two portals, between which you can travel to solve puzzles. Portal is a classic and, as you'll see below, I can hardly say anything bad about it. You should at least try it (there's a demo available, or so it seems)!\n\nPros:\nSmart puzzles, with great balance between pure thinking and skills (a bit too much on the skills side for my personal taste, but I wouldn't say it's a con)\nGreat atmosphere that builds up throughout the game\nFun side-quests, like finding radios and taking them to the right spot, and also putting down security cameras\nEven has advanced levels and challenges for hardcore players\nCons:\nApart from Least Portals, I couldn't find challenges any fun, especially the Least Steps challenge.\nCarrying objects around is slightly too clumsy. For instance, I'd like to be able to rotate what I'm carrying.\nBought on: Got it as a gift from Xsesis! Thanks a lot! It's been as cheap as US$ 1.99 (or R$ 3,99) on Steam. That's a steal!

It is a combination of first person camera view with an almost pure puzzle solving game style which is an awesome combination in my opinion.\nThe events of Portal take place within the Half Life universe. During the game, you take control of Chell, who wakes up inside the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. You are informed by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) that you will be participating in the testing of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. As you progress through the testing chamber, it becomes more readily apparent that all is not as it originally seemed.\nThe portal gun adds a whole new dimension to puzzle solving. All throughout the game, you are presented with situations that will seem near impossible to overcome. After some thought, it becomes clear how you can use the portal gun to solve the puzzle. As the game progresses,  the complexity of the puzzles increases and you often have to think two or three moves ahead in order to progress further.\nAfter you complete the game, two new modes, Challenge and Advanced, are unlocked. The Challenge mode forces players to solve the same puzzles again, but this time, with time or movement limits restricting them. Advanced mode simply ups the difficulty of puzzles by adding new obstacles and hazards.\nPortal is extremely short. It will take only a few hours to complete the whole game but the minimal time you will spend with the game, is well-worth the money.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","July 16, 2013","true","13.1"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","56","67","0","0"

The plot is simple; Your name is Chell, you're being tested in a research zone named Aperture Laboratories. You're only contact is an Ai named GLaDOS. She gives you various hints on how to pass the chambers and provides a bit of backstory to the events that happened prior to the game. You get a portal gun early on in the game which will allow you to create easy ways to travel from one part of the room to the other.

The gameplay is really fun and GLaDOS has some of the funniest and creepiest lines of any video game character. Some of the chambers can be pretty frustrating but once you figure out what to do, you'll have a lot of fun.

I have never played Portal before January 3rd, 2016. Sure, I've seen videos of Portal & seen my friends play it on their PCs, but as for myself - I have never played Portal before then.\nSo I'm glad I got it gifted by a friend right before the sale ended.\n\nDid I enjoy my time playing this game?\nWell obviously I did.\nTime to review.\n\nThe StoryPortal's story is already pretty well known and it's a rather simple one as well. And that's what I like about it. It's a very simple story to grasp & follow with enough bits & pieces of vagueness like the random rooms with writings & stuff all over it really add to it. I would go in depth more about it, but there's really all there is to say about it. It's just such a simple story that I'm left with barely any words on how to describe my opinion on it.\nI would make a separate section for the "Characters", but really, the only notable character throughout the entire game is GLaDOS. Starting off as this rather friendly robot voice telling you that you're doing a good job & proceeds to explain what each puzzle does and whatnot and then by the end turning into the game's enemy was great. I hardly ever got bored while playing, honestly.\nYeah, that's all I can say on the story aspect.\n\nThe GameplayAs per Valve tradition, this game uses the oh-so-beloved Source engine. Because of this, the gameplay really doesn't need much explanation. In this game, you solve puzzles or "tests" as GLaDOS calls them. At the beginning you go around the testing rooms just picking up & placing boxes on buttons to proceed, later get a portal gun that fires only blue portals to help with these tests & lastly you get to upgrade your portal gun to also place orange portals, giving you far more mobility to, basically do the same thing - place boxes on buttons. You also do things like redirecting energy balls into receivers to open doors. That is a very "in a nutshell" description of what you do in this game, but it's just enough to give you an idea of whether or not it's your type of "thing".\nIn lamence terms - this is a puzzle game. But it's far better than the way I described it here. Trust me.\nAre there any other guns besides the portal gun?\nNope.\nCan the portal gun damage enemies?\nNope.\nThis game is purely puzzle-based and it's a nice change of pace for the first-person genre, really.\nIt was a very relaxing experience, if anything, even the times when the game got tense.\n\nThe PresentationNote: This section covers the game's graphics, performance, voice acting and soundtrack.\nHow are the game's graphics? They are simple, but god they look good. I've played this game on the lowest settings since my computer is a piece of trash & I was stunned at how great the game looked on 800x600 with lowest settings. Really! And the performance of the game was also rather noteworthy! Again - I am using a totally trash computer and this game managed to play out rather pleasantly at 40-50 FPS average, with it dipping below 15 when there were lots of particles involved. I am super impressed, really! The voice acting for the turrets & GLaDOS was tremendous. They felt realistic, given their appearance and it gave off the atmosphere that they are, indeed, robots. Lastly, the soundtrack - I...didn't hear much of the soundtrack, I think this game has like 4 songs total. However, the songs that did play were pretty good. Loved the ending piece "Still Alive" a lot though. Great song.\n\nFinal VerdictOverall, I think I have been missing out all these years by not playing Portal. It's a very relaxing game, even during tense parts & most importantly - I had a fun time.\nThere's one huge drawback to it - the game is only 2 hours long.\nBut, regardless, it was great & I highly recommend this game.\n\nPortal gets a score of:7.5/10\nShort, but relaxing and it can work on pretty low-spec computers as well.\nRecommended!","January 6","true","2.0"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","34","43","0","2"

The story is that you play the role of a test subject, Chell, trapped in an abandoned building known as Apature Science. A mysterious voice instructs you to go through several test chambers with the use of a portal gun, a device that can shoot portals in order to teleport one place to another. So it all relies on your skill and brain power in order to escape Apature alive, while enjoying some cake for your victory... maybe. As the name states, the game is all about portals. Wether it be using portals to get to a higher area, or to get a weighted cube to hold down a switch, it's always fun to just mess around with the portal gun. There are 19 Levels and most of the puzzles are pretty easy, so it's a short game. There are also advanced maps and time trials that'll keep ya busy if you think the game is too easy. While it's sequel is much more popular, it's predecessor is still fun to play.","December 29, 2013","true","10.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

If there's one complaint about Portal it's that, yes, it's a bit short even if for $10 but it's not like you aren't gettiing your entertainment/experience value and its chock full of special features for further insight if that's your sorta thing (it is to me!)\n\nOne complaint that might not bother others but sorta bothered me - again because I'm comparing it to 2 instead of vice versa - is that the game wastes no time piling complexity at you versus in #2 how it could often blend world building and exploration more frequently. It's a case of tight budgeting vs. free property reign but I feel it should be addressed.\n\nAll in all, Portal again cements Valve's rep at never offering inept neurally challenged games.

Portal is a unique blend of the puzzle, FPS, and (to some extent) first-person platformer genres.\n\nThe game, for the most part, is a tutorial made into a full game.  This is, however, not a bad thing at all.  The game does its job exceptionally well to ensure the new mechanic, and namesake of the game, Portals, are taught to the player with little room for confusion.  This is an exceptional feat when Portals force players to think differently about the spaces around them, and how to traverse them.\n\nBesides enjoyable puzzles and interesting environments to explore, the game employs GLaDOS, effectively the narrator of the game, to serve as a means of adding dark comedy to the mix.  GLaDOS's unique sense of humor makes players want to continue through the game to discover both the secrets of the facility they wake up trapped within, and hear what witty remarks GLaDOS will say next.\n\nTo conclude, I would recommend Portal to any fans of puzzle games, as well as any fans of FPS or casual games.","August 2, 2015","true","29.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrookinCrepsley/recommended/400/","BrookinCrepsley","Brookin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrookinCrepsley/","46 products in account","After completing the game over four times, and doing the majority of things in Portal, I think I’m ready to review the game. So, Portal is a puzzle-platform game, developed by Valve, and as you cleverly-observed from the title ‘Portal’ there are… Portals, to help you pass each test chamber (best synopsis ever). Thus, I shall just jump straight into the review, which has been split into ‘different sections’ before giving my overall score and final opinions.\n\nStory  –\n\nThe game has quite a simplistic story – the protagonist (Chell) has to navigate through a total of nineteen test-chambers with her Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or simply the ‘portal gun’. She is essentially a lab-rat for GLaDOS, who is an artificial intelligence that would guide and monitor the player. I won’t say any more than that, as it does get quite interesting by the end of the game. When I played through the game for the first time, it took me about three to four hours to complete with that time getting shorter and shorter as I knew how to get through each level, but there was never a point where I felt I paid far too much for the game, and I felt that the game’s length suited the value.\n\nGameplay  –\n\nObviously, throughout this game you use portals. At the start, you can shoot blue portals before obtaining the ability to shoot orange portals as well. This concept was clearly reused by the game ‘Narbacular Drop’; I believe the people who made that game also joined Valve in making Portal. This idea was interesting enough on its own, for a short game, but they added a few more mechanics such as the Weighted Companion Cube coming into play, or the usage of speed benefitting you in quite a few puzzles. And I liked how Portal applies physics to each of its puzzles, thus making each solution seem more logical (well as logical as portals existing anyway). Of course, it’s nowhere near as in-depth as a handful of gameplay mechanics that has been introduced in the game’s sequel – Portal 2, yet because of the game’s length and style, it holds on its own and I never felt bored by the simple gameplay.\n\nReplayability  –\n\nAfter completing the game, there are further options to lengthen your gameplay-time such as attempting the Advanced Maps, which are quite challenging and they are pretty much just harder versions of existing maps you’ve already done in the original game. There’s also Portal Challenges which involves you trying to beat a puzzle with the least amount of portals, least amount of steps or the fastest time possible (however as of yet, I haven’t tried this option). But aside of trying to claim achievements, finding Easter eggs, finding different ways to do the same puzzle or attempting speed-runs of the game (I managed to complete the game at around 2.1 hours on my last attempt), there is very little reason to actually run through the game beyond a second, or even third time. Yet, even then, I still feel like this game is worth your money and your play-time may reach five-seven hours, if you disregard achievement-hunting or other activities within the game.\n\nOverall  –\n\nThis is a relatively shorter review, than to my first one, which suits the relatively shorter game (despite twenty hours of playtime) but honestly, this game must be acknowledged for its gameplay, its humour as well as its difficulty – as I have to say that the last four to six test-chambers do a good job of challenging you initially and there were fond moments, where I stopped and thought “Oh!!! That’s how you… …damn.”, after wasting  length proportion dying and head-scratching. I can honestly say that this game was a memorable experience for me, when I first bought it a couple of months ago, and it is as fun and enjoyable as it is now, with me now having fond memories of many different sections within this game. I must recommend this game to all, as this is a great game with many great qualities and almost no flaws aside of length (which is not even a major problem for me). Therefore, I’m giving the game an  8/10  and I would highly recommend people to buy it whether you are ok with the price, or whether you wish to buy the Portal Bundle on sale (Portal 1 + 2) for a relatively cheap price, it’s up to you.

While it isn't long by any means, it isn't supposed to be. Rather, it's supposed to be a game that you can complete within a few hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OrbiKitsune/recommended/400/","OrbiKitsune","Orbi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OrbiKitsune/","86 products in account","An eerie sci-fi, first person, physics puzzle game, Portal is the spin-off series to Half-Life taking place in the same universe.\n\n----\nOverviewTaking place in Aperture Science laboratories -the Enrichment Center- you are a test subject awakened from suspension state for testing purposes. You are given the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device to take place in the physics experiment, though the plot unravels to reveal a darker truth to the facilities.\n\nGameplayPlaying Portal on the first time can be admittedly disorienting, but the player progressively adapts to the puzzling nature of the portals and the Device throughout the test chambers. Dealing with test elements such as moving platforms, high-energy pellets, AI turrets and acid pits, each chamber is challenging in its own manner.\n\nYou can also try the extra challenges in the game for bragging rights and achievements.\n\nPlotWhile relatively shallow, the plot of the original Portal game has a certain degree of paranoia fuel and space for imagination of what's manipulating the experiment and the nature of the Enrichment Center. Combined with the ARG and further content ('Lab Rat' comic, among others), the game lore is carried forward and somewhat explained of how it fits within the Half-Life universe, leading into the events of the sequel.\n\nGraphicsDecent level of detail for a puzzle game, and low performance required make this game worth a try for even older machines.\n\nSoundThe soundtrack of Kelly Bailey, composer of the Half-Life series has the uncanny feeling of both sinister, outworldish experience that Aperture Science becomes to the player, helping the immersion into the strange world of Aperture.\nThe sound effects in the game are fitting to the setting, mainly consisting of sci-fi noises and mechanical machinery. Few audio errors are noticeable if any.\n----\n\nTL;DR: A strange puzzle game that proves a challenging experience  eventually brings you deeper into the lore of Aperture Science, a fairly enjoyable game with a great sequel and setting.","December 27, 2014","true","47.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

In terms of video games: it is the very definition of short & sweet. There are many people out there overly concerned with the length of games, and I believe Portal is an excellent example of why one shouldn’t immediately scoff at a short game due to prejudices. Sometimes 3 hours of perfection is better than 20 hours of mediocrity. Sit down, immerse yourself, and just play through the game in one sitting as you would if watching a movie. It is worth it.\n\nI say this because I believe this is a game best enjoyed in one sitting. There are no lulls or down points, and every second of the game is riveting and purposeful. The whole experience is so genuinely entertaining and the pacing is so perfectly on point that I think it is designed to be played like this. In this way, I see the length of the game as a strength and not a weakness… but maybe I’m just crazy.\n\nBut what is it that makes the game so genuinely entertaining in the first place? Everything… and then some. The concept is innovative, the puzzles are intuitive and interesting, the atmosphere is captivating, and the dialogue is hilarious and flawless. And when all of these facets come together in the finished product, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And a game is created that transcends opinions: it is undeniably great.\n\nHonestly, I respect everyone’s right to their own taste in video games; but if you don’t enjoy Portal, I would dutifully suggest you consider finding a new hobby. I would find it very hard to understand how anyone could possibly not enjoy this game if they consider themselves a “gamer.”\n\nIf you haven’t yet had the luxury of experiencing Portal, then I envy you. Stop thinking about it and just go for it.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","9.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

An interesting puzzle game with a storyline lying just under the surface. It also spawned a meme that simply will not go away. Oh, and this game is technically part of the Half Life universe. Might be relevent if HL3 ever comes, and it also explains certain comments.\n\nTo get the most out of this game, you need to play it in a relatively quiet setting. It helps you take in the environment and the atmospheric soundtrack better. This is not needed as much in the sequel as the soundtrack and environments are more pronounced.\n\nIn general, a very solid title.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/recommended/400/","thesmolder","Akihiko Sanada","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/","105 products in account","Introduction: A completely original and innovative game!\n\nIf you have a passion for sci-fi, and enjoy solving puzzles, this first person experience is exactly what you're looking for! Portal takes place at the heart of the Aperture Enrichment Center, where the test subject is united with her trusty companion cube and Handheld Portal Device in the name of science. There are 19 test chambers altogether.\n\nStory: While the story itself might be a bit bare, there is plenty food for thought, and suggestive twisted backstory regarding Aperture. It all begins in the Relaxation Vault, where the test subject first comes into contact with the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (further referred to as GLaDOS), and is then educated on how to use the portal gun. With GLaDOS as your guide, what could possibly go wrong? After all, nobody else is as familiar with the Aperture Laboratories as the artificial intelligence that oversees seemingly all of Aperture's scientific experiments. Much of the story is best left unsaid, so I put the rest in spoiler tags.\n\nIt isn't long before the character will stumble over various forms of warnings, from an unseen individual, warning her about the facility... More importantly, her guide. With this in mind, the character dynamics shift, and her task becomes clear: She must escape a laboratory otherwise devoid of human life.\n\nGameplay: Covering the basics: A complete portal consists of both an exit and entrance. Throughout the game, the character will acquire two extremely important pieces of equipment, which will enable her to create a complete portal. Initially, she will not be able to make a portal by herself, which forces her to rely on various forms of equipment littering the early chambers of the facility on her journey to the first gun. Only when the blue gun is acquired, can she unlock the ability to make half of the portal for herself. Soon after, she will be in possession of both portals, which is where the real fun begins.\n\nWith both halves of the portal, the options become endless. The character could essentially jump or fall forever. Regardless, the game offers a lot of content for beginners and advanced players alike. Regardless, the game is highly addictive, and will leave the player with a desire for more. If this is your first puzzle game, don't give up! Once you get the hang of the game mechanics, clearing the game will be a cinch. I promise.\n\nThe theme provides a perfect balance between creepy and mysterious, leaving the player in suspense. Yet, the best feature is easily the dialogue of GLaDOS which sporadically plays through the game.\n\nI think my only complaint is that the game is so short, but not to worry, there's a sequel. =)\n\nControls: I found the controls to be a little bit tricky at first, but they were something that grew on me with a bit of practice. The game is compatible with the XBOX 360 controller, if you have it installed to your computer, however I stand by my initial statement: Default controls are a bit tricky, but something that the player will easily pick up with a little bit of patience. I can't really complain too much about the controls in Portal.\n\nGraphics: Aesthetically, Portal felt a little bland to me, but the overall effect fits its story perfectly. Sleek, and defined, the visual appearance does its job. On a very rare occasion, you might run into small graphics glitches, but it is nothing to worry about.\n\nSound: I, for one, really freaking love the voice of GLAdOS. The amount of humour that she presents to the game is astonishing on its own, and really distracted me from being able to give a solid opinion about the otherwise subtle sounds of Portal.\n\nReplay Value: Definitely a game that can be played multiple times! Portal is genius, and if you don't love GLaDOS (or Portal) within a few hours, I myself will question your humanity... Not to mention there will be no cake for you!\n\n“Thank you for helping us help you help us all.” -GLaDOS","July 9, 2014","true","21.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

The storyline is perfect, little bits of humour, puzzle, action, even some mysterious horror.\n\nYou play as Chell, a completely mute human who is the only person known to have survived the events prior, where the scientists at Aperture Laboratries all got poisoned by GLaDOS, a robot they had built, which went insane. Now GLaDOS uses you as her guinea pig and puts you through a vast amount of tests, each one solvable using the famous Portal Gun and the many contraptions available in the particular testchamber. This game is surely one of my favorite games. If you're a Half Life fan as well, there's a few mentions of Black Mesa and the Borealis in this game so it's worthwhile getting.\n\nThe sequel kind of tops this game in my opinion, but that's because I really like storyline and Portal 2 has that plus a bunch of comedic dialogue from some really interesting and charismatic characters.

For example, the physics engine that Valve built into Source were a big part of what made HL2 feel so fresh and new in 2004. It allowed for a new type of game puzzle - one based purely on mundane real-world puzzle solving. But Portal 2 takes that formula, and with one introduction (Portals), and one reduction (almost no adrenaline action), turns FPS into FPPP: First-person physics puzzler.\n\nBut the puzzles alone aren't what make Portal great. The pacing is perfect. The humor is dry and laugh-out-loud funny (tip: turn on the captions). But Portal's crowning achievement is its ability to make a player feel like a genius when he or she figures out the puzzles. The "a ha" moments are a pure endorphine tidal wave.\n\nIf you haven't played Portal yet, what are you waiting for?","April 28, 2011","true","6.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They're easy as first, but as you progress they get harder. During testing, GLaDOS promises Chell things like cake and grief counseling. However, after Chell discovers some graffitti revealing the AI's true intentions, Chell is skeptical of this so called "reward". After dodging adorable but deadly turrets, flinging through portals, and incinerating a cute box, you finally make it to the last test chamber.

And if you don't know already, it is in the same story line of Half Life.\n\nStory: This game has a beautiful story that shows you what can happen when you have a unstable super-computer incontrol of a futuristic science facilty that houses many advanced devices that need testing and that actually sounds bat-♥♥♥♥ crazy. The story shows you affection, signs of insanity, betrayal and much more and has a lot of testing courses. The test chambers are great and have enough things in them to be tough, but tough enough where you want to solve it instead of quiting.\n\nPhysics/portals: The portal gun is great and really shows off what the physics engine can do. You can also use the engine and do the chambers in different ways using different methods using physics. Also, you may think that "Well you can place a portal anywhere..." and well, that's wrong and that gives me a challenge because I always want to shoot less and less portals to do the chamber...\n\nGraphics: The graphics back then, were good, but not amazing. It uses textures that look like Half Life 2's, but that is because they are on the same Earth. Everything loads great, but sometimes I'll think to myself and say that some textures need a face lift.\n\nSounds: The sounds are great and I have never thought to myself that one sound wouldn't go with that item/object or device.\n\nVoice acting: The voice acting is great. The woman that did GlaDos' voice did a real great job and you really do think that it is a computer talking to you. Same thing with the turrets, since they say things as if what they are saying is what they are programed to say.\n\nFinal verdict: 94/100 This game is great on so many levels and the only thing that stops it from getting 100/100 is that the story doesn't go in depth of Apeture science until Portal 2 and sure they did go more in depth in Portal 2, but Valve could have done it in Portal.","December 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've completed it about 12 times. It's definitly the smartest game ever created, but it's also very short. I like this game much better than I like Portal 2. Portal 2 was almost a comedy game, while Portal 1 is more ambient and dark, and in the last four test chambers  the Ratman Dens makes it feel sort of a horror game, and soundtracks like Self Esteem Fund really makes it feel like you're alone. I had to take a walk after I played the game for my first time, just to see people again. I love this game and I'd really like Portal 3 if/when it comes out to be more like Portal 1 than Portal 2. Don't get me wrong, Portal 2 is an awesome game, but Portal 1 remains the better game.

It's a game everyone could enjoy, in my opinion.\n\nThe storyline itself took me about 2 to 3 hours to complete. The additional challenges and advanced chambers are nice features, great for adding some game time and a challenge for those who like getting all achievements.\n\nThe chambers and puzzles get harder smoothly as you advance through the game.  However, it can get a tiny bit repetitive. The portal mechanism really makes this game unique. I really love the smooth physics. Good graphics. The music and sound are okay. The dialog is simply brilliant and hilarious. Through the game, there are several nice additions (random radios playing the catchy theme song, messages from other test subjects) which caused me to laugh from time to time.\n\nPortal 2, the sequel, is in my opinion even better, but you just have to play Portal before you start on the sequel. Together, they're a masterpiece.\n\nI highly recommend buying this game. It's definitely worth the money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialxstatic/recommended/400/","officialxstatic","The Prince Of Darkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialxstatic/","87 products in account",""The cake is a lie!"\nPortal is set in the mysterious Aperture Science Laboratories. You use your portal gun to create portals to help solve puzzles to finish "Test Chambers" after finishing all of which you will be awarded with cake. You use the power phyisics such as gravity and momentum, and manipulate them to solve the puzzles. When trying to finish the test chambers GladOS the Aperture Science Laboratories' Artificial Intelligence is watching you. To put it simply GladOS is the name of the robot that  is assessing you while you are solving each test chamber. The difficulty of the test chambers can vary for each person. Some may find areas easier than others however this does NOT decrease the amount of enjoyment provided by this game.\n\nThis game is known for its gameplay and story shine. Portal's level designs are fantastic. They indirectly teach the player new tricks and strategies to help finish the test chamber even in an absolutely instructionless and deadly environment. The story is weaved quietly throughout until a truly grand finale and an excellent ending.\n\nThe game's length can vary on how difficult you find it but the average length is around 2 hours so it is quite short. Keep in mind those 2 hours will be some of the best you have ever spent.\n\nFor $9.99 Portal is worth it however if you are a fan of Valve or are new to steam I would recommend buying The Orange Box for $19.99 which contains Portal and four other titles from Valve. The Orange Box includes\n\nHalf-Life 2\nHalf-Life 2: Episode 1\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two\nTeam Fortress 2 (Free to Play)\nPortal\nCheck out The Orange Box\n\nVerdict\n\nPortal is a fantastic puzzle game and is a must-have. This game unlike others only has one downside to it and that is that it is too short. Everyting considered this is a game you should be throwing your money at.\n\n9/10 (would spend 2 hours of my life playing Portal again)","December 14, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lizz/recommended/400/","c00lizz","c00lizz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lizz/","2086 products in account","Portal is in many ways a strange game. At it's core it's a puzzle game, not something most people would consider mainstream but through a great sense of innovation as well as some truly inspired writing it somehow manages to pull it off.\n\nThe concept of Portal is simple enough. You progress through a series of rooms. In each room you must get from the entrance to the exit overcoming whatever obstacles and dangers might be in there using nothing but your trusty portal gun. The portal gun, quite simply, "shoots" a portal entrance onto a flat surface which allows you to travel through it.\n\nThis fairly simple concept does get quite a bit more tricky as you progress through the game as moving platforms, lasers, turrets and many other troublesome entities try to stop you.\n\nThroughout the game you are accompanied by the sometimes scolding, somethings taunting and sometimes soothing voice of G.L.A.D.O.S. The AI in charge of your training and who might be a little mentally unstable as you'll soon discover. Although G.L.A.D.O.S is the only voice you'll hear in the game she does a fantastic job of keeping your entertained throughout your journey. The humor is some of the best you'll see in a game and the storyline is interesting enough that you'll pay attention to every little tidbit you encounter.\n\nThe only negative to be mentioned is the very short length of the game that leaves you wanting more. Sadly, the only alternative to replaying the game and pretending to be surprised is the challenges which are fairly boring rinse and repeat because of their extremely unforgiving nature.\n\nPortal is a great game and one that any Steam user should have in his library, not just because it's been given away for free to all users not once, but twice. But because it is a truly impressive game experience.","November 14, 2012","true","95.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Portal is a challenging physics based game that shows off in the best possible way. Having said that the game isn't very long, having taken about 3:30 hours to finish it. I wasn't, however left unsatisfied. Portal was a simple yet challenging game that really gave me a sense of achievement having completed it. With the addition of bonus maps there is still plenty of work to be done after the main story line is finished.\nThe story line itself is intricately with a lot of hidden secrets that's it is completely up to the player to find, adding another level to the game.\nAll in all a fantastic idea coupled with a fantastic story line.. Making for a fantastic game\n\nMy rating:\nLength:8/10\nGameplay:10/10\nAll round enjoyment:10/10\n","November 22, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Mixing puzzle gameplay, fantastic dialog, and the sadistic yet lovable frenemy GLaDOS, it is easily one of my favorite new IPs in years.\n\nThough it starts out simple enough, Valve is quick to remind you of how incredibly smart and inovative they are. Portals begin being used in all sorts of ways I'd never have thought of, and yet it's never the least bit overwhelming or overly challenging. Solving the puzzles is great fun, but it's really the dialog that stands out. This is hands down some of the best writing I've heard in a video game, and it's delivery is marvelous.\n\nGraphically it might not be the most technically impressive, but it's simple visual scheme is all it's own, and even the most mundane objects become memorable.

What it lacks in content (you could quite easily finish this game, and all the achievements, in two hours), it makes up for in ingenuity. The portal-gun system is a refreshing element which requires you in many cases to subvert typical puzzle-solving instincts and instead "think with portals", as the game advises. Once you wrap your head around the mechanics though, the puzzles rarely offer a reasonably-quick-witted individual a sufficient challenge. Occasionally, a curveball will be thrown in, but each test chamber is little more than a moment's contemplation away from ephihany. Regular FPS players will find the quicker-paced sections of portal-shooting fun, but short lived if you're sure with your aim, and frustating if you're not. The game's main strength comes from it's humour, which is plentifully provided for by the game's "narrator", GlaDoS, though the story behind it isn't fully realised until Portal 2, which is, overall, a MUCH better game. Still, don't let that put you off. I was glad I bought this, and I'd recommend it.","December 4, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While this game is technically a continuation of Half Life, that doesn't matter in the slightest. 'Portal' is the beginning of its own franchise and does not dissapoint in any aspect. The game's incredibly innovative 'Portal Gun' system, the amazing background and characters, and the now famous cake. Combines to form a fantastic all-round atmospheric experience. A brilliant story-driven puzzle game (with a nice dose of action splashed in) and ultimately, in my opinion, Valve's best work so far. And the sequel's even better.......","January 16, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The name of the game is to escape, using a fascinating device that lets you open up personal wormholes on special surfaces. Guiding you on your way is a forever omnipresent computer AI that is perhaps a little too interested in testing her subjects.\n\nI take that back. The name of the game is to drop yourself into infinite free fall, hurl yourself across giant chasms of acid, and somehow always land like a cat. And damn is that fun.\n\nPuzzles, for the most part, involve moving blocks onto platforms so that you can open a door. But thankfully that's not nearly as boring as it sounds. You'll have to get creative, and, while it bothers me when puzzle games do this, you'll need to bring reflexes/timing into some puzzles.\n\nMy only problem (which is a personal problem) is that the game is entirely in first person. I can't play for too long without suffering from motion sickness. I would have liked it if the game allowed 3rd person without the use of the console. I understand they wanted to keep the player's identity a secret until you look at yourself through a portal, but it's not like this was a major reveal or anything. This is enough of a problem for me that I had to dock some points for the game because I still fail to see how 3rd person would have ruined the experience.\n\nVery well thought-out puzzles, good narrative, and a great ending song (which I didn't really connect with until I played the game) that will stick in your head for weeks. 9/10","April 25, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It got me asking multiple questins: Who was I? Was there a villain? If so what was their intention?\nDue to my unawareness throughout playing it gave me a slight nervousness and jitteryness within certain chambers.\nIt's atmosphere is unlike any other game I have ever played. I recommend this game to be played with headphones at a moderatley high volume where every footstep and movement can be heard. There were points throughout the game where I genuinly felt alone and disconected from the outside world (but if you're a skyrim or Wow player you already know that feel). This was all due to the games lack of contact that you have with the games narrator who is guiding you throughout the tests. Because of the on and off again dialogue you really get to be alone with your thoughts and it creates a more chilling design whenever you hear the voice of GLaDoS in levels.\nThe gameplay itself was not dissapointing so much as thought provoking, in some first-person games such as CoD your objective is simple; KILL EVERYTHING. In Portal you can sometimes spend a while thinking what your objective is and how to solve the puzzle (however frustrating it may have become)\nThe challenges can become somewhat tedious at points  but that differs from gamer to gamer.\nIf you want an hour or two to kill I recommend this game\nIf you want a twenty plus hour game experience I wouldn't steer clear from it but I would prepare myself for what may seem as a quick game.\n9.5/10\n\nPros:\n-Brilliant Gameplay and Design\n-Excellent atmosphere\nCons:\n-Challenges can become tedious\n-Urge to buy Portal 2 even though I am broke\nSuper Pro:\n-End credit song","February 8, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

In fact, I did. I've never played a puzzle game of this kind, so it was something new for me.\nThe plot is very well done. I wouldn't say it's amazing, but still, it was surprising at every level (or at least every 3 levels)\nThe graphics were really nice despite of when it was released (2007) (In fact, Portal 2 looks almost the same. Almost. Of course, 4 years are noticed)\nGLaDos (I still don't know where the caps go xD) is the best "evil" I've ever seen (well, mostly heard). His sense of humour is unique. As well as its freakin' speech. Really amazing. And the end. Oh, you will love the end.\nThe voice acting was nice too, but, well, GLaDos is the only one who talks. You are mute, I guess, since I didn't hear the main character's voice in the whole game. And the final song, the end song. It's simply amazing, astonishing and wonderful.\nAnd the puzzles. There are easy ones. And there are difficult ones. But the average is quite easy. (Still, some of them took me a few minutes more than others)\n\nSo, there are only pros. Nope. Only one negative thing: is a bit short. Yeah, I finished it in 2,2 h. And I repeated a few puzzles since I died many times. You can say I didn't enjoy the game. But I really did. It's a bit short, that's all. But it's great.\n\nI do reccomend this game.\n\n9.7/10 (-0,3 for the shortness ;)\n\nPD: Written by a non-native english speaker.\n\nPD2: I forgot to say that the game it's not worth 7 €. Too short for that price. I reccomend to wait for a sale, huge or normal. I bought it at 1,74€.","February 9, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/recommended/400/","enixe","Enix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/","174 products in account","Portal is the first of (currently) two first-person-puzzle game installments set in the laboratory environment of Aperture Science. Main focus of the game is the addition of the "Portal Gun", a scientific device that lets the player create interdimensional portals in order to solve a set of mindblowing and deadly puzzle chambers. Evade turrets and acidic pits, push buttons and use boxes to help you. Guide energy and master the mind of the portal.\n\nDesign & ArtSince the game was created and developed by Valve Software, their "Source" engine runs the whole show and pretty good too. Even at the current time of writing this review (and consecutively playing the game again) in 2015, the graphics did not gather any dust and still look good, since the games release eight years ago. The graphics profit from the setting of clean and sterile lab environments, since nothing really needs to be absolutely good looking, everything is just intended to make it feel really bland, cold and unforgiving. This helps immersing into Portal and its mindset: 'You are a labrat, you are the testsubject; we need you to do what we say without any doubt in mind.'\n\nI greatly enjoy the whole atmosphere of the game; once you play the game, you are truly feeling alone. It is only you, your thoughts, that crazy computer lady voice that keeps talking to you saying weird stuff and the smooth humming of the machinery that surrounds you. Everything feels very strange and suspicious, you instantly feel doubtful about the situation you are thrown into; a situation that desires to be resolved and discussed about.\n\nOverall, the design is very minimalistic, yet very loveable. The portal gun itself, the portals, walls, turrets, everything is designed with love and care, everything is designed to feel sterile and emotionless. These are the only things you are going to see for the duration of the game. Remember, you are a labrat in a cage, you do the tests, until you have lost your value as a subject.\n\nControlsThe game is played from first-person-perspective. If you have played any shooter in the last century, you will know how to control your character in the game and if you do not: Portal offers tooltips at the beginning of the game.\n\nSound & MusicThere isn't much sound to this game, Portal lives from its sterile and clean environment, meaning that most of the time, you will be hearing just the noise of machinery humming away or the cute little speechfiles turrents play, when you cross their sights. Everything seems to be crafted with utmost love and care, even the unregular fade in of random soundtracks feel very nice. The music feels fitting and well made, a soundtrack that could capture your attention for days (and eventually did, for me anyway). Nothing feels interrupting or irritating. The game keeps its sound backdrop as shallow as its intention, one might say.\n\nGameplay You play as a testsubject in a laboratory testsetting. You solve puzzles by using your portal gun to create portals and using gravitational or mechanical forces aswell as your wits. This game really set a new trend in case of puzzle games. I remember playing this game for the first time, it was very hard to adapt to the new premise of me being able to create portals. If you are a dedicated puzzle fan, this game is highly recommendable for you! You are garanteed to have about three to five hours of challenging puzzle solving fun!\n\nAdditional content next to the main storyline is available in the form of a challenge mode (certain chambers that must be solved under different concitions, e.g. your least amount of portals you can create to get to the end) aswell as advanced maps (chambers, that have been increased in difficulty through some means). That makes another two to four hours of fun (be sure to take breaks though, some of the chambers are just unforgiving!).\n\nWeakpointsThere is only one weakpoint in my opinion: I have encountered some people, that did not like the game for its open ending. I can completely agree, the game mostly does a poor job at answering specific questions about it. BUT (very big BUT) it is intended to keep it that way, If you are a person, that favors conclusion over confusion, I hereby warn you about this game. You are intended to be kept in the dark, you are the test subject, everything is kept from you and only shared on a need-to-know basis. Do not play, if you are looking for answers, but if you want to ask questions. It is all just a matter of taste in the end.\n\nConcluding ThoughtsThe game, that changed everything. It is absolutely understandable why this game won several prizes and awards for its genuine design and loveable plotline. The mystery and world of Portal is created to make you ask: What is all this testing for? Why am I being tested on? And why am I here in the first place?\n\nPortal is a game I can safely recommend to EVERYONE. Yes, the game is that simple and enjoyable. A true game that set a new standard. Whoever came up with the idea and its whole execution should be swimming in adoration and money right now. I am completely content with this game and I enjoy it to this day. Play it. You really should. You're missing out if you don't. So get to it! NOW!","March 27","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonlore23/recommended/400/","dragonlore23","Dragon_Lore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonlore23/","128 products in account","Firstly, I'd like to say that this game is very far up on my favourite games of all time, alongside games of completely different genres such as Fallout 2.\n\nThe setting for Portal is unclear immediately, but you quickly become aware of the fact that you are a test subject for Aperture Labs, whcih cements its place in the Half-Life universe. Guided by an omnipresent voice, you make your way through the different chambers of increasingly difficult tests.\n\nAlthough this synopsis may make this game seem somewhat shallow, it most certainly is not. The main character, Chell, although mute, develops a personality regardless. An attachment is created with this voice guiding you. And, most cryptically, is the hidden areas in the chambers. These give background into Aperture Laboratories, the 'voice', and possibly the sole survivor.\n\nWhen compared to Portal 2, Portal does have some significant flaws. This include a lack of characters and personality which, although there, isn't built upon until later in the game. There aren't as many testing mechanics in the original, but this leads to much more creative test designes, requiring ingenuity over resources.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing, and you will fell dissapointed upon its completion. Portal 2 builds upon the first, and is a must after this is completed.","December 5, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game indirectly teaches you new strategies to solve the puzzles, and it feels rewarding when you realize how to solve them. After solving a series of puzzles you are then awarded with cake.\n\nI was instantly hooked by the smart concept of this game. Portal comes with great mechanics and style. The levels pace very well; they start off easy and are quick while the later levels become more challenging. Although it can be quite frustrating at times, frustrating enough to the point where you are stuck and must see a walkthrough online, the puzzles are generally easy and you can finish the game in 4 hours or less.\n\nBecause you will only get a few hours from this game, I would recommend to wait on that discount or go for The Orange Box (bundle).

And if it had arms. and if it talks. and if it had guns, and lasers and.... There is also some green sludge at the bottom that if you fall into you die probably because it smells so horrid or maybe because it is green and we all know green is bad, just like vegetables.\n\nBasically the game is like this, get from point a to point b. With this robot lady nagging you all the time about some cake or whatever, robots shaped like guns shooting guns, avoiding balls of plasma that activate doors, using cubical shaped objects to do what cubical shaped objects do, like dying in a fire, while avoiding green puke on the ground while warping space-time itself so that you can get from point a to point b. Seems simple, all you do is shoot that gun and warp the space field around the walls because worm holes on mid air could prove disastrous, creating a black hole and destroying the entire universe and blowing up your computer. It happened to me, twice. Remember do not try to open portals in the air.\n\nGraphics - 8/10\nGameplay - 9/10\nAnnoying robot voice - 2/10\n\nAlso there is no cake in this game, so overall score:\n0/10 (No cake for you)\n\nNow go buy this game and your own cake.\n","July 31, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/recommended/400/","enixe","Enix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/","174 products in account","Portal is the first of (currently) two first-person-puzzle game installments set in the laboratory environment of Aperture Science. Main focus of the game is the addition of the "Portal Gun", a scientific device that lets the player create interdimensional portals in order to solve a set of mindblowing and deadly puzzle chambers. Evade turrets and acidic pits, push buttons and use boxes to help you. Guide energy and master the mind of the portal.\n\nDesign & ArtSince the game was created and developed by Valve Software, their "Source" engine runs the whole show and pretty good too. Even at the current time of writing this review (and consecutively playing the game again) in 2015, the graphics did not gather any dust and still look good, since the games release eight years ago. The graphics profit from the setting of clean and sterile lab environments, since nothing really needs to be absolutely good looking, everything is just intended to make it feel really bland, cold and unforgiving. This helps immersing into Portal and its mindset: 'You are a labrat, you are the testsubject; we need you to do what we say without any doubt in mind.'\n\nI greatly enjoy the whole atmosphere of the game; once you play the game, you are truly feeling alone. It is only you, your thoughts, that crazy computer lady voice that keeps talking to you saying weird stuff and the smooth humming of the machinery that surrounds you. Everything feels very strange and suspicious, you instantly feel doubtful about the situation you are thrown into; a situation that desires to be resolved and discussed about.\n\nOverall, the design is very minimalistic, yet very loveable. The portal gun itself, the portals, walls, turrets, everything is designed with love and care, everything is designed to feel sterile and emotionless. These are the only things you are going to see for the duration of the game. Remember, you are a labrat in a cage, you do the tests, until you have lost your value as a subject.\n\nControlsThe game is played from first-person-perspective. If you have played any shooter in the last century, you will know how to control your character in the game and if you do not: Portal offers tooltips at the beginning of the game.\n\nSound & MusicThere isn't much sound to this game, Portal lives from its sterile and clean environment, meaning that most of the time, you will be hearing just the noise of machinery humming away or the cute little speechfiles turrents play, when you cross their sights. Everything seems to be crafted with utmost love and care, even the unregular fade in of random soundtracks feel very nice. The music feels fitting and well made, a soundtrack that could capture your attention for days (and eventually did, for me anyway). Nothing feels interrupting or irritating. The game keeps its sound backdrop as shallow as its intention, one might say.\n\nGameplay You play as a testsubject in a laboratory testsetting. You solve puzzles by using your portal gun to create portals and using gravitational or mechanical forces aswell as your wits. This game really set a new trend in case of puzzle games. I remember playing this game for the first time, it was very hard to adapt to the new premise of me being able to create portals. If you are a dedicated puzzle fan, this game is highly recommendable for you! You are garanteed to have about three to five hours of challenging puzzle solving fun!\n\nAdditional content next to the main storyline is available in the form of a challenge mode (certain chambers that must be solved under different concitions, e.g. your least amount of portals you can create to get to the end) aswell as advanced maps (chambers, that have been increased in difficulty through some means). That makes another two to four hours of fun (be sure to take breaks though, some of the chambers are just unforgiving!).\n\nWeakpointsThere is only one weakpoint in my opinion: I have encountered some people, that did not like the game for its open ending. I can completely agree, the game mostly does a poor job at answering specific questions about it. BUT (very big BUT) it is intended to keep it that way, If you are a person, that favors conclusion over confusion, I hereby warn you about this game. You are intended to be kept in the dark, you are the test subject, everything is kept from you and only shared on a need-to-know basis. Do not play, if you are looking for answers, but if you want to ask questions. It is all just a matter of taste in the end.\n\nConcluding ThoughtsThe game, that changed everything. It is absolutely understandable why this game won several prizes and awards for its genuine design and loveable plotline. The mystery and world of Portal is created to make you ask: What is all this testing for? Why am I being tested on? And why am I here in the first place?\n\nPortal is a game I can safely recommend to EVERYONE. Yes, the game is that simple and enjoyable. A true game that set a new standard. Whoever came up with the idea and its whole execution should be swimming in adoration and money right now. I am completely content with this game and I enjoy it to this day. Play it. You really should. You're missing out if you don't. So get to it! NOW!","March 27","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Console or PC, Story driven or arcade-y, and what genre? I thought about this long and hard.\n\nThen it hit me.\nPortal.\n\nIt starts off slow, but not too slow. It give the player a mystery, letting them be intrigued and keep on going. It doesn't rush them into anything, so it's not overwhelming.\n\nThe gamplay is unique, and anyone would be interested in the concept of using portals to solve puzzles. The puzzles are designed in such way that they are challenging for anyone, yet you don't need any outside knowledge to solve them.\n\nIt's not overly anything, there would be no way a new player would get overwhelmed and want to quit. Yet the game drives you to move forward. It's briliant.\n\nI don't think any game is perfect. But the closest game to being perfect would have to be Portal.\n\nSo yeah, buy it and stuff.","November 8, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game indirectly teaches you new strategies to solve the puzzles, and it feels rewarding when you realize how to solve them. After solving a series of puzzles you are then awarded with cake.\n\nI was instantly hooked by the smart concept of this game. Portal comes with great mechanics and style. The levels pace very well; they start off easy and are quick while the later levels become more challenging. Although it can be quite frustrating at times, frustrating enough to the point where you are stuck and must see a walkthrough online, the puzzles are generally easy and you can finish the game in 4 hours or less.\n\nBecause you will only get a few hours from this game, I would recommend to wait on that discount or go for The Orange Box (bundle).

(Is it a fps? Well, that´s debatable.) The game most certainly is a puzzle game, so your gonna have to use your brain on this one. Portal is a game that will challenge your MIND. So unlike in most games, you have to actually think while playing this... and think ALOT. This kinda challenge can be very tricky in a video game and can easily ruin the gameplay, but the Portal does just the opposite: The gameplay is fun because it´s challenging! The game is just enough difficult to be competitive in a good way, the feeling you get when clearing a difficult level without any help is super rewarding experience! Add this with GlaDOS and a portal gun (which is, let´s be real here: one of the coolest "weapon" in a world of gaming) and you have a super joyful, challenging and unique game, that is an absolute must-have jewel in your library.\n\n4/5 This game has the best credits i have ever seen","January 5","true","23.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/recommended/400/","enixe","Enix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/","174 products in account","Portal is the first of (currently) two first-person-puzzle game installments set in the laboratory environment of Aperture Science. Main focus of the game is the addition of the "Portal Gun", a scientific device that lets the player create interdimensional portals in order to solve a set of mindblowing and deadly puzzle chambers. Evade turrets and acidic pits, push buttons and use boxes to help you. Guide energy and master the mind of the portal.\n\nDesign & ArtSince the game was created and developed by Valve Software, their "Source" engine runs the whole show and pretty good too. Even at the current time of writing this review (and consecutively playing the game again) in 2015, the graphics did not gather any dust and still look good, since the games release eight years ago. The graphics profit from the setting of clean and sterile lab environments, since nothing really needs to be absolutely good looking, everything is just intended to make it feel really bland, cold and unforgiving. This helps immersing into Portal and its mindset: 'You are a labrat, you are the testsubject; we need you to do what we say without any doubt in mind.'\n\nI greatly enjoy the whole atmosphere of the game; once you play the game, you are truly feeling alone. It is only you, your thoughts, that crazy computer lady voice that keeps talking to you saying weird stuff and the smooth humming of the machinery that surrounds you. Everything feels very strange and suspicious, you instantly feel doubtful about the situation you are thrown into; a situation that desires to be resolved and discussed about.\n\nOverall, the design is very minimalistic, yet very loveable. The portal gun itself, the portals, walls, turrets, everything is designed with love and care, everything is designed to feel sterile and emotionless. These are the only things you are going to see for the duration of the game. Remember, you are a labrat in a cage, you do the tests, until you have lost your value as a subject.\n\nControlsThe game is played from first-person-perspective. If you have played any shooter in the last century, you will know how to control your character in the game and if you do not: Portal offers tooltips at the beginning of the game.\n\nSound & MusicThere isn't much sound to this game, Portal lives from its sterile and clean environment, meaning that most of the time, you will be hearing just the noise of machinery humming away or the cute little speechfiles turrents play, when you cross their sights. Everything seems to be crafted with utmost love and care, even the unregular fade in of random soundtracks feel very nice. The music feels fitting and well made, a soundtrack that could capture your attention for days (and eventually did, for me anyway). Nothing feels interrupting or irritating. The game keeps its sound backdrop as shallow as its intention, one might say.\n\nGameplay You play as a testsubject in a laboratory testsetting. You solve puzzles by using your portal gun to create portals and using gravitational or mechanical forces aswell as your wits. This game really set a new trend in case of puzzle games. I remember playing this game for the first time, it was very hard to adapt to the new premise of me being able to create portals. If you are a dedicated puzzle fan, this game is highly recommendable for you! You are garanteed to have about three to five hours of challenging puzzle solving fun!\n\nAdditional content next to the main storyline is available in the form of a challenge mode (certain chambers that must be solved under different concitions, e.g. your least amount of portals you can create to get to the end) aswell as advanced maps (chambers, that have been increased in difficulty through some means). That makes another two to four hours of fun (be sure to take breaks though, some of the chambers are just unforgiving!).\n\nWeakpointsThere is only one weakpoint in my opinion: I have encountered some people, that did not like the game for its open ending. I can completely agree, the game mostly does a poor job at answering specific questions about it. BUT (very big BUT) it is intended to keep it that way, If you are a person, that favors conclusion over confusion, I hereby warn you about this game. You are intended to be kept in the dark, you are the test subject, everything is kept from you and only shared on a need-to-know basis. Do not play, if you are looking for answers, but if you want to ask questions. It is all just a matter of taste in the end.\n\nConcluding ThoughtsThe game, that changed everything. It is absolutely understandable why this game won several prizes and awards for its genuine design and loveable plotline. The mystery and world of Portal is created to make you ask: What is all this testing for? Why am I being tested on? And why am I here in the first place?\n\nPortal is a game I can safely recommend to EVERYONE. Yes, the game is that simple and enjoyable. A true game that set a new standard. Whoever came up with the idea and its whole execution should be swimming in adoration and money right now. I am completely content with this game and I enjoy it to this day. Play it. You really should. You're missing out if you don't. So get to it! NOW!","March 27","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Playing as Chell, a silent test subject that is awakened by the AI facility overseer GLaDOS, the player is provided with the Portal Gun, a tool designed to place two portals that allow objects to pass through. During the game, the player has the role of a test subject that uses this revolutionary device to solve a great variety of brilliant puzzles that challenge their abilities of thinking and perceiving space.\n\n\n\nCritical commentary | Essential value: ★★★★★★★	—\n\n\n\nPros & Cons\nPros:				 It's an educational and really entertaining puzzle game, that gives to the player the opportunity to learn several basic concepts of physics (such as acceleration and momentum) and to handle them in a playful game with portals.\nThe characters are quite restrained. Apart from Chell, the protagonist of the game, who is bound to remain silent at all times during the game, there is only one other character visible in Portal: GLaDOS, the emotionless and distant artificially intelligent central core in charge of the Apperture Science facility. Nevertheless, there are moments that GLaDOS' unintentional, yet successful humour manages to break the ice and create a lovely environment.\nDuring the credits, GLaDOS is given the opportunity to sing her own soundtrack, "Still Alive", in a unique way, while the lyrics, being accompanied with images created by the combination of typographical symbols and characters, are being displayed on the screen. And she is just amazing...\nIt features 15 well-made Steam Achievements.\nThere are additional advanced maps and challenges that can keep the player's brain occupied for a great period of time after completing the campaign.\nCons:				 The story is original and interesting, yet limited. Had it not been for its sequel, Portal 2, which provides the player with additional information about Aperture Science's history and GLaDOS, there wouldn't be much to tell about Portal's plot.\n\n\nScoreboard | Overall score: 95 out of 100\nAnalysis			Total score			Concept			◉◉◉◉▢ —	Story\n◉◉◉◉▢ —	Characters			8 out of 10			Technical\nexecution			◉◉◉◉◉ —	Controls\n◉◉◉◉◉ —	Mechanics\n◉◉◉◉◉ —	Functionality & Optimization\n◉◉◉◉◉ —	Menu & Options			20 out of 20			Presentation			◉◉◉◉◉ —	Artwork & Cinematics\n◉◉◉◉◉ —	In-game graphics\n◉◉◉◉◉ —	Music & Soundtrack\n◉◉◉◉◉ —	In-game audio			20 out of 20			Context			◉◉◉◉◉ —	Community\n◉◉◉◉◉ —	Developers			10 out of 10			Misc.			◉◉◉◉▢ —	Duration\n◉◉◉◉▢ —	Replayability\n◉◉◉◉◉◉◉◉◉◉ —	Special features			18 out of 20			Critical\njudgement			◉◉◉ —	General experience & impression\n◉◉◉◉◉ —	Amusement\n◉◉◉◉▢ —	Emotional stimulation\n★★★★★★★ —	Essential value			19 out of 20\n\n\nUpdate history 	April 22, 2015	 Posted review.\nApril 23, 2015\nFixed a syntax error.\nJune 17, 2015\nRenewed the review layout.\nAdded details to the "Pros & Cons" tab.\nMay 5, 2016\nUpdated "Duration" score.","April 22, 2015","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It blends thoughtful puzzle design with a comedic and interesting narrative in a surprisingly effective way that shaped it into an instant classic back when it was released in 2007. To go more in depth on Portal, Let’s take a look at its graphics, gameplay, and story, followed by some final thoughts.\n\nGraphics Portal is a game enveloped by a stark and sterile tone, which fits it perfectly. This does come with the added note that it's not much of a looker due to an absence of elaborate visual effects, but that's not the point of Portal so this doesn't give it any strikes in my book. The graphics are in reality more of a tool to push the atmosphere, which is the overbearing feeling that you are a lab rat with no control over your predicament. When looking at the visuals in this light, you realize that Portal specifically chose this lack of graphical complexity in order to improve the more important aspects of its design, the gameplay and narrative. Because of this, it's my opinion that Portal is visually flawless.\n\nGameplay Just like virtually every other Valve game, the focus of Portal is its gameplay. This is shown by the majority of Portal's emphases being on the expertly crafted puzzling along with the occasional platforming section. The puzzles are done through the quite original use of a portal gun you receive early in the game, which can shoot portals of two colors onto certain (white) surfaces, allowing you and objects to pass through to wherever you have placed the opposite portal. You'll have to use these portals in a multitude of ways, whether it be to obtain a needed object, defeat obstacles, power a device in order to progress to the next level, etc. This fresh idea combined with the excellent physics results in some pretty great moments; an example being launching yourself through a portal at a fast pace, and then having to carry that momentum into a new portal you've made midflight in order to propel yourself at an objective. As for the platforming, it's pretty much just the standard timed jumping every now and then, onto a platform. All considered the gameplay isn't very varied, but the puzzling mechanic Portal relies on is both wonderfully ingenious and fun to play around with.\n\nStory In Portal you begin by waking up in a cold and barren room, knowing nothing about your character or why you are where you are. A portal opens soon after being spoken to by a computerized womanly voice, and you are then released into the Aperture Science Facility to do… well, science. You do this science by the way of solving increasingly complex puzzles while being observed by this AI's robotic voice, and who knows what else, if anything else. The whole way you are taunted by the artificial intelligence (whose name is GLaDOS) in a comedic fashion, but it often hits close to home because her insults are based on your actions, which she previously forced you to commit in order to proceed. This serves to build Portal’s personality, something very few games have, and it’s a real treat that this one does. As to not spoil too much, let's shift gears. There are many environmental clues and eventually a confirmation through GLaDOS' dialogue which informs you that Portal takes place in the same world as Half-Life, which opens up one of the biggest cans of worms in gaming history. How closely the two franchises are connected no one knows (because Gaben can't count to 3), but it's obviously of some importance to the overarching narrative if it was stated in game. Other than that the story culminates in a celebratory party where you get to eat some cake, which is a great way to end the game and move on to Portal 2. In conclusion, Portal's narrative is one of science, then comedic relief, which is followed by mystery, and ends in cake; a story I'd say any gamer could enjoy.\n\nFinal Thoughts When it comes to puzzle games, Portal is the first that comes to mind for pretty much any PC player you ask. I feel this speaks a lot to the greatness of the game, especially when you consider its very short runtime of 2-3 hours; it must have done something great to receive the type of overwhelmingly positive reaction it got, and that's for you to experience. For me I think I was let down by the hype, and maybe also because puzzlers aren't really my choice of game. All in all though, I appreciate Portal for what it is, and think every PC gamer should give it a chance. It's perfectly crafted, there's no denying that. What you get out of Portal will be entirely governed by your taste in games, which for me meant a solid puzzling and narrative experience through the mysterious Aperture Science Facility.\n\nPersonal Rating: 8.5/10\nP.S.

The only "weapon" you're given is a portal gun that can shoot a portal entrance with the right mouse button and a portal exit with the left mouse button. Once both portals have been placed, you can walk though them. The portals can be shot across a distance but only on certain surfaces, which creates the puzzle atmosphere. You'll have to figure out how to get across chasms, up and over obstacles, and around automated turrets. The trick is that you can only have one entrance and one exit meaning you'll encounter many brain teasers on how to use the portals correctly and in some cases, quickly and often. It'll make you think about which portal you're placing, the exact location of where it needs to go, and the timing of when portals need to be switched.\nYou're not the only thing that can move through these portals. The weighted companion blocks can be used to take out turrets by placing a portal over the turret's head and another under a block. Energy spheres are used frequently where players have to negotiate their path using portals to activate a switch. There are some really fun uses of the portals here, especially in all of those strange moments where you can see yourself through a portal across the room entering the portal you're stepping through.\nWhile the main game is short, Portal doesn't only finish with one of the best credits songs ever created. After the story is done new challenge levels are unlocked. These extras are six levels that you've already played. The difference is that they have new challenges associated with them. You'll have to see if you can complete the puzzles in a certain amount of time, a minimum number of footsteps, or using only a certain number of portals. These challenges are really interesting because they make you consider puzzles that were somewhat simple to figure out in a different way.\nThe idea behind Portal ends up being more brilliant than Portal itself.","December 4, 2013","true","14.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

An idea to use portal mechanic to create puzzles absolutely got me. I understand that it's a rather old game for today's standards, but I'd like to point some flaws of it.\n\nFirstly, it's rather short. Completing the main story took me around 2 hours. Not much comparing with other games. Don't expect a long journey from it, but on the other side, it's the time well spent.\n\nSecondly (that's gonna be a good one) - the puzzles were rather easy. I'm not telling it was a cakewalk (oops, that was an accident, I promise), but this game lacks real challenge aside from 6 advanced test chambers. That's only my opinion, though, I'd really appreciate to hear yours.\n\nBut there is also a thing I'd like to mention too - there are actually very few loading screens. Not like it has a crucial meaning, but it really makes you not die waiting.\n\nOverall, I do not regret playing this game. Of course, every game has it flaws, but hey - nothing's perfect.\nConsidering Portal's pros and cons, I can give it solid 7.5/10. See that game on sale? Buy it. Try it out.\n\n...\n\nGraphics? What the hell do you want from graphics? They're good, just enjoy the game itself.","December 29, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/400/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nPortal is a First-Person Puzzle game developed by Valve and released late 2007. Portal is completely dedicated to solving problems by using two portals to move objects or the protagonist through the various puzzles.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Portal takes place exclusively in the Apature Science Laboratories Enrichment Center. The Silent Protagonist Bby the name of “Chell”) awakens in a small room, she is instructed by the Artificial Intelligence known as “GlaDOS” to complete the various test chambers and then Chell will be rewarded with cake.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517834046\n\nGameplay: The gameplay introduced by Portal was probably one of the most innovative and unique concepts introduced by valve, and easily one of the best games released in 2007.\nAs you progress through the game, you are introduced slowly to new concepts and new tricks that you can implement. You start the game with the extremely primitive concept of “put the block on the button”, but after completing a sequence of Test Chambers and obtaining the “Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device” or just “portal gun”, the puzzles get really crazy.\n\nAchievements: There are 15 achievements in Portal, five achievements are normally unlocked on your first play through, another five achievements are very well explained and relatively easy to obtain (Generally by knowing the best location to get them, or preforming specific tricks, or completing some advanced maps).\nThe last set of achievements is the toughest, earning gold medals on all portal challenges, Detaching all security cameras from the walls, and Finding all the hidden Transmissions. (Unless you're going to put an ungodly amount of time into portal, you'll probably need to read guides.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517834071\n\nPrice: Portal is priced at $9.99, the value system I use is “Price divided by GameTime = Value”. Generally playing through the Portal story once will be about 6 hours, give or take a few hours depending on puzzle solving skill. This game has enough content to keep the player busy for 9 hours, but most people won't take advantage of all the features, so the price is a bit high. I suggest going for a bundle deal like the Orange Box (Especially if you're interested in the Half-Life 2 games), or waiting for a steam sale before purchasing.\n\nConclusion: Story: Excellent, some of the finest content Valve has ever released. Gameplay: Memorable, enjoyable, and addicting. Achievements: a nice blend of difficulty, but not an easy 100% completion game. Price: A bit higher then what I'd prefer, but on the enjoyable factor, Portal is definitely worth it.\nI have a personal bias for this game, because the first product I bought on Steam was the Orange Box, so this is among the first games I've ever played on Steam! I easily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, but this game can appeal to just about anyone, hardcore and softcore alike.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517834102\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 13, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Portal 2","September 13, 2015","true","19.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezalon/recommended/400/","rezalon","Rezalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezalon/","255 products in account","Product received for free\n\nGame: Portal\nDeveloper and publisher: Valve Software\nGenre: First-Person Puzzle with a hint of Mystery ARG\nReleased: 10 Oct, 2007\nSetting: Alternate history 2010, Aperture Science Enrichment Center, Upper Michigan, USA\nSpoiler-free plot summary: You play as Chell, a Brazilian-Japanese test subject in her 20's who wakes up to find herself in a mysterious science facility dedicated to researching portal technology. Not a single employee can be found, and instead, you are guided by an A.I. called "GLaDOS", who eventually grows more self-aware and corrupt as you complete tests through the facility.\n\nFull review: Portal is a relatively short first-person puzzle game. A newer player can probably beat the game in a few hours, while a veteran can beat the game in 40 minutes, so don't expect a gripping story or that many memorable moments. There is some justification to this, however, as this game is a spin-off of the Half-Life series, also made by Valve Software, and solely exists to elaborate on some side-story elements seen in Half-Life 2 and its episodes.\n\nHowever, as well as the relatively short main campaign, there are also two map packs that can be played for those wanting a longer experience: Advanced and Challenge. The advanced maps are a remix of 6 test chambers seen in the main campaign, made to be more difficult for experts. The challenge maps, however, are the vanilla versions of these remixed maps (the ones seen in the main campaign), but have 3 challenges attached to them: least portals, least steps taken, and least time taken. Both the advanced maps and challenges are very sobering to those who found the main campaign too easy.\n\nAs I said before, the story is quite minor, and is more-or-less a carbon copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey. But if one pays attention, one can find secrets throughout the facility relating to an ARG, which was used to advertise the sequel to Portal, Portal 2.\n\nA short review for a short game. Do I recommend buying this game? Yes. Especially if you're in the mood for a nice, small puzzle game, or are one of the many people who have played Portal 2 without playing the first Portal game and want a prequel of sorts. For NZ$11.99, I'd perhaps wait for a sale before buying this game. Say around $5 - $6.","June 2","true","20.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Although it is not required to play this to understand what happened in Portal 2, it is still interesting to see how GLaDOS developed such a grudge against Chell and adds to the little references that one may find in the second game.\nPortal has a different feel from that of Portal 2, with the Aperture labs feeling much more empty before its apocalyptic stage and GLaDOS much more robotic.  The humor, subtleties, and ending of this game is what makes it a rather memorable game though and builds up to what is in Portal 2.","June 21, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So I'll just give my impressions quickly. The game is pretty great! Having already played Portal 2 before playing the first, it's not as hard going backwards as I expected it to be despite the first game being a bit barebones compared to the second. The levels are fun, though generally very easy, and the ever so light dusting of a story is interesting and leaves you wanting more (with some nice hidden references along the way). My biggest complaint is everybody's complaint, it's just too short. It took me less than two hours to beat the game without using a guide, but there are some nice little "bonus maps" that offer some more gameplay. If you've played the second and never played the first, I'm not too sure it will be worth the time (don't get me wrong, it's a great game), but, if you've yet to play the second, then you should definitely start here.\n\ntl;dr-Really fun game, 8/10.

At first, I doubted the content of the game by looking at the plain and simple but fine graphics. As I proceed to go through chambers of puzzles and challenges, it really is fascinating simply because of the physics applied within the game. The plot is good and with 'GlaDos', it is undeniably exciting and refreshing to play such a unique FPS-based puzzle game. It is definitely worth playing.","March 24, 2013","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game you play as a girl named Chell, and you use a thing called a quantnam space hole genorator or something like that aka the "portal gun". In the game you have to deafeat the homosidal robot: GLaDoS (yes, you have to capidalize those letters). GLaDoS will place you in rooms with the portal gun and in those rooms will be filled with the folowing items: buttons, cubes, lasers, acids, doors and diffrent colered walls. White walls you can shoot portals onto and black walls you cannot. The rooms you will be put into are called test chambers. They are each filled with different puzzels and they get harder as you progress. Also just to note there are things that shoot you: Turrets, and anamate objects that are freindly: Companion cubes.\n\nThe game isn't perrfect so I give it an 8.5 out of 10","March 29, 2014","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

GLaDoS will place you in rooms with the portal gun and in those rooms will be filled with the folowing items: buttons, cubes, lasers, acids, doors and diffrent colered walls. White walls you can shoot portals onto and black walls you cannot. The rooms you will be put into are called test chambers. They are each filled with different puzzels and they get harder as you progress.

I played  it on my boyfriend's Steam account.  I liked it so much I made my own account to have my own copy. The story is deep enough that I find myself catching new things everytime I go through it.

At first, I doubted the content of the game by looking at the plain and simple but fine graphics. As I proceed to go through chambers of puzzles and challenges, it really is fascinating simply because of the physics applied within the game. The plot is good and with 'GlaDos', it is undeniably exciting and refreshing to play such a unique FPS-based puzzle game.

The combination of storyline and a brand new method of puzzle solving make this a very rememberable experience. The progression of gameplay concepts is very smooth, to avoid the player feeling overwhelmed. Included with the game is some developer commentary going further into how they developed the game. Also, there are advanced alterations of main puzzles as well as interesting challenges for some of them as well. The storyline is one of the great highlights of this game. At first, you think it's just moving from one puzzle to the next. However, your ENTIRE view of the gameset begins to change at a certain point, and reveals the truth about what is really going on.

A great game, a bit on the short side, but it might've sucked if it was longer and it's only $9.99 after all.\n\nMuch like Braid, it uses simple gameplay mechanics and makes you use them in ways you didn't think was possible at first in order to reach new places.\n\nAnd the game does have a sense of humor.

For a game on sale this cheap its ok, but if you pay full price maybe not so much so. I played Portal2 before this one, maybe its a giveaway on some of the mecanics in the puzzles, I dont know.\nBut overall its a great story... I am happy hat I now know how the story began, what I could only guess whie playing Portal2.\nI am looking forward to all the other stuff you can do, the achievements that are just waiting to be found/fulfilled.\nI guess there is at least another 5 hours worth of unique gaming in Portal.\n\nOh, I nearly forgot.

Portal itself is a great game, both portal 1 and 2. Portal did seem a bit short, having completed the story mode 2 and a half times in ~15 hours. The plot is amazing with a neat twist at the end. It's an older game and the graphics are eh, but if you dont care about graphics its a good 9/10 for me. The first few puzzles are remade in portal 2, its something you should look at, its actually kinda freaky lol.

Oh ok that may not be innovatave by today's standard. but back in 2006 (yes it has been that long) this was a new leap (through a portal) into uncharted territory. Born from a small division who had previously worked on Narbacular Drop, the game that created the very portals we know, this game's core mechanics are great. As is the setup, without giving too much away you awaken in a glass room and are greeted by a computerized voice. It's your job to navigate your way through the various chambers for your reward of cake. You will soon be handed the Portal Gun, a fantastic device that can link two points in space and time. You go in one portal and come out of the other and visa versa, you use this to complete tasks from the very simple to the very challenging depending on your skill. Momentum is adopted fantastically and will be all you think about for a majority of the game, following Valve physics (Source engine) the more speed you get the farther you'll fly. This game has some of the most well written dialogue and a perfect voice actor (Ellen Mclain) to fit it in a game that i've ever seen and heard. The soundtrack is close to nothing but what there is, it's atmospheric, catchy, perfect for the isolated feel of the game. as there are no partners or anything of the sort! You're all on your own in this. (asside from the computer voice) A funny fact is that this game was pretty much a stocking stuffer to stop people throwing bricks at Valve's windows demanding Half Life: Episode 3 (it's been TEN YEARS VALVE since ep.2) and yet it's one of the finest 3 and a half hours you'll spend doing anything other than breathing. Portal is GREAT and you should try it. Beat it to completion. you will leave satisfied. 10/10, FIVE STARS, A+, FOUR STARS!","July 2, 2014","true","58.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I must say it is the ultimate puzzle game.\n\nWhen I first bought Portal, I thought it was just in the same environment throughout the entire gameplay.  However, I was wrong.  There are a long list of places to go, and the story unfolds as you go, though it is not very deep.  The first few puzzles I did were extremely easy, and I thought the rest of the game would be similar.  I was way off.  After just about half an hour of gameplay, you're going to be pulling your hair out and punching yourself in the face.  This game took me 2 hours to beat, and I must say it was well worth the money I paid for it.  However, I paid about $3 for it.  Unless you want to experience the best puzzle game of all time, don't buy Portal for $20.  Wait until it's on sale.

I thought it was some kind of shooter and well..I'm not a big fan of that kind of genre.\nI was wrong. SO WRONG!\nPortal is far away from a shooter. It's a really clever puzzle game with a lot of (mostly black) humor and an unique gameplay (first person). Each level is great to play and challenges your brain. You have to solve challenges by shooting portals to maneuver objects or even yourself through each chamber.\nI'd recommend to play it with a gamepad, since some stuff is easier to do with. In particular if you are an achievement hunter.\nThe only negative point for me is; it's too short! There are 19 chambers, 6 advanced chambers and 6 bonus chambers. And if you got the hang out of the game, well, it can be over quickly. (But luckily there is Portal 2 and some nice Mods.)\n\nSo if you like puzzle games and got a glimmer of black humor, Portal is perfect for you.","March 29, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It works, but I’ve found myself a puzzle game that doesn’t require writing down information. Portal is this game. When I heard Portal was a comedy puzzle game I was incalculably confused, so the game had already carried out its function. But that’s beside the point. I simply didn’t understand the concept. Did the portals make witty comments as you jumped through them or were you just taunted every time you failed a puzzle? Well it turns out I was half right with the latter option. Somebody thought it would be a good idea to transform a woman into a machine and she decided to kill everyone and test the survivors. That would be you. However, she (or is she an it?) likes to make sarcastic remarks every ten seconds. Whether you laugh or not is unimportant because you will laugh.\nThe main idea is that you connect 2 spaces with portals which you can travel through or transport objects through. And you will do this while avoiding apathetic turrets. Nevertheless, you will be pushed on by the incentive of cake; whether it is or isn’t a lie. Puzzle games generally increase your brain power, but I’d say I learned one very important lesson from Portal. If you’re going to turn a woman into a robot who has power over a huge science facility, be sure to choose the right week.","August 20, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite it's short lived story mode it does invoke many laughable moments as GLaDOS' running commentary is very amusing at times as well as slightly feely.\n\nOnce story mode concluded I found great entertainment in bonus maps which actually made me think and plan, however none of these maps were so obnoxiously difficult that i found myself getting bored. The bonus maps really struck a balance between difficulty and enjoyability, I would say it took approximately 8 hours to finish all the advanced maps and challenges... my only quarm is I felt the advanced maps could have been slightly more complicated. It is worth noting however that there is a plethora of maps available online that are easily downloadable to Portal for those who wish to challenge themselves further.\n\nOverall I would certainly recommend Portal to anyone (especially if it is on sale) and would agree with its high Metascore... I'm looking forward to playing Portal 2 :)\n\n- kILLLA","August 24, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has been one of my favorite games to play. Its puzzles are unlike any other game (except Portal 2). People say that you only get 2-3 hours on this game, but if you are like me and you are bad at puzzles, you can get more than 5. If you don't remember things well, you can go back and play this game over again.\n\nPortal is not a very hard puzzle game, which is good for people like me, but if you want a harder game, get Portal 2","August 23, 2014","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I told them to wait for you, but they cut it\nanyway.
