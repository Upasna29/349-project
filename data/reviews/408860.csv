It's missing too much and feels like a rushed handheld port. For instance on the infinite levels one is still held to the artificially low building cap, so rather than see how far you can take a level you have to sit there with many open unbuilt spaces as the level runs to it's artificially quick end. I also really did not like the nontower puzzle levels at all, they felt forced and more like work than a game. I wish some more thought and effort had been put into Dead Stop. It feels like a demo for a larger game.\nThat said, it is a fun game and plays very well. The towers are pretty standard but in a good familiar way. Had the pricetag been three bucks I would be happierier recomending it.\nThe look of the game is great, the art director did a fantastic job.","April 22","true","28.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
