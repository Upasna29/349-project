There is plenty of strategy concerning which units to use for certain fights (anti-flying vs flying, angels vs demons) and a very fun campaign featuring specialized enemies which you can't unlock yourself. Also, there is plenty of content available at this stage as you can see by my 5+ hours. Army of Pixels is definitely recommended. I'll be happy to answer any questions.\n\nFOR DEVS: I have noticed on multiple occasions that if a ranged unit releases a projectile, but dies before that missile reaches the target, the missile will do no damage. I am not sure of your intentions, but I find this unreasonable. If there is a lane with 2 opposing cultists or 2 elven arches, it should perfectly cancel out instead of having the first unit to shoot win.","October 31, 2015","true","6.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

(however, these ideas are a bit nit picky since it IS an indie game)\n\nThe highlight in this indie game however, was deffinetly the amount of individuality it gave the player. I felt like the army i was leading was genuinely my own, and that sense of self kept me hooked for hours. I was also making my own decisions on where i would fight on the map, and was given hints on who i would be fighting (thankfully not by just saying it, but adding description), which also enhanced my experience while playing, giving it a "realness" I find that other indie games simply don't provide.\n\nThat said, for an indie game, it was deffinetly worth playing through! My hope (Selfishly because i crave more) is that more content is added to this game, or similar content is created in the future!","October 31, 2015","true","20.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Wait until it's 75% off.  I bought the game an played through everything in one day.  It had a small learning curb and you find the winning strategy early.  That said, I  did lose a few times as the difficulty ramped up which totally made me like the game more.  I played through the other modes with the "winning strat" and found just a little extra enjoyment from it.\n\nThis game has the right idea I just wish it had a little more depth.  Buy it (75% off) and play it.  It will be worth it.","November 5, 2015","true","37.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The map has four lanes on which you and your enemy can place units to attack the opposite tower, the units on the two sides will combat against each other when they come into fighting range, and those survived in the combat march on to the opposite tower. When a tower is taken down, each remaining opposite unit on this lane score one point, and the whole stage ends when anyone score 10 points. You will earn gold and mana in each interval between round and use the gold to deploy new units.\n\nThe concept of the game is interesting, however the game feels semi-finished, since the game seriously lacks depth in terms of strategy and is short of variations in almost every aspect (animation, music, story(practically nothing), battlefield). You will likely find yourself doing the same thing over and over after the first one or two stages. The other game modes do not bring much differences, so the game has little replay value.\n\nThe campagin mode of the game should take about 2 hours to complete. The remaining amount of time I spent on it was wasted on grinding the gems needed for unlocking the additional races and trying to beat the stage filled with slimes (which is difficult because of the cheating AI and the poor balance among races).\n\nIn summary, I do not recommended this game to anyone, unless it is heavily discount and you've run out of game to play.","November 5, 2015","false","6.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

However it would need I'd say 5-10 more factions, stronger counters, units with much more distinctive abilities, and removing those crazily OP spells that the player gets and the AI doesnt (which, incidentally, could have been fun unit abilities: healing, aoe attacks, snares, resurrecting corpses as zombies...). As it is, you can more or less place any unit in the build queues, spam spells and you'll win. Locking factions (with ingame currency) is just a trick for having you spend a bit more time in the game.","January 3","false","5.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"
