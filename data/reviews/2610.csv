This extremely violent wild west adventure is one rootin', tootin', shootin' good time. The short six hour campaign story is great and some of the side missions are pretty fun too. Good voice acting, cool slow motion quick draw mode, and a nice assortment of weaponry round out the pros. The highest resolution I could play at was 1280x1024 so most of the visuals look pretty dated. But overall, a really fun game. It's a blast of dynamite--literally.","November 27, 2013","true","7.8"," 127 of 137 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","127","137","2","0"

Don't get me wrong, the 'Call of Juarez' series are the best in Western you can get on Steam. After some searching I found 'Gun'. All those positive reviews couldn't be wrong even if the game was 'dated'. The reviews are right. Great Western game with some realy nice mechanics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/2610/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Gun is the great western game from the PS2-era, namely, 2005 year. Oh, sure, it is dated! But last time I checked, Rockstar still keeping its Red Dead Redemption to consoles, so there is still none a better open-world cowboy game on the PC.\n\nOne thing Gun did good, the shootouts, were bested by the Juarez game series. But if you want an open world where you not only shooting deadbeats, but also shepherd cows, hunting buffalos, and, yeah, running mail quests, while riding your mustang… you still got only the Gun option.\n\nAnd it is a good option. Not only it is playable from the box, unlike many other 10 years old games, which Steam is releasing… The Gun is a very worthy still – in all aspects but visuals.\n\n“Open world” in this game, of course, can’t be compared to the newer games, like Fallout New Vegas. It is a vast territory somewhere diluted inhabited oases. You riding between them, reasonably expecting an ambush on every turn, behind every bush. By the way, horses are your best friends: you really don’t want to walk all the wilderness back to town. So don’t shoot them, and don’t allow others do so. Speaking of shooting, gunplay there is rather primitive, as you can expect from a console game, but at the same time, it allows you to enjoy a decent arsenal of the time, and unleash all the knots of the plot and game logic. So it is okay.\n\nAbout game plot. Although of course it is made full of cliches, in the endline, it is a good scenario. Not sure I want to read a book about, but, as a part of game, being sounded by good actors, it feels natural.\n\nAs I said earlier, besides main quests and that dabbling revenge pursuing, you have many other opportunities to feel at home with Wild West around you. Visit cathouse, drink whiskey, play some poker, do some ranching, mining and hunting… both on animals and on wanted criminals. And of course, you can be a Sheriff in one place, and rob some trains in another.\n\nSo, if you want a western game on the PC, try the Gun. At least now, despite the fact it is 10 years old title. Play it now, while it is still available and working, and there are no new game from the Rockstar or Techland, or some other studio with taste in the good old days of 19th century.\n\nWhile many fine games took some beef from the westerns, from Fallout New Vegas and even Mass Effect to japanese Wild Guns series… If we are talking about vanilla Wild West, not some Weird West, like in the Dark Watch or Damnation, we have so few decent games, that missing the Gun is almost a crime.\n\nMark 8.1/10","August 25, 2015","true","62.1"," 102 of 112 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","102","112","4","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/2610/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr7QqZ3Tra8\n\nFor me this is one of my favorite games of all time and the best game set in the wild west. I know there are other, like Call of Juarez, but Gun, which is older, have far more interesting characters, world, story and I can safely say it's higher quality product, as far as the first Juarez. While the consoles have Red Dead Redemption, which by the looks of it is superior, PC have Gun, which is rough around the edges. I read somewhere, before RDR, Gun was the best western game. It may be rough, but this doesn't mean it's not fun. Unfortunately, it's far from perfect. It does have some problems, that might put off some people. It all depends of your tolerance for something far from perfect. Let me continue with bad stuff, so I can end on a positive note.\n\nThis is a console port and it's obvious. It's not the worst, but this could be unacceptable for some. The game runs at 30 fps, which is not such big deal, I can close my eyes, but in some situation dips below that. It's an open world game, but it feels like it's divide by sectors and when you reach the border of some sector, the game need to load the surroundings and fps drops below 30. It's for e second, but it's annoying.\n\nThere are some weird bugs. Few examples: NPC is giving me task and you can see his neck,arms and legs are not attached to the torso. In one side quest you can see in the distance, the enemies are riding … the air, or the legs of a horse are not moving. These bugs are more funny, than game breaking. The graphics didn't aged very well. For the time they were decent.\n\nMaybe the biggest problem is the presence of slight auto aim. Why is this in a PC game? It would be nice if I could turn it off. The answer is simple – console port. The developer of the game is Neversoft, which were famous with the Tony Hawk franchise, but for the port is responsible Beenox (known for the Spider-man games) and they didn't do good job. Here is the contradiction. Maybe the auto aim it's not a bad thing, since aiming with the mouse is not perfect, it's not that precise. I always compare 3rd person action games with Max Payne in this regard, because the aiming there is perfect for me and Gun is almost there.\n\nThere are other 2 small problems. The first is the AI – sometimes it's just stupid and second one is the enemy models. You will see the same characters over and over.\nAfter all I said, maybe you are asking yourself is there any good things in the game? Yes, there is. Absolutely love the game. Almost 10 years later, you can see the higher quality of the game, starting with the voice acting. The main characters are voiced by famous hollywood actors, like Thomas Jane, Kriss Kristoffersen, Lance Henriksen, Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman, Tom Skerritt. Even the other voice actors are doing a great job.\n\nAs a hole the sound design is great. The weapons sound like they came out from old western movie, which contribute to the atmosphere of the game. The music is phenomenal. When a track hits, you feel like you are in great adventure. And it is great.\n\nThe studio hire hollywood screen writer and the outcome is pretty good story. You take the role of Colton White, who with his father, makes a living with hunting and selling the meat to a steamboat. The steamboat is attacked, because the bad guys are looking for something, that your father is hiding even from you. He dies, the boat is destroyed and from here starts your adventure. The story is great, but short, so don't rush with her.\n\nSo is there anything else to do? You have a lot of side quests, most of them consists of killing everything that moves. But there are others, like get a cattle back to the their pens, making deliveries, protect people from wolves. And of course there are wanted posters. With them you often have a choice between dead or alive, which respectively brings you less or more money. When you are given a choice to get someone alive, the thing you have to do is to shoot the horse, cut him once or twice with the knife and apprehend him. You don't need to kill his buddies. And what is the wild west without a game of poker. In the two towns there are tables to play. The AI is not that good, but here is not that important.\n\nWhile walking around you can find gold, which you can dig. So the first thing you have to do when you see shopkeeper is to buy pickaxe. Other things you can buy from him are standard upgrades for your weapons, horse, but not for the bow. For him you have to visit an indian outside the towns. There are two shopkeepers in the game and they sell different upgrades.\n\nFrom everything I said until now, I almost didn't touch the gameplay. It's good. If you put aside the auto aim, everything else is great. You have pretty standard arsenal of weapons – pistols, rifles, shotguns, sharpshooter, whiskey bomb, dynamite and bow. My favorite is the shotgun. At close range is irreplaceable. After almost each story mission you will be given new weapon, each with different stats. In saddlebag you can choose which one to equip. The ammo for everything is not endless and you can't buy it. You have to find boxes with them in specific places spread around the world. Only for the pistols are endless and for the rifle are most easy to find.\n\nThere is one more thing and it is Quickdraw. This is basically bullet time. With a press of a button, you slow down time and arrows appear to show you where the bad guys are. Then you pres left or right and start shooting without reloading. The feeling of killing 6-7 guys this way is awesome. When you slow down time, you can shoot arrows and dynamite, while there are in the air. Of course, you can move the crosshair with the mouse. In some cases it's very useful for more accurate shots. You can also go in first person view, for better shots with the rifle and bow. As far as the bosses, all I can say they are a lot of fun, especially the final one.\n\nHere is one interesting fact. Activision merged Neversoft with developer Infinity Ward in May 2014. In August 2014 it was discovered that inside the latest DLC for Infinity Ward's game Call of Duty: Ghost there was an easter egg of a fake poster advertising Gun 2.\nThe game run absolutely fine on Windows 7, 64 bit. There is widescreen fix, but it stretching the HUD. When you type in 1 in HUD_PATCH inside gun_res.ini, it will fix the stretching, but the mini map will be almost in the middle of the screen.\n\nGun is forgotten and underrated game. It's worth buying right now, if you don't mind the port. But it's definitely have to be played by everyone, who loves open world games and western movies. Gun is like human – it has some shortcomings, but if you look close enough, you will see beautiful soul underneath. From here you have to decide if you want to overlook the flaws, for everything else or not.","December 4, 2014","true","8.5"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","62","67","5","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/2610/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Disclaimer - I do not own GUN, I have played the game via Steam family share and the hours recorded on Steam are not accurate either due to playing offline.\nGUN is an action adventure western themed game which was released ten years ago in 2005. This was my first experience with the game too, I had never played it on release.\n\nThis is probably one of the first open world games to come out. The world consists of the story missions, side missions, gambling side activities and bounties to take care of.  As you travel on horse back from town to town, you encounter bandit attacks and ambushes which you can choose to either fight in, or escape with your tail between your legs.\n\nYou play in a third person view of your character, Colton White. The game also has an auto-aim feature which I suppose was needed for the consoles back in the day, but on the PC it just felt clunky when aiming with a mouse. While you aren't out in the desert on story missions, another activity you can take part in is the hunting; you can hunt wild animals and then sell the fur and meat to be able to upgrade your equipment.\n\nThere are plenty of classic western style weapons to be used in GUN too, from the revolver, to explosives and bow'n arrows.  This is also another game with a bullet-time feature in which can be activated once you fill up your Quickdraw meter and then switches into a first-person view. GUN also encourages melee action as well; with another wide range of different weapons to use here.\n\nThe graphics do look dated; but for its time, this would of been top of the range. So if you are the sort that is discouraged by older looking games; GUN is certainly going to put you off in the graphics category. There are a couple of options which you can change to increase the graphical fidelity, but really any machine now days will be able to run this on max settings.\n\nGUN does have an element of difficulty to as well; I had to reply a number of missions from dying and messing up the objective. A full playthrough took me about eighteen hours to finish; this was with doing all of the side missions and activities as well. You are getting a really fleshed out game here.\n\nSince the game is old, I did have a couple of technical issues. The main one being the game will not support higher resolutions and will sometimes cause a black screen upon launching - I just had to minimize and reopen for it to sort out though. I did also have a few random crashes while playing too; so in order to minimize the risk of this, save often so you don't end up having to re-do levels you just completed and you'll be fine.\n\nI can recommend GUN; but only if you are playing it purely for the gameplay and story elements. Most will be put off by the aging looking graphics. however if you play it for what it is, a really well put together Western open world game. You will surely have a good time.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Seeing as how, on PC, if you ride too fast through the relatively small world all hints of scenery, except for static objects, are prone to disappear, leaving you riding in the sky (but not for too long) – $10 would be more than fair, if you had an inkling of replaying this game. The more I've played it, though, the less often I've found such glitches.\n\nRemember, circa 2005, much less was expected from games. There is a respectable amount of diversions; I'm 6 hours deep and about 60% through - just sayin', don't expect an older ReDead Redemption. This is not that. If anything, it's ReDead Revolver with PERHAPS less refined combat but much more freedom and Native Americans instead of Mexicans, Animals instead of Carnies.\n\nAye, when I recently replayed both Red Dead's, I kept finding myself thinking "When is [major incident from the story] going to happen?!" Every time I was anticipating such an event, it was always one that took place in GUN. So it seems, at least to me, GUN beat out ReDead in being epic... indeed, sometimes, while riding aimlessly around, the music can become TOO epic.\n\nAs evident from the publishers, I really do stand by my saying that GUN is Tony Hawk with guns, regarding the sense of the controls/feel of it. Mind, I am playing with a controller - IT DOES HAVE CONTROLLER SUPPORT, YOU JUST HAVE TO MAP THE BUTTONS YOURSELF - when I first started the game, if you take a few steps and then stop abruptly, Cole continues sliding ever so slightly. LOL it's as if a remnant of the engine that defined the skateboarding. The longer you play, the less you'll notice it. Also: Never ride your horse with gun drawn unless you are in combat; having your weapon holstered, your horse can maneuver just as well as anything with wheels. I exaggerate only slightly when I say you can drift around corners on horseback.\n\nThe gunplay is acceptable but nothing fantastic and you can't take too many bullets, even on Normal. For every few bullets, you'll have to take a shot - of Whiskey, oh yeah. Often, especially when horses are involved, it can be aggravating to try and line up your shots. Sometimes, it comes down to: drive your horse in circles, drive your horse in parallel lines, get off your horse. There is hardly ever that appropriate speed at which horse-to-horse combat can be fluidly achieved. The speed of things was something to be reckoned with in all games back then; remember how ANY time you had an escort mission or had to follow a story-dictating character while they walked and talked – if you moved at full speed, you’d leave them behind; if you walked, they’d leave you behind. So it comes down to Start.Stop.Start.Stop.Arggggh.\n…anyway, I don't know if I'm just lucky in doing this/lacking in skill for having to do this, but a tried and true method for me, that I've employed in several games when I can’t figure with the camera(/)speed: swing the camera haphazardly to aim, shoot, pray... watch it be a headshot... er, watch your enemy's head explode. Yes, there's chunky gore to be seen in GUN.\n\nPistols, Shotguns, Rifles, Bows, Dynamite, Whiskey Bombs, Knives, Hatchets... 30(?) weapons in all. There are Stats that get upgraded when you complete missions, to help you in the progression of the story; it's a tale of revenge steeped in a revolutionary atmosphere - your actions throughout the Story make you more and more enemies, you'll be ambushed constantly by parties of 2 or 3 Bandits; sometimes the towns will be (")off-limits(") as the residents will seek your life.\n\nA typical half hour in-game could be something like:\nShoot bandits off their horses (again, because of the iffy/sluggish camera controls (ON CONTROLLER), I usually will get off my horse and run around whenever enemies ride in on the beasts, it's much easier – just don’t get trampled) and then scope the scene for gold veins to mine, go back to your incapacitated enemies and scalp them, go to town and play Texas Hold 'Em, pick up a Pony Express mission that takes you to the Ranch in-between the two towns (Empire, New Mexico and Dodge City, Kansas), go check the store in the other town (while avoiding/destroying the Bandits/Indians/Haters-in-general), pick up a Deputy mission, dispatch with criminals, then go to the wilderness and find the Native American shopkeep and Hunter, all the while using your Quickdraw (GUN's Dead Eye) to kill birds and other wildlife.\n\nYou cannot aim down sights with your pistols; not really sure why but that’s that. You can aim in the first-person with two-handed weapons, poppin’ dudes with your rifle, rippin’ ‘em in half with your shotty, or huntin’ the murderous Great Animals with your bow (really cool, really annoying). It has been stated elsewhere that, at least for controller, ADS is a toggle – if you continue holding the aim button and try to shoot, it’s a no-go.\n\nThe Cast Includes:\nWhistler from Blade as your father, Ned.\nHellboy as the criminal Mayor Brown.\nThe Punisher as Cole, the hero.\n\nKeeping in mind that this is an old game, ergo perhaps lacking in content by today’s expectations:\n$5 = WIN. $10 = DEAL. $20 = LOL.\n\nAddendum: Playing on Normal, I've quickly found any sort of challenge to be nonexistent. I still stand by my recommendation, seeing as how, no doubt, only fans of Western Shooters or those of the game when it was originally released would seek this game out.\nFor those who have not played it, it's (EITHER "is" or "was," sorry I can't commit to one or the other) a good game. I just have to stress once again that, despite being a technically open world, there's nothing but hand-holding; there's little in the way of difficulty; there's fun to be found, should you acquiesce to its age.","October 11, 2014","true","6.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

You're a cowboy seeking revenge on whoever killed your father, who was involved with a madman looking for a fabled city of gold. I'll rate the game on a few criteria.\nStory/immersion: 9/10\n-The story  is great. Each character brings something new to the table. Each of them have their own unique personalities and are important to the plot in one way or another. The voice acting is also pretty good. Sure, it may be out of sync at times, but that never got in the way of me enjoying it. Also, it feels like I'm playing in a westerner, and although some of the scenes portray a few negative Native American stereotypes that seem to be a bit outdated, it feels genuine. I loved it, but honestly, the story should've been a bit longer. I beat it in 6 hours which, although average for the time, seems short for the kind of game it is.\nControls: 6/10\n-This is one of the few places in which the game suffers. Moving is standard, as well as aiming, jumping, and crouching. What really could've had some work was the weapon system. You have plenty of weapons, don't get me wrong, but it's such a hassle to switch between them that I wound up using the rifle for most of the game. This could've easily been fixed if you could just cycle through with the mouse button. Instead, you have to use either the numbers or hold alt+the corresponding weapon key. Really bad in the heat of battle.\nGraphics: 8/10\n-By today's standards, an 8 seems a bit generous, but considering the fact that this game is from 2005, they really stand out. Even today, they don't look horendous. One thing I must say is that character models, such as NPCs and enemys don't render at full motion unless you are closer to them. If they are further away, they look like something out of Doom 3D. Anyway, the camera controls nicely, which is great considering the time this game came out.\nExtra: 7/10\n-Throughout the game, there are plenty of side missions you can do to improve stats, gain money, and take a break from the main story. They're fun, and adds to the feel of the wild west. My only complaint is that it feels like grinding. If you don't do side missions, then the main story gets very difficult towards the end. This makes it not feel like something extra, but rather, something you have to do and part of the main game.\nOverall: 8/10\n-Highly reccomend. Don't buy it at full price. It's a short game worth a smaller price.","May 6, 2014","true","6.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The main campaign is disappointingly short; as in short enough that I'm glad I bought the game during the summer sale rather than paying the full $20.  The storyline line is cliche and lacks the intrigue necessary to keep anyone interested, but the voice acting is pretty good.  The gameplay is fun and makes you feel like an old West gunslinger, but whoever made this game has probably never even seen a real levergun, as the reloads are initially tiresome and slow.  One good selling point is that the game ran flawlessly on Windows 8.1 right after download; I didn't have to get any patches or mods or run it in compatability mode, which was a nice surprise.

The action in this game is fantastic and there is a fairly large but empty feeling open world to accompany it. The side missions of course don't do anything to the story itself but are there for added fun and to lengthen the game itself, I didn't find myself actually doing them til the game was over but it shouldn't stop you from completing some of them because the game does get relatively harder as you progress and you need dem upgrades. All in all whenever I played this it was for nostalgic reasons because I did play this back on the gamecube when I was a kid but if you have never played this game before then go grab it, it's a hell of a game!\n\nClay: "How did you know what that apache indian was saying?"\nColt: "Plot Convinience..."","February 1","true","5.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

The game itself is one of the best for the limited choice of cowboy games on PC and in my opinon across all platforms. Although some of the negative reviews have said that the game hasn't aged well i'd have to say that i do agree with some points but as a whole disagree.\n\nI've finished the campaign in just over 5 hours but in all honesty the map size for what we would call open world in comparison to a game like Red Dead Redemption is of its time and frankly that is understandable when trying to create a campaign that wasn't overly boring within a relatively small open world. The one bad thing i would say about the short length of the campaign is that you can feel like the story lacks depth in some senses but i feel that as a whole it stands strong as it tries to not make boring repetitive core missions in a limited space.\n\nAs far as side missions there are plenty and of a wide variety be it your classic bounty hunter posters (which in mission do include an option to subdue your bounty which i found surprising for a game in 2005 for which i expected to be find bad guy shoot bad guy policy upon first playing it so long ago) you have the option to help out on a ranch herding cattle, delivering mail or even hunting wild animals (the hunting missions dont include way points on your map which really ups the open world exploration of the game). You can even just go out and hunt buffalo if you feel like it a true variety on display throughout.\n\nThe game has a basic weapons collection system which allows for a bit of variety when it comes to combat both in ranged and melee. Although you can't go to the store to buy your weapons as they can only be unlocked through campaign progress, their is a general store which sells upgrades for those weapons to improve things like damage and accuracy as well as other miscellaneous items including the nice little feature of a pick axe to go and mine gold allowing you to become the true claim jumping 49'er you've always wanted to be.\n\nThe graphics are again understandably low quality and are of course of their time. Cut scenes can be a good laugh watching the characters mouth move in random contortions which apparently are producing words as their gun jaggedly no-clips through a horses head. I feel that it gives the game a bit of atmosphere i mean it wouldn't be expected now, but hey as i keep saying its a classic from 2005 and the game holds up so much more than just graphical quality.\n\nThe game does have both mouse+keyboard and controller support though the controller will have to be manually mapped out for those who wish to truly experience the old-old-gen console experience.\n\nBut hey real nostalgic trip a true classic and a worthy title to a returning fan or a new one. i'd have to give it a solid 9.5/10","January 27","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I vaguely remember hearing good things about it when it came out ten years ago. It definitely looks like an earlyish GameCube era game, and has a few awkward hiccups here and there, but overall it runs well, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.\n\nMy complaints so far are...\n\n-Key bindings could be more customizable. It won't recognize any buttons other than the L/R click on my mouse. I've accidentally button mashed myself to death on a few missions. The key to throw barrels of TNT is the same as the button to throw your selected grenade/explosive type weapon. One minute you're setting up an ambush in the intersection, the next thing you know, you took yourself out, and failed the mission for the tenth time.\n\n-Does occasionally crash. It's a well done port, but it's still a port, and isn't quite as stable as it could be.\n\n-THERE IS NO AUTOSAVE. If you fail a mission, it'll restart you where you picked it up, but if you quit the game, or it crashes on you, you'll pick back up exactly where you last manually saved. You have been warned.\n\n-Missions can be a little clunky. You have to blow up a boulder, but your tnt was dropped a few pixels too far away, and despawned, so you fail, and have to restart. You have to chase down a bandit that changes sprites in the gang every time you play it, and you'll fail even if you still have a direct visual on them, but they've moved just a few steps too far. You'll fail if you're doing an escort/follow mission, and stray too far ahead.\n\n-Crosshairs are more just boxes, and precision shots are tricky until you have a few hours in, and get a feel for how the hitboxes work. The Sharpshooter rifles are precise though, and since unlocking them, headshots are a breeze, even from horseback.\n\nOtherwise, it's a great game. The gameplay's enjoyable, the story's good, the map design is great, especially for as old as it is. I've lived in Colorado since '97, and the scenery really does capture some of the nostalgia I've gotten from travelling across the plains, and visiting old ghost towns and stuff.","April 19","true","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roastbroast/recommended/2610/","roastbroast","Mantaloupe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roastbroast/","124 products in account","For the time being, consider this the closest thing you can get to RDR on PC. It's a fun game, but unlike Redemption I feel like a lot is missing. The map is small and the campaign seems kinda short. The world doesn't feel as alive and vibrant as it could be, and graphical bugs seem frequent (Weird walk cycles, people moving without a walking animation from a distance, etc.).\n\nBut my complaints of GUN end there because the game is an excellent western title. You play as Colton White, a young man who has to carry out missions to find a crook reverend named Reed after he ambushes a steamboat you were on, taking your father and a ♥♥♥♥♥ he knew to the river deep. You play between Dodge City and Empire City in Kansas (Both well known as the pinnacle western cities in popular culture, along with Wichita and other towns) fighting off gang members, raiders, Apache Indians and so on.\n\nIf you've played Red Dead Redemption before this game then you should feel right at home. It has a pretty straightforward third-person mechanic where you can get weapons like a Schofield revolver, a lever-action rifle, Winchester Shotgun, tomahawk, whiskey bombs (Essentially a Molotov cocktail) and much more. Gunplay is very simple and intuitive, normal for a TPS, and you can use your revolver to slow down time with a Dead Eye-esque mode called Quickdraw. Plus, you can ride a horse. Why would you pass that up?\n\nWhile not as developed and gritty as RDR's excellent western epic of a story, the story is still well-thought-out, although from what I've heard it's relatively short. You can also do side missions such as being a ranch hand, helping the local sheriff or marshals, and, a wild west staple, hunt bounties, among other things. The score fits so well with the game and story, that I could see it very well in a spaghetti western if the graphics weren't so...you know...2005.\n\nOverall, it's a great game and I'd recommend it if you're a fan of the wild west, Red Dead Redemption (Much like myself), or just games like these in general. It's a smaller-scale RDR and despite its dated and sometimes buggy graphics and small map, I suggest you give it a look.","May 24, 2014","true","8.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragontroopbeta/recommended/2610/","dragontroopbeta","DragonTroopBeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragontroopbeta/","217 products in account","I have played this game extensively on Gamecube and Xbox 360. While the visuals may put you off at first, it will soon grasp you on the amazing story and stellar voice acting. The characters are very memorable, especially the  protagonist, Colton White, and his father, Ned, who he helps hunt fresh game in Montana for steamboats travelling the Missouri River. When travelling on the water after a successful hunt, the steamboat is ambushed, and Ned reveals to Colton with his dying moments that he is not his real father. Colton's journey across the West in the late 19th century is a tale of greed, brutality, and lust. It has one of the most gripping stories of any western game I have ever played. Sadly, as with being a western game, it is cursed to not sell very well. With the only exception to this rule beng Red Dead Redemption, not as many people have picked up this gem from 2005 - back when Activision was a semi-respectable publisher. It hasnt aged well, but the combat is still very fluent, if not a little repetitive. There are quite a few authentic sounding weapons from the time period, and you have an array of 6-shooters, hunting rifles, sniper rifles and shotguns to choose from, as well as melee weapons such as the bowie knife, cavalry sword, and tomahawk. Thrown weapons are added as well, including a whiskey fire bomb and dynamite sticks.\n\nThe most unique mechanic this game has to offer is it's Quickdraw system. Yes,, it has been done in westerns before - time slows down, and you sling your pistol out and blast away at any man looking in your direction at the card table.\n\nSpeaking of card tables, there a re quite a few mini games to be played here - poker tournaments, horse races, bandit raids, bounty hunting - you know, cowboy stuff.\n\nOverall, the game has a good story and atmosphere. You actually feel like you are Colton White, a man on a mission of vengeance and heroics - at the same time. Find Quivara, the City of Gold, and kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s behind the steamboat massacre all the while protecting the people from the dastardly Magruder, a failed politician and the trecherous murderer of Colton's true parents, which is an interesting character development as it is a complete surprise who his parents really were.\n\nTallied up, this game scores a 7/10, as long as you do not mind outdated textures and a rather small overworld map.","September 8, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gun is the game that Neversoft quietly made while most people were eagerly awaiting their next Tony Hawk game. Gun is the open world western of 2005, 5 years before Red Dead Redemption would hit stores as a critically and commercially successful western. People praised Rockstar for doing an open world western, but forgot about Gun.\n\nGun is a gem, and everyone should play it. The story is strong. The voice acting from the leads, Thomas Jane, Ron Perlman, Kris Kristofferson, Dave Wittenberg, Lance Henriksen and Brad Dourif, nuanced and unequivocal. The soundtrack is perfect. The animation is outstanding. The gameplay is pretty good, but not perfect. There are so many reasons for owning this game and literally just one fallacy; the graphics.\n\nThe only issue in Gun is the poor time release; late 2005, before the first next gen console would roll into stores, therefore, only taking advantage of what power the PS2 had left in it; and that's what PC gamers are getting, the PS2 port. It's not bad, hell, you can use a controller and configure it to your liking, all buttons mappable in the menu.\n\nConcering the plot, you are Colton White, voiced brilliantly by Thomas Jane. You start the game with your father, Ned White, hunting along the Missouri River. You fight some bears and this acts as the tutorial, learning how to shoot and whatnot. I REALLY don't wanna spoil anything, because the plot is so damn good. But from there, you end up on a steamboat to sell the meat with your father and a whole heap of ♥♥♥♥♥ happens. You meet one of the games antagonists and end up travelling to Dodge City. From there, you uncover mysteries of your father and your own personal past. The overall plot can be done in maybe 7 hours, but if you ♥♥♥♥ around doing side missions, bounty hunting, ranching, parcel delivery, being a marshal and deputy, you can squeeze in 12 hours or so.\n\nYou meet these brilliant characters that come to life with, for 2005, really damn good animation; although the character's mesh will collide, the body motion is amazing and not robotic, like how some games are from over a decade ago. Whoever directed the cutscenes did their homework in film school, as the camera work is fantastic, tracking shots, over the shoulder dialog, full body view, some dutch angles. It's all intricate and brilliantly directed, I just can't believe this game was made by Neversoft, holy ♥♥♥♥.\n\n9.7/10\n\nP.S. If you're not already using ureschanger2 for older games that don't support widescreen, get ureschanger2 and follow the readme. It's very easy to use, just copy/paste the d3d9.dll and resolution.ini, changing the resolution to your liking. Once you get this bad boy in widescreen, the game looks a bit more glorious.","June 23, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played it for a little bit and could not force myself to play anymore.\n\nReally, it is sad, however, because I played it when it first came out and unless my memory is out of wack, I enjoyed it a lot more than I am enjoying just now. It seems like everything has fallen apart - and maybe some of my tastes have shifted over the years; I mean, it has been over a decade.\n\nNow people bring this up a lot in relation to Western games - but Red Dead Redemption really is a greater one. The only reason I even bring this up is because I actually replayed it within the past year as well, and it aged much better than this game (but it certainly isn't perfect). However, that only had to uphold 5+ years whereas this one is 10+.\n\nThe looks of this game are really bad, even for when it was released, and the characters are pretty bad from the get-go. The controls were just all over the place - everything was really jittery, and all of the characters and objects were really jittery, moving in sloppy robotic ways.\n\nIt just made my memories of it fall apart.","May 7","false","1.2"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peekle/recommended/2610/","peekle","Peekles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peekle/","342 products in account",""You talkin' to me, punk?" 8/10\n\nI didn't play this game until 2014, almost an entire decade since it was initially released, but it's still one of my favorite gaming experiences in a long time, which was kind of surprising as when I first began my journey into 'GUN' I thought I'd play for maybe three or four hours tops. I mean, nothing about this game looks special at all. The graphics are dated, the voice acting isn't great, and it looks rather generic by today's standards in almost every way possible.\n\nIt's safe to say that when I first picked this game up on sale, that I didn't expect more than 'Grand Theft Auto' on horseback. In fact, the biggest appeal of this game to me was the chance to do some good ole fashioned horseback riding; something I hadn't done since 'Ocarina of Time'. I never thought that I'd be so swept up into the dirty world of the wild wild west and the stories it had to tell me, but I was. From saving harlots, to chasing gangs down on horseback, to killing entire tribes of Indians in one fell swoop, this game includes every cliche you could possibly think about the wild west and I ain't complaining.\n\nAside from the tight controls, camera angels, and helpless harlots though, this game is just down right fun. And even though it's hard not to compare it to 'Grand Theft Auto' I never found myself thinking I was playing some cheap clone just in a different setting. And did I mention there were harlots?","December 16, 2014","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/2610/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","GUN can be basically thought of as Call of Juarez, albeit more shooting and less running around dodging stuff. As Colton, you grew up under a harsh father learning to hunt and live off the land and horses and the rest. Until one day, your father told you he's not your real father, then to save you he threw you off the boat you've been defending as the boiler exploded. Your only clue is a token to the Alhambra Hotel, and Jenny, and a preacher Josiah Reed, who is working for someone... And it may involve Indian gold gathered up by Spaniards...\n\nThe game involves shooting... LOTS of shooting. Pistol, rifle, shotgun, even a few whiskey bombs (i.e. molotov cocktails before Comrade Molotov changed it to gasoline) and later, precision rifle plus a bow. As you go through the plot missions, you'll unlock new weapons. And as you go through the game world, you can travel anywhere (between towns if you like) and indeed, some of the "gold deposits" you can mine requires buying a pick in town.\n\nA story mission would be escort the wagon through Apache territory (resulting in a couple checkpoints, including on horseback, static defense, go forward to find dynamite to clear a passage, then railshooter.  Another mission would be clearing the bridge of Apache presence, as they rush the bridge, check for explosives (you have to grab them and chuck them into the river) then escort the Chinese coolies to finish the job as Apaches attack, then finally defeat the Apache warrior leader with quickdraw and shoot fire arrows out of the air then kill the minions and finally leader himself.\n\nBetweens story missions you are encouraged to do the "side missions", which would give you bonus in various areas, such as pistol, rifle, shotgun, horse (speed), quickdraw, and so on if you complete them. The side missions are quite varied, including wanted posters (best if you wound the perp, then grab and knock out), but usually it's dead or alive (alive worth slightly more). Each town has a sheriff who will ask you to do things, basically run around town dealing with various troubles, usually involving shooting, but sometimes melee. There's also pony express where you need to make deliveries on a timer. There may be additional missions in town. Finally, there's usually a shopkeep where you can buy various upgrades, from fastloader for pistols to better knife to pistol upgrade (bore enlargement kit).\n\nThere is a lot of terrain between towns, and lot of places to explore, and as mentioned before, there are gold in those hills (and you'll need a pickaxe from a shopkeep to get them). Finding them is part of the fun.\n\nAs this game did come out more than 10 years ago, graphics are low-fi but good enough. Music is quite good, very orchetrally western. Voice acting is above average, though somewhat cliched. Gun sounds are adequate.\n\nThe main problem is you basically spend your entire game depopulating the West, of one unsavory character after another. The game doesn't reallly have you do anything else (other then grabbing TNT barrels and chucking them, either into the river or put them at places where you do need to blow them up). The only time you really need to think was the wanted, where you TRY to sneak up on the guy but it probably doesn't work.\n\nWhile the controls can be mapped to gamepad, the game is best play with mouse and keyboard, where the added precision makes gun fights easier for you to pull off headshots or weapon shots (i.e. shoot weapon out of enemy hands). And in this game, you CAN blow enemy's head off. Rare, but it does happen, esp. with shotgun.\n\nStill, the game holds up even after 10 years, and IMHO, at some places, better than even Call of Juarez (the original) which has a very similar premise of sorts (in CoJ, people are also after the gold hidden and the protagonist is chased after by a nasty preacher with gun). If you can get it at bargain bin prices, it's worth a couple hours for sure. Just beware of certain nasty segments, like the quickdraw segments that require a lot of retries. And remember to save. A LOT.\n","September 21, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Cole is a likeable protagonist, bordering on an anti-hero. The game also allows you to continue playing after you beat the main questline, in case there were any side missions that you missed before taking down Magruder. While I wouldn't play this game again right away after beating it, it does have some replay value, and the soundtrack is reminiscent of both Firefly and Tombstone.\n\nThe Bad: The side missions can get repetitive after a while, and the A.I. isn't great on your allies. They're more likely to walk into a bullet than avoid it, and there are plenty of missions that you'll fail if they die. The game also has an odd habit (particularly during the Magruder fight) of not giving you instructions on a mission until your health is nearly depleted and you can't do much other than die and start over. The Pony Express missions are also kind of pointless--at most, your horse gets more health and you get $5 for essentially running a horse race back and forth across the map. Pretty dumb.\n\nThe Ugly: Some of the writing in this game is downright laughable, and most of the side characters are cardboard cutouts. Apart from Cole, there really is no character development. Magruder and his posse are evil because the game needed antagonists--no other reason. Likewise, you as Cole don't particularly gain anything by completing the main quest apart from having the satisfaction of killing all of the bad guys and feeling like the Man With No Name out of an Eastwood western.\n\nAll in all, the game is pretty good and definitely worth playing at least once, but the creators could have done a lot more with this to make it even better than it is.","September 15, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now when was 4-5 years old I remember seeing commercials for Gun and always begged my dad to get it for me. Of course he never let and always gave me the speel of "Oh its violent" like any other kid my age at the time. Now 11 years later I now own the game and let me tell ya after those long awaited years my expectations have been none the more met.\n\nThe Positives:\nFor an old game running on a modern opperating system Gun runs flawlessly and despite how dated the game may appear it does pay a lot of attention to detail mainly in character models and atmoshpere. The controls are a little weird at first in my opinion and they could have been better but again this game is 11 years old so I will cut it some slack in that regard. You are also given plenty of variety in side activities that reward you with cash and stat points which give the game some light RPG elements and its almost recommended to do these side jobs when you can in order to progress at a smoother pace with enemies that pose a real threat.\n\nThe Neutral:\nDespite the given variety in missions is does get a little repetative but not to much to where it will jade any sort of enjoyment for the player.\n\nThe Negatives:\nNow if your all into graphics this game will dissapoint you since it is dated and it dosent support modern resolutions like 1920 by 1080 and the graphic options are also quite bleek with detail.\n\nOverall its a fun game with some smart writing and characters but overall just being enjoyable","March 29","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an old game though so I can't complain a whole lot. Could of used a more indepth story though. Something to drag you in... Heck in the first town I can't tell you how many empty buildings there where or the fact you could see the end of the world. They could have taken a little more time using some creativity but as I said it is an old game. As I also said there are the good parts there too... So don't let the game pass you by. It is something to add to your western collection. However the one wesetern game on here I can't get enough of is the Call of Jaurez. That is the only western on pc worth the time. However if Rockstar ever came out with Red Dead on PC hands down that is the best western game alive. Just wish Rockstar would do it.... Doubtful though... Anyways the game gets a thumbs up but in truth it is a so so kinda game. Buy at your leisure. Course I haven't had the chance to get any further so it might draw me in by the end but for now just know "Buy at your Liesure"!!!!","September 10, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stock controls are a little wonky (but I'm sure there is ways around it to use a controller instead or even change the keyboard controls to better suit your needs.) Also, the campaign itself is only about six hours long (maybe even less) in it's entirety. But to make up for it, upon finishing the campaign my save file says the game is only 55% completed, so the side missions must be more plentiful than I thought. (However, the side-missions do not supply to the story and do not upgrade your character enough to make them worth your time.) There is no auto-save, which I learned the hard way. The graphics are not to today's standards (which is to be expected of course) and yet still, the game has times when the frame rate drops dramatically for a second or two. However, that does not take away from the overall expierence of a Western game worth your time, especially at the price of $4.99, which is what I paid. Buy it if you like Western era games at all, especially at the low price that is stated above. It's a classic!","February 8","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game me and my father would play when I was just a child. It's an open world western game with a great story, great gameplay, great gunplay, and great immersion. It has character progression; every time you do a side mission or hunt a bounty, or choose to kill or subdue a wanted criminal, etc. you get money (which goes towards buying upgrades from shopkeeps like increased ammo, more horse stamina, or more damage.) and increased stats. Certain types of side missions increase certain stats. Story missions don't progress your character any, but that's what makes the game fun. If you cannot beat a certain part, you can do side missions to increase your stats so you can do so. You get more guns throughout the campaign, meaning the combat doesn't get stale because you always have new "tools" to try out. I recommend playing this game on the hardest difficulty, or second to hardest, because only then do you really get the full experience of needing to increase your stats to progress. If you play it on the lowest difficulty you can breeze through the whole game with eaze. The immersion is so good and so thick (if you can get past the graphics, which to me, weren't a bad thing, especially for the Playstation 2 era.) and they really go above and beyond to make you feel like you are in the wild west. It's brutal, realistic, your character changes clothes over time, and you can play poker. (!!!) This game is a win-win and honestly worth every penny. Also, something to note: headshots are HEAVEN in this game, when you shoot someone in the head  with a sniper rifle, their head just pops. (and at one point, you man a cannon and you can headshot people with that as well, which is pure joy.) I cannot recommend this game more. I constantly had a blast. -EDIT: The story mode on normal difficulty took me 8 hours to complete. I didn't rush through it or try to 100% or anything. A casual playthrough on normal took me 8 hours.","January 31","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
