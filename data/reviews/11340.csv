It was very obviously made by an indie studio and it shows in the minor grammatical errors (which do lend it some charm). There are lots of different types of weapons, each having their strengths & weaknesses. You can only carry a limited amount of ammo which means you'll be using all of the weapons instead of just the most powerful one. Has minor RPG elements. Graphics are good and quite charming. The dungeons are randomized, but the game probably doesn't have much replay ability. I heartily recommend this game!","November 30, 2013","true","40.4"," 63 of 68 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","63","68","0","0"

You go from room to room killing everything with up to eight different weapons. You can level up your stats, play through tons of levels, or you could just play something else.\n\nThe biggest problem with LM is that the difficulty is unbalanced. When you select your difficult setting, you're actually deciding on how much you want to be annoyed. This game features a lot of small enemies, some that leave trails of fire everywhere, spit multiple projectiles, and even randomly become invincible. The harder difficulties mean you have to put up with more of their crap, blow through all of your ammo, and possibly get killed in the process. The easiest setting seems like the best choice, since all difficulty really affects is how much the player does and takes damage. However, this setting also makes the game too easy...which I guess is to be expected...hm. Regardless, the alternative is pointless frustration.\n\nInsta-death also starts to become a common theme later in the game. Devils and Champion Knights have attacks that'll kill you regardless of health or difficulty. Circle-strafing is a good method of avoiding this deadly attack, but these jerks tend to attack in groups, and other enemies lending a hand. Still, death really isn't very punishing, unless of course you managed to collect a rare item. There are a number of unique treasures that strengthen the player or offer a big XP bonus. These are lost if you die before completing the stage. Strangely, all of the achievements are tied to these rarities, you don't even get a cheevo for beating the game.\n\nLarva Mortus is just a very dull game. Within 15 minutes you've seen most everything the game has to offer, and yet it just keeps going for hours, without purpose or entertainment value. There are a few moments of satisfaction, like blowing up a half-dozen monsters with a cannon, or shooting a werewolf in the face with a shotgun, but you can get more entertainment from playing a classic FPS like Doom. This game consists of running through rooms, occasionally finding something interesting, sometimes dying, and just never really caring.  Your free-time is more valuable than that.","October 28, 2014","false","4.5"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","35","42","5","0"

The game is mission-based and you select from either story or randomly generated missions on a world map. Missions take place in a small, NES Zelda-style dungeon with an objective. Random missions give you a chance to level up, find artifacts and better weapons before progressing with the story.\n\nUpon leveling, you can put points into stats like max health, regen, run speed and resistances, adding some lite rpg elements. You'll amass an arsenal of weapons you can switch between at any time, from the basic revolver and shotgun to flamethrowers and cannons.\n\nNatively, the game runs at 1024x768, but looks fine and the Steam overlay works. The story is dull and short; most of your hours will come from grinding, due to the difficulty. Repetitive and shallow, I can't really recommend it with so many other games to play.","July 26, 2012","false","4.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Demonic rituals and classic horror creatures like werewolves, vampires and zombies fill up every corner of this game and are complimented by perfectly eerie, evil-sounding music and ambient whispers and noises that invade the players head. All of these aspects make up the spooky atmosphere Larva Mortus boasts, and the story, conveyed in an awesome graphic novel-type style, lives up to the games overall horrific demeanor and is actually very interesting. As you progress through the game, you'll discover new weapons at a pretty fast pace and you will have the opportunity to personalize your character a bit with upgrade points gained by leveling up. There are also A LOT of side missions to tackle other than the main story line which can really help you catch up if you're stuck on one of the main quests. One of the best things about the gameplay though is the fact that the levels are randomly generated. What that means is that if you do happen to die near the end of a level, you do have to play through it again, but the level will be re-designed with different rooms and monster spawns. This keeps the game from getting tedious on some of the more difficult parts. I did encounter a bug that would cause monsters to occasionally not spawn where they should. It doesn't affect the gameplay too much though, it just means that you have to run out of the room and back in to reset the spawns. I also really would have liked to see some multiplayer in Larva Mortus. Hopefully the developers will eventually get around to adding it. I think that would be a blast! Needless to say, the gameplay itself is smooth and enjoyable but there's nothing amazing about it alone. It's the combination of the gameplay and the demonic-horror style that really makes the game shine as a whole. In conclusion, I absolutely recommend Larva Mortus, especially if you're a horror fanatic like me.","February 1, 2015","true","4.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astraeakisaragi/recommended/11340/","astraeakisaragi","Astraea Kisaragi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astraeakisaragi/","378 products in account","General\nLarva Mortus is a typical example of a isometric budget shooter with semi-cartoonish graphics. The interesting in it is the extremly low price due the constant 90%-off price label, which puts it into the bellow 50 cents category. And for that it offers quite a few good things.\n\nGameplay\nWe are controlling a monster hunter looking guy from a birds perspective, which gives us a quite good overview trough combat. Our hero is easy to work with, which is definitely welcomed as combat always happens in cramped rooms. The mechanics is exactly this - you basically go from room to room and clean them out from monsters. Levels are generated randomly so you never know into what you go, but as long the level design regardless of the environment serves the same purprose, it doesn't really requires you some change in tactics or would surprise you in any way. The enemies vary from basic undead, flying bats to spiders and poison spitting fat zombies. Except the boss level templars, they don't really represent any serious force and usually are trying to make up for the lack of their power with rather high numbers. Very importantly - try not leave the room until is not cleared out entirely, cause the room will reset even if only one enemy remains and you need fight the horde once again. Exceptions might be missions where you need to rescue a certain number of civilians, blasting trough the rooms and just focusing on the rescue can save some time and nerves.\nSometimes you need to find a key in order to continue, but it means cleaning a few more rooms into a other direction, until you eventually find what you searched for. Except the enemies the room also contain "furniture" like coffins and crates, which I recommend to destroy, cause you might get stuck in them in middle of combat and enemies can corner you, plus there is a chance that they might drop ammo or powerups. (see bellow) Unfortunately the game gets eventually a bit dull after some hours spent in it and you usually keep going only to raise your level and find some new item. It simply lacks the depth, but I think it's forgiveable by such a budget title.\n\nStory\nWhile it might sound weird, it actually features a working story. It's your typical "find missing ancient artefacts and beat some evil monsters trying to take over the world" B (or C?) class movie type of story, already the fact that there is actually one and with animations/voicing included, is quite surprising (and very welcomed) which might raise it slightly above other games of this category. What I noticed the doing random levels while being in middle of the story can cause some bugs. Is highly recommended complete it first.\n\nLeveling, weapons, artefacts, powerups\nLeveling - And yet another surprise for your cents, the game has actually a RPG system. Each level you get a point which you might use for raising you stats. Personally I found some more useful as others. I highly recommend to put many points as possible into Endurance and Regeneration, (6+ recommended) First raises your HP and the other speeds up healing which might be crucial on more difficult levels. I also recommend to raise your walking speed and luck to get more drops from destroyed enemies of crates. Other abilities doesn't have such influence and are okay with 2-3 points.\nWeapons -  plenty of them and they are rather balanced. Is always the best to switch whatever has the most ammo in it. Of course certain weapons are better into certain situations, like the machinegun is best against weak huge groups, while the shotgun is better against individual strong enemies. Don't worry, as you play, would fill eventually figure out all of them.\nArtefacts - pretty much the alpha and omega of this game. While many of them adds only points to your score, other give you huge advantages, which will change your game dramatically. I highly recommend to get the backpack, extended clips and enchanted scroll so fast as is possible. Backpack raises the carried ammo by a huge ammount, extended clips raise the magazine to 120 by one of the most used weapons and the scroll doubles the time duration of all powerups.Artefacts can be found randomly in dungeon, but the game doesn't excludes the already found ones. so it depends on pure luck. But assuming in certain levels you can find 3 at once, you will eventually get 100%. On sidenote, you most successfully complete the level to keep the artefact. If you die, they get lost. Can be quite the bummer.\nPowerups - unlike artefacts, they are only temporary. However they can change the tide of the battle dramatically, especially if you have a good luck (more powerups) and the scroll, which doubles the duration. Unlimited ammo with the machinegun and double damage can literally make you to a walking terminator.\n\nGraphics\nOne of the biggest cons of the game is the low resolution. Is quite noticable that is a ported mobile game. While the graphics aren't bad and objects stay sharp even on my full HD screen, the devs could have added a option of standard desktop resolutions even if it would be achieved with simple stretching.\n\nMusic and sounds\nModern/organ combo which gives away a creepy cemetery feeling. Few and repetitive, but suits the game rather well. I cannot say anything else as I really liked it. If there would be more tracks, I would ask the devs for a OST. Really.\n\nAchievements\nBasically all of the achievements are connected to finding the artefacts. As I mentioned, there is a high chance that you find the pieces same over and over, but you will eventually find all of them, even if means a bit of grinding. One of the easiest games on Steam to get on 100%.\n\nConclusion\nDo I recommend this game? Definitely yes, if you find that 90%-off price tag on it. While this game will not cause a panic in the game stores, it offers quite a fun for a few cents.\nMy rating: 6/10","April 20, 2015","true","14.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

It's basically a twin stick shooter (without controller support) where the player scuffles through randomized (but persistently unstimulating) dungeons, fending off flocks of uninspired enemies to tediously grind through a few repetitive mission objectives, all tied together by the most perfunctory of stories.\nThe game's design and visuals transpire blandness. Enemy variety consists of the trite assortment of bats, spiders, skeletons,  zombies, werewolves and respective supersized variants. Moreover the monsters are afflicted by extremely constrained behaviour types, limited to either rushing the player, casually flying around or throwing the odd missile. This cognitive impairment makes the enemies prone to getting stuck behind objects and frequently kamikaze into the environmental traps, and the only challenge comes from the occasional overwhelming numbers of enemies.\nDue merits for the low hardware requirements, which allow to run it in a modest 5 year old computer, but when the game looks over 10 years old that's hardly a redeeming feature.\n\nThis is an inexpensive game that nevertheless feels too cheaply made for its price, and I can't find any reason to recommend playing it even if it finds its way into your steam account after a bundle sale.","December 28, 2014","false","5.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/recommended/11340/","Luna_Nyx","♥ Gia ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/","397 products in account","Larva Mortus, a top-down retro shooter, kinda like all of those flash games out there like Dead Frontier. You're playing as some kind of monster hunter, and you travel across the world to certain hotspots where monsters, ghosts, demons, werewolves, or whatever kind of evil have been causing trouble freely to end their mayhem spree.\n\nThis game is a weird one. I know for a fact that people frequently disagree when it comes to this game, some say it's bad, some say it's pretty decent. My opinion? Well, I would personally recommend it.\n\nIt's buggy, sure, it gets kinda repetitive, sure, but the gun combat is quite satisfying, at least to me.\n\nYou start the game on the map screen, and across the world, you'll find missions that you can do, a few story ones, and lots and lots of optional missions, from killing ever single enemy to destroying altars that summon them, to killing special "champion" enemies, to rescuing ♥♥♥♥ing lost souls that wander in front of your projectiles all the time, the worst so far to me.\n\nIt's gameplay is rather simple, you aim and shot with the mouse, controlling a crosshair on the screen, and you move and perform actions with the keyboard. At first, you move rather slowly, but you can upgrade your movement speed each time you level up, among other things like your resistance to debuffs (Some, like the ghost's projectile that turns you into a sitting duck, not being able to move and attack), which is quite useful, your regeneration speed, your melee damage, your luck and how fast you get experience points. You get experience points by killing enemies, collecting stars, or performing certain other actions. Randomly, a "jumpscare" (More like a JPG. file with a weak sound, I don't know if they were even trying to go for jumpscares) will pop out, a face, a low volume noise, and that's about it. It doesn't spawn more enemies, damage you, or change anything in any way.\n\nWhen it comes to quests, the main storyline quests are quite easy, even on hard difficulty. The optional quests, on the other hand, can be quite merciless at times. The only benefits that you get from these quests are the experience points, and the chance to find one of the upgrade items that randomly spawn inside a level. Sometimes they spawn on the main missions, and they aren't necessary for the game completion. Hell, they don't even count if you want to get the game's 100% completion. They do, however, upgrade your weapons, for example, the backpack allows you to carry more ammo, the dum dum bullets increase the damage of your revolver by 25%, and the holy water allows you to do an extra 10 points of damage to demons. Some of the collectible items do not upgrade anything at all, they just give you experience points. If you die during the mission, said randomly spawned item is lost forever!....Until you get lucky enough to find it again.\n\nIt's soundtrack is decent, it's got plenty of subtle sounds that add a nice touch to the creepy atmosphere of the game. It's nothing too loud or obnoxious, but nothing that noticeable, neither.\n\nThe game can get monotonous if you start doing every single side mission, because it's mostly about shooting enemies all the time with the same weapons. You'll randomly find them in some missions, stuff that goes from a sword and revolver that you start with, to a shotgun, a cannon, a manual machine gun, a flamethrower and a tesla gun, among other weapons. You keep these ones even if you die during the mission.\n\nNow, when it comes to difficulty, sometimes it's way too easy, sometimes it's relentless, because sometimes you'll have to fight against enemies that can basically fill the screen with projectiles, and some of them are quite damaging. Also, there's that ghost enemy that's able to paralyze you with it's projectile, and there are two enemies in game that possess a one hit kill ability. The big red demons with their short ranged, easy to avoid flame spray, and the big crusaders with their almost no warning, long range, but easy to avoid ray that comes out of their swords. If you play this game on hard difficulty, you'll probably get your ♥♥♥ kicked a lot. There are on achievements for finishing this game on any difficulty, so you might as well play on easy. The achievements of this game are unlocked when you collect said random relics in missions.\n\nNow, for the BUGS.\n\n- Collission detection is kinda off at times. Some items possess a hitbox that's got a different shape or a different size than the item they are around. Most of the items can be destroyed, so this is mostly  a problem if you're trying to hit and run. But it's quite a problem when you're trying to get across moving traps.\n\n- Sometimes, the enemies, and even lost souls, vanish completely from the room. Even if you killed every visible enemy, you'll hear one of them lurking  around, and the room won't count as fully cleared until you get out and come back in again. It's not that frequent, but when it happens, it's mildly annoying.\n\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game if you are a fan of over the top, kinda monotonous shooters.

Well, its better than many of the games that were coming out for the Atari 400 back in the early '80's.  In the '90's it would have been shareware or freeware.  But due to inflation over the last twenty years what used to be free now costs money.  Well, maybe that's not exactly why, but it's the best lie I could come up with on short notice.\n\nThe game isn't all that bad if you come home from work or school brain dead and need something really nit-witted to unwind with, or if you happen to be an anacephalic gammer, in which case you probably aren't reading this review.  For those of you who are off to uni and have to work your way through, this is the game equivilent of ramen noodles for supper every night.  You put up with it for a few years so thatyou can get a better job and the better standard of living that goes with it.  Or so the schools' admissions propaganda would have you believe.  The fact is that you can get an Ox-Cam education and still end up eating dry cat food, living under a bridge, and playing the solo version of tic-tac-toe in the dust.  That's when ramen and Larva Mortus start looking really good.\n\nThe game does have its place,even in the library of a power gamer.

Five men stumble across an evil artifact and split it between them, now for some reason evil wants the five pieces back. It’s up to you to reunite the five pieces before the evil demons do.\n\nGameplay is of the top-down variety, movement is done with WASD and aiming is done with the mouse. Your weapon selection is pretty generic and grows as you find new weapons. Monsters are also pretty generic, running the gambit of skeletons, spiders, bats and zombies. The graphics are decent and the story is told via static images, done in a comic book style. The game is terribly average and doesn't try anything new, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, however that isn't the part that makes the game boring to play. It’s how the developer setup advancing the story that bores me to tears.\n\nThe game starts off by showing a mission that will start the story, but you cannot start the mission without leveling up first. You level up by selecting other non-story missions that will appear randomly after every level you beat. Each non-story mission can have a different flavor: save X amount of people (which you don’t even have to save technically, you just get a higher score if you do save all of them), clear all rooms of monsters, defeat X boss monsters, or remove X ritual circles from the area.\n\nHere is the crux of the problem. The game requires you to be X level before continuing the story, you level up by repeatedly playing randomly generated dungeons with a very limited amount of goals for each dungeon, with a very limited variety of enemies, on levels that use a very limited number of tile sets. After the first few playthroughs of the levels just to start the storyline line I saw every level and enemy type. I played through the story mission only to find out the next story mission was yet again locked, and I had to be a certain level to play it. Which meant more grinding through randomly generated dungeons with little variety to advance the story again.\n\nSee the rest of the review here: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/larva-mortis","October 7, 2014","false","1.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The creepy music, the horrific groans and screeches given off by some monsters, the glowing red eyes in the darkness every now and then, there is also disturbing faces that show up on the screen every now and then.

Larva Mortus is a top down shooter with flaws which offers you couple hours of entertainmentish.\n\nYou play as a monster hunter doing various monster hunting tasks. Across your journeys through abandoned warehouses to cemeteries you deal with undead monstrosities, werewolves and such. All are classic horror monsters, even main character is very classical monster hunter manly man. Weapons of slay include revolvers, two handed sword, machine gun etc. etc. Nothing new, you've seen 'em and know em. Oh, you'll gain levels too.\n\nControls work the way they should, you'll run around using wasd and with the power of mouse you'll aim and deal lead to monstrosities.\n\nFirst hour of this game is pretty much fun. Also first hour of this game is pretty much all this game has to offer. You run around rooms, killing monsters with guns. Then you run around killing some more. It's really repetitive, but sometimes that is just what we need.\n\nLarva Mortus has serious balancing issues. Instant death dealing monsters, unbalanced weaponry, easily predicted enemies. Difficulty level is a rollercoaster ride in this game. Too easy from pain in the behind hard, no gradual progress in there. Character development is simple as it should be. Problematically you can level up your character to be almost useless.  (Free tip, first 5 points goes to walking speed)  Still the game has few good horrorish moments and pretty good ambience. Music is nice for the first hour and then it you'll start wishing this game had few more songs. I had no techical issues with game and it ran smoothly.\n\nMain campaing is playable only by leveling up via random quests. These put you around the globe for uh, monster killing, saving people or, you know, killing monsters. Also you can get quest for eradicating monster sings, which is basically the same thing as monster killing.\n\nI recommend this game for horror and top down shooter fans who can deal with B-quality stuff.","November 2, 2014","true","10.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

What makes this game unique is its dedication to its bizarre and weird story. There's lots of little touches - fog effects, spooky hallucinations, creepy music and sound effects, and a storyline that would feel right at home in a Weird Tales action story.\n\nIt's cheap, fun, and spooky.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/11340/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nIt's pretty obvious at first glance that Larva Mortus isn't going to be a life-changing experience, and for most of us playing it won't even be a day-changing experience as what seems to be an addictive and fun game at first, will turn into a boring and repetitive experience in a matter of minutes. The story takes place in the 19th Century, following a young recruit of an agency responsible with concealing and exterminating all evil creatures and their sources of power, so it won't be long before you start travelling around the globe to find all the evil lords that hold the main pieces of an artefact that allows evil to exist and expand throughout the lands, but as cool as that sounds, the way in which the game tells that story makes it boring and pointless as there is nothing else to fill in the blanks between missions and expand on the universe, instead the story turns into running from point A to point B only to then find out that you've been mislead and the thing you're looking for is at point C, kinda like a Mario game if he was looking for evil artefacts. There are also no cutscenes or voice-overs to add to the presentation of the story, so you'll be stuck with some lines of text that for most times are pointless since you can pretty much figure it out by yourself that after killing an entire castle of vampires, werewolves and bats, and still not finding the missing piece, the thing you're looking for is definitely not there.\nRating: 3.5\n\nGameplay\nLarva Mortus had something good going on for a while and that was due to its focus on gameplay, which looks and plays great for a few minutes, as you use different weapons ranging from swords to machine guns and explosives to eliminate all sorts of enemies while you take on different objectives such as freeing lost souls, eliminating sources of power, clearing the entire area of evil presence or defeating a boss; and to make it even more appealing the game promises randomized map so no matter how many times you replay a stage, it will be different each time. The problem with all that is that once you get past the first 10 minutes, you start to realize that no matter which enemies you'll face and where you will still do the same thing over and over again; the best strategy to defeat almost any type of enemy is to run around in circles shooting forward or waving your sword around if you're out of bullets, because as long as you do that properly you'll be just fine and no matter the objective you're following, you will still have to do this over and over again just so you can eventually reach an area where you have to shoot or walk through an additional thing. As for the bosses, all of them are just versions of normal creatures with more HP, and the random maps don't really change the game at all since they just move the rooms around, so instead of taking a left, you'll take a right the next time, but end up in a similar area with similar enemies.\n[/u]Rating: 4.5[/u]\n\nGraphics\nYou can't expect quite a lot from an indie game with a limited budget, but the biggest visual problem with Larva Mortus isn't even the engine it was built on, which is obviously old, but instead the repetitive design which makes the already boring game even more monotone, always using the same colours and textures, putting you in similar looking rooms with the same objects sitting around the same monsters coming at you every single time you play.\nRating: 3.5\n\nAudio\nThe audio quality overall is just horrid, with missing tonality, sound effects that have no place there and even worse sounds that should've been there and they are not, and just that one song that keeps repeating again and again, and again with different effects added on the background when you enter a boss room or get overwhelmed by enemies, but even with that added, you still have to listen to the same tune that was bad to begin with.\nRating: 2\n\nExtras\nFinishing the main campaign takes less than two hours, and even though you can play the game for as long as you want to since it will constantly provide you with missions with various objectives, taking in consideration that no matter how many of those you'll complete, nothing will change probably no one will bother to play for longer than 8 hours, which is the time it takes to obtain all items that award you with achievements if you're into those.\nRating: 5\n\nVerdict\nLarva Mortus is an indie title that had something going on in there for a while, starting with cool ideas that failed to entertain for more than a few minutes due to its poor execution that ultimately provide more boredom and dullness than entertainment, making this title become nothing more than another leftover in your collection. It does come with its fun, and for a few cents that fun is probably worth it, but then again, don't expect it to last.\nRating Overall: 3.7\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Larva Mortus at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=282[/h1]","September 29, 2014","true","13.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2Madda/recommended/11340/","x2Madda","x2Madda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2Madda/","264 products in account","This game is dumb.\nAnd it revels in its own stupidity. If anything they didn't go far enough really.\n\nYou are a monster hunter of the Van Helsing variety called to investigate some strange going-ons. You eventually meet a man who claims to be cursed against his own will and only by collecting the various artifacts of doom can you save the world. Halfway through this you are hit with a plot twist from one of your would be targets that actually collecting the pieces is a bad idea and your employer is out to get you! ...he then gives you the piece anyway because hell if I know.\nOur character points out that since he started collecting the pieces he has suffered nightmares and ill health and nothing more so then I began to wonder if this is subtle meta storytelling like Hotline Miami where the game is telling you that all the violence can end if you stop playng the game.\n\nSo I did.\n\nHopefully he has been able to sleep better now.\n\nBut a bad story doesn't make a game dumb! Well I mean it does but it can be overlooked if the gameplay is good and here the gameplay is...Not bad but not good either. This game was made back before twin stick shooters had revived popularity so it is WASD to move and mouse to aim. The game would have lended itself brilliantly to being a twin stick shooter but we can look past that...Except we can't!\n\nWhy? The room layouts and the secrets and traps within are extremely reminiscent of the Binding of Issac. I played Larva Mortus first but looking at the two games side by side the similarities are noticable. Larva however is not a rogue-like and even though the gameplay is similar in a lot of areas they are very different products so don't buy Larva Mortus and expect it to play like Binding of Issac because Larva is not that punishingly hard infact it isn't hard at all but it is also not as rewarding as a result, unlike a good run in Binding of Issac.\n\nThis game hasn't really aged well, the graphics are good but a little wonky in places, the music is okay but a little off in places, the sound effects are sufficent but a little mismatched in places, I don't know what it is but everything in Larva Mortus is one step to the left of mediocre but it works out because otherwise the game would be completely forgettable anyway but as it stands it is akin to '5 nights at freddies' whereby it is an experience as much as it is a 'game'.\n\nCould I recommend this game? I couldn't. If you are a Binding of Issac fan then don't buy this game and expect it to scratch that itch either. If you end up with this game in your possession however then be sure to give it a playthough, its really not offensive to the senses to play nor is it that bad of a game at all but it lacks pepper and I think it probabaly just hasn't aged well. A Larva Mortus today would be a twin stick shooter but as it stands this game is more of a relic of an age that has passed.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 26, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

Although what you do in the first 15 minutes is exactly what you do until the end of the game so it is extremely repetative. But hey, you blast the fk out of tons of zombies and monsters and it can be challenging so it is worth a go for some mindless fun. A lot of the enemies can shoot at you, and since your main goal will basically be to take as little dmg as possible, you will be constantly circling enemies and shooting them to avoid projectiles, so stay on the move. Use melee when possible to conserve ammo. It can get really hard because you take a lot of dmg with each hit and some boss fights are hard as fk because your guy is a pu--y and dies in only a few hits. All the weapons are about the exact same weapon lineup you would find in Quake 3, including the lightning gun, and also a flamethrower and dynamite.\nIf you want to change the game's res you have to change it in the windows appdata folder. Search the games forum for tips on this including my addition to the post with information on how to do it if you have Windows 8.1.\n\nGame is 7/10, fun but extremely repetative.","March 10, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Not too bad of a game but I'm honestly not impressed. The game can be finished really in a few hours sitting for anyone who can play a top-down and dodge. And even on the hardest difficulty...the game doesn't seem HARD.\n\nPROS:\n-Cheap game. Good for if you want a top-down adventurer and something to play on the side.\n-Music is good. Relatively Castlevania-ish if you're into it.\n-Weapons do a good punch.\n-RPG-ish levelling system.\n-Powerups really make for that OOMPH-room-clear feel.\n\nCONS:\n-Sword is basically your meat and potatoes. Only time you really need a ranged weapon is when you need to break a flammable item, shotgun for large crowds. But hey, play your style.\n-Powerups have no counter/expiration timer. They'll just run out at an unspecified time randomly. Had an ammo crate I picked up from one room expire in the other after firing barely ONE shot from it. Huge minus.\n-Regen health kinda breaks the game. Clear a room, sit there, wait and regen and then move on. No sort of scare to fail or lose a level or actually play with some sort of score or dodging besides being instagibbed by monsters who just smack into/run faster than you.\n-Enemies have no kind of AI. They literally just run at you or just move around you in a circle or just chuck something at you. Some of the Champion monsters are a legit challenge...for about 2 minutes, even with enemies splintering/getting decapitated and still moving/crawling on the floor.\n-Yet to find a reason to use Dynamite beyond being overwhelmed by monsters. Was hoping for secret walls or doors...:(\n-Level up system does not allow respec. You click that button by accident? Too bad.\n-No real penalty for death besides just restarting at the Map screen, no penalty in exp/points. Just go repeat the stage.\n-Buggy rooms. I've gone into rooms and enemies are stuck against walls, in/behind objects or invisible forcing me to run in and out of the room constantly to make them reset to the point where I CAN hit them anyway.\n-The missions start feeling...samey...after about the 10th mission. Textured walls and floor and recolored enemies. The game starts feeling boring about 10-12 levels in.\n-You still pick up weapons when you walk over them even if you're full on ammo for them, leading to you practically wasting ammo sometimes-the few times you really feel the need to shoot at something. Ammo isn't scarce by any means but it's a personal peeve really. And you already carry such a limited amount of ammo as is and the ability to leave a room with 1 monster in it and come back in to farm it up for medpacks and ammo is pretty...meh.\n-Speaking of which: being able to run back to a cleared room and sit in it and regen HP when you get overwhelmed is pretty snoreworthy.\n\nOverall the game IS fun somewhat but I honestly wasn't impressed overall. It's an indie game and well made but otherwise, don't expect something long and involving. You can throw in a few hours with the game but it's nothing to call home about.","September 23, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It puts you in the shoes of a monster hunter that has to travel around the world to samey-looking locations and slay monsters. There's storyline missions, and there's (I think) an unlimited and random-spawned amount of side-missions.\n\nThe major flaw that drags through all of Larva Mortus' elements is: repetitiveness.\n\nOn the technical side, you can't blame the game for really anything. The gameplay is solid and (more importantly) consistent, though it gets a bit repetitive. The missions are: break a curse, kill all monsters, save lost souls, kill monster champions... but in reality it always gets down to 'kill all monsters' on way or the other. Visually everything looks good, but the locations get repeated and after you realize there's actually only a variety of 3-4 dungeons - again, it gets a bit boring. The music is well done, brooding and dramatic orchestral arrangements, but again only a handful of them, and which after you listen to them for hours - you guessed it, they get a bit tedious.\n\nBut flaws aside, the only true gripe I hold against this game is the INCREDIBLY STUPID XP MECHANIC, where the game upon your death remembers your level, but erases your current XP. To explain: you enter a dungeon with 1000 XP, and you're lvl 1. In that level, you gain 10000 XP and lvl 10, but then before you finish the dungeon you die. When you continue, you will be lvl 10 but your XP will revert back to 1000. That means that for lvl 11 (for which the requirement is, let's say, 11000 XP) you will no longer need only 1000XP, but 10000 (from your current 1000 to 11000). There are no saves in dungeons, so on later missions where the monsters do get tough, this can be a real pain in the a$$... and not in a good way.\n\nAll in all, Larva Mortus is best played in short sessions. I seem to come back to it once a week or so. I play it awhile, then it annoys me (because of the XP thingy), I leave it, then play it again awhile, then it annoys me one more time... it's a mixed bag, really. But for the price, especially on sale, it gets so cheap you can't do anything else but recommend it. Sort of...","April 13, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would also recommend that you take a break every hour or so, because it does become tedius after prolonged play. I also had an issue in some rooms in which a monster would not spawn, forcing me to exit the room and come back.

Larva Mortus offers a boring story with equally boring gameplay, not to mention a dull and unoriginal soundtrack to boot. Everything past the first hour of playing is completely repetitive, and the fact that all levels are randomly generated adds nothing to the mix considering that all rooms are almost identical: dark, filled with an unimpressive range of enemy types and incredibly boring to clear out.\n\nAll in all, this game is kinda like aids, except it costs money and is playable.","March 2, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Name aside, you are a priest (I think) with various weapons against hordes of monsters.  The view is third person overhead, and you use WASD to move and can shoot/aim with the mouse.  As you kill monsters you'll occasionally find buffs to damage/armor/speed and level up which allows you to improve speed/life/regen/item drop rates/debuff length/etc.  Leveling doesn't really increase damage though so its not very useful once you get near the end of the game since monsters start to be able to one shot you.\n\nThe Good:  Initially fun to play, good challenge and has nice art in the cut scenes.\n\nThe Bad:  The game drags on quite a bit, especially if you are going for achievements.  There is not enough variety in monsters weapons or tactics to keep you interested, since most monsters can be defeated by strafing around them, and the ones that can't slow you and one shot you.  The bosses have so much life that it can become quite boring rotating around and around them.\n\nTakeaway: Not the worst game ever, but it might start to seem like a chore later on.\n\nThe Achievements: You don't need to beat the game to 100% it oddly, but beating the game is actually easier.  On any mission, some rooms can spawn one of 25 rare items, or ammo or a key.  The problem is that getting one of the rare items doesn't take it out of the pool so getting that last one can be very frustrating.","March 4, 2015","false","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The achievements however, are quite frustrating and very luck-based. If you're an achievement hunter like me, allow me to explain what you'll be up against.\n\nEvery map is divided into small, square rooms. A few of those rooms will hold a single "item spawn point". One of the following can appear at such a spawn point:\na key to a locked door (for the current level only)\na bunch of consumables (ammo / health)\none of the achievement items (chosen randomly, which means an item can appear that you already have)Keys have absolute priority for being chosen to appear, because otherwise some doors would remain locked and the level would be broken. And again, there are very few item spawn points per map. Add in that consumables appear more often than not and you're lucky to get a single achievement item per map. It goes well at first, but when I was down to the last one, that was a chance of around 4% per level? It took me two hours...\n\nI was considering a negative outcome for this review but luckily the last item appeared just in time. The combat is smooth and sufficiently satisfying. The Hellsing-ish vibe is a big positive in my mind; just imagine you're playing as Anderson. All the more so after you've edited the (plain-text) savefiles and set your Regeneration to 200.","April 11","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
