However, it does lack a number of key components of any wrenching session, such as...\n\n-The "This Bolt is so Badly Rusted and Seized That No Amount of Breaker Bars, Impact Wrenches or Penetrating Oil Can Help You Now" puzzle;\n-The "DO YOU FEEL LUCKY, PUNK?!" EZ-Out Bolt Extractor Mini-Game;\n-The "Dropped a Nut in the Engine Bay and it Didn't Hit the Floor" experience;\n-The "Broke a Thousand-Dollar Part While Attempting to Fix a Ten-Dollar Part and Now I'm Inventing New Swear Words" vocabulary game and its companion, "Throw the Wrench Across the Garage in a Fit of Rage"; and\n-The "Desperate Run to the Parts Store Five Minutes Before Close" racing game.\n\nOh, I almost forgot about the ever-popular "Roll to Hit Your Head on Everything Between the Floor and Ceiling" skill check.  Come to think of it, that's exactly why this game is pretty enjoyable - all of the wrenching without any of the frustrations that come along with it.  In all seriousness, it could use a couple things (for example, removing an engine whole instead of piece-by-piece, then tearing down the engine on a stand outside the car), a bit of polish here and there and, of course, more cars and more customisation (performance parts, tuning and engine swaps would be great!), but overall, CMS 2015 stands well on its own as it is.","May 24, 2015","true","31.2"," 1,082 of 1,102 people (98%) found this review helpful 1,042 people found this review funny","98","082","1","042","29"

When I heard about Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 being in crowdfund mode I was hesitant to put more money down as I felt like it'd be the same thing. A decent time waster until you beat the game. After looking at what they had so far I started to get excited for the title and immediately pledged enough to get the game when it was released. I received my code earlier today and began playing it.\n\nThe menu is completely different and I found it to be fluid and well designed. It immediately gave me a good vibe. I quickly and eagerly created a profile and began playing. As soon as I started working on the car I automatically fell in love with how it felt. In the previous title it felt like the menus were slow and sluggish. It felt like a burden just to check my inventory. In CMS 2015, that's not the case. The keys are simple and understandable yet pay homage to the original title. Taking off and putting parts on was a breeze. I found myself immerse and even at times swearing like I was working on a real car. Not even kidding. At one point when it told me I had to replace a Piston I was like "Man forget this game!" yet I quickly dove into the top end and just started taring down and enjoying it. It's immersive and easy at the same time. I played for 4 hours before I could even test drive a car, but it was worth the wait. I've messed around with the Auction house and that's a great perk. I gave myself a budget and immediately surpassed it because, well 'because I can'. This game feels endless and fun. Fluid, good looking and immersive.\n\nI was how ever, disappointed in the fact that when you purchase a car on the auction house, you're required to put back what was on it. For example, I couldn't put a dual carb intake when I took off a single carb intake. It was disappointing as I am a big mechanic head, I love to be able to upgrade rather than replace. I was equally disappointed at the lack of aftermarket body parts. I was hoping for a hood scoop or two, but unfortunately nothing. These aren't game breakers though. I will still enjoy this game daily. Hopefully, they will update the game with either a DLC or a base patch that will allow you to do a motor swap in the auction cars.\n\nTL:DR version: Game is fun, fluid and immersive. Way better than 2014 and in my opinion, should be in any gear heads library, or just anyone who wants to play a good car game. Looks great as well!\n\nIf you enjoyed this review please consider going to www.frostythegamer.com and following the website.

I'll say that, yes this is a game... and a good one.  But, it is a casual sim and not so much like a Falcon flightsim.  For example, changing the brakes on a car is one thing, but in this game you don't have to spend time bleeding brake lines or... running brake lines or electrical lines.\n\nIn real life, gremlins in the electrical systems (wiring harness, fuses, etc) are what takes up so much of my time.  In this game... they're not even there... really (unless you count ignition wiring).  That could be a blessing or a curse because I hate testing 2 miles of insulated copper wire with a multimeter just to figure out why a car has a mysterious parasitic power drain.  In this game... you're either blessed to not have that tedium or let down without having that real sim experience.\n\nOverall, it is a fun GAME.  Little to no bugs.  I only wish the market allowed me to reference my parts list from the build order so I didn't have to go run under the car every time I forgot what suspension part I needed.\n\nOverall, I rate it an 8/10","April 26, 2015","true","45.7"," 145 of 151 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","145","151","6","1"

CMS 2014 is more realistic in many ways - sideways evolution not revolution.\n\n\nGraphics are decent, sounds are reasonably realistic if simple. Music is passable for the first half hour, then gets turned off. An ingame jukebox with your own mp3 folder linked would be great.\n\nInto the reason why we play games - gameplay. The main suspension types (live axle and independant) are well represented along with engine choices. What is lacking is any customisation. Once you've put together 20 or so cars the excitement fails and you feel like you're grinding toward a goal you can't see. You cannot change parts from one car to another to improve horsepower or weight like Redline Racer 2 or similar (incidently a very good car modification game but very buggy).\n\nIn my case, I was grinding for 9k experience, the point in which you can buy parling spaces to get cars from the auctions.\nI hit 9k, spent my 50g then went shopping at the auctions. Bought an absolute beater for far more then it was worth and took it home. Stripped, rebuilt every component I could, replaced everything else and then looked for a place to market my rebuilt ride.\n\nThat's strange, I have no auction option...that's right. You can only sell the cars you buy for a set sum dependant on condition and model, not feed it back to the auction where you bought it. You get paid a minor 'restoration bonus' and actually end up almost even steven from where you started, which considering you've just spent the better part of 30-45mins rebuilding this thing is.....disappointing to say the least.\n\nThis seems to underutilise the potentially exciting platform of the auction. Why couldn't we walk the lot before the auction, checking out the cars beforehand or even meet other bidders?\nAlso on bidding, it seems a very simple but random process - you're not sure why one model car sells for more then the same model in similar condition because you're literally given no information on each unit. Zero. Can't even pan around to see how many panels are missing.\n\nAnother lost oppurtunity is the test track - this could have been much larger and give the player a challenge or at least a reason not to on-sell a car but alas no.\n\nMods are enabled so the community will probably come to the rescue but they shouldn't have to. The pan speed is excellent however not being able to do anything while draining oil or lowering/raising a car on the hoist is immensely frustrating, can't even check the job sheet.\n\nThis game is worth money. How much though? To someone like me who already has a sound knowledge base on car mechanics, maybe $5-10. The content there is well done with no bugs I can see which is a pat on the back. I understand it uses DLC and I've bought a couple already, but misses clear oppurtunities to shine using platforms already existing in the game and offers little direction or encouragement to continue either doing customer jobs or rebuilding auction cars. You will get bored at less then 20 hours.\n\nIf you want a better understanding of cars, this is a good start at least in names of components and different types of suspension. Some little AVIs on how the different suspensions compare to one another in practise would be great to better educate those who wish to play this game as a learning tool.\n\nA good crack at a title, but over far too quickly with little replay value.\n\n\nEDIT   -    After playing the 2014 complete version I must say there appears to be more tangible goals at least on the Tuning and 4WD addons, in addition to 2014 having more realistic graphics and engine components (actually has intake from filter housings to throttle bodies unlike 2015). Unfortunately 2014 has slow component removal speed and slow mouse speed and still has limited content..\nThe best CMS would be an amalgam of the best attributes of both with casual/hardcore mods with more complex components and tuning/mix match options","November 7, 2015","true","19.8"," 131 of 136 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","131","136","4","7"

Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit. The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates.

Everything is vastly improved, especially the graphics and game mechanics (pun intended). They've also added the ability to buy auctioned vehicles, allowing you to fix them and sell them for profit, among some other big new things. The developers are actively updating the game and listen to the requests of its fanbase which is always a great thing to see. I love a dedicated developer that keeps up to speed with its community. Also, there's a growing multitude of cars available to work on, engines have variation most of the time, and while the game has no tutorial, the learning curve is easy to get over once you figure the parts of a car out. It gives you a very easy start, then slowly gets more and more intricate as you become more proficient in your tasks. It actually gets pretty challenging sometimes.\n\nA lot of people wonder about how realistic it is, so I will go over that in the next paragraph:\nI'm no mechanic, so I have no real-life depiction of how realistic the game actually is, but I got an opinion from a friend of mine who really is a mechanic.\n\nThe original Car Mechanic Simulator is what initially sparked my interest in how cars work, and now this sequel helps me expand on that. Hell, it got me so intrigued I went out to my car to see if I could take the air filter out! I even watched some YouTube videos on mechanics principles. I really didn't care for cars prior. In fact I knew nothing of cars. Thank this game for inspiring my love in vehicles! After talking to a mechanic friend, he does say the game lacks realistic difficulty because in reality, knowing which tools to use and finding out what is broken is only half the battle, and it holds your hand through putting things back together, as well as taking things apart in the right order. In real life, it's far more possible to forget to put something in the car, or to lose a bolt inside the engine which apparently sounds painful to a mechanic. He said you can't simply pull out some parts like the game does, too, such as a gearbox. Also, the engines it has you work on aren't as wildly varying as real life cars. My car engine has many of the parts the game has, and thanks to the game I could identify a few of the things which felt very satisfying since I had literally no knowledge of it prior. Everything was arranged differently than in the game, though. It's possibly true that the game isn't quite spot-on realistic, however there's nothing I know of that's better at teaching you the parts of a car and how cars work. With the incredible leap in game quality in just one year, I wouldn't be surprised if it'll be marginally closer to real life in the next sequel. I'm not IGN and I give this a 10/10, so that should say something! It was well worth the 16 dollars I spent, as you can't put a price on education and inspiration.","June 19, 2015","true","28.9"," 109 of 115 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","109","115","10","3"

Very well done. However, some quality of life improvements need implemented.\n\n-Load times are atrocious. On a modern machine, simply ridiculous in length. This needs adressed.\n\n-The newest DLC is excellent, however, the 1/4 mile needs an option to toggle between manual or automatic, or even a launch control(I realize the older cars don't have this). If you are simply keyboarding, launching a 600+HP vehicle is a terrible chore of finesse. 1/4 mile times will even drop(versus stock, slightly tuned, max tune) until you can find that sweet spot of gear manipulation just to end tire spin. Even then, times are foolishly off what they should be.\n\n-No option to toggle KPH to MPH. Small complaint, but important.\n\n-When tearing a car down, a lot of the screen is wasted space. They need to implement a menu of items and % you already have in your inventory for each part removed. Maybe something as simple as a top 3 % listing to cut down on menu swapping time. This would fit nicely into some of the empty voids on screen. Whether it shows on part removal or part replacement mode. It would improve gameplay ten folds...\n\n-Repairing items at a 90% cap is nice, but when an item is above a certain percentage, say 90-99%, breaking it shouldn't be so simple. Sometimes randomness can cause 100% of these items to break for a LONG stretch. Not a huge deal, but could be improved. Again not huge, but can be very annoying.\n\n-New DLC issue, Superchargers/intake can block distributor cap clip on the back side. Real pain even zoomed in to remove or replace.\n\n-Load times.\n\n-More variety would make it more consuming. Parking lot for customers cars waiting to be fixed(similar to a real shop). More bays. Perhaps even a staff at a certain XP level to allow more projects with less hands on; your staff does basic jobs for you(such as simple exhaust repairs/brakes/etc..) More money sinks. Custom build jobs(This may or may not be in newest DLC,if so disregard), not just repairs. Not everything needing worked on is broke. A lot of customers want a built/modified/improved car out of a perfect performing car.\n\nOverall this is an amazing game despite my minor annoyances. Amazingly fun if cars are your thing.  Would recommend to any wrench turner who plays games.","May 9","true","81.4"," 57 of 59 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","57","59","0","0"

From a beautiful Ford Mustang, to a luxury Bentley or even an eco-friendly model. Everyone likes cars, unless they don't. And being part of that gang, I thought it would be a good idea to try out this new game, and share my experience with the world.\n\nIt's a never ending battle of making your cars better and also trying to be better yourself.\n\n\nDale Earnhardt\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Car Mechanic Simulator 2015.\n\nGameplayFirst of all, let me tell you something. This game will screw you with the amount of screws you'll have to unscrew and rescrew during your mechanic career.\nAs a garage owner, your objective is, as in any other game, to make money, which will be used to upgrade that same garage, as well as to buy parts for other cars, and even to buy cars.\nAfter accepting the first job, there's a list that tells the player what's wrong with said car, and, obviously, it's up to the player to open up that car and find those parts, and replace or repair them. If you choose to replace, you can just order the piece you need online, however, if you choose to repair the piece, you'll save money, or you’ll end up breaking it.\nAs the game goes on, and the player gains experience, which can be used to get some scanners and faster tools, those lists indicating the problem will cease to exist, and it will be up to the player to use everything available to find the problem and fix it. Plan B, which let me tell you, always works, is simply to dismantle the entire car and check every single piece, but that does take quite a while, as you can imagine.\nI didn't know the difference between a spark plug and a crankshaft, but now I do! So fear not if you don't know anything about the mechanical side of cars, or even anything related to cars, because you'll learn it all.\nCar Mechanic Simulator 2015 will bring out the mechanic in you that you never knew existed. Trust me, I'm (now) a mechanic.\n\nPros Incredible details;\nPlenty of pieces, from rubber bushings to spark plugs, CMS2015 has it all;\nThe difficulty ladder is really well designed, and the player won't feel a difference when the harder repairs come by, if anything, it will feel easier with all the practice;\nSome interesting tools available to help discover what needs to be fixed, from testing paths, to electronic meters, there's a nice variety to use and abuse;\nIntuitive job objectives that help the player to find out where the problem is, without having to dismantle the entire car (even though that's the fun part!);\nNice variety of cars, with more being added in the future;\nNo game has as many screws as CMS2015;\nThe auction house allows the player to buy a (almost) ruined car and resell it, after it has been worked a bit, for profit.\nI wouldn't be surprised to see some of the "Cons" listed below improved in future patches/updates, but I do feel the need to point them out as they're somewhat disappointing.\n\nCons Long loading screens, even if you're only going to visit the auction or the parking lot;\nThe "damaged" details are feel very poor, since there's no broken or bent, just rust (the more rust, the more damaged the piece is!);\nThe shadows are a bit off, especially around the lifter (I'd also like to point out the lifter doesn't appear to actually be holding the car, it's just sort of floating there).\nVerdictI'd give it a 8.5/10, which could easily be a 10 if the graphic quality and effects were a bit better. Nonetheless, it's a fantastic game and undoubtedly a must for any fan of the genre. Do note that the team is still active, and I'm sure the quality of the game will increase even further.\n\nNote: Despite looking quite similar to real cars, the vehicles available in game aren't actually the real ones, and it would be sweet to actually be able to work on a Ford Mustang and such, but I do understand it being extremely difficult to apply due to licensing issues.","May 7, 2015","true","20.9"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","59","64","7","5"

If you're a huge fan of this type of simulation, ignore everything after this and buy it anyway.\n\nInterface awkwardness seems to be common in this sort of game.  I don't know if it's lack of playtesting or what.  "I" opens your inventory, but doesn't close it; that's the Escape key.  All the menus are like that.  After you buy cars at the auction, they are sent to your garage's parking lot.  Naturally, you can't go directly there from the auction.  You have to go to the main workshop (loading screen), then to the garage (loading screen), send the car to the workshop, then go back to the workshop (you guessed it! more loading screen).  I still can't think of a reason not to let me just summon the car to the lift like I'm a wizard since that's effectively what's happening anyway.  Even if it takes a single loading screen, one is better than three.\n\nThe decision on what parts are seems pretty arbitrary.  Things that are just one part: Rear differential, starter motor, the entire transmission.  On the other hand the distributor cap has: ignition wires, clips to hold the cap on, the cap, the rotor, and the housing.  I'd love it if I could work on the bigger complicated parts at the workbench, or use an engine lift to pull the blessed thing out whole instead of raising and lowering the car over and over.\n\nI think the biggest disappointment for me is that it only feels like half a game.  You fix cars, but there really isn't any point to it.  Sure you get XP and money to fix *different* things on *different* cars.  It's all without any goal to it.  This game would be much improved if it were mated to a racing game.  Then I'm making money to fix up my car, buying auctioned cars for parts to my car, and using the garage to improve my car.  But nope. I'm just pulling bad parts off of a car, hitting them with a hammer until they are fixed or ruined, buying replacements for the ruined ones, and putting it all back together.  Or rather I was since I no longer play the game.","August 18, 2015","false","34.3"," 119 of 164 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","119","164","12","8"

I also loved Gearhead Garage back in the 90's, and I have a background in auto repair, so I maaaaay be biased.\n\nHaving played Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, I realized that this team was putting together something very special - something that rekindled a love I haven't experienced since my Gearhead Garage CD stopped working. CMS2014 (last year's game) reminds me of the CD-level release of Gearhead Garage - no auctions, limited cars, and somewhat... unfinished, I suppose. CM2015 (this year's game) is the entry that I think the developers wanted to make. It feels alive, very much so, and it feels like it has this wealth of potential just waiting to be tapped. I am honestly excited for this game in a way I'm not often excited about games.\n\nThe ProsDevs are highly active in the community. Seriously, check the Steam Forums for this game, and they're engaged with players. They are actually keeping a community-created list of wanted features (and are honest about what they can't/won't include, too). VERY cool to see this from a dev team!\nGorgeous graphics. The details in the textures are really nice, and the individual parts shine here. It may not break any monitors or redefine any genres, but it definitely is something my graphics card makes veeeery pretty.\nCustomizable "home base" (garage). Maybe it's just a "me thing", but I like making it my own place.\nVERY detailed (and, from a parts sales guy's perspective, accurate) parts - assembly and "fit".\nSmooth Gameplay. There's definitely a rhythm you can get into, and it makes this game easy to lose hours in.\nThe ConsSoundtrack. While I do enjoy the genre, I turned the in-game music volume down to 20 (instead of 50). This made it much easier to bear, even enjoyable. Customizable music has been suggested to the devs, and is definitely something they should pick up.\nLearning curve. It's a bit steep to get into the game, though if you have some background in cars it's easier. A piece of advice? Switch between the view types, particularly View 3, which shows you the condition of parts. You can take a test drive to find the condition of suspension parts.\nClarity of Gameplay Direction. It's honestly more exploratory than explained to you. Poke things. Explore your environment. Open doors, play with objects... Honestly, a lot of learning is done by experience here, which either lends to the idea of a garage mechanic or breaks the game for you entirely, depending on how you look at it (I don't mind it, but I have a background in this area, so...)\nHonestly, it's a standard initial release as of April 24 (2-3 days after release), so the content isn't massive. There's 17 cars now, one more definitely happening, and a menu entry for "community content" that isn't active just yet. If this opens itself to modding... this game could easily end up being 800+ hours on my account. I absolutely love it!","April 24, 2015","true","10.6"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","38","40","3","0"

I began mechanically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and actually learned a whole lot about the functions of a vehicle.\n\nPros:\n\n- Beautiful graphics.\n- Good car selection. (clearly knockoffs, but you can take a good stab at what they represent)\n- Plenty of parts to disassemble and reassemble.\n- Doesn't just hold your hand and tell you every move to make. (Some may not consider that a pro)\n- Is definitely realistic, and now I can trust myself to change sparkplugs. :p\n\nCons:\n\n- I learned from this game that the key way to identify a messed up car part is to find the absolutely rusted-over part, and remove it. I believe that if the creator(s) were to create cracked, dented, crushed, and other affects to try to identify, that it would be a little less cheesy, and a lot more challenging.\n- No trucks. I will live until this issue is fixed though. :)\n- No transmission repair. I feel as if the game has very in-depth repair abilities, such as being able to gut out an engine and lift the whole thing out, but as far as gearbox operations, you don't get to jack with the transmission at all, you only have to replace or repair the gearbox as a whole without messing with the transmission or the overall mechanism inside of the gearbox itself.

RUST.\n\nSo imagine we are handed a relatively new car that has some suspension problems. We pop the car on a lift, take a look at the undercarriage, and we find pristine parts, right next to others that look like they've been randomly touched by a rust monster. This makes the game into quite the amusing "find the rust" quest.\n\nAdded hilarity comes from antique muscle cars. I've opened the hood just to find an engine that must have been submerged in the ocean for 100 years. You want me to fix your engine? The engine block is made out of rust! There are a whole 5 push rods and two spark plugs that are in sensible shape! But the customer is the customer, and we get to disassemble the entire engine, but 40+ new parts, and somehow put them together, with new pristine parts next to others that somehow, despite being quite rusty, do not need a change. Yes sir, I'll only change 5 pistons, even though the other 3 are at 30%. I am sure you want to pay for another mechanic to rebuild your engine again in a year when those old parts fail, right?\n\nThe game's biggest issues today are the fact that the game refuses to list the defective parts when I am in front of the computer, ordering replacements, so I either have to use paper, or just make multiple trips to the in-game parts store (Just imagine how long that would take IRL if a mechanic did something like that). The second issue is that the game wants you to replace the broken parts with newer ones that meet specs, but it has to be in the exact same position. So, say that we have an 8 cylinder engine, with its 16 pull rods. 5 of them are broken and need replacement. the rest do not, but they are so used they are not good as replacements. We also have to change the crankshaft, which involves removing the engine heads where the pull rods fit. So after we disassemble everything, and put on the new crankshaft, and put the engine heads back, then comes the game of trying to figure out which location to put the new pull rods, as we've already taken all of them out. So I end up pushing O a lot, and seeing if, after placing a new part, the game actually thinks it counts as a repair. if it doesn't, I have to take the part out again, and then put an old one, Repeat until you find all the new replacements, or just give up, and purchase all the parts new.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game, as long as you don't take it too seriously. Highly recommended.","April 26, 2015","true","92.0"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","25","27","8","1"

That said, this is a good start for anyone remotely interested in fixing/repairing/replacing parts.\n\nWhile there are some things I could criticize, like the 'instructions not clear enough - private parts stuck in engine block' tutorial, it's quite easy to get into and play with little hand-holding. The part repair system could use a little work imho, the paint shop seems a bit redundant at times, the auction camera needs a bit of fixing, and some other small things.\n\nOverall for a game of this style, having that balance between a gearhead's game and a general indie style game is hard to get right. This game gets it right. It has enough depth and detail to actually make me stop and think about what I'm doing and what steps I should take to complete the repair, but not too much that I have to call my mechanic friends/family and ask them what I need to do.\n\nThe game is easy to get into and very fun to play, again balancing gameplay and detail/realism. The number of times I've had to replace a crankshaft after I've already taken apart the clutch housing and reassembled it......\n\nThere are a few things that needed work, but mostly just quality of life improvements that could be changed/added in a patch. No major problems to speak of.\n\nI wish some of the 2014 features were there, like the sense of progression from a garage to a multi-car shop, or the 'replace the missing parts from my new used car purchase'.\n\nYes you will replace brakes a thousand times, yes you will change thousands of filters, yes you will find the same problems coming up time after time. This is the life of a mechanic. Cars need brakes, cars need new filters, mechanical things break, and often times it's the same things that break. I would recommend that you see the 'monotony' as a more realistic representation of how it is to fix cars in a shop. Your car will need new oil, it will need a new timing belt at least once in its life, it's just a fact to live with.\n\nThe thing I personally like, having recently gotten to that point, is once you can purchase a parking garage and go to the auto auction to purchase broken down piles of scrap, and turn them into like-new beauties to sell. The trailer/intro video shows this, starting with a car that may be missing half of the body, trying to repair as many parts as possible to save money, and buying what you can't fix. By the end you can decide whether to just replace the really bad parts, or completely renovate the body, engine, and suspension to brand new quality. It adds a sense of accomplishment to the end game (which some may say is desperately needed after changing 1000 brake pads), and keeps you playing.\n\n\nTL;DR: It can be boring, but it's worth it to anyone even remotely interested in cars. Just buy it. (Though if still in doubt - wait for a sale, $20 USD may be a bit steep for some)","April 28, 2015","true","37.4"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","27","31","7","5"

But new and improved for 2015 are the cars have many more parts now and the repairs are a good deal more involved. You also earn XP now as you work and complete jobs which can be used to unlock more advanced diagnostic tools like the test path, OBD scanner, compression tester etc and other repair abilities.\n\nThere is also an unlockable paint shop now as well so you can do body and paint work and an auction house where you can buy junk cars for parts or fix them up and sell them for profit. Once you earn enough to get the extra parking lot, you can store your cars for service or just collect them. Customers call in on the phone with jobs you can take or decline. An all new better organized parts shop and tablet access eliminates running back and forth to the computer to buy parts.\n\nTest driving the vehicle now and using your diagnostic tools generates a parts list condition report for certain systems saving you time poking around and disassembling the vehicle looking for bad parts.\n\nAll in all there's quite a bit to do and highly recommended if you like puzzle games, working on cars, or are a simulator fan.","May 16, 2015","true","12.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","1"

Your abilty in the game is outstanding, you gain experince points, having thoses points makes it possable to get things, you can take jobs or reject jobs, you can not only do auto repair, but go to the auction and get cars to restore. The game is not a auto training simulator, there are no software training simulators for auto mechanics, you would need to see a tech school for that because it is hands on training.\n\nHow ever the diganostics on the car for a failing part is on the mark for the most part of what got broken and needs to be replaced. If you never worked on a car ever, here you will get to see what the parts names are and were they go, so yeah it could be said you will learn the very basic bases of auto mechanics.\n\nIf your a mechnic who likes to play around with car repair games, a person who is into cars, anyone who is adicted to cars, I would recomend this game. Check out the guides section in the fourm and look for "Auto Repair Manual Class for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015" Why this guide? Because at the very end of the guide at the bottom it has Tutorial Videos of the in's and out's of what is expected in the game and maybe of intresst to you to see what is going on in the game! They are sectioned off with titles on each video making it possable for you to choose what you want to see.

I want to hear the painful shattering of knuckles hitting steel by accident and the curses spewing from my tobacco filled mouth out of pure anger and agony. Another thing that I think needs to be added in conjunction with the afore mentioned agony is having the option to throw your tools in anger damaging the vehicle in the process only adding to the pain. Also there should be a frustration meter that runs all the time that rises from things like your wife calling to talk about something you don’t care about at the time, or ever. With these features missing I would have to give this game a, 9 out of 10.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is smack-dab in the middle of this genre, and can be described as a zen-like puzzler that is an incredibly slow burner. This game will require many hours from you, and will satisfy and reward you the whole way.\n\nEssentially, you manage a mechanics garage. The whole thing. You answer calls, take jobs, and fix cars (among other things). You can repair parts, or order new. You can let jobs pile up, or solve one at a time. Each job is very much a puzzle. The better you are, the quicker you advance. The more you advance, the better swag/tools/speed/etc. you get. It has RPG elements like that. The music is great, too.\n\nPros:\n+Utterly addicting, in all the right ways.\n+Beautiful graphics, and great music to fit.\n+Metric tons of gameplay in here.\n+If you are familiar with automotive anatomy, it will help some, but don't let that scare away people that are unfamiliar: its easy to learn.\n+Controls are smooth and intuitive after the first 20 minutes or so.\n\nCons:\n-This is the kind of game (I think) that is best chipped away at an hour a day or so (probably like EuroTruck Simulator). Its a slow burner. You need to invest alot of time to really get somewhere. Not necessarily a 'con', but you should be aware. It isn't instant gratification.\n\nI got it on sale, but I think its worth full price for most people (if you are looking into it, its probably for you). Its amazing and beautiful how video games can be brilliantly built out of mundane and simple ideas.\n\nPeace,","March 10","true","4.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","2"

Well, we know which brands of car we like, what shape we like, what features they have and mostly we love to drive them (must be a minimum of 16 years old to do so). That is probably the extent most of us really know about automobiles. Well, Thanks to Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, you will expand your knowledge of one of the biggest inventions of the nineteen century!\n\nCar Mechanic simulator 2015 is a car simulation/ racing / puzzle game. In this game, you are going to take control of a very busy garage. Your phone is going to ring constantly and you will receive a lot jobs to repair cars (mechanics and body work); engine, brakes, suspensions, gearbox, axles or the body of the car. After you accept the job (you will have a full description of the job), you will have to get your hands dirty and reach the part to be replaced. You can’t really miss it, it will be rusty (red). One of the interesting aspects of the job description is that you have to make sure that all parts you replace are of a certain condition (eg above 70%). Well, if you buy the part it would fine but sometimes you might decide to use the repair table to save some money. Let’s say you decide to replace the faulty part with a brand new one and decide to order the part using your desktop. You will have five suppliers and one bank. Each supplier will be a specialist and the bank will be here if you need a loan.\n\nAt the end of each job, you will earn money (thank god for that, you see the price of some parts. . . pretty steep) and experience points. As you gain experience, you will be able to accept bigger jobs and each time you reach 1,000 XP you will be given an upgrade point which you can use to get better tools or customize your garage. Xp will also give you access to upgrade you garage with very important features; such as a paint shop. If you feel the urge to take a break from the chaotic work, why don’t you take a car for a spin or go to the auction (you must upgrade your garage with a carpark before you can go to the auction).\n\nThe layout of the garage is well designed and you can see everything a garage has to offer – car lifter, tools, garage doors - but no calendar (you know those calendars that have picture of a woman without much on sitting on a car bonnet looking rather suggestive).\n\nThe graphics are really good and the controls are a combination of keyboard / mouse and are easy to use and understand. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning, too.\n\nThis game is really impressive to be honest with you. Whether you are a petrol head or not, it is really enjoyable to play. It might be a bit repetitive, but it’s fun!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics\n-	Garage is very well laid out and can be customized\n-	Easy to follow jobs in hand\n-	Plenty of content and DLC\n-	Great soundtrack\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No achievement or trading cards\n-	A bit repetitive\n\nCar Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a well thought-out game.\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE\n","March 20","true","9.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","15","17","4","0"

It can get repetitive after about 16h (I played more than 30 already and still have lots of fun), but it is actively developed and almost every week (and sometimes even more often) there is something new to see in the game and also after you explore all the content available at the moment game is still relaxing and fun so I find myself running it just to play for about half an hour, fix a car of two, and relax a little. I highly recommend this game. It is very well done technologically, constantly improved in terms of gameplay and replayability and has very good support and contact with the developer. Almost every thread on steam forums has a developer answer, and some of the suggestions were implemented in the game in literally few days from being first posted.

"CMS 2014" featured static levels whereas this one seems to throw random jobs at you, which you can either take or reject on a whim (which is great).  I would have liked some sort of difficulty gauge on how hard jobs are before you accept them, that is...something to tell you that you have to take 15 parts off the car as opposed to 2 before getting to the part you need to replace.  Some may be able to say, "oh, that's just a catalytic capacitor radiator thingy...an easy fix"...I can't do that.  A color palette box in the showroom would have been nice too (instead you have to toggle through colors), but this is minor.

I didn't even think twice, of course I backed it, 2014 was such a great game. The idea of Car Mechanic Simulator is a very easy one to understand - I absolutely love tinkering with my real life car so naturally you would think this game is made for someone like me who is looking for a cheaper alternative to modding real cars, I would actually disagree with that. I find that this game has a wider market than people first think - the hunt for that last broken part and the race to get the funds for a bigger garage or that new part for the car you picked up at auction last week adds both puzzle and RPG elements that a lot of gamers will be familiar with and will enjoy.\n\nThe game itself plays incredibly well and the new menus are gorgeous, very simple and straightforward, the controls have also been fine-tuned leaving the finished product feeling much better and in turn even more fun to play.\n\nAnyone that has played 2014 and liked it, even just a little bit, should definitely pick this up - let's keep supporting the creators and hopefully we will see another new game with some more incredible new features in 2016!\n\nThe only thing that slightly holds this game back is the lack of customisation that you can put into the cars you pick up at auction. I would love to be able to fit my 20 year old rusty hatchback with a 5.0 litre V8, upgrade to a twin exhaust (or even quad!?), a wide body kit, slam the suspension, tint the windows, even possibly convert it to 4WD! Oh, the possibilities... Perhaps I'm just expecting too much, or maybe I've just been playing too much Need for Speed... Who knows, either way, I would bet money that we will see improvements like these in either future DLC or the next release.\n\nVerdict - As much as I really want to give this game a perfect score, it has to be 9/10 based on the lack of customisation for your auction bangers. Still a fantastic game that I will play until my eyes bleed.","April 24, 2015","true","32.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

I think Car Mechanic Simulator is a tremendous first step, however it ultimately fell short of what I was hoping for.\n\nThe game boils down to an interactive set of 3d car models. These models allow you to disassemble and reassemble engines, drive trains, and so on. This is definitely neat, but in itself only has so much enjoyment before things get repetitive.\n\nThe illusion of running a repair shop almost works but the finer points of running a business are completely lost. There are always more customers waiting, no matter how long you take, or how poorly you did. Diagnosing problems seems almost trivial, just look for rusty components as you wrench things apart. I want to like this, but I ran out of challenges a while ago. All that remains is the grind of XP and money.\n\nThis game needs more of something. I would personally love to see engine tuning and performance simulated to some degree. Other options would be expanding the business model of running a repair shop, or perhaps adding more realism to the repairs themselves. A broken part isn't just a rust texture after all.","November 8, 2015","false","5.6"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","20","30","2","0"

It does what it was designed to do very well, if you like cars, and sims. I found it pretty relaxing taking cars apart and putting them back together. That said, here's a summary of what I think are the strong and weak points of this game:\n\nPros:\n\nUnique idea (to me anyway), running your own garage\nNicely rendered cars and mechanically logical design/engineering\nFun upgrades to your workshop can be added (e.g. custom colors from your spray booth)\n\nCons:\n\nGreater role-playing elements would make this good game great\nDon't really see the purpose of the "test track"\nLimited toolbox upgrades -- I have so many upgrade points and can't do anything with them\nMinor grouse -- slow loading times, especially to auction, parking, garage, etc. surely this can be improved?\nMusic was driving me batty after a while, but you can shut it off\nGets repetitive after a while, especially without new cars, challenges, etc., which means\nLimited replay value, unless you find taking cars apart relaxing, like me\n\nI know there are more cons than pros, but the weight of the pros is higher than the cons.

Massive improvements to graphics, tons more vehicle parts to work with, and a whole new approach to issuing missions makes this a major overhaul to what was already a pretty good game. Despite some worries about hardware, I've been running the game at 2560 x 1600 with maxed out settings and see a solid 60fps.\n\nThe idea of having jobs issued by telephone, with the ability to pick and choose your workload, really works well for me. My son and I picked out a couple of interesting looking jobs, loaded them up on the lifts and started plugging away at the pile of problems. The whole process felt very smooth and intuitive. A nicely structured tutorial at the start (very simple, just a few text popups and some easy initial missions) helped greatly.\n\nIt's still not as easy as I'd like to navigate around the inside of the vehicle, but since the real thing is even harder I can't complain.\n\nThese guys have put out a great game, and they even managed to do it on-schedule. If they hit their published targets for DLC I'll be even more impressed.\n\nRight now their software is massively underpriced in the Steam store, there is no way this game should be priced so low, so jump onto it asap.","April 24, 2015","true","25.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

(if only!)\n\nThere is a steep learning curve, heck, my first job was an engine block replacement! Which meant everything had top be undone, gearbox out, clutch & flywheel out, both manifolds.

(little oversight by the devs there! - but nothing major)\n\nI love the way you can take multiple jobs, but that could lead to confusion if you don't check the job sheet.\n\nI also like the fact that as jobs go on, you have to check & diagnose the faults yourself. Something to look forward to and be a little challenge.\n\nThis game, I feel, will just eat away hours, and it's intended not to be stressful, but really a chill out game, like ETS2 or similar.\n\nAll in told, if you like the idea of messing about with cars but don't want to get your hands oily, then this is ideal.","April 26, 2015","true","10.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","2"

It's time to get busy!\n\nMost of the initial starting jobs are simple tasks with parts lists or problem information attached. Like replacing filters, brake pads, Suspension Bushes, wheels and oil.\n\nMoving up to the more advanced areas like replacing Turbochargers, Pistons, Muffler Bearings, Crankshafts, Bottles of Boost and Timing Gear.\n\nThe workshop is fitted with 2 Hoists and a central area, giving you the room to work on a couple of cars at the same time. This also allows access to other areas of the car as there is only so much you are able to do from the top of the engine bay.\n\nRepairing Cars are the main focus of making money, but you can also sell the old parts that were replaced for a little extra money.\n\nOnce progressed far enough in the game, you have the ability to go to market and buy cars for your own overhauls and sell them at auction. A fantastic distraction on the side of increasingly difficult fault finding and part replacement.\n\nIf you have ever been interested in cars, mechanics or even wonder how they all fit together this is a fantastic sim to get you into and learning all about the ins and outs of engines and suspension.\n\nAnd Maybe, Just Maybe, you might also realise that a few parts I mentioned don't really exist.","May 3, 2015","true","9.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

It sports better graphics, a slicker interface, improved controls, a deeper career mode, and a better gameplay experience over 2014. In order to unlock additional content (i.e. slicker vehicles, shop improvements, and abilities) you'll have to turn the wrenches a lot longer in order to gain XP. This isn’t entirely a bad thing, as I feel it keeps you coming back for more. The jobs seem to be more varied in both, substance and tasks in order to get you through. However, you’ll see a lot of the same types of vehicles, early on, just in different colors. Despite that, I honestly can’t find much more to complain about.

This is a very refreshing game, since it's the only one of it's kind that I know and it's very casual. For me, it's also a nice way to learn a bit more about the anatomy of cars  on top of the knowledge that I already have (and the fact that the game is translated to my native language also helps a lot, since I'm not too familiar with the English names for various parts). That's probably the downside, you'll need some basic car mechanics knowledge to get going. The tutorial isn't really all that explanatory, so if you're not familiar with the basics, it could take you quite some time to figure out what parts you actually need to replace and that can be frustrating.\n\nBut, if you have some basic knowledge you should be fine. You can pretty much pull apart anything until there's just a skeleton standing. That's what makes the game so cool, there are no limits in what you can and cannot do. There are no set time limits for repairs, so if you feel like completely disecting a car, go ahead and do it!\n\nThe XP points system keeps the game challenging. You need to unlock certain features to make your life as a mechanic easier like an OBD scanner to read the on board computer for any errors or better tools to be able to take out screws more quickly. The more XP you get, the more challenging jobs you can accept. And with more XP also come sweeter cars, since when you've built up a name for yourself, people with luxury cars also start finding their way to your garage.","January 7","true","46.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Although even as a newbie to cars, the game helps you a lot, and in the meantime you'll learn a lot about how cars work\n- There is test driving of vehicles but no "racing" or multiplayer\n- The most fun is purchasing vehicles at auctions (fixer-uppers) and restoring them for profitable resale.  Take the extra used parts you gathered from these vehicles and repair customer old beaters for almost no cost to you (also very profitable)\n\nThere is some degree of financial management / budgeting aspect in the game but it's minor.

I'm happy to say this years version is just so much better. I've been playing for hours now (ignore the low hours played stat - Steam was down earlier so I played in offline mode) and it's a very entertaining game. Improvements such as the multiple bays, car auctions, upgrade paths - among many others - just make it a more complete game and I am very happy that I backed it on Kickstarter from the start.\n\nI'm only around 15 jobs in and the difficulty has been going up steadily in terms of type of repairs that I'm now being tasked with but - and this is a big but (ahem) - you're left to play the game at your own pace which is perfectly suited for this type of game. I'm having a blast playing this and can't wait to see the later parts of the game once I unlock them.\n\nFor the price of £14.99 this game is a steal if you have any kind of interest at all in the basic workings of motor vehicles but I wouldn't expect to become a fully-fledged mechanic after putting a few hours into this. Although, having said that,  it's very likely your basic car knowledge of what parts go where will improve dramatically. I used to work in the automotive industry but in the administration side so this game appealed to me for that reason as well.\n\nAs a comparison the nearest thing I can compare CM2015 to is the ancient Gearhead Garage that Snap-on bought out many, many years ago that was a fun, albeit simple, game repairing and doing up cars to flip at auction and make money. I'm hoping this game further in will vastly improve on that little gem from way back.\n\nHighly recommended.

I also have really enjoyed mechanic simulators in the past, Street Rod was a staple of my childhood.\n\nSecondly, If you're *really* into car mechanic simulation, buy this, when its on sale. This is better than Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, but still not a great game.\n\nIf I had to use one word to describe this game, it would be Tedious.\n\nIt takes a very, very long time to unlock the more enjoyable parts of the game (9000xp for the garage, are you kidding me??) You'll find yourself repeating the same monotonous, mind numbing jobs to build your xp before you can unlock things like the "test track" and the Garage, where you can store your own cars bought at auction. Speaking of which, the XP system leaves much to be desired and appears to have been thought up in 5 seconds with no play testing whatsoever. Remove a part? +1 XP. Install a part? +1 XP. Finish a job? 100XP. That's pretty much it. I guess you could get 9000XP by removing and installing the same spark plug 4500 times. Replacing a piston should generate orders of magnitude more xp than replacing an oil filter.\n\nYou select the job you wish to take by clicking on your desk phone. It lists 4 jobs, 2 of which always require vastly more XP than you have.\n\nThe interface can be painful to operate - Press I to open inventory.. but press Escape to close it? How about the parts catalog, which is listed in alphabetical order and does not have nearly enough subcategories. An alphabetical list for engine parts with photos is ridiculous.\n\nThe repair bench is a button press. That's it. Remove part, attempt to repair, you'll either make it better or make it worse. Boring mechanic.\n\nThere are definitely lots of parts in the engines, which is great, but the selection of which parts are 'wrenchable' and which are not seems completely arbitrary. Why are there 4 clips holding the airbox together, and like 4 bolts to the entire gearbox? Also please don't force the player to lift and drop the car a bunch of times to work on the engine... some parts are removable from the top, some from the bottom. Why can't I just remove the engine and put it on a test stand?\n\nI realize this review is a bit discombobulated, but then again so is this game. It just seems like a lot of values were randomly selected, and not much thought was put into vital gameplay mechanics and interface design.\n\n5/10.\n\nBetter games in this genre from years past:\n\n* Street Rod 1 / 2\n* Redline Legal Street Racing\n* Gearhead Garage","September 29, 2015","false","9.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

That is a good thing.\n\nWill you learn how to repair a real car? No. But it will give you a rough approximation of where certain parts are located in a car and a general idea of what they could look like. It's essentially a puzzle game. You are told the car has a noise in the engine, you need to find and repair the specific part. As you play you gain access to more testing tools so you can check the current durability of items without needing to fully disassemble the vehicle.\n\nBut let's face it, eventually you will fully disassemble a vehicle for the fun of it, because you can.","May 10, 2015","true","29.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The vehicles are varied, but there isn't much variance in the engines, suspensions, or braking systems.  There are what I would call "factual errors"; i.e., cars apparently built in the 60s or even 50s having front disc brakes and electric fuel pumps located in the fuel tank.  A nice addition would be the inclusion of a "Hard" mode, where the player must use a specific bolt pattern to remove and replace cylinder heads, remove leftover gasket material, and deal with fluids like coolant and oil when changing timing chains.  7/10","November 27, 2015","true","22.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Earn XP by completing repair jobs on vehicles, and unlock different cars, perks (more diagonstic tools, faster unbolting) and more complex jobs.\n\nThere's not a lot to this game and it doesn't demand much of your attention once you've learned the basics, although it's nicely animated and does a good job at showing the very basics of car anatomy. You probably won't learn more than that from playing it, though.

You will learn some basic names and functions that are pretty basic so I wouldn't really call it much of a sim. It doesn't take long to reach the maximum level and money isn't a real obstacle once you can afford to buy, repair/upgrade, and sell your first vehicle.\n\nWhere this game becomes a gem though is how relaxing it is. It has good music and decent graphics that you don't get tired of looking at. Everything is straight forward and not hard to figure out. More and more options and car varieties come out to keep you entertained. Where the game is now (May 15, 2016) is pretty great. You have a drag strip (super cars struggle a bit here) and a Dyno setup to help "tune" your car to maximum performance. You have a small but nice variety of cosmetic options to make your car more valuable and unique. This plus all of the original features gives you a game you can sink a couple of hours into here and there to build up your personal collection and your bank account.\n\nAll in all, I would give this an 8/10 atm. The game is great, don't get me wrong. Hardly any bugs and plenty of fun. But it could always use more. More cosmetics, more cars, garage expansions, and possibly some sort of multiplayer whether that be in the form of racing or a collection showcase. Either way it is definitely worth the money, and getting all of the DLC when it goes on sale is a must!","May 15","true","102.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you ever played a game called "Gearhead Garage" and you're hoping this is something like it, it's that and then some.\n\nI also contacted the developer on twitter and they stated they're interested in adding more tracks to the game for driving your cars on, as well as race modes like drag racing through DLC. If they keep to that promise, this game will have no issues selling tons of copies.\n\nHopefully for 2016 they bring in co-op and even more content, considering you can't really work on 3 cars at once, it would help a lot.","June 24, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

More often than not, the classification of "Simulator" is abused and misused by developers hoping to cash in on a weak Genre with very few good games. I am very pleased to say there's actually a game in here!\n\nThis does not play like an early access game. It feel more like a finished game they keep adding stuff to, and I personally love it. However would I title it a "Simulator"? That's a bit of a stretch. But overall, it's still a nice game.\n\nI have very few complaints about the game, mostly with some of the odd steps you must take to complete a job, like completly removing the exhaust manifold to remove the front exhaust pipe for example or your HAVE to remove the Starter from the top, not the bottom (on some cars). Also the total lack of gaskets in the game is perplexing, this is a simulator - where are the gaskets? But overall I would recommend this game to car lovers, mechanics, and simulator players. There's game to be had here!!\n\nThings I would like to see added before final release:\nAbility to fix body parts\nAir wrench upgrade option.\nGaskets\nOption on/off for auto mouse movement (game moves mouse at certain stages and get confusing)\nCustomization items for car parts - UPDATE - Feature added to game but as a freaking pre-release DLC, thanks for showing your love for your supporters (sarcasm). It's a sad sad day when Alphas get Alpha DLCs.\nPickups (there are no pickups in game)\nTire options","May 3, 2015","true","28.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have some experience in auto repair and other misc. hardware as I'm a maintenance mechanic for the USPS.  Since I'm no expert in repairing cars and I like to learn, I enjoy this game and I've learned quite a bit from the repair jobs I've done so far.\n\nAt the time of this review I'm only a few hours into it but already I notice some things I would like to see added for extra realism.  For example, hoses (air, radiator and others) battery cables and other major wires, various fluids like washer, brake, transmission etc. and gaskets in the engine would be a nice touch.\n\nSomething else that would help with the immersion would be to have different size wrenches and sockets with ratchets to use on different size bolts and nuts.\n\nI think it's important to have a lot of different parts for the different cars as most cars take different parts in real life; at least for the larger more important parts.  That would be nice to have to look up the make/model in the computer to get the right part. :)  Honestly I don't think it wouldn't be that hard to add that if only they added part numbers to the car part inventory.  Finally I would like to see options of stock, upgraded and high performance parts so you can upgrade the cars you buy.  Overall though the game has potential to take many hours of fun and learning.

And you can't ever complete this one, because jobs are unlimited and randomly generated. This game is very addictive, and it feels a lot like euro truck simulator 2 but with fixing cars instead of delivering cargo. This is not one of those crappy simulators you usually see on steam, this is amazing like euro truck simulator 2. Also, you can modify the colors of your workshop, buy attachments like a paint shop, a test area and a parking garage where you can store your car collection. You gain exp from working on cars, and with it, you unlock more cars with more problems to work on, more attachments to buy for your workshop, and you get upgrade points to upgrade your character, and to get tools to help you identify problems with cars. There's a lot more cars in this one than in 2014, and they are much more detailed with much more parts. This time you can work on the cooling system, open up the engine block and replace pistons or the crankshaft and the crankshaft bearings and everything. This game has insane amounts of detail, and the graphics and textures are mind blowing. The reflections are also really nice. The game also runs really smooth, and you don't even need the recommended graphics card if you want to run the game on Ultra graphics settings. I run it on Ultra very smoothly with my GTX 560 TI 2GB Phantom graphics card, so yeah. I honestly have never seen such gorgeous textures and reflections in a game before.  Well, Gta V has nice reflections, but still, this game is gorgeous too. In this game you can not only work on the parts of your car, but also on the panels, like doors, fenders, bumpers, lights, etc. Also, this game has tons of free DLC coming out, and they look like they will be amazing! The game's soundtrack is pretty cool too, even though I'm not really a fan of dubstep, I enjoy the game's dubstep soundtrack. It gets repetitive after a while though, because there's not a lot of songs in the game. I would like it a lot if they add more songs, and perhaps also a custom radio thing where you use your own music for the game's playlist. At the moment when I feel like using my own music, I turn off the game's soundtrack in the options menu, and run my playlist in the background, but I think it would be awesome if they added an in-game feature to use your own music, so you don't have to turn off music in the options each time you want to listen to something else. This game is also well worth the $20, and I highly recommend you buy it!","May 5, 2015","true","24.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Paint your cars in the Paint Shop. Test your car faster on the Diagnostic Test. I'd recommend this game to you.

I even managed to replace my car's air intake and air filter by myself =D .\n\nBasically you have to fix your customers' car, stripping down the car until you find what the problem is. You can use a number of tools to ascertain which parts are faulty or you can drive the car down a test track. You will have to purchase or attempt to fix the part by yourself, replace it and build it up again. You can also buy used vehicles and restore it, but it gets kinda pointless since there's nothing to do with it apart from photographing it and selling it.\n\nIt's very casual and gets repetitive fast but still very fun to play.

Less detail in some areas, oil draining for example, the margin for where the drain pan is small, make that bigger. The way you disassemble and reassemble, you should be able to take off multiple parts at one time. A parts cupboard or something similar would be good to store repaired and used parts rather than have all parts mixed in together. A colour palette for the paint shop rather than a slider for hue etc It takes ages to collect XP. More toolbox upgrades. Timing and carb tune up options. Tyre options. A dyno tuner as well maybe. Trade cars with friends maybe, or race them. Theres so much more that can be done with this game.

Now if only they could bring us back to that feeling,the auction mode,the fun it gave us.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has already done just that for me.I have only played for about 2 hours and what took about 5 minutes to fix a engine repair now can take upto 15 minutes becuase of the more realistic detail.I haven't got to the auction section yet because I haven't leveled up enough yet.Yep,you have xp for your mechanic to level up and unlock different tools and perks for your mechanic and it feels very balanced in the way that you have actually earned it.I would gladly pay more than $20 for this game since thre is already 5 dlcs planned and modding ability.This game is a must buy if you liked CMS 2014 or a Gearhead Garage fan,you don't want to miss this game:)","April 23, 2015","true","16.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

HUGE grind at the start for XP to unlock the test path, paint booth and parking lots (plus the cash needed for each) which for me got old pretty fast.\n\nOnce you open up the locked areas your next goal is to buy junkers from the auction block, repair/restore the vehicle to 100% and turn a decent profit or put it in your personal collection.

Yep it has an auction room, garage and a test track (although I dont like the test track at all). You can paint your car any colour you want (doesnt seem to be any decals to apply though). On the whole a great game when you want to take a rusted heap of metal for a couple of thousand and turn it into a great profit. It can be a bit tediuos at first as you can only repair customer veichles. Once you get your parking though and a little capital... oh yeah.

Briliant, Absolutely superb graphics to the last detail. 5star\n\nNext, gameplay. Gameplay its similar to CMS2014 but improved a lot ( specially camera movements ) everything its a lot easier. 5star\n\nNext, parts. Car has A LOT MORE parts specially engine is absolutely design to the the last screw. Unlike in CMS2014 you can take whole engine apart, so you looking at more than 200+ parts per car. but I will try to take car apart and confirm this*. 5star\n\nThe garage and whole enviroment looks so real it will make you speechless. 5star\n\nYou can buy very cheap cars on auction and repair them put them together and sell them making lots of profit.\n\nAnd off course you can upgrade you garage tools and to get more cars in at once.\n\nDoes game have any cons/something what needs improving? So far I haven't find anything bad ;) sorry my fault, I found 1 word in tutorial what supposed to be "by" and it was "my" so only this so far\n\nFinal verdict? 5 star game so very good price with absolute superb graphics and gameplay with lots and lots parts and you can use to learn bit about cars and engine ( kind of ) gives you idea what is where and roughly how to repair it :D\n\nI hope this is good enough to change your mind and you buy a game and enjoy it ;)\n\nGood luck and have fun","April 24, 2015","true","36.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

During the beginning it has cars with list of exactly whats broken, which is simple as deconstructing parts to find broken ones.  You then replace them with parts you buy instantly on the shops computer.  You later can update to tablet to buy parts right under car(saves time)\n\nYou eventually you get good enough that game will no long hold your hand to what is wrong with the car.  There is car test park, with driving  stages to test certain parts of car(I personally never used it).\n\nYou eventually rack up experience and money to buy cars at the auction house, where you buy bombed out vechicles, often missing body parts.  This is coolest part and you can eventually fill your garage with cool cars with custom colors.  My goal filling my garage with all the mmoore interesting cars.\n\nPRO's\nPretty fun after you get tons of experience\nOk graphics(good but  not great)\nLots of different cars\nAuction House\nReally teaches you about cars!!!\nSomewhat detailing of major car systems\nYou decide what cars to fix on the phone\nFuture player mods and DLC\nOnly $20!\n\n\nCON's\nExperience points take way to long too rack up\nMay not be super detailed depiction of car(no ac compressors,  no brake lines or bleeding, etc.)\nDoesnt tell you everything important(that you can move a oil collection tank under car to avoid $100 cleaning fee or need certain tools for automated testing for parts.\nLimited to no customization of cars(at very least make certain wheels interchangable, metallic and matte paint, striping.\nNo free range walking of car garage(why not!)\nNo drag strip! ;)\n\n....Biggest Gripes\nI used a cheat program to get experience and even money.  I think game should have difficulty modes, like easy where experience points are gained way faster, a lot more starting money, maybe $10000 emergency loan.  You take the fun out of the game for certain players, forcing some players to advance at such a low pace leads to cheating ;).

I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves sim games, mechanically inclined or not. You do not have to know anything about cars to play it. It may even teach you something. It kind of generalizes most consumer cars into a few categories of different engines and running gear. The parts being exchangeable between cars is nice it makes you worry less about finding the right part and more about working on the car. Fun fun fun.

As a simulator it’s exceptionally well done, capturing many of the aspects of car repair whilst not being as unforgiving as its real world counterpart is. However some of the more interesting parts of the game are hidden behind the levelling system which is too basic and takes far too long to get anywhere meaningful making it very easy to put the game down and forget about it. I enjoyed my time with Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 however if you don’t have an interest in cars or simulator type games then you probably wouldn’t find much more to love in it.\n\nRead my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/05/11/car-mechanic-simulator-2015-well-theres-your-problem/","May 10, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can really see that this was a project that meant a lot to the devs by how actively it's supported and how amazing it was right out of the door.\n\nThere is a wide variety of cars, and more being added all the time. The ability to mix things up and restore cars instead of just repairing other peoples cars is lots of fun. You can finally full disassemble engines and just about every other component on the vehicle. The upgrade path may be limited, but the upgrades are worthwhile. The game looks great and runs smooth. If you had high hopes for Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 but were a little disappointed, please try this game, there's no doubt you will be happy with how awesome it is to rebuild classic muscle cars, modern sports cars, compacts, and just about everything else as well as taking on the ever changing challenge of vehicle repairs.","May 14, 2015","true","35.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first it was a little intimidating working on my first few orders but it starts you off with simple things like replacing Fuel, Air, and Oil filters, and other simple tasks. Then you begin to work with different vehicles and much more complicated issues where you will need to competely break down the powertrain.\n\nOf course it's much more simple and MUCH faster than in real life, but it's been a lot of fun so far. Especially with the unlockable upgrades such as unlocking a Paint room, and getting more tools for diagnosising problems, and being able to repair parts efficently without ordering new ones.\n\nI'm still pretty new to the game with a few hours of gameplay, but I think it's a lot of fun.

Now, the only part(s) I'm disappointed about, is the lack of vehicle modifications that can be performed. Unlike real life, you can't turbocharge, supercharge, procharge any of the vehicles in this game. Another part I'm not so pleased with about this simulation, is there are no pickup trucks whatsoever. I hope that in the near future there will be DLC containing pickup trucks, vans, and other miscilaneous vehicles. One other Disappointment I have is the amount of driving, or lack of driving ability there is. It would have been nice to have freerome, a race track other than the Factory Test Track, and a Dyno in the Garage.

Well, that's actually not true. As a "simulation" of being a car mechanic, it's terrible: cars and their respective parts are massively simplified from reality, and the entire process of fixing a car is also quite simple and extremely fast. Most "simulators" are guilty of this as well, so it's far from a unique issue. BUT, as a puzzle game involving cars, it's lovely. In short, think of this as a normal game and not as a simulator.\n\nThe obvious comparison is to Car Mechamic Simulator 2014, and 2015 is a substantial improvement. I didn't notice any bugs in either game and performance seems to have improved a bit too but I have no hard evidence to support that. The controls are, IMO, the biggest improvement. I thought they were fine in 2014 but 2015 is much more intuitive and really highlights the flaws with 2014; I'm not sure how to get more specific, just that 2014 now controls a bit "awkward" to me. Graphics are not cutting edge but do look very nice, so no complaints there. I love the ability to restore cars, I get quite a lot of satisfaction from it, for some reason. The basic gameplay mechanic is the same between both games: removing/replacing bolts and removing/replacing parts. Simple in concept, but surprisingly fun and also quite relaxing in a way. If you played 2014 and enjoyed that, then you'll love 2015.\n\nNow for the minuses. The camera is a bit weird. It's far from the worst I've dealt with but it's not great either. It can be a bit tricky to aim on certain parts, especially the driveshaft; I'd say it's solidly midpack overall. While I generally think the soundtrack is quite good, it could be more varied and if you don't like EDM, then you'll hate it. The store front for buying new parts is just a massive list of all the parts, with no way to sort between different ones; a method to search through them would be great. At least you can sort parts in your inventory by arrival and condition, as well as search by name for them. Draining oil took a coupe of tries to do properly because I couldn't aim the drain under the lift and the plug is small, but that's likely just operator error (read: entriely my own fault.) Load times are also quite long. They aren't unbearable but can take several minutes to load at worst (when trying to load the Parking section and you have numerous cars stored); hopefully this gets fixed in future updates. All this are fairly nitpicky and I can easily look past them. No game is flawless, afterall.\n\nOverall, if the idea of working on a virtual car sound appealing, give this game a try. If you don't like it (and you'll find out pretty quickly if this is for you or not), thank God that Steam refunds are a thing. Like Farming Simulator 2015, this is a simulation game that doesn't suck and offers some nice gameplay...even if it truly isn't a simulator.","July 20, 2015","true","51.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

NOTHING... I started playing this game out of curiosity and now I'm learning about all the parts. Graphics are OK, maybe a little outdated but not that much. UI is simple and helps you a lot if you know nothing about cars. It's fun. I understand the complexity but it would be great if the devs updated the base game and DLCs with more parts, aftermarket and/or even a mode to tune your own car. I don't know if more cars are unlocked with more XP or if what the game shows at the beginning is all there is. A couple more cars wouldn't hurt, still, like I said, understand the complexity of adding a car. I don't regret buying it. It's not an action or racing game. It's a game for when you want to think a little and if you like to tinker with stuff. Highly recommended!","January 5","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The names of the individual car parts are accurate.\nWhilst playing through the game you will learn teh very basics of the car parts, what they do and how they work.\nThe overall game is great for people new to cars who want to learn and play at the same time.\nWith enough time playing the game I would probably feel comfortable enough changing the brake pads on a car and possibly adding new oil.\n\nOne major problem I have with the game is the loading time. If I have two cars in the garage and load up the it will take a good minute to load the game, then the first car and then finally the second car.\nWhen taking jobs, loading in the cars also takes quite some time.\nIt can become quite boring waiting for the cars to load and it's the one thing making me want to close the game down and play EuroTruck Simulator 2 which quicker loading screens.","June 14, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game taught me a ton about under the hood andbody work. Now I don't feel like such an idiot when the guys and girls I know lift the hood and start their car talk. that added with the fact that its simple and at times fast to work through a car, and the variety that comes with DLC make for an interesting and informitive game. No, you might not be able to build a car from the shell after playing this, but you will certainly feel like you can, and that's something a lot of games wont do. It's awesome and unique and I don't see myself getting tired of it any time soon.

At first it was a little intimidating working on my first few orders but it starts you off with simple things like replacing Fuel, Air, and Oil filters, and other simple tasks. Then you begin to work with different vehicles and much more complicated issues where you will need to competely break down the powertrain.\n\nOf course it's much more simple and MUCH faster than in real life, but it's been a lot of fun so far. Especially with the unlockable upgrades such as unlocking a Paint room, and getting more tools for diagnosising problems, and being able to repair parts efficently without ordering new ones.\n\nI'm still pretty new to the game with a few hours of gameplay, but I think it's a lot of fun.

Now, the only part(s) I'm disappointed about, is the lack of vehicle modifications that can be performed. Unlike real life, you can't turbocharge, supercharge, procharge any of the vehicles in this game. Another part I'm not so pleased with about this simulation, is there are no pickup trucks whatsoever. I hope that in the near future there will be DLC containing pickup trucks, vans, and other miscilaneous vehicles. One other Disappointment I have is the amount of driving, or lack of driving ability there is. It would have been nice to have freerome, a race track other than the Factory Test Track, and a Dyno in the Garage.

Well, that's actually not true. As a "simulation" of being a car mechanic, it's terrible: cars and their respective parts are massively simplified from reality, and the entire process of fixing a car is also quite simple and extremely fast. Most "simulators" are guilty of this as well, so it's far from a unique issue. BUT, as a puzzle game involving cars, it's lovely. In short, think of this as a normal game and not as a simulator.\n\nThe obvious comparison is to Car Mechamic Simulator 2014, and 2015 is a substantial improvement. I didn't notice any bugs in either game and performance seems to have improved a bit too but I have no hard evidence to support that. The controls are, IMO, the biggest improvement. I thought they were fine in 2014 but 2015 is much more intuitive and really highlights the flaws with 2014; I'm not sure how to get more specific, just that 2014 now controls a bit "awkward" to me. Graphics are not cutting edge but do look very nice, so no complaints there. I love the ability to restore cars, I get quite a lot of satisfaction from it, for some reason. The basic gameplay mechanic is the same between both games: removing/replacing bolts and removing/replacing parts. Simple in concept, but surprisingly fun and also quite relaxing in a way. If you played 2014 and enjoyed that, then you'll love 2015.\n\nNow for the minuses. The camera is a bit weird. It's far from the worst I've dealt with but it's not great either. It can be a bit tricky to aim on certain parts, especially the driveshaft; I'd say it's solidly midpack overall. While I generally think the soundtrack is quite good, it could be more varied and if you don't like EDM, then you'll hate it. The store front for buying new parts is just a massive list of all the parts, with no way to sort between different ones; a method to search through them would be great. At least you can sort parts in your inventory by arrival and condition, as well as search by name for them. Draining oil took a coupe of tries to do properly because I couldn't aim the drain under the lift and the plug is small, but that's likely just operator error (read: entriely my own fault.) Load times are also quite long. They aren't unbearable but can take several minutes to load at worst (when trying to load the Parking section and you have numerous cars stored); hopefully this gets fixed in future updates. All this are fairly nitpicky and I can easily look past them. No game is flawless, afterall.\n\nOverall, if the idea of working on a virtual car sound appealing, give this game a try. If you don't like it (and you'll find out pretty quickly if this is for you or not), thank God that Steam refunds are a thing. Like Farming Simulator 2015, this is a simulation game that doesn't suck and offers some nice gameplay...even if it truly isn't a simulator.","July 20, 2015","true","51.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes a short bit to get used to how it works and what issues go to which part of the car. If you're very car savy then this will be a walk in the park for you and it'll just serve as a fun simulation to work on some sweet rides. Others, like me, who just know how to change the oil in our cars...if that, will actually find this educational as well as fun. A game like this could have easily been too complicated for people to enjoy, but they hit it right on the button. The graphics are nothing to complain about either!\n\nThe only complaint I have is that after awhile you start to see that a lot of the jobs are quite repetitve. It would be nice to have more variety of issues to solve with the cars. Thats pretty much it.\n\n9/10 Great game","July 24, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It won't teach you to be a mechanic - but you will tinker with the basic components of how a car works.\n\nIn the game you will have to find and replace damaged parts, and as you become proficient at this you will have to start diagnosing whats broken. You can also try repairing parts to save dough. To make life easier, you will buy a variety of tools to test the car to find what's wrong, to make repairing go faster, etc.\n\nThis game is a huge jump from the last version - and so if you like car games you should buy this for two reasons: a) it's a good game and b) the developers are really showing their skill and passion for this series; so they really deserve some support.\n\n+ decent graphics\n+ innovative gameplay\n+ excellent improvement over the last version\n+ interesting DLCs at fairly reasonable prices\n\n- sometimes confusing upgrade system\n- could use more cars\n- body work not has comphrehensive as engine and undercarriage systems\n\ntl;dr; if you have even a passing interest in cars, repairing them, etc - this is a great game.","July 4, 2015","true","47.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cars were never an interest to me, and if something is wrong with my car, I always take it to someone to fix- never would I do it myself. Not even an oil change.\n\nThat introduction aside, I LOVE this game. Even without that real-world interest level, this game is polished, sharp, and always has you eyeing goals in the future without holding your hand.  How rewarding it was when I was first repairing some more difficult issues, and without knowing where some parts were located, stripped down the entire engine of a car looking for those parts only to have to reassemble the whole thing- and get it right! It really is a great balance between simulating the work of a mechanic and gamifying it so that it's not quite so world-dreary and labor intensive.\n\nI am quickly banking cash and gaining experience with excitement, as soon in game I'll be able to buy a beat-up car at auction and fix it up to resell for huge profit as a side project in my garage.\n\nIf you don't know cars, but enjoy simulations, progress, and have a bit of a mechanical-puzzle oriented mind, this is a very, very well done game and I highly recommend it. I may not be a mechanic after this, but at least my eyes won't cross in ignorance when someone says "catalytic converter" to me at the garage.\n\nSide note: I love the music in this game too. A great mix for working away at the cars in game.","April 25, 2015","true","21.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The amount of destructable parts you have is much better than before.  I like that you can now restore cars and work on their bodywork too.  The possibility of DLC should keep the game fresh with new challenges and vehicles unlike 2014 where once you have taken apart a v6 that was really it, game mastered time to move on.  I would recommend this game to people who are curious to see how cars fit together (all be it in a very simplified fashion).   However there are some drawbacks which I hope they iron out soon.\n\n1.  The music is annoying and repetitive, please add more stations and the ability to play my mp3s.\n2.  Colouring things rusty to indicate their condition really gives the game away.  I rarely need to use diagnostic equipement or test drives to isolate the problem.  Also, please stop giving me a list of things I need to replace, this compounds the issue. The whole point of the game to test my diagnostic skills and therefore the xp I get at the end of each job.\n3.   Using xp to unlock the ad-ons to your workshop like parking, paint booth and test path is stupid.  These should only be based on cash.  The whole xp to unlock thing puts the new car restoration part of game out of reach until the very end (9000xp = 100+ jobs) as you need to unlock the garage parking in order to visit the auctions.  I want to be able to buy a car and work on it slowely as money, skill and ad-ons allow.\n4.  Turning down jobs/doing a poor doesn't have consequences (except some xp)?!? are you kidding me? Customer rep needs to play a greater part.  As I recall there were repeat customers in CM2014 if my memory serves me correctly.\n5.  Tutorial needs to be bigger.  This is the part of the game where you give me a list of things that are wrong.  Also, put it outside the campaign.  If people are still struggling to to find things in the campaign perhaps introduce Workshop manuals that can be bought via the PC or Tablet???\n\nWell thats enough of the negatives, all in all I still enjoy the game and for only $20 I really think you cant go wrong.  It is different and thats why I like it.  I think the community and the developers will inmprove this game as times goes on.  Get on it.\n\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","45.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The amount of destructable parts you have is much better than before.  I like that you can now restore cars and work on their bodywork too.  The possibility of DLC should keep the game fresh with new challenges and vehicles unlike 2014 where once you have taken apart a v6 that was really it, game mastered time to move on.  I would recommend this game to people who are curious to see how cars fit together (all be it in a very simplified fashion).   However there are some drawbacks which I hope they iron out soon.\n\n1.  The music is annoying and repetitive, please add more stations and the ability to play my mp3s.\n2.  Colouring things rusty to indicate their condition really gives the game away.  I rarely need to use diagnostic equipement or test drives to isolate the problem.  Also, please stop giving me a list of things I need to replace, this compounds the issue. The whole point of the game to test my diagnostic skills and therefore the xp I get at the end of each job.\n3.   Using xp to unlock the ad-ons to your workshop like parking, paint booth and test path is stupid.  These should only be based on cash.  The whole xp to unlock thing puts the new car restoration part of game out of reach until the very end (9000xp = 100+ jobs) as you need to unlock the garage parking in order to visit the auctions.  I want to be able to buy a car and work on it slowely as money, skill and ad-ons allow.\n4.  Turning down jobs/doing a poor doesn't have consequences (except some xp)?!? are you kidding me? Customer rep needs to play a greater part.  As I recall there were repeat customers in CM2014 if my memory serves me correctly.\n5.  Tutorial needs to be bigger.  This is the part of the game where you give me a list of things that are wrong.  Also, put it outside the campaign.  If people are still struggling to to find things in the campaign perhaps introduce Workshop manuals that can be bought via the PC or Tablet???\n\nWell thats enough of the negatives, all in all I still enjoy the game and for only $20 I really think you cant go wrong.  It is different and thats why I like it.  I think the community and the developers will inmprove this game as times goes on.  Get on it.\n\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","45.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a good game!. Sometime a job will come along in the game and your be taking a lot of the car apart just to find that one faulty part. A basic knowlegde of cars is needed but you will learn fairly quickly about how to take the parts on and off and in what order.  Everything in the game is very decent or better, the sound. the graphics, the gameplay and so far i haven't come across any bugs. There's quite a few extra 'help' in the game like the OBD scanner or a test brake/suspension place in your garage but they cost one experience upgrade which is 1,000 XP in the game, It takes quiet a while to level up, so there's no way your get everything without some hours put in. My biggest problem with the game is the repairs list. You can only see what you need to replace on a list while near the car, once you go to the computer to buy new parts that list is gone. It can be very annoying traveling back and forth to the car to see what you need or you have forgotten. I do know once you unlock repair the items on a bench yourself, you won't need the list as much but i feel the repair list should always be available by pressing O, no matter where you are.

They have different vehicles but more of them and somewhat more detail such as body panels, radiators and fans etc that sort of thing. I have enjoyed playing it though imo there doesn't seem to be much of a challenge financially as it's pretty much a continuous upward climb towards riches. At 9000 xp (7ish hrs for me) you unlock the abillity to buy cars in various conditions and fix them up which is fairly rewarding and has greater financial risk/reward if you don't manage your funds.\n\nAll in all I wish the game was more detailed (ex. piston heads don't require removing bolts from underneath to remove, many bolted parts are simplified, no fasteners on body parts, only fluid you deal with is oil, so no coolant, trans, gas, wiper fluids etc all omitted, no hoses, no tuning, no interior parts, no glass repair etc. However it is still a fun game, and somewhat educational though simplified.\n\nTLDR; If you are interested in car mechanics you'll like this game, it isn't ultra detailed but it has enough to be fun and challenging at times.

The idea that you canrebuild a car with a ratchet and socket is unrealistic, and I would like it if they added usable hand and power tools in the future. First and foremost in my mind should be a torque wrench, where you have to look up torque specs and sequence (could be done using the computer?) and having to set the torque value on the wrench and torque in sequence. welders and paint guns could also be neat to use when doing body work or painting.

It draws you in and you just kind of lose yourself in playing around with the cars, removing parts, seeing what connects to what and how and then fixing everything and putting it all back together again.  It's very fun but also very relaxing.  It's kind of like when you're a little kid and want to take apart your toys or the toaster or a radio but here you don't have to worry about mom or dad smacking you when you can't put it back together again.  Not sure how realistic the game is in terms of learning how cars actually work but it's really fun and you can easily lose an hour playing it before you realize.

After a while I got annoyed with some minor things:\n\nThe loading times in this game are absolutely terrible, as others have already mentioned.\nThe sound effects get old pretty quick (sounds like breaking glass every time you remove a bolt or part), can be fixed by turning your sound off but I'd rather have more variety.\nThe jobs get repetitive, but this happens in real life too (90% of the jobs I received were brake and timing related)\nThe automatic mouse centering is pretty annoying every time you open a menu\nIt lacks a lot of realistic parts to be a simulator (transmission gears, more body options, missing almost every electronic part besides the ignition and battery, torque specs, etc) but I suppose someone could fix this with a mod or something.\nNo Steam achievements (could be some for fully restoring a car, completing certain number of jobs etc)\nEverything "damaged" is rusted so it's pretty obvious to find the problems without running any diagnostics\n\nI didn't do much with the 1/4 mile strip since each time I went there it was terrible on keyboard and the loading times just weren't worth it. The only thing I ever left the garage for was the auctions and even those just ticked me off. Who would want to pay $50,000 for a rusted piece of garbage that they're only going to get $70,000 after fully restoring it? They should make the bidding system a bit more realistic too..\n\nOther than that I liked the game, the DLC make it much more enjoyable once you run out of things to do.","May 30","true","43.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was a pleasant surprise to discover that this game was not only bug-free (at least for me, during the 30ish hours of gameplay) - but also a LOT of fun!\n\nThe game is a very good high-level simulation.  It started off a bit slow, and there really wasn't much of a tutorial (at least not that I experienced) but the game is very intuitive.  I love the fact that you can upgrade your tools (although there is a limited number of options and once I maxed it, I wasn't sure what to do with the extra exp points).  The upgrades are actually useful (i.e. quicker assembly/disassembly of parts, increase chance to repair parts, diagnostic tools that tell you the "condition" of parts in the car)  I also loved the fact that you can go to the auction house and buy cars which you can then fix up and either collect or choose to sell.  There is something very satisfying about buying an older beater covered in rust and dents and restoring it with shiny new parts.  You can also "test drive" your cars - which I also thought was neat.\n\nTLDR - Great simulation game that smoothly delivers what it promises in the description (which is a rarity these days).\nSeems to be bug free and has a very intuitive UI - although I found I had to "discover" most of the things myself since there didn't seem to be much of a tutorial.  This is a real time-sink and I've caught myself a few times now going to the auction house, buying an old beater and meaning to restore just a portion of it... but once you start and then see another rusting component that you just have to replace (and have gotten so quick and good at it)... it really does draw you into spending far more time than planned.... If being a mechanic was this much fun and satisfying (and no grease on my hands) then I could see being a mechanic ;-)\n\nDefinitely worth the price tag, and I hope that they intend to build upon this game (it seems to me like there are some areas in the game that were left intentionally empty - maybe for future expansions?)\n\nI'm happy with this purchase and will be keeping my eyes open for more games from these devs!","April 26, 2015","true","41.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Much has been improved in terms of added variety in cars, but there are still many areas that feel under-developed and lacking in substance, even in comparison to that earlier title.\n\nThat said, it's still a cracking ride, and an easy recommendation for anyone interested in cars and practical, mechanical puzzles. As long as you don't take the 'Simulator' part of the name too seriously, this is probably the closest you'll get to the sweaty, filthy joys of running your own chop shop.\n\nRead my full review here: http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/car_mechanic_simulator_2015/review/article-1468.html","May 28, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fabreeze/recommended/320300/","fabreeze","Fabreeze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fabreeze/","186 products in account","This game DOES go on sale quite a bit, so definitely pick up while that's going on if you're thinking about getting it. For under $10, it's a decent buy. I definitely would not buy for $20 though.\n\nAt the same time that this game improves upon a lot of the downfalls of CMS 2014, it still lacks a way to stop the mind-numbing process involved in getting to the good content of the game.  After playing for two hours, I'm still grinding through basic jobs in hopes of eventually getting to actually work on my own cars.\n\nI'd say the music has improved but still is an extremely repetitive playlist. They can't be more than 20 minutes long, if not less. **UPDATE** One new song was added since I wrote this. Probably a 25 minute playlist now. You're better off muting the game music and playing your own.\n\nIf you haven't played CMS 2014, then it will be more likely that you enjoy this game since you won't notice how little it has really changed. It has definitely gotten better since then, but I think that maybe some more time developing should have been used.\n\nBasically, I really think that this game still needs work; but it looks like the developers are really looking for support from the community to do so gradually. That's fine. While it definitely is a finished product, some aspects of it just look very cheap. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a very good game. Not to mention it's pretty much the only mechanic sim out there right now. It's just that I feel like it still falls short of being a great game. It's almost feels like I bought an early access game without the label on it.\n\nI don't want to say this about the game because I know that the developers have worked very hard for this, but I really wouldn't be able to pass off pretending to fix virtual cars as a fun activity to anyone.  You're really better off watching informational videos on YouTube on how to perform the tasks you'd be doing in the game and maybe practicing on a real car than playing this game. Although it may feel like it has some educational value, you don't really need more than basic car knowledge to get these jobs done. Let's be real.\n\nI really don't agree with how little experience points you get from jobs that require you to diagnose several different systems and repair them. To even be able to access all of the new features of the game, you need to get a parking garage which costs 9000 XP. Over 20 jobs later, I'm only at 4000 XP. At least there's a bigger variety of problems to fix, unlike CMS 2014, but it's still just wayyyy too much. Why isn't the garage paid with money instead of experience anyway?\n\nAll this aside, the game gets good support and still has updates and DLC coming, so there's hope all of this gets fixed eventually.","June 16, 2015","false","3.7"," 47 of 94 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","47","94","2","1"

I got it with all of the DLCs up to this point on sale and it was well worth it. Even though it is a "simulator" it is limited in what it simulates. It does let you take in repair jobs and remove old parts to replace them with newer ones. You have to put the cars on the lift to be able to access certain areas of the car; other parts of the car are only accessible under the hood. You have to remove certain parts first in order to get to other parts. You have to order replacement parts for the repair jobs you do. What the game does not simulate are things like the following: best practices, like disconnecting the battery before doing jobs like removing the starter and such. You don't have to torque done wheel lugs in a start pattern. You can't bulk order parts like spark plugs and oil filters that you are going to regularly need in order to get better pricing. As a matter of fact, you cannot even shop around from multiple suppliers to get better deals on parts. Another example is that you have an oil pan to catch oil when you drain the oil sump. However, if you use this, it is solely for role play purposes; you don't get a huge mess on the floor if you drain the oil with nothing to catch it. Also, you can remove the drain pan under the engine without first draining all the oil out.\n\nThink of this game as more of a 3-D puzzle game. You will learn the basics of what car parts are, where they are on the vehicle and how they fit with other parts. You won't really learn any real auto mechanics, though.\n\nI have really enjoyed this game, because there is always some new goal to work toward. As you get more experience and money, you can upgrade your tools and also your shop to make diagnosis and repairs easier and faster. Eventually you can buy your own car at auction and then "soup it up" but I haven't gotten to that point yet.\n\nThis game looks good and the controls make sense, though there are some little annoyances like having to always use the ESC key to close windows instead of the key that you used to open the window. The music is terrible but you can turn it off.\n\nThis is a good one if you like cars and want to pretend like you have your own shop.

The fewer screws from the last version is surely welcome as is the much better graphics. The bad however vastly outnumber the good about this game.\n\nThe absolute worst thing is the repetition. I bought the game for the promise of buying broken cars, fixing them and selling them back but guess what, that requires 9000 EXP and 50,000 USD to unlock. EXP is gathered snail-slow, 100 per fixed car and 1 for installing or uninstalling an item. That's 10+ hours for me and I'm still on 6,500 EXP doing the exact same thing on each car over and over again. In a way I guess the developers knew there isn't much variety in the game itself so the flooded it in a way that it needs forever to get you anywhere.\nI have a decent computer and still the game takes 15-20 seconds to load a car! I'm not talking startup time, each time you take a job, that's the waiting time before the car appears in my garage. Taking the car for a test drive, same wait. It's really frustrating.\nTaking off the wheels is driving me crazy. I am aware that most car fixes need the wheels removed but the game takes it to a crazy level. If there are 4 steering/suspension problems in a car, rest assured each is on a different wheel. Same thing for timing belts and things that require a lot of unscrewing to reach. 2 pistons on a V engine? Almost certainly on different engine-body parts. Again I think this is intentional to make the game play longer for lack of original content.\nOverall the game is good, I welcome the mechanical simulation part, quite nice but the game content itself is very short if the repetition is at least limited and the game should be priced according to this criteria, the current price is a highway robbery for the actual content.","October 30, 2015","false","10.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Informative for someone like me who only knows a few part names and has made few repairs on their car. There are a number of additions that i feel should defintely be included though. More fluids, electronics repair, part descriptions, better damage indicators rather than generic rust, and just listening to engine sounds to diagnose problems quicker - to name a few.\n\nThis isnt a simulator, rather a collection of minigames based on the reality of auto mechanics.\n\n\nThe progression and experience earning rate is dreadfully slow, though. It does feel like hours before i got to my first 1000 Xp and chose my first measly upgrade.\n\n\nLoad times are pretty merciless. I really wish they would focus on smoothing it out rather than other features.\n\n\nMost importantly though; the DLC. Why on Earth would you release a "Gold"/complete version of this game that collects all of the downloadable content if you're gonna release another new dlc pack after, separately?? That's total lack of respect for your customers. I cant see why they wouldnt include it in an update, at least for those have the Gold version like me.\n\n\nThis is an ethics issue that i cant forgive them for. I can praise the simple repair aspect of the game but i wouldnt recommend this on a account of poor professionalism from the developer.","May 18","false","4.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

They also grew a pair of balls by adding a V8 and making an L4 with and without DOHC (Dual Over-Head Cam). The only, and I mean ONLY bad thing about this game is the XP system. Final gameplay rating, 9/10.\n\nI also gave a brief description on realism of the parts on CMS2k14, so might as well make one here amiorite?\n\nAnywho, this game blew CMS'14 out of the water. They moved the oil filter to the bottom, which is what I stated. Not only that, but they added more parts to work on, including ABS, even MORE rubber bushings, sterring rack, and much, much more. I'd rate the realism 10/10.\n\nFinal rating: 9.5/10.

RDG seems incapable of adding the smallest features, one fine example being keybinding they swore to add over a year ago. Also, when confronted about their lack of work, they get defensive (one instance even instantly locking the complaint thread). The only times they actually respond to any forum threads is a little before and a little after an update. Now, the only content they can add are vehicles, and more and more vehicles. I have yet to see even one feature added that they have promised on their "suggested features" thread.\n\nAltogether, I highly advise you don't buy this game.","April 24","false","121.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

As you gain experiemce you will unlock ability to repair parts rather than replace them with new ones. Also you gain access to some diagnostic tools which willl tell you what is broken, but you will rarely use them because they'll just color code what you already see as rusty as thus broken.\n\nFirst 10 hours of the game you are likely to have lots of fun, but soon after you will inadvertly realize you have just been taking apart 3 variants of engines and 3 variations of undercarriages stuffed in different chasis all that time.\n\nThere is little progression to speak of. In fact the only difference awaiting you at the end is option to buy  broken cars and sell them after you have fixed them the same way as completing the repair job.\n\nThere's no customization, no tuning and virtually no driving cars in this game. If you're looking for that you will be dissapointed.\n\nIf you're looking for simplistic puzzler to kill 10-15 hours in you will enjoy this title. If you're looking for something akin to classic games like street rod, you will find this title dull and repetitive.","May 3, 2015","false","52.1"," 23 of 51 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","23","51","0","0"

It is a GAME so it's missing things that make it a true simulator. No angry customers or budget for keeping the place running. Customers coming back to say you didn't put a screw or a bolt back...accidents there in the garage..challenges, maybe you get to go to Nascar and have to SPEED repair cars.  There needs to be a clock period. Where you quote a customer a time to pick up so you have to work a little faster. And for the love of god please allow us to add our own music..itunes play list..something.\nHearing the sound of the wratchet (may have spelled that wrong) definitely did take me back to being a little girl in the garage with my Papa but as a hard core simulator fan this falls short.\nIt plays more like a mechanic class than an actual game.  I'll give it a good review just because you did an amazing job on the parts.  But I won't be buying any more of your games ladies and gents.

I gave up entirely on even playing this game when I realized that to unlock anything extra (Buy and fix old cars, test the cars, or even anything for the garage) would take an extra 9,000 xp. Would recommend this for people who don't know how to change their oil and want to do that for at least five hours, or for people who don't know how a hydraulic lift works. Other than that this game is very beautiful and has some good mechanics to it, but again feels to go a little slow, it might just be me but, I would recommend waiting until this game has some solid updates that add a bunch cars and garage upgrades to buy it.","May 8, 2015","false","4.6"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","10","26","0","2"

If you know cars well you will be insulted by how much they leave out, and if you don't know cars but want to learn more you'll be grosly misled.   I enjoyed 2014 more than 2015.  Because 2015 didn't fix any of my complaints from the first game, it would be very awkward to recommend it.  However, it is not a bad game.\n\nProsImproved Graphics.\nMore detail on car parts and repairs.\nYou can now buy your cars from auctions.\nConsNo campaign mode.\nWork orders are less creative because there is no campaign.  2014 would tell you "the car makes clank sounds and accelerates slowly" and then you had to figure out what was broken.  2015 just gives you large lists of broken parts to fix.  Not nearly as interesting.\n2014 would also have you plug the code reader into the obd port.  2015 has you use the code reader on the actual parts, very odd.\nYou still don't have to add transmission fluid after putting the transmission back in place.  Same goes for anti-freeze in the radiator.\nIts still fairly difficult to line-up the oil-catch under the oil plug.\nSome of the jobs are still absurd expensive, people spending $15,000 on crappy econoboxes to fix them.  Some of the parts are still crazy priced.\nThe interface and controls are still awkward and counter-intuitive.\nSome tasks, such as removing the wheels, still take far too long.\nOk, so the list of cons is big.  Do I recommend the game?  I would recommend 2014 before this game.  It seems like 2015 didn't solve any of major issues with the series and they took some of the core expierence away by getting rid of campaign mode.\n","October 27, 2015","false","8.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","3"

There is no real tutorial, help file or wiki to help you find what parts are to be found where. Combined with the ho-hum camera, this means you'll spend most of your time clicking around the car, hoping to hit the hot spot with the correct name. If you're out of luck, it'll be hidden inside other components. Strangely, finding the right parts to replace seems to be the core game component. The other mechanics are bolting/unbolting said parts and ordering replacements online. Oh, and you get to push the button on the lift.\n\nThe music is very much an acquired taste, so bring your own MP3s.

CMS2014 was basically a series of puzzles where you're given a car and have to find the broken parts and replace them, but Endless mode left you wanting more because all it did was throw broken cars with no explanation of what might be wrong at you and make you tear your hair out trying to find that one busted rubber bushing.\n\nCMS2015 fixes that.  The entire game is like Endless mode from CMS2014, but now there are dynamically generated jobs that have basic problem descriptions (Car is loud, handles funny, engine keep cutting out, etc) to help limit how much of the car you have to tear apart to find the problem.  2015 also adds basic bodywork and the ability to paint cars (you have to unlock this part of your garage).\n\nThe most fun (and profit) in my opinion, comes later.  You can, after you add a parking garage to your shop, go to auto auctions and bid on junkers, then restore them and sell them for profit.  The more you fix up, the more money the car is worth when you sell it.\n\nCompared to CMS2014, the cars have many, many more parts.  You can unlock some new diagnostic tools (compression gauge and voltmeter) and some old ones make a return (diagnostic path and road test, which is much improved).\n\nThey're doing a wonderful job listening to their playerbase as they move forward with future updates (they've added some features and fixed some bugs at the request of the community already, the game has only been out a few weeks and they've released over half a dozen patches), and they're planning on adding more.  Chiptuning hasn't returned yet, but they're looking for good tuning ideas to implement instead of 2014's three-bar system, and they're taking votes on which cars to put into the first paid DLC pack.  They've released two free cars already.\n\nCMS2015 does everything CMS2014 did right, and fixes just about everything CMS2014 did wrong.  If you had fun playing 2014, or you enjoy knowing How Stuff Works, you really can't go wrong with this.\n\nIt's not AAA GOTY, but it's a wonderful casual game.","May 6, 2015","true","37.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whilst you have to grind your way to get to the buy and selling stage (yep its not open from the begining) but you have to grind you way through countless oil changes, gearbox changes, timing belts or running gear to get enough money to open your parking lot and go to the auction for cars.\nSure the grind sucks (but which games doesnt have a grind element to it) and they seem to be releasing new cars.

They are also working on improvements and DLC addons that should bring lot more to the game like tuning etc. Right now its a parts changing game.\n\nThe actual game play is not like the trailer videos. You never see third person and body work is just clicking the part off, buying a new one then clicking it back on again.

And oh boy i got hooked. And here's why i love this game so much:\n\nStory:\nYou're a car mechanic and you fix'em cars.\n\nPresentation:\nThis game didn't really go for photorealism despite being a simulator, and some parts look really funky at times, but most of the time it doesn't really matter because this game runs really smooth and you don't need a beast to run this very smoothly so good optimaztion there. And mostly i didn't really cared about funky looking parts because i had so much fun. Oh, i almost forgot to talk about how much detail and effort has put into this game. You will be surpised to see how detailed the car parts are even thorugh they didn't went for the photorealism.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay in this game is so addicting and fun for both car lovers and problem solvers, so in the first few jobs the game tells you what to fix, but 3-4h in the game gives less infomation about the problem and you need to dig(or shall i say, screw) your way into the car to find the problem and replace it with new parts. Also this game really teaches you about car parts and how to remove them and put'em back in. It is a very fun and addicting IF you're a car lover like me or a problem solver, novice mechanic, or people who like puzzle games. Well if you're not one of those people i suggest stay away from this game because it's not for you.\n\nOverall:\nOverall this game is perfect for Car lovers, problem solvers, novice mechanic, and people who like puzzle games. For those people this game gets 9/10 BUY THIS GAME NOW. But if you're not one of those people do not purchase this game. I myself would put a recommended review because this game deserves more positive reviews.","March 16","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are some highlights:\n\n> Part manipulation and examination mechanics are greatly improved, and far more practical.\n> the gameplay actually "flows" now\n> Real-life models are amazing; this is really going to be the key attraction of the game moving forward.\n> Testing equipment, including the test track, are streamlined and practical.\n> Mechanics for advancement in the game are ideal; it has a roleplaying aspect in that you are working to improve your ability to diagnose and repair cars.\n\nAreas where I would appreciate improvement:\n\n> I still believe that the heart of this game lies in REALISM\n> licensing more real-life models to work on will cultivate a "collector" culture amongst players\n> Mercedes Benz is an awesome choice, THANK YOU for licensing those classics\n> Jeep, Land Rover, Hummer, and perhaps a Harley Davidson motorcycle DLC would be insanely cool\n> Working on a Tesla Motors electric model would also be interesting\n> Working on some old soviet era trucks would be interesting\n> the more the player is asked to pay attention to (and work around) the details of working on a vehicle, the more interesting and enjoyable the game becomes\n> the feeling that you are learning to be a better mechanic is satifying and interesting\n> players should be given difficulty options, for example, having to choose the appropriate size of socket to remove nuts and bolts, setting electrodes on the testing equipment appropriately, setting the testing equipment manually to get the correct readings, etc.\n> having to care for and replace tools as often as parts, since both degrade with use\n> being given choices between tools to perform the same task that present a dillemma in terms of "will this tool do the job better than some other choice? will the wrong tool degrade or break the part?"\n\nMinor complaints:\n> the placement of the oil catcher is obnoxious and impractical.\n> the way the game lags when you have too many parts in inventory is odd -- I have 32 GB RAM, and massive HD space, so why can't the game deal with what's in the inventory?\n\nSome will say that those suggestions are going too far, and they don't want to have to think that hard. That's fine, you can make the difficulty settings optional; people can play the game as-is and that can be the default. Maybe the higher difficulty levels can be a cheap DLC, for hardcore gearheads only. For me, with moderate experience fixing and restoring automobiles, I get off on having to actually think through a repair and pulling it off well. If the game devs have found a way to re-create the spirit of the repair experience, they won't only win awards and acclaim, but build a massive following for their game. There are a lot of gearheads out there, and not a lot of games that capture high degrees of realism. That's really the holy grail of this genre, creating the most realistic technical experience possible.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. The developers are paying attention to the community, and it's obvious that they're very passionate about creating a quality product.\n\nBuy it if you love cars!\n\n","March 13","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it in alpha and enjoyed it and played it a lot early on.  But after a while the challenge diminishes rapidly.  It only takes a few times to learn a car, and new cars are not much of a challenge.  The DLC of new vehicles are expensive and there should be many more vehicles in the base game.  The vehicles are typically based on a basic format so if you have 4WD DLC your just getting one basic vehicle with some minor changes between them.  They represent different companies but are all designed the same.  The only really different vehicle is the Maluch, and its, just weird.  All in all I played over 120 hours.  You have to have the visual tuning DLC to make the game playable, but they charge seperately for it, so you know what your in for with this game.","November 27, 2015","true","125.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there is some main components missing from the game. Heres a few things I would like to see in the game.\n\n1. One that is simple yet not avaliable, being able to just jump in behind the wheel and start the car to hear it run.\n2. And to continue that thought,  what about realistic sounds? You get a repair order, complaining about a knocking sound in engine bay, or you will get a car that won't run. If you were able to turn the key over maybe that will help with the diagnostics of the repair.\n3. Like many have stated, no hoses, no electrical work, no fuel/brake lines. You cant take the enegine out with a cherry picker than dismantle it. Being able to do actual body work instead of buying brand new body parts would be fun.\n4. Also i see a tire machine in the shop but it has no use. Having the ability to change tires as they commonly go bad would be an awesome little perk.\n5. I havent fully upgraded my "repair %" but it doesnt seem like theres many parts that are repairable. Not sure if you unlock more parts as you upgrade, if not than you should.","November 10, 2015","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BumblebeeAutobot/recommended/320300/","BumblebeeAutobot","Bumblebee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BumblebeeAutobot/","16 products in account","There are quite a lot of pros and only a few cons to the game. Mind you, I will be comparing the older version to the newer version.\n\nPros:\n-It is not very laggy: The biggest issue I had with the older version was that I set my game to the lowest video settings, but I still kept on lagging. This game takes that and throws it in the bin. With the same computer and same specs, the 2015 version was much more smoother than the 2014 version. I had at least 30fps all the way, whereas I would have 15-20fps on the 2014 version.\n-Interesting Campaign Mode: The one in CMS2014 was very controlled, you were given the same puzzle as everyone else who played the game. This gives you the choice to select the orders you want to take, and that is a game changer. No longer do you HAVE to do an order. You get to pick what you want to do. i.e I don't feel like fixing that guy's brakes, so I'll just select the order with the engine problems instead. This helps to make the game much more smoother and much more playable.\n-Much fewer glitches: I had a problem with CMS2014, and that was my order #43 glitched and I couldn't finish the order no matter how closely I followed the instructions. Since this is a newer game, we don't have as many glitches anymore. This game is being constantly updated, so it allows for improvement all the time.\n-Cool DLCs: We have had two DLCs come out by the time I am writing this review, Visual Tuning and Young Timer. Young Timer is free, with the nice little Fiat 500 lookalike. The Visual Tuning DLC does cost some money, however it is much more cheaper compared to the price tags on the other DLCs.\n\nCons:\n-Time Consuming: Unless you are an absolute car bore who likes fixing the cars in this game like I do, you are not going to have a fun time. This is a simulator of what mechanics do on a daily basis, so ofcourse it is going to be time consuming, what did you expect?\n-Unlockables: In CMS2014, we had the OBD scanner as a tool since the beginning of the game. Why do we need to work on 10 cars maximum in order to unlock the tool that we had for a long time in the previous game? They could've let some tools remain like they were in the previous game. However, it does add for an interesting aspect to the gameplay, because now you get to work for the things you really want. Although that is interesting to me, it might not be to the other gamers.\n-Repair Uncertainty: Now again, unless you are a car enthusiast that finds these innovations interesting to the gameplay, you are probably not going to like the fact that there is a chance that the item you repair may not be fixed successfully.\n\nOverall, I think they did an excellent job with the new 2015 simulator. The new additional features are absolutely worth every single penny of that price tag. This new game completely demolishes the other older one, and I am not saying this because my CMS2014 Order #43 did not work. I genuinely believe this new game is a huge step forward from the previous one. I can now only imagine how much greater the 2016 version will be, definitely a rival to the upcoming Street Tuning Revolution. I am only joking, that game is a total in depth tuning game and it will take Red Dot Games a little while to catch up to that level, eventhough in my opinion it is very close. Then again, I have not played Street Tuning Evolution yet, so I can't tell the gap there might exist between the two games. CMS2016, that is a game definitely to look forward to.\n","June 20, 2015","true","41.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're able to get all XP upgrades pretty early and then... nothing. Never be able to reach 100% though. A showroom for done cars is missing.

My bad!  I needed to replace the O2 sensor and put on new spark plugs!" and charge them some more.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. The year is almost over, and I have a good 100 hours on this game, so it's about time for a review.\nWhat can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It's definitely a very good game, it's informative in its own way, educational, and just plain fun, especially when you save up enough money and experience to expand your garage, get the paint shop, get the underground parking, and go to the auction house to buy wrecks you can fix up and sell for a profit.\nOf course, things are simplified a lot under the hood of each car you get to work on. I'm no mechanic, but I know enough of cars to have done maintenance on my own cars, and I have studied a lot of stuff for stories I write in which a character is an actual mechanic. There is in fact a funny thing about that; the game showed me painfully well how I got most of my knowledge about cars. It started in Dutch, as that is the language set on my laptop, and one of the first customer cars I got in showed a list that said there was a part that needed replacing. And I was all like; what the hell is that? So I saved and quit to menu, set the game language to English, started back up again, looked at the list, and went; Ohhh! Duh, a rubber bushing! Why didn't you just SAY so? I KNOW those! (And I know the name of that part mainly from watching YouTube videos of HotRod Magazine/HotRod Garage, and reading those kind of magazines - in English. For about 70% of the parts, I have NO clue what they are by the Dutch names alone)\n\nHow simplified is it under the hood? Well, all cars have similar parts, for one. A front suspension has a crossmember, shocks, springs, a swaybar and end links, steering rack with inner and outer tie rods, upper and/or lower control arms, wheel knuckle housing, wheel hub, brake disk, pads, and a brake caliper. All but one or two cars come with a brake servo, and the newer models with an ABS pump and control unit. Brake lines? Nope. Brake fluid? Nope. A need to bleed the system after you rebuilt it? Nope.\nThe engines? Let's stick with my favorite type of cars; the old ones. There's several classics that are all too recognizable; a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, a 1969 Ford Mustang, a 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle, a 1969 Dodge Charger. Of course they are not called that; the game has given each car its own brand and type. Big plus; they have actually taken the time to design logos and name badges that are on the cars, and they look good, too!\nBut, the engines. Those four cars I mentioned all come with a carburated overhead-cam V8 engine. All parts are interchangeable, except for the two-carb intake manifold that comes on the Mustang. Have you bought a Chevelle and want to spruce it up a bit with a dual carburetor setup? Sorry, no can do, that dual-carb intake manifold is not an optional part for that car. Even when you take the V8 out of a Mustang and put it in the Chevelle, you can only put on the single-carb intake manifold. The only optional parts you can change on a car are the rims, and body parts if you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack.\nFor the rest, though, it's good. Quite simplified, but with plenty of detail parts even so. Take apart one of those old V8's, and you find yourself with a box full of individual rocker arms and pushrods which you can take out one by one - and there's sixteen of them in one engine.\n\nThere's one big drawback, though. You can't take the whole engine plus transmission out of the car in one big lump and put it on an engine stand to disassemble it, like almost any car restorer does; you have to disassemble, and reassemble it, in the car. And some parts you can only reach from underneath. Once you have gotten down to the engine block, it's; take out pistons, lift car, get under, remove oil pan (if you already hadn't), remove crankshaft caps, remove crankshaft, get out, lower car, remove engine block. Fix up or buy new one. Put in engine block, lift car, get under, put in crankshaft, put in crankshaft caps, get out, lower car, put in pistons, lift car, get under, put on oil pan and filter, get out, lower car, rebuild rest of the engine. That would be SO much easier if you could just take the whole thing out, put it on an engine stand, and disassemble/reassemble there.\n\nAnd the simplification shows. The plug wires are the only wires you'll find in the whole car. The detailing goes as far as to put individual clips on the air filter box/distributor cap you have to take off, but a wiring loom for all the electrics? Not there. Gaskets? Not there. There's a fuel filter, but fuel lines? Nope. Brake lines? Nope. And even on the most hashed-out rusty wreck of a 1957 Bel Air you buy at the auction house, ALL the bolts are always brand new. The rims and parts of the suspension/engine may be so rusted they are beyond repair, but they still come off with three turns of your wrench on the brand new bolts holding everything in place.\n\nThe same goes for the fixing of the parts. You have a work table where you can fix a good number of the parts you take off a car. Butthe fixing process is; click. You managed to repair the part! Condition is now X%! Or; click. You failed to repair the part. Condition has decreased. (and it always decreases to a point so low you can't re-attempt to fix it again. So if you hash up a part, it's utterly broken and you need to buy a new one)\n\nStill, overall, it's a great game. After 100 hours I'm still not bored of it, even if I'm doing pretty much the same things over and over again. It just has that certain something about it that keeps drawing you in to play it more. There's just a few little things that could make it even better.\n- placing of the oil drain pan. That is SUCH a hit-and-miss, because you can't look upwards properly once you're moving that thing around. I end up just removing the oil pan and taking the $100 fine for oil cleanup, rather than to fiddle around with that drain and having it sit just a smidge too far to the left, right, front or back anyway.\n- disassembling/reassembling the engine outside of the car on an angine stand. If that could be implemented, it would be SUCH an improvement.\n- customizing of the cars. Currently, it's just visual with body parts and head/tail lights and bumpers, and rims, and only when you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack. If you were allowed to put different engines in different cars, or even do things like put that dual-carb intake on a single-carb V8 engine, that would make things a lot more fun. Also, speed parts would be nice. Take the tame little Pinto, yank out that four-banger engine, plop in a V8 with a high-lift cam, dual or triple carburetors and a turbo or a blower, and you suddenly have a much more interesting car.\n- graphics. Not the overall game graphics; those are pretty good as is. But some extra graphics for the cars? That would be a lot more fun. Take the Dodge Charger, give it a new paint job, and let us put on a bumblebee stripe around the rear end, for instance. Or racing stripes over the hood and trunk of the Chevelle. Or a spiffy flame-job. Hell yeah.\n- the test drive. Currently, there are in fact different engine sounds for the different cars, and some different driving characteristics. But the handling is atrocious, and the whole thing feels a bit... tacked on. Almost like it was an afterthought. There is massive potential for improvement there.\n- bodywork on the cars. At the moment, it's front bumper, headlights, hood, front fenders, doors, trunk lid, taillights, rear bumper. Not even windshields/rear windows/side windows (and everyone who ever restored an old car knows that the quarter panels/rear fenders and floor pans are 90% of the time the areas that need the most work). I can see a lot of potential for improvement there as well, the outer bodywork, and the interior as well. Allow us to put in leather bucket seats, for instance, or give the interior a different color than black.\n\nDo I recommend this game though? Hell yes!","December 2, 2015","true","118.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it in alpha and enjoyed it and played it a lot early on.  But after a while the challenge diminishes rapidly.  It only takes a few times to learn a car, and new cars are not much of a challenge.  The DLC of new vehicles are expensive and there should be many more vehicles in the base game.  The vehicles are typically based on a basic format so if you have 4WD DLC your just getting one basic vehicle with some minor changes between them.  They represent different companies but are all designed the same.  The only really different vehicle is the Maluch, and its, just weird.  All in all I played over 120 hours.  You have to have the visual tuning DLC to make the game playable, but they charge seperately for it, so you know what your in for with this game.","November 27, 2015","true","125.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're able to get all XP upgrades pretty early and then... nothing. Never be able to reach 100% though. A showroom for done cars is missing.

(I got every upgrade and reached about a millions dollars now with no idea on what to spend it all)\n-No preview option when using the paint shop.\n-No real city to ride your own cars once you get them\n\nTo conclude, CMS 2015 is well-made, fun game.

I've never been one to RACE thru a game at a RECORD pace, and this one was no exception.  It took me about 90 hours to get to the point where I had all the tools and upgrades, and could afford the parking lot, the final purchase required to buy cars at auction (the only way to OWN your own cars).\n\nI haven't read thru the community forums much.  In the beginning, I needed to go to YouTube to find videos on how to find the parts in some of the cars, such as the fuel pump (located on top of the fuel tank, btw ...), and it took me awhile to figure out how the color scheme works with each mode, as they change depending on whether you're in DISASSEMBLE mode, ASSEMBLE or a third mode you can use to diagnose the condition of the parts.\n\nOnce you get it, it's a piece of cake to figure out the order of taking the car apart and putting it back together.\n\nI also bought the DLC, but I haven't seen much in the way of custom parts yet, other than RIMS and PAINT.  In fact, that brings me to my WANTS, or things that would make this game better.\n\n1.  Why not be able to take the cars out and drive them around a city or RACE TRACK?  The one little test course is a quick set of bumps and turns thru an alley, and gets old really quick.\n\n2.  The addition of tracks or courses would make improving your car more exciting, and maybe motivate you to build it with 100% new condition parts.  As it is, you really need to have a junker to tell any difference in performance from car to car.  Beefing up the UPGRADE system would be nice, too.  Souping up the motor and suspension, or TURBO and NITROUS kits would make shaving times off a time trial a lot of fun, and give you some reason to stay with the game after you get to where I am, where everything gets a little tedious.\n\n3.  For me it's hard to understand why you can repair CERTAIN partz at certain times, but not others.  You end up with hundreds of broken partz that you have to sell one by one, mouse CLICK and ENTER.  When selling stuff, the sound of my keyboard and mouse is like an old manual typewriter.  You can sell the "JUNK" with one button, but anything above 10% condition gets thru that filter.  And its all junk if you can't repair it, unless you want to build cars out of damaged partz.\n\n4.  What about a reputation system?  The cheaper, better, and faster you repair carz should bring you more trusting and higher paying customers.  As it is, you select cars from a list, by clicking on a phone.  Rather sterile, and boring after a while.\n\n5.  Also, I don't know about the value of the cars.  There may be a list somewhere, but I haven't seen it.  Makes auctions a little silly if you can't tell the sale value of the car before bidding.\n\n6.  How about some RACING WHEEL support, along with the tracks or city driving?  These muscle cars BEG to be driven hard, not just crashed and trashed in an alley with KEYBOARD controls.  It would be fun to drive thru downtown traffic, pull in to a RACE TRACK, and race against AI cars or your friends.  OPEN and CLASS races would be fun, and could also add to the FAME of your CUSTOM shop when you win, or just show up and race a lot.\n\nThat's it, for now, MotorKatz!  I obviously liked the game, but I don't feel like it has enuff depth to keep me interested, as it stands now.  Like any good game, it has left me wanting more!\n\nGood Luck!\n\nJack","July 11, 2015","true","153.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, draining oil does not require you to drop the entire oil pan. You must also not overfill when pouring oil into the engine as featured in the game to let you know "It's good", and another example is that with spark plugs, you MUST gage them before you put them inside the engine or bad things happen.

For the most part you can repair most parts on it, and depending how  many points you have spent in the skill, you have up to a 90% chance of repairing a part. However there seems to be no rhyme or reason to which parts you can or cannot repair. For example, you can somehow repair brake shoes, but not brake discs. Another problem is with the repairs itself... As mentioned, you have up to a 90% chance of a successful repair if you purchase all the points for the repair bench. That may seem like a lot, however given that it may take up to 5 repairs on say an engine block, you really only have a 5 out of 9 chance of completely repairing it successfully. This means you may repair an expensive item up to 89% or so, but then fail your last roll and completely destroy it. How does that happen in real life? I have an almost brand new engine and somehow I totally ruin it beyond repair? I could understand letting it only repair up to a certain point, but the way the system works, even with full points in repair, you end up ruining more than half the parts you pull on any given repair job. Also... how the hell difficult is it to put an oil pan under the engine to avoid a $100 spill.\n\nThe good: It's fun... But gets old fast. Not a lot of variety. Most cars are different only on the outside. If you've worked on one, you've worked on them all.","June 27, 2015","true","96.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it in alpha and enjoyed it and played it a lot early on.  But after a while the challenge diminishes rapidly.  It only takes a few times to learn a car, and new cars are not much of a challenge.  The DLC of new vehicles are expensive and there should be many more vehicles in the base game.  The vehicles are typically based on a basic format so if you have 4WD DLC your just getting one basic vehicle with some minor changes between them.  They represent different companies but are all designed the same.  The only really different vehicle is the Maluch, and its, just weird.  All in all I played over 120 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrtostados/recommended/320300/","mrtostados","Mr. Tostados","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrtostados/","23 products in account","Gameplay: 7/10 It gets tedious. You'd better hope you like unscrewing things (and then attempting to repair them, failing, buying new things, and screwing them back on). Then again, I'm sure being an automotive mechanic gets boring after a while, too. The cars all have the same basic components, as most cars do, but some have different layouts for more specific systems, like rear brake drums instead of discs or I4/I6/V8/V8OHV engines, etc. Despite this variation, after a few cars, you've seen it all. There's a lot of attention to detail, but even then, the game is not 100% accurate. If it was, though, I'd imagine it would be a lot more difficut. I'm glad that driving does not happen much in this game, because the driving mechanics were honestly not very good at all. Besides that, everything runs smoothly without any serious glitches. It performs as advertised.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 There isn't much to look at in this game, but what there is looks pretty nice. In other words, the textures and models all look great, but they mostly just sit there - no action.\n\nPlot: 0/10 It's a game about being a mechanic. What were you expecting, an epic tale of love, loss, and man's journey to find himself? There's no plot, you just fix cars for hours. I'm not really factoring plot into the overall rating, because that isn't the point of the game as I see it.\n\nSoundtrack: 4/10 One of this game's weakest points has to be the soundtrack. I know some mechanics, and I don't think many (if any at all) of them listen to EDM, and certainly not the same 5 songs in an endless loop. Now, you might think that it's fine. You'll just shut off the music and load up your own or whatever you usually do. Bad news:  YOU CAN'T SHUT IT OFF  (at least as far as I can tell). Now, it isn't  bad  EDM, it just gets super annoying. You must listen to the same songs over and over and over and over.\n\nReplay Value: 4/10 This game quickly becomes boring. There are only so many variations on cars and so many different tasks you can perfect performing. After a while, there's just no point in playing. The Trader Pack added the ability to buy cars at auction and restore them to keep or sell, but the only thing you can do with the money from selling cars is buy more cars or more car parts. It's very circular. It just feels like there's something missing at the upper level of this game.\n\nOverall: 60/100 I can't blame this game for being something I don't like. It's a simulation of being a mechanic, and I wasn't expecting much. So, as a game that simulates being an automotive repair specialist this game is probably a 90/100 (and stands pretty uncontested in its field). However, there's just about no replay value. There's no real reason to be satisfied with restoring even some of the nicest cars in the game because there's nothing to do with them after that, besides look at them and drive them around the generally pointless test track (the only textured driving course included with the game). The lack of replay value is what really ends up making this game kind of disappointing.  Suggestion:  What would make this game a 95/100 is a racing element: being able to buy performance-enhancing parts to upgrade your cars and then race for money. Despite its flaws, I'd say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is mostly worth the meager $19.99 it asks of your wallet.","December 10, 2015","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also I would like to request the option to lift trucks and such and also to be able to turn certain or all cars(whatever suits your fancy) into boneified drag cars, just my opinion but thatd be cool.

I have worked on cars before and mostly everything is spot on - especially suspension wise. There are some parts that have either been omitted or overly simplified but - especially engine wise - but it's no big deal. It performs well but has a few weird quirks. I could not get the game to load until a user suggested I force-minimize the game via CTRL+ALT+DEL, then go back in, which oddly enough worked out.\n\nPROS:\n- Fun and educational\n- Very accurate parts wise\n- Great visuals\n- Nice testing tools\n- Good experience points and unlocks\n- Nice soundtrack (in my opinion)\n\nCONS:\n- Odd performance quirks at times\n- Long and frequent loading times\n- Some overly simplified engine components\n- Camera fights with you sometimes\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR CMS 2016:\n\n- Let's get deeper into engine parts! I realize it might turn away some folks because engines can get very complex. Perhaps a difficulty setting where this is adjustable?\n\n- Automatic transmissions. Every car in this game is a manual. Autos would be nice as they would introduce a whole new category of drivetrains.\n\n- The aftermarket scene. I realize this is probably a can of worms, but a few performance mods wouldn't hurt.

As far as gameplay goes it flows quite well, and navigating around your vehicle is 95% of the time smooth and easy. It could use some achievements though and other things to work towards while you're trying to get those XP points to unlock stuff - it gets kind of repetitive when you have a large gap of XP before the next thing you can unlock.\n","June 29, 2015","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
