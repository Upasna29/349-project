The main issues I really have with the game in its current stages is how in some instances it’s fairly lacking in content and that some things really aren’t explained all too well within it. However, it has some fantastic potential, and certain aspects such as the level creator are absolutely fantastic and its definitely worth looking into if you like the idea of creating your own adventures in this way.\n\nThe meat of the game really is in the editor and sandbox aspects, so if you are looking to get it for the campaign you may be slightly disappointed as there’s only 3 short levels as it stands and it feels more like an add-on to show you the sorts of things you can create.\n\nFor my more information and some demonstrations of features (etc.), my video preview is below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME_cxXapmgE\n\nPLEASE NOTE: My “preview” series focuses on Early Access games and is more of a “first impressions” than a review. Due to it being incomplete I can’t properly review it; however Early Access isn’t a way to avoid criticism, so I feel first impressions after a good few hours of play is the best method to assess Early Access titles.","July 18, 2014","true","3.7"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","38","51","0","4"

Players can design their own cutscenes, characters, puzzles, levels, and campaigns using powerful yet simple-to-use tools, and will be able to share them via Steam Workshop.The latter half of the game’s title, When Pigs Fly, is a full-length adventure campaign created entirely within Adventurezator as a testament to the game’s creative potential and limitless possibilities.Adventurezator is a game with a lot of scope and a lot of potential. There certainly is the grounds for a fascinating, time consuming adventure/crafting game to be found here.At this point Adventurezator is off to a good start. Those looking for a completed adventure game will find that When Pigs Fly is still very early along and is simply not there yet. As an editor the Adventurezator framework has a great deal of potential, but like any creation software it will eventually require an active community to share what they are working on in order for adoption to thrive. Hopefully that will prove to be the case here.\n\n","September 21, 2014","true","54.4"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

Contains cutscene editor (2d), stage select, characters and scene/stages (the latter two similar to the one seen in The Sims.)\n\nThe simplicity and very quick result in the phase-creation has to do with the fact that all the elements are relatively "ready for interaction," relatively "alive." On the other hand this limits explore more complex possibilities.\nYet I dare say that because being such a quick and polished tool, a gamedev might well use it to create and test prototypes or go beyond.\n\nThe downside I noticed is the delay in the save/load (at least on my PC).\n\nI truly believe that everyone should explore their inner Tim Schafer. :]\n\n====================================================\n\nEu vou explicar: É como 2 produtos em 1.\nVocê tem a "campanha" chamada "When Pigs Fly", que é um adventure 3d super bonito e engraçado.\nE você tem um CRIADOR DE ADVENTURES que é tão fácil e prazeroso que um leigo pode criar e publicar novas estórias nele.

Sometimes these love-at-first-sight relationships end in crushing disappointment. (StarForge) Other times I get to witness the birth of something truly great.  So far, Adventurezator is definitely on the "great" side of things.\n\nThe style is fantastic, from the comical art direction, to the awkward pig genitalia, the delivery just makes me smile.  The whole concept of easy-to-use tools and emergent adventures is already quite enjoyable, and just screams potential.  Things feel pretty polished in an "under construction" kind of way.  Occassionally you run into these to-do notes where features should be.  But hey, this is a game that is currently in development.  You can't judge an unfinished house based on the fact that some of the rooms still need paint or furniture.\n\nWith Adventurezator's current state, in all honesty, my endorsement is mostly based on potential here.  I'm confident that Adventurezator will become something amazing however, because I see none of the warning signs that other failed early access titles exhibited.  Performance is good.  I see all good, original assets, not purchased Unity models.  The roadmap shown so far keeps things realistic, instead of promising the moon, only to ultimately fall short of it.  Because of this, I think you can safely give your money to the Adventurezator guys.  You'll be supporting something that I can confidently say will be well worth it.","May 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Still in its early stages at the time of this review, It shows a lot of promise, and the style and ease of use are pretty good, allowing a complete amateur to create professional looking levels in a 3d world with little knowledge and experience of adventure games.\n\nThe way the npc's and the puzzles are 'Emergent' is the main goal to this.  You just add various elements, set a few simple parameters, and let the npc's act accordingly. Set them a few objects to interact with, set up a few friends and enemies, and things to say and just let them go.  You don't have to worry too much about pathing or complex dialogue trees (at the moment, though I imagine this may change later)\n\nThe cutscene creator is of necessity a bit more complex than the other editing tools, but it looks like it won't be too hard to make a nice looking  cutscence to add an interesting story for the campaign. All it requires apart from some experimenting  is a bit of artistic skills or use of others work, which makes the ability to use the workshop to use others content a boon to this type of game.\n\nThe problem at the moment, apart from the inevitable bugs during development is the simplicity of the puzzles available and lack of ability to customise objects. Only had the game for a short while, but looking at the current state of the game it seems the developer has concentrated on getting the look and the basic mechanics in place first, so while it looks good, and is easy to use, the content and ways to interact are a little limited if you want to dive in and create devious puzzles, and truly create your own world.  The current playable levels are also rather limited, as another reviewer put it, they are more to give you examples on which to to base your own work.\n\nTime will tell of course. The developer has to balance ease of use with the complexity and flexibility of the tools available. As more content gets added we will be able to see just how powerful this game creator will be. I can say that even at this early stage, its fun to mess around with and create a little world, and I look forward to seeing what else I can do in the future.\n\nThe humour and style of the game is great, and I think it can be a  very interesting and involving way to tell your own story. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to express their creativity and make an adventure game, but do not want to have to mess around with the more complex tools available elsewhere.\n\nUpdate 29/10/14 Published first level.  Despite a few difficulties that will be patched out, the process is pretty easy, and the developer is easy to work with when I told him of my problems. The forums have examples of how the developer wishes to move the game forward, and they seem encouraging.","October 11, 2014","true","116.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

There is currently a small selection of levels to play but they are well made and fully voiced with beatifully made cutscenes. But the big thing with this game which makes it one of my favourite games is that it has its own story creator and not just any story creator. It is called 'Sandbox' and inside here you have a range of tools such as 'Cutscene Creator' where you create your own cutscene as seen in the animated trailer (Yes that was made with this!) 'Level Editor' where you make your own levels with characters and such. It is still buggy and very featureless but at the moment there are a fair amount of things to add. 'Campaign Creator'(As of this review it is not in) You can link levels and make branching stories and such to make a full game and not just seperate levels. 'Actor Creator' Basically the title, you create your own actors for use in your levels.\n\nI would recommend SAVING OFTEN as I have come across a very common bug that freezes the UI and makes it, most the time, impossible to do anything so beware.\n\nFor now if you like making your own stories like I do then I would recommend hopping in and making some so when workshop is added you can publish and become 'Famous' probably. But if you just want to play a story then it would be best to hold off for now until workshop is in or more levels are added.\n\nFor now I give the game a 7.5 for being buggy, sort of featureless, lack of levels but has a very nice range of level creating tools to work with and I have to applaud them for the cutscene creator as it works beautifully!\n\nVideo of 1 level and my level I created :D : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiMQ6rkSgl4","July 24, 2014","true","4.0"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

The story and the puzzles are simplistic, the 'action' is aggravating. Being eaten by a bear in suspenders is less fun than it sounds. Especially if it happens over and over, thanks to clumsy controls. Even picking stuff up or going through doors is unnecessarily complicated.  I didn't get very far into the story before getting thoroughly frustrated.\nThe lack of content on the workshop three months after release, might be a sign, that Adventurezator isn't a good game engine, either. For me the biggest issue is the inability to import my own assets. The models in the game are just too limited. The lack of any kind of scripting means, that I could only make the same style of unappealing action/adventure game as the builtin campaign.\nThe best part of Adventurezator is the cutscene editor. It's really easy to use. Pigasus Games should turn it into a standalone tool with export to video an GIF. I'd buy that.","December 27, 2015","false","1.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

After all, maybe it’s either just a game creation tool, or just a point n click adventure. Could it possible be both, and actually good at both?\n\nWell now, in simple terms; Yes.\n\nThe game is spit into its two main components, Adventurezator, which is a rather detailed system for creating your own point n click adventure games. By detailed, I mean just that. Everything from unique characters, cut scenes, and levels can be created so far. With the option later to tie them all together in a campaign creator.\n\nIt’s simple to use, and rather intuitive, as shown in my first impressions video. Among it’s rather plentiful objects, and creation settings, it also allows the user to import images, sounds, music, and more. Featuring a rather detailed little NLE editor for creating your cut scenes and will access to any folder on your system to import needed files.\n\nIf you’ve ever played the Sims, or a similar game; you can easily create a level, building or forrest with rather amazing cartoony detail. A rather pleasant system indeed, and if they continue to add more it will only get better.\n\nThis brings us to When Pigs Fly; the point and click adventure game what according to the developers was made entirely using Adventurezator. After playing around in it,  can certainly see this as being true.\n\nYou only have the option of a ‘Quickie’ though, 4 pre-completed levels to play. The Arena is a mess in my opinion. Without so much as a even a single que or popup telling me what’s going on I was quickly mangled by a rather large bear. There were no instructions on how to fight, much less what to actually even do.\n\nFrustratingly I left to explore the When Pigs Fly chapters that are the point and click.\nThey’re actually rather good, although once again there aren’t any instructions on how to play. There are some objective in the top left corner however.\n\nSadly shortly after starting I was left confused and frustrated once again. Unable to complete a prime objective, or simply talking to a Zookwinkle. Now matter how many times I clicked, wandered about or interacted with the little gnome, I was unable to engage him in dialogue. Frustratingly I felt like just giving up and writing off the game entirely.\n\nGood thing I didn’t, as I chose instead to play the other two Quickies, and oh my are they good. The lack of gameplay instructions did mate it tough, and I did fail a few times. Yet in the end I completed both, and found I had actually enjoyed the experience. The puzzles weren’t so much as complex and difficult to solve, as much as the gameplay and mechanics needed some polish. Easily forgiven, as the game is still in the Alpha changes at the time of writing this.\n\nYou really need to explore and hover your mouse cursor over every little nook, cranny and object to make sure you don’t miss anything.\n\nI was also rather delighted at the fact that instead of simply evading the three bears to steal their food; I could wield an axe and murder all of them. Including the little bear cub that though I was his nanny. Such sadistic freedom made me chuckle, as I stood axe in hand over the bodies of these bears. Blood slowly pooling at my feet. Bacon might be their favourite food; but on this day the bacon made them pay.  All in all Adventurezator: When Pigs Fly has some amazing potential, and despite some gameplay issues all relating to their point and click the rest is rather wonderful. The toolset is perfect for people that want to create their own adventures, and once the game is completed sharing these with the community will easily expand the game and keep the community happy and engaged.\n\nPigasus Games have given people the tools with which to create their own unique stories, whether these are feats of heroism, or madness incarnate. This is certainly worth trying, and keeping an eye on for both the tool set, and their adventure game.","July 23, 2014","true","3.5"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","21","36","0","1"

It comes bundled with a very witty campaign mode where you get to play a complete - and fun - game created entirely using Adventurezator itself, plus a couple of equally fun, fully playable scenarios (or short games, if you will) to help inspire you on the possibilities for your own creations.\n\nI loved the several hidden (and some not-very-well-hidden) references to classic adventure games and general pop culture, and I'm pretty sure you will too, specially if you were born in the 80s. I also had fun playing on the sandbox and making my own short game scene. If some earlier reviewers felt like it wasn't that complete, rest assured you'll find all the tools you need to create your own campaigns including custom cutscenes, levels and actors (PCs and NPCs). All of a sudden I was back in the 90's, felt a bit like fiddling with Microsoft 3D Movie Maker or Klik&Play, but much more fun.\n\nNow, for the not-so-great stuff. Graphics can take a little getting used to (but check the videos, it's pretty much WYSIWYG), and I had trouble with my graphics card. The game still has a few bugs with the camera, and the way some commands behaved felt somewhat counterintuitive to me, specially during the campaign mode, but not enough to take the fun away.\n\nIf you (or your kid) have a story waiting to be told, you should probably give this one a try.\n3.2/5","September 22, 2015","true","70.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Adventurezator: When Pigs Fly is a point and click game that features a pretty extensive level editor which allows you to create your own levels, campaigns, characters and cutscenes. Even though I didn't really spend a lot of time with the editor, I can tell that it is really easy to use. Most of the work requires you to just drag and drop different elements.\n\nThe game includes one campaign that was created by the developers to help introduce players to the different things players could use to create their own levels. The campaign is decent. The main storyline is only like four to five hours long but does include alternate paths/endings which could add some additional time. The best parts of the campaign are the various nerdy easter eggs including Doctor Who and Minecraft among others.\n\nTo truly enjoy Adventurezator you need to want to create your own levels and play other user created levels. The included campaign is not worth buying the game for. If you don't like point and click games or don't want to create your own levels, Adventurezator: When Pigs Fly is probably not worth purchasing. If you ever wanted to try and make your own point and click game though I think you could have quite a bit of fun with the game.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","September 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its built-in campaign is a refreshing and fun take on adventure games full of character and engaging problem-solving. It also showcases the power of emergent behaviour that you can craft yourself in its adventure-game-making workshop.\n\nThe game is absolutely recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in adventure games - especially if you, like me, are tired of their formulaic design and uninspired puzzles.\n\n","September 17, 2015","true","2.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It has reams of promise, I like what little there is, but thats its biggest flaw. Very very little content, very little room for customization that would be expected when designing any type of game. Granted you can change backgrounds, masks and a few other art assets, what really hurts this title is limited ai entity customization. No real selection of body types, hair, or varied species lets say. To make anything really worthwhile that wont look like 100 different other user stories you need way way more customization otherwise every story a user makes will look identical possibly with exception to the text story. Thats just not enough to really warrant a lot of time at this point spent trying to create something.  I would rather have seen the developers add a ton more content and customization at a higher price point. The ability to create your own characters and ai. Ability to create outfits and edit facial features for example.  Art assets like furniture might suffice but still seems lacking. I just dont have the impression that I can create anything vastly different from any other user. I had hoped to create custom fantasy stories for my grand kids but none of them would look very different from the other. This is where this title suffers and its a huge shame as it has tons of potential to be amazing. Its just missing the mark in two very important and crucial areas, content and customization. I know its early access but even the dev posts seem they are content with whats offered. With just some smaller customization features in the future. Hope they realize they have a gold mine in the making. Slow sales most likely demonstrate that I am right in this regard. Needs more, higher price point to justify more features. Possibly an "Advanced" DLC that offers even more depth would even be welcome.","July 30, 2014","false","0.6"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","16","36","0","1"

I have to say that the developers did a FANTASTIC job creating a fully-functional "create your own adventure" tool with a ton of features I never thought I'd see.\n\nI did notice the interface was completely overhauled as well. With the amount of work the developers threw in, I have to give a thumbs up.\n\nFantastic work Petrucio.\n\n\n3/10/2014\n\nI was pretty excited for this game when I picked it up in a bundle about 8 months ago. The engine seemed great and appeared to be the skeleton of an amazing game.\n\nUnfortunately, I have decided to write this review 6 months later with very few updates. Unless the developer has a big update in the makings that hasn't been released, it appears to be an Early Access money grab. In its current state, which is much the same as it was months ago, it's merely a tech demo with very little content.\n\nI highly doubt anything significant will manifest and be anything near a competent game. Thus, I can not recommend it to ANYONE, especially for more than $1. It's a shame too, because it could be promising if the developers made a 10-15 hour game out of it.\n\nWill change and update my review if anything significant changes!","March 10, 2015","true","2.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","2"

In some instances I've clicked on something and have no idea where I'm at, what I'm supposed to do or even how to go back.
