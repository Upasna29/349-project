It's been added to the rotation along with Towerfall, Samurai Gun and Duck Game.\n\nThe music is great, the shooting is super meaty and satisfying and the sheilds are really good. Reflecting a shot into someone's face is hilarious.\n\nI think more variety in map mechanics would be good for longevity. Also maybe different shotguns? sawn-off, assault etc? Could be pick ups or vary depending on character.","December 30, 2015","true","4.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

Visuals are very nice and the soundtrack is awesome.\n\nA bit difficult to master, I think. I would love to be able to shoot diagonally...\nI like that there's a "game over".\n\nI played the Single-player part ("End of Times") and I can only assume Local multiplayer (versus or co-op) would be much more fun!\n\n\nReminds me of Super Meat Boy and Blackthorne. It's the visuals plus the platforms and a bit of the character movement.\n\nIf you like classic arcade games, retro visuals, action with friends (local only), and a very nice synthetizer soundtrack, then try this one!","November 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

A niche genre to be sure, but if you happen to have any real life friends, you owe it to yourselves to give this game a spin. The controls are super responsive and the shooting feels meaty and weighty. It's as twitch and skill based a shooter as you will find. If you're looking for something that's easy to pick up yet has a very high skill ceiling, this is one worth checking out.\n\nWhile it may be in early access, the local multiplayer portion of the game is basically feature complete and highly polished. With a first class soundtrack and great presentation, Demons with Shotguns is a steal at its current asking price. With a single player and local coop mode in the works, the future of this little title is definitely looking bright.","June 25, 2015","true","3.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It definitely works and has everything you'd expect from a game like this but beyond that...\n\nThe gameplay is solid. characters move how you'd expect them to, the shotgun's are satisfying to use and the powerups all do things. (to be honest we never fully grasped the powerups)\n\nAs far as my groups sessions went the deeper levels of play essentially revolved around gambling with shotgun distance. the close you are to the opponent when you fire the more of your pellets will pierce your opponents flesh. However the clsoer you get the more danger you are in as well. Making use of your shield and the recovery time between shots is the most important aspect to winning. You can also run out of ammo so playing it 'safe' means running out of bullets more often and having to expose yourself to pickup more.\n\nArt and music are fine and befitting of the theme although I must admit that the background, characters, and stages blend a little too much at times which did lead to my death. Bullets especially can be hard to see.\n\nEverything works and the game flow is certainly there but the game just seems to be missing its 'thing' nothing about the game stands out as being unique to only this game. All the characters are exactly the same meaning the only thing that changes the game are the stages themselves. there are quite a few modes but it still doesnt help this game from feeling like just another local arena game. I also think pretty much every hype moment will be experienced within a couple plays. Around our tenth game we weren't really surprised by anything that happened.\n\nI'd say if you get it on sale or in a bundle its worth a shot but there are plenty of more innovative arena games out there.\n\nPro-Con thing:\n+solid gameplay\n+different theme\n+nice art and music\n+shotgun metagame\n+mode variety\n-lacks originality\n-elements can blend together\n-lack of hype\n-unclear powerups","February 7","true","0.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

The gameplay is really fun and addicting but it lacks in playable levels, guns, and characters. It was made with Unity. Hopefully the devs make this game bigger since it really is a hell-of-a-lot of fun. Oh, and its funny as hell too. The angel is the funniest and the commentator sounds like the dude from honest trailers: "Frag em all." All in all, if you want a funny game the play with your mates, this could be a good hour spent but if you're looking for hours of gameplay, look elsewhere. Until they add more to the game like interesting levels, a level editor, more characters, more guns, more traps, more awesomeness, I cannot fully say that this game is amazing enough to warrant it a perfect score. I give it a 6-7/10.","July 2, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I had a few friends over and they had a blast playing it.

Really, my beef is more with the price. I feel eight bucks is a bit too much for a game in a genre that has so much stiff competition. I played three players for about an hour - until they whined enough for us to go back to TowerFall. I will play more though.\n\nPros:\n+Good music\n+Environments change over time (e.g. it turns from day to night)\n+Tarot cards are well done, in how they alter gameplay (very similiar to orbs in TowerFall)\n+The shield mechanic may very well be the best thing about this game. Essentially, when you use your shield, if an enemy shoots you at close range it will spray back at them and kill them. Bringing something novel to the table is very valuable in indie games.\n+Devs are responsive and kind, on the forums\n\nMeh:\n.Artwork is so-so IMO\n.Lots of levels, but the differences do not really affect how I play or the strategies that I use\n.As far as I found, there are no differences in what character you choose\n\nCons:\n-For a game that only has local play (no single or multiplayer), there are not enough game variants or customization options for a match. This needs to be first priority.\n-There is something about how the screen is fixed in TowerFall that is more appealing than a screen that zooms in and out like in this game and Duck Game. I don't know why, but I think its just easier for more casual players in general.\n-I am not at all religious, but the in-your-face religious nods can turn people off. It turned off a friend last night, in fact. Its a subtle thing - take the Binding of Isaac for example. They never quite reference anything super-specific. Jesus Juice is about as close as it gets. Demons with Shotguns kinda steps a bit too far. Don't get me wrong - its a cool theme for a game, but maybe just be a bit more classy about religious references. Just my opinion, I am sure people will hate.\n-I mean, I hate to say it again, but I will - this is essentially Duck Game, but without a billion weapon options, multi or single player, character customization, armor wearables, etc. etc. And it was only 3 bucks more at release.\n\nGood luck in the future, and I will change the review if/when enough has been done.\n\n-Ryan","July 16, 2015","false","1.3"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","27","4","15","3","0"
