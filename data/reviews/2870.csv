There are still a few rough edges and design decisions that some might find mind-boggling, but overall it is a great space game that can be polished with the use of a number of mods, some of which bring back 'classic' X features such as automated galaxy traders and miners. (as of the 14th of March 2015 some mod makers are still updating their work for the new moddable UI, some mods are temporarily out of action).\n\nWhen considering buying X Rebirth is important to keep in mind that Rebirth is a fairly ambitious game for a smaller studio, as such there are always going to be the QA problems relating to small teams that have the ambition to make big games, like bugs working their way in, and lacks of resources meaning change doesn't happen as fast as gamers would like. To give Egosoft credit, they have adopted extensive community beta testing for each patch so the game is tested on as many different rigs as possible. On my most current playthough started at 3.2 I haven't found a single plot stopping bug, in more general freeplay I rarely find a bug, let alone one that blocks me doing what I want to do.\n\nThere are still some annoyances in the game such as expected bread and butter features missing from the vanilla game (a lack of FOV adjustment is a pertinent example). But these things, as illustrated by the addition of a great new gravidar, new menu system, and external camera system, seem to have been identified, working their way back into the game as Egosoft move from bug squashing to remedying design oversights. You can now do things like transfer freight and drones between ships, and build stations in empty space, creating a new zone with 7 build points that you can rename. Now, many modders seem to be finding their feet. As the engine is tweaked for performance, and bugs are squashed, it looks like X Rebirth might be headed towards a golden age of modding (if current offerings are anything to go by). The Teladi Outpost DLC brings back more classic exploration, kind of like exploring some of the rim sectors in Freelancer which is a welcomed addition to the X Series. Also the new music in Teladi Outpost is awesome, 1980's inspired synth-pop goodness, perfect for a space game.\n\nThe AI can still be a bit flakey at times, but is improving with every regular patch. Commands for capital ships are still a bit limited: You either set them off on an automated task, or give general orders such as "attack this", "fly to zone", "fly to my position", "patrol" etc. The closest I can think of is it operates a bit like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident (without the GUI)—you give the commands to an NPC captain through comms, or if you use the Co-pilot conversation mod, through keyboard shortcuts. There are a number of significant mods in alpha state at the moment that look to improve AI behaviour (in addition to Egosoft's on going work in this area).\n\nThe economy is running well. New trade software means you can lock in more trades, and a mod like Yorrick's YAT (yet another trader), adds the option of automated galaxy, system, and cluster traders and miners. These all seem to run fairly well with a miniumum need for any micro. The economy is simulated but not 100% real, so the AI still makes use of a number of crutches, but this really doesn't affect the game much, at most it means the player can no longer make obscene profits for doing not much at all. That said, I still make plenty of credits in my most recent game start to keep expansion running smoothly, and the economy is flowing along well. However, if the AI using a crutch is a big deal to you there is a mod that removes the wares from ships spawned by the AI.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY: ASPECTS I ENJOYOne part of Rebirth that I enjoy is the set up: slowly building an empire, amassing stations and capital ships, setting patrols, essentially minmaxing an empire. If anyone remembers playing with lego as a kid, it's kind of comparable to that: you set up a cool base, build lots of vehicles, get a crew together, then muck around - it is a similar kind of ethos involved in the X series but with the level of interactivity we expect from PC games.\n\nAt the moment I have about 10 stations that all support each other while producing wares to keep the galactic economy running, I have top of the line freighters and miners assigned to each station, and defense fleets that patrol my territory protecting my assets. I have named each ship and station individually with all the most well crafted names I could think of (and some stolen from famous Sci-fi and fantasy), prefixed with Iain M. Banks designations of GSV, GOU etc with a few of my own new designations. The little things like setting up an empire in this detail are what makes games of the X series fun.\n\nIf this kind of empire building appeals to you then you will like Rebirth. While my empire is building, I do missions, capture ships, place trade agents on stations, increase my rep with factions, get achievements, role-play and so on. With Litauen's 'Capital Ship Bridges' mod I often sit on the bridge of a frigate ordering profitable trades as it escorts one of my galactic freighters. Then at other times it's just enjoyable to sit back, parked up in one of the zones occupied by my stations and watch the empire hum along. Personally I think if you are expecting a straight-up fighter combat space sim you will be a bit disappointed (there is still lots of fighter combat but it is not the primary focus), the wider aspects of Rebirth such as the empire building are where this game shines.\n\nEven if you decide to not follow the plot the feeling of flying around in space just exploring, seeing new places, and observing the galaxy going along with its business around you is incredible. A number of mods can improve this experience such as 'Ency's mod'* (link at bottom of review) that modifies planets, and adds nebula to create breathtaking vistas and lighting.\n\n\nPERFORMANCEPersonally I get okay performance, my set up is:\n\nNvidia GTX 760\nIntel 4670K\n8 gig of ram\n24" IPS @ 1920 x 1200\n\nI run adaptive vsync at half refresh on max settings in game, including all the driver side bells and whistles from Nvidia control panel, it sticks at 30fps. Some people might like higher frames but as long as the framerate is consistent and the game looks pretty I'm fairly happy.\n\n\nKEY TO ENJOYMENT: EMBRACE MODDING AND STEAM WORKSHOPA good idea when approaching X Rebirth is to embrace modding. The support of Steam Workshop means you can easily pick and choose features, removing things you don't like about the game and picking up new features generated by modders. Check out my curated collection of mods below for a number of improvements that save time and improve the game by adding handy new features, immersive changes, and the removal of annoying ones. One mod I can't support enough is the capital ship bridges mod—simply brilliant.\n\nRemember there is no such thing as a "modified" tag in Rebirth, modding doesn't ruin achievements and Egosoft intentionally made the game easy to mod and added Steam Workshop support, they almost expect us to mod our games and personalise our experience, this means Egosoft can realise their artistic vision of what Rebirth should be and the gamers can have ours—we all win.\n\n* http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=362680&start=0\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=327527055","November 5, 2014","true","687.2"," 1,029 of 1,172 people (88%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","88","029","1","18","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraed/recommended/2870/","kraed","kraedy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraed/","311 products in account","This game is a disaster, avoid at all costs.\n\nX Rebirth is marketed in big bold letters as a trading game with a vibrant, reactive economy and NPC ships that go on trade runs simulating real economies. This is actually a load of tosh. More than 99% of ships (this is not an exaggeration) circle around stations in an endless loop, all caught up in a slow moving pointless traffic jam. They aren't going anywhere, have no goals and just keep doing this loop forever. The other ~1% seem to spawn next to stations then despawn when they are leaving them, never actually travelling to/from anywhere. It's all window dressing.\n\nNot that it matters anyway, since trading doesn't even work. You'll have to do some really pointless trades (deliver 100 units of food when you can afford/store 100,000? What's the point?), and when you do you quickly find that the entire trading interface and ship control is totally buggy and doesn't work. Half the time player owned ships don't actually move when giving orders, and there's no way to view/delete the orders of ships in game. If your order bugs out you have to manually edit the xml files of your save game before trying again. If you eventually get them to move they frequently reach their destination then either get stuck staring at a station, or ram into it endlessly due to awful pathfinding.\n\nCombat is really, really dull. You only ever get 1 ship, it can carry every type of weapon, but can only ever shoot one at a time and has no turrets or other hardpoints. EVERYTHING in this game is done manually. You can't automate anything.\n\nWalking around stations is... rubbish. It's full of copy pasted stations - which you'll notice by station 3 - and NPCs that only have 4 sets of dialogue and just repeat them over and over again. You're going to get incredibly sick of talking to random people about why they're all a bunch of racists, or why VR holodancers are sexy but not real. It's incredibly unengaging content and somewhat alarming how so much of the development time and focus of the game is on a feature that is not fun from the start.\n\nA lot of people have been saying this game 'has promise'. That 'it'll be fixed in patches'. It won't. This game is defective by design. You can't just fix core fundamental game mechanics with patches. Even if they manage to fix the bugs it won't change the fact that everything in the game is completely lifeless and window dressed, rather than engaging or purposeful.\n\nIf there's any one good thing to say about this game, it's that at least it's beautiful. The game is gorgeous, and that's really the only thing going for it.","November 25, 2013","false","12.2"," 2,048 of 2,388 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","048","2","0","54"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xcutex/recommended/2870/","xcutex","XcuteX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xcutex/","37 products in account","Updated for 4.0!\n\nShort version: For the plot, just watch on Youtube. This game cost Egosoft a Roguey (*formerly* a big fan/promoter/guy who runs a nice X-game site) and was a waste of a Cycrow (modder who brought life to a lot of the X-games). This game isn't a sandbox. It's a pretty garbage can.\n\nLong version: Changing the format from my 3.6 review to just be: who did their job right; who sort of did their job right; who did their job wrong; noticed changes for 4.0; conclusion. Misspellings readers notice are prbobabally intentional.\n\nWho did their jobs right?\n\nWell... nobody? Graphics people were here, until I found myself complaining too much.\n\n\nWho sorta did their jobs?\n\n1) Graphics people! Everything is gaugeous! Big 'ole cap ships with so many guns, to the tiny boarding pods (which open up on contact with a ship! Crazy detail)! Character models are pretty bland, and many are bald; apparently it was much worse in 1.0 though. Travelling on highways is still nice; though they've shortened the 'roller coaster' highways. Stations are huge and feel like realistic-ish space stations. Might not prefer the big empty interiors that have less game impact, but that's minor. Big problem: you still glitch through ship/station surfaces and get stuck on the inside. It seems rarer now; either 4.0 fixed most causes or I got better at avoiding collisions.\n\n2) Combat people! Weapons fire, missiles track, but there's very little balance. Missiles are useless in a firefight against fighters because they'll never connect; missiles are the only real weapon against capital ships because lasers are too low dps. Cap ships regularly have 12+ (think I've seen 17) fighter escorts. When you're trapped in a fighter, 12 to 1 odds means run or die. Or rarely run AND die. Plasma/LR turrets (look like beam lasers) have laser accuracy and can 2 or 3-shot an upgraded player ship (the turrets are mounted in groups of 2 or more, so it can functionally be an instant kill). Boarding operations frequently end with 'How did I die?' I have also never noticed any of my ships or stations launch combat drones, despite the fact I keep stocking up on them.\n\n3) Economy people! Ships fly and trade; stations will build correctly now. People assigned to posts will show up in menus and you no longer have to restart to interact, buuuut... Stations are still functionally indestructible and quickly rebuild if you're not actively shooting at them. Player stations STILL take over 24 hours real-time to construct. Construction Vessels (CVs) still don't get integrated into stations like the description says - they're ugly, inconvenient (extra crew needed, etc.), and a huge vulnerability to a station performing upgrades. I'm going to elaborate on stations later, because it was the biggest non-glitch-related let down for me.\n\nWho didn't do their jobs?\n\n1) Story people! Spoilers! You find a unique ship just before someone in an escape pod flies onto your ship (and you let them aboard?). This person stays with you through the rest of the campaign as co-pilot. And is probably the most-wanted person in the game for its first half. Whatta coincidenss! Plutarch (PMC) is suspicious of who you're meeting and order you to stand down. Right in front of a jump gate that's been offline for thirty years. But right at that moment the gate activates! And you go through! And not only don't find certain death, but find allies! Whatta coincidenz! And when you come back, you find PMC is doing a lot of crimes-against-civilization stuff, and it's up to you to expose them. And war, that's been planned for years. The main 'good guy' character also casually mentions "I knew your father. He was a good  man." WHATA COINCI... you get it now. Later, another gate activates (ok, maybe they're coming back online) and leads to the most powerful Argon system (protagonist allies) from before the gate crash! That Plutarch company is desperate and releases weapons using AGI (artificial general intelligence) based on Xenon (rogue terraformer) tech, and then ANOTHER gate opens to a whole system housing Xenon fleets! The Xenon start rampaging (not destroying any stations, mind you), and it's up to you to plant bombs inside a Xenon station to delay attacks. The game could have been titled "Uncanny Coincidences... in Space!" At least then Ego could have claimed some allusion to The Three Princes of Serendip.\n\nChanges I've seen:\n\nCollision glitches happen less rarely than 3.6. Weapon mods - RANDOM modifications to ship weapons that enemies drop. They increase or decrease damage, range, rate of fire, cooling, etc. Not all mods are good. You can craft them with dismantled mods, but the result is random, so you reload a lot. Two new weapons I haven't gotten because the story arbitrarily locks the weapons you can access. Save files are now compressed in .gz format, making them harder to modify. Cargo drones don't seem to get stuck (though we could have used transport devices from previous games and avoided the issue). Home of Light is a thing. I don't regret not getting it, even on sale. There's a tester with a positive review that includes something like "Fix the fog! It's dropping frame rates to single digits!" SETA (time speed-up) is back. There's a jump drive, haven't gotten it (spent time early in the game amassing a big fleet to see if you could kill a station). You can apparently cap certain Xenon ships (stuck early in the plot). There's a mission bulletin board, so you don't have to fly all over to try to find missions. Any mission requiring station defense is a guaranteed win - accept the mission, continue what you were doing before, and get paid. Because stations are unkillable.\n\nThe rant:\n\nThe state of stations is really irritating. They're the only non-randomly generated things in the game, and therefore their creation and destruction is the only way to truly affect the universe. Well, you can construct your own, over the course of days! Who the f*** thought that was a good idea? DAYS. But you can't destroy NPC stations. You *can* bring their hull to 0, but! AI ships (which you can't directly control without mods) are too stupid to shoot at all the modules on most stations, so those modules can't die. And 0 hull stations will be back before you can "destroy" a second station because they rebuild (repair) so fast. Player stations as defensive installations are pointless - spend days making a station that'll shoot a few randomly-generated NPCs? But even as factories, they fall flat. They make stuff that feeds other factories, which make stuff that feeds shipyards, which make ships. The player cannot have a shipyard, which is limiting in its own right. So you can supply one of the few NPC shipyards. Well you can buy ships from them, when they're not making their own ships that quickly despawn. OH! And you see ship info, there's a section for what command they're executing. 4.0 seemed to make that command "???" more. So you go close and scan the ship to find what it's up to. Well, if it's got the 'explore' command, it's going to despawn soon. So, they hid ship commands with "???" because too many people were aware the ships had that despawn "explore" command. Anyhow, you've got your factories. You've got your ships. But NPC stations aren't sand castles in a sandbox; they're steel bars with sand glued on. So, at some point you'll realize your sandbox is really a prison.\n\nThumbs up if the review's helpful.\nThumbs down if it isn't.\nPor favor.","April 27, 2015","false","302.4"," 625 of 723 people (86%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","86","625","723","29","14"

From what i've seen so far.\n\n90% bug free, there are still some bugs that have really annoyed me, (Fighters Clumping together, Remote calling Marine Officers doesn't get his Marines back on board)\nBut the game hasn't crashed on me since 2.5 and the graphics have had a much welcome overhaul.\nFrame Rates have been improved (Still needs work).\n\nThe New Features added since 1.0 are staggering, so much has been added that my instruction manual has been left pretty much obselete. It's not the same game you bought during 1.0.\nJump Drives for Skunk, SETA making a return in 4.0. Plus a new dlc coming out.\nWe are seeing a game that isn't as good as X3, but it's getting there.\n\nThe Game stands out in it's own right and Egosoft never leave a game half finished, their reputation for fixing their games long after release is what makes them worth trusting, even after the terrible release.\nTo those who played it and put it away I recommend you dust it off and give it one more try, whether you like it or not? Talk about it on forums, Egosoft are changing their Minds and you might get what you want eventually; they've already reintroduced SETA after saying it wasn't going to happen.\nThey're listening to their fans.\n\n--------------------\nReview of 4.0\n--------------------\n\nSo far I am over the moon with the changes.\n\n- The new Weapons crafting Mod is interesting way to beef up your weapons.\n- Pirates marauding everywhere, they destroy ships and send cargo lifters to scavange the cargo. (Love that Pirates now have a purpose)\n- Can't wait to test the new Very Hard Difficulty, Pirate swarms sounds exciting.\n- Better reintroduction of missile/drone supply management for Station managers.\n- Attacked vessels now flee battle when they lose a particular percentage of shield (Which really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, as I don't want to babysit my freighters everytime they get a scratch, they now have the wits to run away rather than get shot at till they die.)\n- FINALLY after 2 years they fixed the production cycle bug for Drone and Weapon factories (They're now profitable and skip to the next ware that needs producing.\n- Personally wasn't bothered much about SETA and jump drives being reintroduced, but it was highly demanded by the X Community and i'm glad they listened.\n- The holomap is allot more interactive and ordering a ship to fly to a particular point of the map is a much welcome reintroduction.\n\nThere is loads more changes that I can't remember.\nHope we see a 5.0?

Once the game-breaking bugs and technical problems are fixed there STILL won't be a game underneath.\n\nThe biggest issue is that, compared to previous X games and every other space game, there is simply nothing to do at all. Every feature of this game is a boring time sink - you walk around stations for no particular reason, to find copy-pasted people who serve no real purpose, to aid you in your quest to fly your one solitary ship that isn't in any way fun to pilot. Everything is a chore to do once and then tiresome to have to repeat again and again. The terrible interface doesn't help either, with you and your poor idiotic co-pilot spinning around in your seats trying to figure out the useless map system.\n\nWhy would I bother capturing ships when I can't really do anything fun with them? Why would I build a trade empire and amass credits when there's not really anything to buy with those credits? What's the point in gaining a faction's favour? What is the point?

Yet it works actively against anyone who tries to make good screenshots. There is no way to disable the cockpit view, and no external view. No way to disable the Hud. No way to pause without that the menu comes up. ect.\nMaybe there are ways to do this stuff that i couldnt find yet, i didnt look into console commands or ini files or anything yet. There are probably solutions to be found for those things.\n\nThe rest of the bad stuff:\n\nThe UI is pretty bad, unintuitive. I mean the UI was bad in X Games before, but i wish the old system back after playing with the new one. The fact that they "optimised" it for using it with a gamepad makes it feel forced and bad with M&KB. The learning courve is pretty bad, also because of the bad way the UI is designed.\n\nThere are lots and lots of other minor things, like only one ship with 2 rooms where you can only freely move around in one and cant do anything than close or open a door. The ship stays allways the same besides of functional upgrades that have no optical effect as far as i know.\n\nThe Map is pretty much useless, the one in the former games was leagues ahead of the one they put in now. The stations interiors are looking pretty much the same everywhere. All feels lifeless and staged. The "Persons" in them look like manequins standing around, without any purpouse. And most of them look really horrible.\n\nI could go on and on, this game is utterly rubbish in usability and immersion, yet it would hold still great potential if they would correct their errors and work on the game more. The core mechanics are there, and it does look pretty in space.\n\nI am sure we will see lots of patches and probably also expansion packs / dlc. Which hopefully will improve on the rather bad first impression.\n\nDont buy this yet if you dont have a high tolerance for bad / unfinished gamedesign, take a look at it in a year, it might have matured to be something more likeable and playable by then.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n.... somehow, after all this said.... it still drags me in.... somehow.\nI probably have a high tolerance, or maybe because i played all the former games...\nThe more you play it the less heavy the faults become, there is some truth to that.\nIts more a thing of discovering new sectors and exploring, that feeling of adventure is still there to a point, for me.\n\nIts just not as good as i hoped it would and should be *sigh*\n\n-------------\nUpdate after the new review system for steam and about 10 days after the review was initially written:\n\nEgosoft is patching and updating and improving it since the fiasco that was the launch. We saw 5 patches so far, they work on the bugs, which is good, but most of what is broken is the gamedesign itself, and that is hard to fix.\n\nIts not an X Game any more its something different, it lost its soul and heart.","November 16, 2013","false","11.2"," 1,310 of 1,618 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","310","1","0","24"

I really can't figure out what type of demographic they were aiming for as I've never seen a single individual let alone a marketable demographic that could enjoy it.\n\nThe various types of parasite drones you can employ is actually a pretty neat concept however very little of the game requires or rewards their use.  I't  is often simpler/faster to perform combat actions oneself.\n\nThe hack variant makes your player ship vulnerable and non-responsive to any Tom ♥♥♥♥ or Harry that comes around wanting to pick a fight.

Most of the time they won't even fire back if something starts blowing them  the *** up\n\nThe AI scripting in conjunction with the reputation systems...sigh\n\nThe vast majority of ships one sees flying around are actually fluff they do 1 circle on an indefinite loop never docking anywhere or interacting with anything.  They are ambience nothing more.  Another popular mod is removing most of them as it can increase frame rates.\n\n\n\nWith heavy mod use and a fair amount of time editing .xml saves this game can manage to reach basic utility and functionality for a space sim.\n\nSome things particularly the AI are going to end up being brick walls I think for the mod community; so once all the dust settles you'll still be stuck with a title that's really neither fish nor fowl as far as the platform it's capable of being enjoyed on by most new and old players alike.

I have spent alot of hours in game since XR 2.0/2.1. (Free play) If your wondering if you should buy the game, I strongly recommend waiting another 6 months before picking this game up.\n\nThe games performance has improved but there are still a number of issues with the game.\n\nA small list of the most annoying:\n\nShips not refueling I spent a good hour trying to get a couple of my ships (with jump drives and space for fuel) to refuel at a station. They dock then undock without picking up any cargo.\n\nStations not building Construction ships are VERY flaky on whether they are actually going to build for you or not. They wont build if they're even remotely close to other ships and often wont build for a very long time even after getting all required materials.\n\nPathing Ships still ram stations instead of attempting to move around them.\n\nCrashes Occasional game crashes for no apparent reason\n\nHuge performance hit in hi population zones (I have a high end machine, this shouldn't happen)\n\nShips in fleet on combat missions Your fleet ships are not by any means accurate and they don't give a dam about reputation. If your doing a combat mission near a station expect to get into trouble with the faction that owns the station.\n\nMining ships not mining Self explanatory, sometimes they will just ignore their orders and chill where ever they are. Their info says looking for minerals but the ships themselves aren't moving.\n\nCant dock Occasionally you cant dock on your capital ships (fresh undamaged capitals outta shipyard). This means you cant assign crew to the ship, if you cant assign crew then the ship is often useless. (really annoying with construction ships)\n\nGrievances:\n\nController:\n\nYou need to rebind the controller to be able to target enemies.\nYou have to hit up or down every time you want to move up/down on a menu, you cant hold the up/down button down to move quickly through items.\nSetting quantities is really slow, quantities are set with a slider the slider does start moving quicker after holding the up/down button down for awhile but the delay on this is far to long.\n\nEconomy: *This is non existent, npcs spawn the materials they need out of nowhere.\n\nLack of content / Size: This is the major one for me. The universe itself feels extremely small, the space available to build your empire is very limited, there needs to be way more clusters with a lot more factions (with some of them actually fighting it out). There definitely needs to be a lot more hostility to the game in freeplay.\n\nReliance on NPC construction facilities: You cant build your own shipyard, unless i'm dropping the ball here and missed this completely. (wtf on this one)\n\nLimitation on where you can build a station: You can only build stations on designated construction points. I never played X3 or before so I dont know if this limitation existed previously but in a sandbox environment I should be able to build stations where ever the hell I want.\n\nFinding specific NPCS: I spent a few hours looking for a specialist for a station I built. I tried talking to ships and tried 3 different clusters (Albion, DeV and Omicron) and still couldn't find the npc I was looking for. I suppose specialists aren't meant to be easy to obtain but you shouldn't have to spend hours upon hours trying to find someone to give your station a 2% bump in effeciency.\n\nTrading: Even with the trade computer the trading system is still garbage.\n\nNPC chatter: NPC's will flat out say no to your requests.\nEG:\n\nYou: Where is item X? Them: No. This is incredibly frustrating, if an npc has no interest in talking to you they shouldn't answer the hail or they should give a valid excuse to give some indication to the player what they need to do to be able to get the required information.","June 16, 2014","false","60.9"," 351 of 429 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","351","429","0","7"

I had written a rather long review, but apparently there's a limit to how much one can post, so without elaboration, here's a summary.\n\n- It is a sandbox game with a constraining ruleset. You are only allowed to fly one ship (which is upgradable, that's something), and control other ships indirectly. You can build stations, but they can only be built at predetermined locations in the game. You can not actually meaningfully impact the economy as your profits are negligable, you have no meaningful impact on the AI production, the AI can endlessly spawn ships, and stations cannot permanently be destroyed. So, you can only build sandcastles designed by somebody else, the other kids already have sandcastles that you can knock down but they just rebuild it, and you can't kick any other kids out of the sandbox permanently.\n\n- The campaign, like many sandbox games, is a glorified tutorial, which you need (unless you google *everything*) because while the controls and functions are inherently simple, they are not obvious. However, the campaign also arbitrarily sets you up with an enemy faction, no matter how friendly you were with them before, and this event is *entirely* outside of your control. Fly to the mission location, and it will simply happen. Faction relations range from -30 to +30, with the predetermined enemy faction I was at +28 when I decided to continue the main mission, and the game just set it to -20. Because plot. Which has no other function other than to teach you the game and send you on an exploration through the universe. Accept it will happen, or start in Freeplay.\n\n- Nothing you do has any impact. However, since everything in the game moves at a snail's pace, you won't notice this until many hours into the game. You cannot meaningfully impact the economy. Enemy ships just spawn, they do not get built, they will always keep coming. You cannot permanently destroy stations in order to conquer the market. This last one especially has an important player function: you cannot accidentally screw yourself over by permanently ruining the economy and/or production chains. However that also means that once your own productions are set up, the only result is that prices go down due to overproduction and it means jack ♥♥♥♥ other than even lower profits than what you'd have expected.\n\n- The only ships that are meaningful (other than your own) are capital ships (L and XL size). Smaller ships are pathetically weak, and even the L size ships are at a huge risk of being randomly destroyed.\n\n- The AI is horrible, in many ways, and has seemingly arbitrary rules that rely on whether or not you are present in the same zone. Pathing is terrible, ships will "ghost" through objects when you are not present and thus follow an efficient path, but if you are present, will become stuck in impossible locations. Your mining ships will fly straight towards hostile stations, inevitable getting destroyed, because the closest resource is in that direction. Ships that get attacked, will never flee, unless they happen to be under your (in)direct control which means you get a message when they are half dead and have to press 5 buttons to tell them to flee, which they may or may not do in time. Fleet groups will not stay together, and will arbitrarily not react when a ship in their fleet gets attacked. The best one I found though: at a jump point in a sector, there was a hostile station close enough for some of its turrets to start firing at my ships if they jumped to that zone. I thought I would solve this problem, by shooting the station's turrets. I did so, and it worked, the turrets stopped firing at my ships, and they moved on without much harm. THE SECOND I LEFT THE ZONE, my ships would get destroyed before they could even make their jump out, because the game arbitrarily decided the turrets were back. This behaviour would stop if I flew back to the zone and the game realized the turrets were in fact destroyed.\n\n- Drone AI is FUBAR. If your ships deploy the drones they have, there's a good chance they will not return to the ship once the fight is over, and the ship jumps out without its drones, causing them to be useless pieces of metal where they were left behind. However, the ship will not recognize these drones as lost, listing them as "in use" forever. Unless you manually find them and shoot them. If you sell the ship's drones, and then buy new drones for the ship, the drones will again be listed as "in use". This problem has been around for a long time, and apparently isn't important enough to be fixed.\n\n- Loading times and mechanisms. You load the game, it gives you a loading screen. Not for the game, but for the intro movie. You skip the intro movie, it gives you a loading screen. Not for the game, but for the menu. You load your save, you finally get a loading screen for the save, which then puts you in the game. Should you get destroyed, you get a game over screen. Once you get that to respond, you get a loading screen. Not for your last save, but for the menu. Once that is loaded, you can again start loading your save. If you are in a tricky situation and get destroyed a few times in a row, this gets aggravating QUICKLY. I'd strongly recommend installing this game on an SSD if you have one, it dramatically increases loading times and performance.\n\n- I-don't-know-WTF-you-are-doing-syndrome, AKA memory leaks. The longer you play this game, the poorer its performance gets. I could launch the game, have fun with fairly well working controls and gameplay. After an hour, I would start to notice input lag on my commands (and there's a lot of button pressing in this game, enough for that to get really irritating). After two hours, I would start to notice sluggish behaviour in nearly all departments. Some googling about this problem revealed that the game uses a lot of memory for behind-the-scenes calculations, and otherwise well working systems with relatively low RAM can suffer. That could be a fine explanation, but when this problem gets progressively worse, it's not a hardware fault, it's the software.\n\n- The game is aesthetically boring. Not initially, the graphics are good, there's a lot of detail on the models, and your first few hours venturing into space (as well as hitting some new areas with distinct styles) will make you ogle your surroundings shamelessly. However, after that, you start noticing that everything actually looks identical. A slightly more red shade of paint doesn't actually make a new ship model. You notice the stations pretty much all look the same, which makes some sense in a space environment, modular designs are effective. But then you notice the planets do too. And the astroids. And the mass traffic, which has no other function than taking up space and making space look more "alive" because mass traffic is a bunch of small ships travelling in a circle around an object, or appearing out of nowhere inside a highway. And after a while, the music, which sounds appropriate enough for a space enviroment, quickly becomes boring.\n\nIn conclusion, this game had a lot of potential, and a lot of good ideas, but is overall, fairly poorly executed. You will encounter bugs. The immensely stupid AI will get on your nerves. A sandbox where you cannot meaningfully impact your surroundings, is not a sandbox. A place where every look and sound is repetitive, is not aesthetically interesting. The biggest challenge in the gameplay, is not hitting the wrong button when inputting a needlessly complicated sequence for a command. The plot is a tutorial that doesn't care about the sandbox aspect, since it in no way respects what you've actually been doing. And yet, I have 200 hours in this game, and that is the worst of it all. These problems do not appear until later. My empire of 200 hours, affects nothing.","May 12, 2015","false","216.4"," 152 of 184 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","152","184","12","2"

This is where the game shines to me in comparison to previous X games. If you don’t enjoy watching things unfold from the sideline and only enjoy the flying around capturing new ships to use part of the old X games for yourself I’ll stop you here and not recommend the game to you, unless you like having them alongside you then by all means proceed.\n\nMining is vastly improved though! <<< Like really a hell of a lot better mining system. (still not required for a successful game experience, highly recommend it when you have the extra cash, at least from an automated standpoint when you need to supply your own stations with materials. Otherwise continue stealing freighters)\n\nFewer menu trees (though it’s only good in theory because the automation isn’t there so you just have to hope there is a command you need in whatever situation you got into… if you’re doing combat mission don’t forget to remove your mining ships from your squad)\n(I’d of prefered more menu choices with less of a hierarchy from X3 so that they weren’t hidden away.)\n\nSpace Graphics… don’t look inside unless you want a dollar and old toffee candy.\n\n\nThe Disappointing;\n\nThe bad things that I see in this game are mostly from a lack of automation available to the player in the old X games and missing fleet commands that really weaken the whole spin on having one ship through the whole thing. --If I have to spend 10 min sending orders to trade out, that’s not a better trading system in my book it’s a depreciation of something that was much better in the old X games.\n\nPlayer Stations I’m really disappointed that they are limited to defined areas within zones, the ability to set-up outposts anywhere in X3AP was so cool and satisfying that as I write this I almost feel like hopping over removing tubes and starting a real empire. That being said I do prefer the new player station system as a whole, but the lack of freedom here brings it down to a level below it’s original roots with station complexes. (After getting more hours into the game and scaling up my own economy, I really must say that the game falls way short here, I like the scaling of the stations but the building and expansion of improvements takes far too long and I don't feel like running my computer for 7hrs+ just to have a single section build waiting on supply bottlenecks because my other stations and traders are busy)\n\nEarning cash as a whole just seems so backwards in this game that I can’t even begin to describe my disappointment in this area. In what sense should I have to spend 7-8mil to buy a ship that does an actual economic activity only to make 250k an hour when I can just go long range scan for 15min get lucky and make 1.5mil off 100 crates of station trash items. (Adding in there are really only 3 things you can do for cash, long range scan, board ships, and board ships. For a game speaking of economy as an integral part of the gameplay experience there seems to be a lack of reward for doing the most basic economic tasks in the economy, the way it is currently set-up owning mining or trading vessels is a waste of cash and you must essentially own your own economic empire to even think of making a penny from station building since you can't make a profit because of what for me seems to be a set demand basis from the other factions with their preset number of stations, they need to build more stations in zones and expand against you and other factions)\n\nConclusion\n\nAnyway I don’t recommend Re-Birth over X3AP or over any game really for that matter at this point. not worth $50, but if you could get 75% off or something huge go for it.\n\n\n(After putting a good solid playthrough at 50hrs into the game and scaling up to the point where I had multiple combat fleets the game just feels stale, There isn't the threat of a true pirate menace, my biggest woes are managing an economy between my personal stations and assets through a few god awful menus, or commanding a fleet to jump in or out of combat zones as I wreck, or get wrecked, by the npc faction I feel like killing at any moment. When the ships do get into fights it's a pretty beautiful light show, but that's about all it has going for it at this point. It's fun for a bit, but after the first few station sieges and capital battles you're just grinding in a single player game to grind. You can't effectively manage the systems you take and you can't produce new factions  of resistence to your mighty fleets.\n\n----I'm quite peeved that I can't command Xenon I's which I consider the most beatiful ships in the game and the producers of some of the better laser light shows when carriers and destroyers jump in.\n\n\nWhat Would Improve it!\nAI\nThis game could be better with an overhaul to the menu choices and npc faction ai, micro and macro level ai combat and economy, something that allows for recognition of a certain asset level allowing for new diplomatic options with the factions as an equal, or something to that extent, allowing for a scale up of fleets sent at you or to assist you in zones that you have influence over determined through % assets in system\n\nBetter Ship Designs --- Why are "half" the ships that are flyable freaken  flying Y's that's great and all but I like where the designers went with the xenon I sleek and tons of guns. If I have one ship I better be getting one helll of a show.\n\nLess congested menus, maybe even more of them just less hidden trees of menus, I don't know, but as it is now it's rather annoying. It's like there was no change from the previous games with the continued use of hidden menus. It wasn't a problem in the old menu system of too many menus it was the hidden options, at least for me, that caused the problems.\n\nTrading needs to be automated beyond station purchases, I am going to advocate for an exporting trade option beyond inter station purchases of my own assets. ....unless I somehow missed this and it's a hidden option i'd like to be able to set a trader to export finished products rather than wait for my station to lower the price of its' goods. pricing sliders solves this issue\n\nFleet Management and Supply --- Really needs to be better\nI want sliders for automated purchasing amounts of drones and ammo with fleet managers that have accounts, as it is now I can only manage one fleet at extremely  poor efficiency time wise, literally takes me 2hrs to get all my ships repaired, stocked, and all while making sure they are in the right places.)\n\n...Might Update as I play more, if I play more and flesh out more of my experiences with newer updates or if I think of more issues/positives. --updated after another 30hrs for a total 89hrs (left the game on over night twice to build stations subtract 12hrs, but I count that as actively playing)\n\nnote I'm probably done playing until the expansion release. I'll be starting a new save to get the experience fresh to add to this and any other projects if there are any changes that will affect the early low free capital gameplay.\n\ncurrent review after patch 2.51","November 6, 2014","false","118.5"," 401 of 539 people (74%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","74","401","539","10","14"

Like many others, I was struck both by the sweeping changes to the “X” formula established in the preceding few titles, as well as the horrid, god-awful, soul crushing bugs and technical hang-ups.\n\nI invested approximately 180 hours in the first couple of months, doing my best to study the universe and bludgeon my way through the infuriating campaign, and after doing so (the dev’s released a steady stream of patches through this period, turning the game from utterly broken to sort of kind of maybe just a little playable), and my private verdict to my gamer-y friends and family was “Do Not Recommend, Stay Far Away!” Which hurt a little, because I could see the game’s potential glimmering far down in the deeps.\n\nI think the thing that troubled me most back in those early days was the fact that even if you got past the bugs, which many did by editing game files, the new universe was essentially simplistic and lifeless. Even if all the game’s systems worked flawlessly (and they didn’t, not by a long shot), there was really no point in playing because, in my opinion, the universe and the mega-stations that looked so darned pretty from a distance, were essentially just empty shells, no more interesting or compelling than glittery Christmas ornaments on a well dressed up tree.\n\nNow fast-forward a year & umpteen patches later to the release of v 3.0 and the expansion Teladi Outpost.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes. After letting the game gather dust since early last January, I finally re-booted and started a new Free Play session and dove back in. Right away, I noticed a plethora of changes, ranging from cosmetic graphics enhancements to radical shifts in the design of the game’s UI and underlying mechanics, most of which a very vocal crowd had screamed to the rafters that the dev’s either couldn’t, or wouldn’t, change a year earlier.\n\n-The menu had been switched from a cumbersome, un-intuitive radial style menu to an easily manipulated sidebar style menu, one that was lightning fast to navigate and cool as all hell to look at. Contained within this menu was a newly redesigned map, complete with two different information modes, and a wealth of new tools for tracking and maintaining my property.\n\n-Now there was a reason to actually go into the stations other than to crawl around inside their air ducts: to find loot that was useful for crafting items that was either worth a ton of money, or even better, could be used in exchange for virtual seminars (training videos that could be applied toward your hired officers, increasing their various stats) or even better yet, hiring permanent Trade Agents on any given station who would constantly update your trade computer with current buy/sell offers from that station, the XR equivalent to X3’s Advanced Satellite Network.\n\n--Haulers/Traders from far off systems now populated the universe, such as the factions LI or PMC from Albion trading with stations in Omicron Lyrea, or Canterran vessels docking at the No Limits Spice Farm in Albion space. This had the overall effect of making the universe seem a lot more meaningful and bringing it to life, for me.\n\n--Faction owned destroyers patrol and react to threats and many haulers travel with either fighter or frigate/destroyer class escorts, and the player is free to assign these kinds of escorts to his/her haulers, too.\n\n--Redesigned mission offers & rewards; now there is always something for the pilot to do, patrolling zones and engaging in frivolous but fun dog fights, protecting stations, sabotaging rival factions’ stations, etc. These missions are plentiful and updated regularly, and function not only as a means to put some credits in the players account during the early game phase, but also to build faction rep for the later stages when the player begins to build their trade fleet/station network.\n\n--There are now ways and means to order your squad around that actually work pretty well. Not exactly fleet management, but getting there.\n\n--The ability to place stations anywhere I liked.\n\n--Small shipyards open for business! More capital ship choices for purchase in general, as well as an overall increase of the types/styles/configuration of ships in the galaxy.\n\n--Redesigned highway travel. On this note, I’d just like to point out that with the release of the Teladi Outpost expansion, Egosoft is now introducing a whole new style of sector to explore (new to XR): in Teladi space, you are given a huge area to explore, filled with hidden lockboxes, interesting new stations and nebulous electrical storms that obscure your view and potentially damage your ship, and you are not given any highways to show you the way around. This seemingly small touch does a lot to increase the sense of mystery and epic adventure that was missing from the initial release, essentially forcing the player to explore again.\n\n--Most bugs have been squashed, leaving no game-breakers that I could find. That is not to say that XR does not have bugs, I’ve found some ranging from irritating to downright aggravating, but in all cases they were minor and easily ignored.\n\nI could go on and on listing the improvements, but I think I’ve made my point clear that the dev’s have been hard at work tightening up their systems and introducing new content. I’ve got roughly 100 hours into v 3.0 and I feel that I’m hardly scratching the surface. The bottom line is that they’ve created a rich, compelling, beautiful space-fantasy for the player to become engaged with and tinker about in, a universe that can easily gobble hundreds of hours of the players time.\n\nThe best way to approach X Rebirth is to just enjoy it for itself and not hold it up in comparison to it’s older siblings.\n\nFinal verdict 80/100","December 29, 2014","true","390.7"," 258 of 344 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","258","344","9","10"

And don't worry about the older bad reviews, In the current state (3.61 + Teladi Outpost) it isn't bad at all - just different.\nAnd just like with the old X games, mods fix the things that Egosoft won't or didn't (yet).\nThe Steam Workshop integration means the mods are easily installed.\nWant to get rid of nebulas?

And if you want your fighting rush, on hard difficulty you need to wise up to survive battles against more than a 3 small ships and capital ships are a real challenge (not like before which you could capture with no effort).\n\n\nFactory building is the most rewarding and polished thing in this game, building your complexes bit by bit, to make huge profits later on (if you do the proper ones in the proper locations obviously, Fusion Reactors anyone!? wink wink)\n\n\nAll the game needs right now is exploiting exploration to a greater extend, add hazardous areas, npc factions with more life, etc. but that is already coming in December it seems, anyways, with a bit more stretch in the end-game, that is, what makes sandbox games interesting (lots things to do aside from the main plot story).\n\n\nSo I can only recommend this game as it is NOW and congratulate for a good job to Egosoft from lifting this one up from the ashes. They made a good engine but the state of release was simply rushed and aweful. Luckily they have managed it well.\n\n\nJust buy it if you are into space genre, trading, factory building, exploration (later on), huge cap ship fighting, etc..","October 9, 2014","true","712.8"," 241 of 326 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","241","326","5","9"

Unfortunately from further research into previous games, one in particular keeps coming up, X3 a game from 2005 which seems to have so much more then this game. My biggest disappointment has to be the Albion skunk, it’s just not fun being stuck in a single ship, in a universe with many more interesting ship designs and varied rolls for combat and trade. The point that killed this game for me was saving up the currency to buy an Arawn, a "super carrier" only to find that I the player can't fly it.\nNow this game does have some things in its favor.\n•	The soundtrack is wonderful\n•	The universe is large and atmospheric\n•	Ship models are interesting and engaging\n\nThe following are things that broke the universe for me\n•	Character models are poor, many of the characters look like there in their 80s\n•	The Albion skunk is the only ship you can use. (To hit this point harder: you can only explore the ramp and a break room in the Albion skunk, the cockpit is just a HUD cut scene.)\n•	Missions have terrible rewards for what’s required of you\n•	Voice acting is limited and delivered as if the voice actor was tired and not interested\n\nThis game is NOT worth what they are asking and Egosoft deserves the criticism, this game is worth the 33/100 metacritic gave. Save your money, don’t even buy on sale wait a few more years, maybe in another year or so, this game will be worth 30$.","May 17, 2014","false","6.2"," 152 of 202 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","152","202","0","0"

Missions are buggy meaning you can't even complete them.

You looked attractive and we seemed to have many of the same interests.  I've spent some time with your older siblings and we had a lot of fun hanging out.  They had their quirks, but they were fairly easy to look past and I'm glad we had spent the time together.  I was expecting that being with you would be as much fun, so I went ahead and put my money where my mouth is and picked you up one evening.\n\nLet me tell you what, I was really excited to finally get to meet you in person, and when the time came that we finally DID meet, I quickly went to work learning what I could about you.  You were indeed pretty to look at, but then I heard your voice.  It just didn't come off as natural and you sounded pretty scripted.  That was okay though because I was still excited to find out who you were on the inside.  Well, it wasn't too long before things started to slow down and then you suddenly disappeared on me.\n\nWell, I thought that was odd, but our time together was still new and so I didn't think much of it.  I got to reading about some experiences other folks had with you and it seemed to match what I was doing.  Some folks had some tips on how to further our relationship, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  Made a few changes before we got together again.  It seemed to help some but after hanging out together a few times you started to show that you just weren't that ready for a serious relationship.  Okay.  Let's be honest.  You weren't even ready for a casual relationship.\n\nYou had some serious issues with your personality  Your memory didn't seem to be all that good, as every time we hung out, it was like we had to start our relationship all over again.  This happened quite a few times.  It was really odd, but other folks told me that was normal though it really hacked off some folks.  You also wore the same things alot.  Sure, they may have been different outfits, but they looked pretty cloned.  You also use WAAAAAAY too much glitter in your makeup.  Wow.\n\nIn spite of all that, I kept at our relationship.  It seemed like it was going to pay off too.  You made some changes and we got a little further each time we hung out.  It seemed to take FOREVER but things started to really move between us.  I was able to look past a lot of your faults (which were not few) and put in the time necessary to try to make this work.  It was going great and I was finally starting to get emotionally involved (which admittedly took a bit of forcing) but then it was over.  I was confused.  Is this really all you had to offer?  Were you REALLY that shallow?  All that time you spent in China and you come back like this?  I guess I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nNeedless to say, I was really angry.  All that time, effort and money poured into our relationship and I have almost nothing to show for it.  I now regret ever having met you.  You lied to me about almost everything.  I was really hurt.  I still like your siblings, but I don't think I'm going to trust anyone from your family again.  I hope your parents are as horrified as they should be about what they raised.  I never want to see you again.\n\n\n\nSo I then searched for a new relationship.  Someone who I could appreciate and it's obvious they want to appreciate me.  I then stumbled across you, Dragon Age: Origins.  We spent just a little time together and I quickly fell in love...","January 4, 2014","false","190.9"," 317 of 462 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","317","462","4","25"

I was very much in the mood for space game, and while I had heard Rebirth came out several years ago I was very disappointed to see linux support dropped. Well its back as of a few months ago! This prompted a near-instant purchase from me, after checking to see if the devs had been working on patching the horrible state the game was in at launch. I'm happy to say they have been working very hard.\n\nThis review will NOT attempt to compare X:R with any of the other X games, since its been so long since I've played them. I also won't generally compare it with other similar games in the genre. However I will say that if you are considering getting X vs Elite: Dangerous, I recommend X unless you are okay with an *always*-online game, including for single player. Also, E:D doesn't support linux, which I use exclusively.\n\nGraphics:\nI opted into in the 4.0 beta 6 and it runs very well on my linux mint OS with a GTX 970. On ultra with 8xAA, 16xAF, I get 40-60 fps in every area I've been to, including large battles with cap ships. There are occasional (rare) times where the FPS drops to about 2-5 when docking into a station, but a quick hop to the graphics settings and re-selecting ultra fixes it right away, so I'm confident the devs will fix that issue. Obviously I can't speak to the Windows performance, but since it uses the ultra-slow dog known as DX12, YMMV and I suspect it might run worse than the linux version.\n\nSide note - I installed on a linux laptop I have with an intel 5500 and with a little tweaking to lower the settings, the game runs playably, though obviously not near 60 fps. I mention this because the system requirements state you need AMD/Nvidia, but thats not strictly true.\n\nI won't go into much detail, but this game looks absolutely breathtaking. Destroying a major component of a cap ship results in an awesome looking plume of fire and smoke, that while not realistic for space, makes for a really awesome sight. The amount of 'local' station air traffic is awesome, with a very 5th Element / Blade Runner type feel. You can get scanned by cops, and if you're carrying illegal wares for that area, you might need to hit those afterburners quick! It really helps with the overall immersion.\n\nThough I'm sure there will be a few hiccups here and there in such a massive game, so far I have encountered no major bugs, even in the linux beta!\n\nControls:\nThe controls with a mouse+kb are very good, so if you're not a "joystick jockey" then you'll still be very much able to enjoy this game. That said, there is joystick support that seems to work well enough, and gamepad support which I don't recommend. The gamepad mappings leave a lot to be desired, especially since to control throttle you must CONSTANTLY have the trigger depressed. This should have been a more traditional left trigger=throttle down, right trigger=throttle up.\n\nI personally have found after playing with all the control options (mouse, joystick, gamepad, steam controller) that a custom binding of the steam controller in non-gamepad mode works best for me. My joystick is showing its age so its just not as precise as it used to be. However if you have a steam controller this game is awesome with it. You can get my steam controller bindings in the 'Community' section, titled "XR Non-Gamepad Bindings".\n\nSound:\nEffects are about as you'd expect for a space sim and serve the purpose, with your gun and laser and computerized voices. The music is generally quite good and the main menu music in particular (can't speak to the DLC) is great. It definitely gets me in the mood for flying. Voice acting is awful, which is typical of X games. Just turn voices off in the beginning and save your ears the trouble. In future X games I hope they drop voice acting to spend more time on launch-day polish, which has always lacked a bit in Egosoft games.\n\nGameplay:\nAlright, so this is of course the meat of the game. I'm about 75% through the main plot missions, and have done a relatively small amount of side missions. The plot isn't half bad, and generally better than most games of this type. The last truly good plot I've seen in games like these was way back in Wing Commander: Privateer (yea I'm old) and its expansion. So that said, its a pretty enjoyable plot overall if you can get past the horrid voice acting or just turn it off. It'll feel a bit like an old JRPG that way.\n\nThe plot missions start a bit bland, per most games of this type, but about 40% through you'll start seeing cap ship battles, a prison break thats pretty cool, and get to see a significant portion of the systems and zones.\n\nYou can get up and walk around your ship, or dock with stations and walk around them. It can be somewhat rewarding to explore stations in the beginning of the game, and some stations are quite cool to look at and explore, but most use a random selection of about 5 or 6 layouts so it does get a little dull. That said it goes help with immersion if you don't like to do everything via menus like in previous games, so overall its actually a nice addition. You can, as of one of the past patches, just do pretty much everything but black market trading through menus from your ship.\n\nThis game does not hold your hand, in fact it probably needs more of a hands-on tutorial to explain how to properly do trading, station building, etc. All X games have suffered from this, but my personal feeling is you should take your time to grow into these games and learn/discover for yourself as much as you can while enjoying the game and environments, so maybe thats what they intend. When you really get stuck, an online video or tutorial is just a quick search away. (Try to find a recent video as Egosoft really has changed this game dramatically since release)\n\nI have a decently upgraded main ship, and 4 'large' ships, some of which do trading missions, and some come with me on combat. Seeing and participating in a large scale combat is just awesome looking. Sadly, stations can't be destroyed, but on the plus side this makes the economy of your game harder to really screw up. Some of the 'generic' auto-generated missions are a bit vague or exploitable, however they are actively patching and improving them.\n\nI have not built a station, but the beauty of a game like this is that you can play the go-it-alone smuggler type, the economic behemoth, the private military force, heavy mining operations or just about any other type of role you might want to play that involves space + ships.\n\nI have about 20 hours of play time so far. Obviously many players and fans of X will say thats not enough for a review because I haven't done X, Y or Z. However thats not true in my opinion. I'm having a blast and have definitely got my money's worth already. Since I am not comparing this to previous X games, thats enough to write a review. Also I haven't noticed any linux reviews, so its important to write one for any linux fans who might want to know how the game runs. That said, I expect I'll be enjoyably playing this for many hundreds of hours more. I can't say that about any other game I've bought in the past 3-5 years.","February 2","true","24.1"," 83 of 108 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","83","108","2","0"

I have to say while this game seems to have alot of potential and I am really excited about the future of it, it is sadly in the beta stage.  It is wrought with bugs such as ships not responding, graphics disappearing, missions that are unachieveable with editing the save game file.  The rest of the universe seems to ignore you when you try to build stations and are buying materials.  I left the game running over nite to see if some npc trading would occur over time and nothing happened.  The npc characters on the stations are terriable, everywhere you go they are the same with extremely bad and constantly repeated dialog.  I have tried to overcome all these pitfalls and have spent more time researching how to change the save game file and be able to move to the next mission than I have played the game.  I think the game will be an excellant game when it is completed,  I can not believe it was sold in this state.

Yes, the Teladi outpost DLC fixed a few things but it doesn't change the fact that Egosoft threw out almost everything good about the X3's and gave us... This.\nPros\nThe graphics are simply stunning. I cannot deny the vista's are utterly jaw dropping\nThe music is sweeping and epic\nNew sector system-In the previous game each 'map' was one sector which had so many stations, ships and jump gates leading to other sectors. The downside to this is that they had a rather definitive edge to them and expanding beyond the default size of a given sector was difficult. In Rebirth they have highways linking regions withing sectors so that they are now exponentially bigger\n\nCons\nThe highway system to enable FTL travel between regions means they decided to do away with the SETA drives. Singularity Engine Time Accelerator. In a nutshell, it would speed the game up to a maximum factor of %1000 to allow you to cross even massive sectors rapidly however here your only options to move swiftly are to take the highways, which are fixed and only link between regions one way or to boost your way across at speeds not all that much greater than your normal. However that introduces annother problem:\nBoosting drains your shield. Fair enough, in the last game boosting would eat away at your shield but only if you didn't have enough energy cells to power it. In Rebirth your only options are to arrive at a fight late, or with your shield depleated.\nSteering is either by joystick (and it doesn't have pre-built profiles so you have to bind everything manualy) or by cursor flight. Either pointing at a spot on the screen and clicking the mouse until you're poiting where you want to go or by moving the mouse around on the screen and it will keep turning that way. Now, for those of us without a joystick this can act as a virtual stick, meaning we don't have to move our mice up and reset them mid-manouver however it also feels difficult and can serve to dull reaction times. This was an option in the previous games but that's where the problem lies. It was an OPTION. Here you have no choice in it.\nThe Ship. Now, as I recal in the first X games you only had on ship you could be in, fair enough it was a while ago in computing terms and resources were limited however they soon corrected this to the point where you could fly around in just your space suit, a small one man scout ship, bombers, corvettes, frigates, destroyers, carriers or even, if you had balls that clanked as you walked, The Valhalla. A ship so large it can't actually fit through a gate. In Rebirth, you're stuck in one ship. This wouldn't be an issue if the ship were any good but it isn't. From the top:\nIt's name is the Albion Skunk. I don't know who thought of this but in the previous games it was named the Albion Pride. And no, you can't even change it's text. I might be able to live with it if your co-pilot (more on her in a sec) didn't say it every time you came into dock\nThe ship computer from previous games makes a comback, I'd gotten used to her and quite liked the announcements she made but here, the only thing more irritating than 'Betty' the computer is Yisha the co-pilot telling Betty to shut up\nThe speed is not great, made all the worse by the lack of aformentioned SETA drive and the only boost feature eating up your shield\nDrones, missiles and weapons are all limited. And you only get one gun... One. You can have a few on your ship at a time but you can only shoot one. Even the samallest, least combat capable scout ships in X3 Albion Prelude have two.\nAnd of course, you are stuck in this one ship. Sure, you can get out and walk on stations but you have to come back to it sooner or later. Or spend the rest of your life running the vents like a rat, trying to make a living out of oddly placed credits and random junk you can sell. Either or. Frankly, I'd choose vent rat","October 24, 2015","false","25.6"," 301 of 454 people (66%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","66","301","454","52","24"

The bottom line is that they sacrificed what the X series was all about in order to attract new customers, which is a viable business strategy but is a very dangerous thing to do with a game such as X.\n\nBecause of this decision you get the feeling as if the game was intended for controller use and I think was to be for next gen consoles, but at the last minute I think they pulled the game and Egosoft were left with a game made for consoles which now had to go PC. Now this is speculation, but from the UI layout and functionality it would seem as if this is what the game was geared up for and then had to be quickly ported to PC..... maybe.\n\nMy final thoughts;\nSpace looks lovely at times and flying between floating cities close to a planet looks breathtaking, but on foot in stations and other areas the lo-fi textures are all too evident. Shoddy menu management and design choices (I had to make a whole new set of UI elements as the default set is woeful), buggy/non-working game play elements, annoying travelling mini game, poor ship and NPC AI, clipping and texture issues, sound issues...... in fact let’s just wrap this up into one sentence;\n\nThis game in not complete and will not be for at least another 6 months, maybe try back then.\n","April 22, 2014","false","103.7"," 77 of 102 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","77","102","0","2"

They didn't believe me - they knew Egosoft's reputation for DOA game delivery (as did I) - but I kept the hope alive. And while far, FAR from perfect X3:R and X3:TC with substantial modding proved to be decent experiences in the end. We have to take what we can get in this genre - It feels like there will never be another Freespace 2.\n\nI guess hope died when X was reborn. All the problems I had hoped resolved in this game - horrible AI, ships colliding constantly, UI that can only be explained as having been designed to annoy and torment - were still present and accounted for. And then some. A lot of some. Yes, it's pretty to be sure but not pretty enough to justify the sheer terror it will run your CPU and GPU through. The campaign is nothing more than a broken tutorial. Combat with other ships is akin to a special-needs jousting contest. I could go on and on but others have done my job for me. Lamentably, Egosoft doesn't appear to be listening.\n\nI don't know why this keeps happening with Egosoft's releases. A more naive soul might blame the developers but as a developer myself I have to believe that the product management and sales of Ego's games are driving them straight into the ground. Much like what you'll be doing with the Albion Skunk should you deign to pilot her.\n\nPass on this one. Check back again in 3 years. And don't make the mistake of buying Egosoft before the community has had a chance to find something redeeming and shiny under all this sh*t.\n\n","January 10, 2014","false","46.5"," 115 of 163 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","115","163","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrostDrachen/recommended/2870/","FrostDrachen","FrostDrachen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrostDrachen/","226 products in account","2.20 Review\nWhen I was first set loose in X: Rebirth's vast universe, right after it's release, I was convinced it was going to be amazing.  But I quickly realised that this was, in fact, a colossal supernova of bugs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design that refuses to let you have any fun – and I really tried. I forgot about the game for a while, and came back to play the 2.20 update, hoping that the game would be fixed by now. I was disappointed, again.\n\nFirst problem: you only get to pilot one ship, the horribly named Albion Skunk. You're able to explore it using a first-person mode, which could have been fun if there were more than two rooms to it, and if anything was even slightly interactive. The cockpit is cluttered and restrict your vision horribly, and it took me a good while to find some of the most important HUD elements, such as the speedometer. Which isn't that well done either. Eventually I found a guy that sells different cockpits, ehich there are four of. And so, I was saved from the horrors of the stock cockpit by bying the very open, combat-oriented one.\n\nIf I remember correctly EgoSoft said that there's only one ship to incease immersion and that they couldn't have made the capitalship gameplay fun while keeping the mobility realistic. Well, changeing ships has worked just fine in the other games. I would've paid extra for the ability to change into something with more than one gun. Even if it was just a frikin' shuttle.\n\nThen there's your co-pilot, Yisha. For a character you spend the entire game with, and who's almost constantly talking, you'd think they would have hired someone with some basic acting ability to speak her lines. But while you'll eventually grow used to her awkward delivery, you'll never stop cursing how useless she is. Case in point: if you're piloting a drone, and enemies start attacking the Skunk, she'll just sit there dumbly. Couldn't you, like, move, or fight back, or something? Not to mention her, and everyone else's, bad animations and ridiculous outfits. Oh, and a boob-window on a spacesuit. Because logic.\n\nSecond problem: The voice acting. Oh god, the voice acting is absolutely horrible. It has to be mentioned multiple times. I could rate this game negative just because of it, but there's so much more. The game has a big problem with humans in genereal. On stations – which all look identical – you'll talk to NPCs, who are terrifying, slot-mouthed, dead-eyed mannequins. While space itself feels nicely alive, teeming with traffic and huge ships lumbering back and forth, the interiors feel lifeless and boring. In a nightclub I hear the ambient sound of people drinking and laughing, but it's empty except for two people standing motionless by the bar. Thankfully you don't really have to enter stations anymore, you now can do all interaction straight from your ship. But since it's done as a video conversation with the character you're speaking to, there's no escape from the animations and voice acting.\n\nHow about something positive for a change? Stations aside, Rebirth fares much better when you're in space. Ignoring some messy shadows, it's a good-looking game, with colourful nebulas, asteroids, planets and star. The combat is like jousting in space. Ships make passes at each other, firing a volley of shots when they get close and hoping some connect. Or you can use heatseeking missiles. Hit the spacebar and you can strafe, FPS-style. Hit it again to steer with the mouse. The movement feels nicely weighty.\n\nExcept that the Skunk can only mount one weapon at a time, which are all extremely underpowered compared to the fact that enemies can mount multiple ones, and have near-perfect aim. Missiles are nice, and one of the only ways to make combat work for me. The other is to fly to a station and hope the turrets kill the hostiles before you die.\n\nThird problem: you have separate ships for trading that follow you around and have to be given orders. You couldn't, and still can't, buy any trade-goods with your own ship, everything has to be done with slow and dumb freighters that can't even fight pirates reliably, despite the 20 turrets that are mounted on them. You can't cancel an order without editing your save file, and sometimes the freighter just refuses to move, breaking the entire save and preventing the plot from progressing. It's like I'm dragging a badly-behaved toddler around a shopping centre. Thank god they've fixed most of those bugs by now, but the trading UI is still slightly confusing at times and the ships are still ridiculously dumb.\n\nThe UI... It's confusing and mostly useless.It's designed to work around a controller, on a PC-exclusive title.\n\nThere's so much done wrong with this game, even this full A4 page of text is just the beginning. No matter what happens with stability and bug-fixing patches, its poor controls, awful interface, and dull pacing ensure that X Rebirth will remain unpleasant for all but the most forgiving, die-hard space jockeys. And oh god, the voice-acting...","October 5, 2014","false","14.9"," 190 of 285 people (67%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","67","190","285","28","4"

Expect to spend 80% of your play time flying back and forth through transparent space tubes, 10% flying around space stations within 10 meters of the hull to scan information points and giving trade orders to your ships, and the last 10% pew-pewing spaceships with one weapon at a time.\n\nHere are some of the game's shortcomings:\n\nBoring gameplay consisting mostly of flying through space tubes, as if you're playing some sort of public transit passenger simulator rather than a space game.\nVastly fewer weapon options with no ability to fire multiple weapons simulatenously.\nYou can only pilot one ship unlike previous games, where you had hundreds of choices in many ship categories, from scouts to carriers to freighters.\nAll objects in space are inexplicably surrounded by protective bubbles that absorb all damage from collisions, making the few precious moments spent outside space tubes even less exciting.\nA lot of tasks needlessly require the player's presence, such as chauffeuring ship officers from stations to the ships where they are to work.\nWhen talking to NPCs, you must wait for them to finish talking before your commands take effect, given the fact that a particular zone may have dozens of NPCs of the same type offering their services, this makes finding specific goods very annoying.\nYou are forced to use a cockpit, wasting 30% of your screen on what is essentially a static model with some flashing lights here and there. A discreet HUD overlaid on an unobstructed view of space would be vastly superior for many players.\nThe draw distance is depressing, with objects conspicuously popping in as you travel inside space tubes.\nThe 4 different sectors are basically palette swaps of each other with a few cosmetic differences (a cracked planet here, some space debris there, etc).\nThe script and voiceovers quite obviously weren't done by native speakers, resulting in strange and immersion-breaking dialogue and pronunciation.\nCharacter models and station interiors are very low-quality.\nThe Teladi look like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. This would be funny if it weren't so tragic.\nYour co-pilot's jumpsuit has an embarrassing boob window that betrays a lack of respect for the playerbase.\nThe game does feature a few improvements, however they hardly justify all its shortcomings:\n\nCapital ship components can be damaged individually, adding depth to capital ship combat.\nMore piracy options, now you can not only extort and salvage enemy ships, but also hack them to release cargo.\nStation complexes now exist as superstructures rather than individual stations connected by spaghetti strands.","March 14, 2015","false","11.9"," 152 of 226 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","152","226","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acesential/recommended/2870/","Acesential","Acesential","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acesential/","586 products in account","It's honestly with a heavy heart that I do not recommend X: Rebirth.\n\nFirst some backstory.\n\nI first got into the X series with X3: Terran Conflict.  It was intimidating and daunting, but I got it during a sale, and I figured that I should at least invest some time into it.  While it was a rocky start at first, I managed to learn the ropes and have myself a good time with space combat and trading.  Excited, I bought Albion Prelude, and got even more enjoyment due to the improvements upon the systems.  The addition of the stock market, for example, was very much appreciated.\n\nSoon after playing Albion Prelude, I heard about the development of X: Rebirth.  Promising to be more accessible but just as deep, I became incredibly excited.  Bohemia Interactive had promised something similar with ARMA3 and they delivered on their promise.  I expected just the same from Egosoft- and why not?  They had been working on the X series for more than 10 years- they knew what their fans wanted and expected.\n\nAt least... They should've known.\n\nBut X: Rebirth put my faith into Egosoft into doubt.\n\nX: Rebirth is nothing short of a mess.\n\nFirst off, the game is poorly optimized, with framerate drops quite abundant in the earlier areas and very apparent across the campaign.  Some areas are not quite as bad, but it's very clear that there was minimal QA done.  The computer I use is very powerful but even then it chugs with Rebirth.\n\nSecondly, things are buggy.  Ships under your command behave strangely, trading sometimes does not carry out, and orders can be backed up with no way to cancel them.  Saying that it is a test of patience would give too much credit to the game- it is downright broken.  Patches have fixed some of the problems, but many still hang around.\n\nThirdly, the elements Egosoft touted for immersion are of poor quality.  From the number of character models to the interiors to the voice acting...  The detail is not even up to 2008 standard, much less a game being released in 2013.  This could be forgiven somewhat if it wasn't for the fact of how repetitious many of these elements were.  There's probably only about five or so voice actors across the entire game, all with equally wooden delivery.  Ren Otani's VA is the best, but that's best in the sense of "Of all the moldy sandwiches in the fridge, this one has the least amount of mold."\n\nMinigames have been put in place, but they feel incredibly out of place in a game meant to be a space trading simulator.  Tapping buttons to time "convince" meters for small-talk or zipping behind ships to speed through the highways are elements intended for action-focused games, not simulators.\n\nBut perhaps most heartbreaking of all, the game is missing so many features that made the past X games great.  The radar system is now gone, as well as readouts for speed and distance.  Combat has been given more of a focus but it has lost its complexity and tactical thought.  The elements that should help with establishing a gian trade empire are gone, such as trade automation.\n\nThis is not the X game that we were promised.\n\nThere ARE some things in X: Rebirth that are worthwhile.  The detail put into the universe is nothing short of incredible.  The low texture resolution can be forgiven as there is now a true sense of scale to the world- the highways, one of the most impressive elements in X: Rebirth, zip you from sector to sector, which can range from stations located in the center of a broken planet to derelict but surviving facilities only tens of thousands of miles away from a star.  It's awe-inspiring, flying around in space.\n\nThe base of X: Rebirth is not terrible.  It has given us a more moddable engine capable of a very detailed universe.  But sadly, it should've been more.  Knowing Egosoft, they will work tirelessly to patch and fix the game, but the damage has been done- I've lost a lot of my trust in them.  After being so enthusiastic about a game, I honestly feel betrayed.\n\nPerhaps in a few months, the game may become what I expected.  When that time comes, I'll revisit this review.","November 25, 2013","false","48.5"," 89 of 125 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","89","125","0","0"

The X-Series games are sandbox after the storyline campaign. The campaign is huge and everything works, of course there are tips on the forums for some parts. I stopped using all the mods and really enjoy the vanilla game now. Once you have your first station running you will see how much depth in trading you have to manage. Assign some ships to your station and they will take over some of it for you.\n\nSpace is beautiful and the universe is much larger than even X3 Albion Prelude. It is divided differently, but not smaller. I have a fleet of ships patrolling sectors and many transports running wares all over trying to keep my business profits up. Every transport destroyed has an impact on the market due to the products it would have carried.\n\nThere are many ways to edit your 'save files' but I've learned that it spoils the game. The fun of winning, for me, is gained by figuring out how to earn the credits and build your empire and not just giving yourself millions of credits. When you play this game just be prepared to spend many hours/days/weeks learning about the markets and the universe.

Such complexity was handled in all the previous games with many (but simply) buttons and tables on the hud, now all you have is a small (and dark) multi-level radial menu. That means that most of the options are hidden on sub-levels, and even if you know where to look, it will takes 4-5 inputs before your action will be performed.\nThe radial menu is great for chatting alternatives (and such) on rpgs, but it's awful if you want to submit orders and visualize the status of your ship;\n\n- You can directly control just one, single, ship. You can still submit orders to other ships, but instead a single table, you have to "speak" with the person you hired to work on that ship (see radial menu concerns above).\nActually this can be a minor issue, since the ship is highly moddable and the drone system somewhat mitigate the problem, but forget to jump into your newly conquered ship. Those times are gone, egosoft declared;\n\n- The indoor experience: It's not about the 10-years old models/textures of the interior; It's not about the awful "thief-like" minigame inside it; It's not about the time lost in the search of a specific guy to hire in order to use the extra ship you got (a thing that was simple&free in the previous X games). It's about all of that, and much more.\nAt this state, it's just an ugly and useless feature that should be re-designed, if not removed alltogether.\n\n- Awful dogfighting system. The lack of basilar stuff like the gravidar and the targeting controls (both presents on the previous X) makes the fighting somewhat problematic;\n\n- Doubleclicks everywhere: from the start menu to the last ship that comes your way, if you want to perform a mouse action on an item, you need to double click it. Forget the "mouseOver" events, do you want to make a new game? one click to select "new game" button, and one click to confirm. Do you want to modify a setting? double click there. and so on..\nNot a real trouble, but very, very, annoying on the long run..\n\n- Console port of a game never released on console: The FoV cap. The GUI size (and usability). The low-res textures. The small (aka ultra-compressed) data size. The "xbox" references all over the code. All of these details (and even more) points out to just one direction -> console port.\nHow a game never release on console can be so consol-ish?  some people got a reasonable answer to this question[forum.egosoft.com].\n\n- Terrible FPS and many bugs: Many people got a very low framerate even on high end machines. Others suffers of crashes and many other bugs.\nThis might not be a big issue if they will fix them, but at this state of the game, the point stands.\n\nMy opinion is to stick with X3:AP which is the best out of the series, and enjoy the X world until the Egosoft will address to all these issues or, more likely, will give us the real X4\n\nA man can dream, can't he?","November 25, 2013","false","4.0"," 111 of 162 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","111","162","0","0"

If you just want facts, skip the next 2 paragraphs.\n\nTo begin, I'll state that if you've played X3: Reunion/Terran Conflict/Albion Prelude and loved them, this is not a sequel, spiritual successor or anything along those lines. X Rebirth falls under the "inbread abomination" category. It borrows heavily from the lore, but not from any of the concepts that made the previous titles fun to play.\n\nDon't be fooled by the positive reviews, half of them aren't even consistently deluded. With comments like "10/10" then individually listing the areas of the game as followed "Sound: 6/10, Graphics: 8/10, Gameplay: 4/10. Totally loved it" it's as if the positive reviews came from people either associated with the company or from people so dissapointed that they decided a drunken review to sucker more people out of their money was the best alternative to admitting this game was a flop.\n\nGraphics: Nothing special here and if it runs on your computer properly it can be very pretty at times, about 50% of the uses are consistantly reporting massive framerate issues even after 6+ months of release. It uses directx 9, which is several generations old at this point and most believe this was due to it's, all but confirmed by the devs, origins as a console port.\n\nSound: The voice acting is mediocre to bad, it's repetitive too so there is really no way around listening to it.\n\nControls: Severly limiting, more complicated than previous "X" titles due to a complete failure to streamline them into a simpler form. No initial support for flightsticks on a space sim, the menus you use to navigate and control your *cough* "empire" *cough* are obviously designed around the limitations of a primarily controler driven interface, they took the menus from previous titles, removed them, then added in even more awkward and convoluted replacements that are twice as hard to navigate and produce half (if even that) the intended results.\n\nGameplay: If you like ultra repetitive minigames where you ping the map then blow up space debris for money, you'll love this game. If you like reflex minigames where you get to hear horrible voice acting, repeated over, and over, and over etc. you'll love this game. Your ship, The Albion Skunk, is essentially invincible and overtuned to the point that it's almost not fun. The ships in your fleet can't be directly controlled, they can only be given very, very basic orders and they often decide the best thing to do is follow you instead of completing those orders. These ships die or just dissapear because they're probably as sick of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game as you are at this point.\n\nDon't waste your money on this game, the only thing they did right was hyping the hell out of it to sell copies and even then it's arguable if that truly was the right thing. After this stinker, I'd be hard pressed to see how Egosoft expects to sell another game in this franchise to anyone.","June 20, 2014","false","6.6"," 128 of 191 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","128","191","0","4"

The trailer and description of what the game is, are as accurate as Aliens: Colonial Marines was to it's demo, or possibly even far worse.\n\nReading through the description of what the game is supposed to do is actually more fun than playing the game. You get more fun counting the lies and laughing about how absolutly untrue the description of the game is. It's like if someone runs up to you and starts telling blatently obvious lies, you smile and probably get a chuckle or two. That is at least enjoyable.\n\nThis game is an anomaly in itself. It is broken to the core. It is actually designed wrong, and to work against itself. I have never in my life experienced anything as fustrating as this game, never.\n\nI don't think the developers even know what a video game is, seriously. The absolute basic "unwritten" standards of gaming do not exsist in this game. Simple things like telling the player what things are. Letting you know what to do. Things like pressing I for inventory, or, even the option to map it to a key (Inventory is not mapable to any keys!!!)\n\nNo instructions or idea as to how to do things, it just tells you to do them. Many items in game have a description saying "no description". There is a limited 6 button radial in-game menu, where one option is next page..  and sometimes has 4 or so pages worth of options, on a 60+ button controller (The KEYBOARD!!!)\n\nSeven year development time.. What were they doing? Why aren't the most basic standards of gaming in here.\nWhy did the game have game breaking bugs on mission 1 and 2. How did it get released? Did anyone even try to play the game first? Was there even 1 single game tester? In seven years of development, you never figured out that the first couple missions have game breaking bugs!?!?!?!?\n\nHorrible frame rate unless you own a low end - mid spec PC. That's right, the more powerful your computer / graphics cards are, the worse the game runs.. Wow. Like I said, this game is an anomaly.\n\nStations are copied and pasted hundreds of times each, with a total variety of maybe 3 or 4 at most. Why not release an editor, and ask people to submit station designs, then you load them into the game for free. Name it after the creator. Why not? People will do it for free for you.\n\nWhy are the developers so terrible at what they do? How is it possible. I know I will never ever buy another game before reading a review ever again. I will never buy a pre-order ever again, and I will never ever buy enything from Egosoft again.\n\nWhat an accurate name too, I bet their ego's are very soft after this absolute worthless unfinished joke of a "game" was released.\n\nWant a score?

But after playing it a few hours now (waiting for patches to make it run ok on my machine) I have to accept that this is nothing like the X3 I enjoyed so much.\n\nThis is a console game. It's extreamly beautiful in space when you fly around but it feels like you're in a FPS game and not in a space trade sim. I hate the huge space stations with tine little dots you have to fly around and find to interact with. The space station you can (or should i say forced to) walk into.... terrible. Horror. It was cool the first time. The 2nd time it was annoying. The 3rd time I had to dock, watch the animated transitions as I exit my ship and walk into the space station to find some NPC I could only think about if there was ANY way to completely skip this... The animated transitions for everything. I hate it. I want to click somewhere and get a instant window with possible choices and issue my commands. I do NOT want to watch animated screens in the ship cockpit move up and down.  I just wish I could radio all NPCs from my ship and never ever have to set my foot in the space stations.\n\nAnd the voice acting... holy crap. I don't want to trade in this game because of the repetitive NPC speeches when you trade with them.\n\nX3:TC was hard to get into at first but once you understood it... it's a awesome game. This game only has one improvement over X3 and that is the graphics in space. Every single other feature is a HUGE step backwards.\n\nI'm not sure patches will fix this game. The gameplay itself and the overall gameplay design is just so bad. Performance and bugs can be fixed but this game needs a huge gameplay change to get fixed, I'm not sure it is possible. They have to remove so much to fix it it would be like starting from scratch with a new game.\n\nIf you are interested in space game where you fight, trade, explore and build X Rebirth is NOT the game you are looking for.","December 7, 2013","false","13.3"," 77 of 108 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","77","108","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpiritOfDeath2/recommended/2870/","SpiritOfDeath2","Sir Protagonist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpiritOfDeath2/","251 products in account","After replaying this after the 3.0 patch, and with a fresher mindset, i feel I can give this game a fairer review.\n\nIn a word, X rebirth, is alright. I really wish steam reviews had a better system than a thumbs up or down, because I do not believe this game to be praiseworthy, but neither should it be within the mostly negative on the steam page.\n\nIt is not by any means a bad game, but it is not a great one either. I still feel if you are wanting to get into the X series, to start you should play X2: the threat or X3: Terran conflict (or Albion prelude, AP is essentially an expansion for TC anyway) however on its own, X Rebirth stands a good space 4X first person space simulator. It has some nice looking paint, a tutorial that is excellent for teaching new players to the X series (whereas before, the game plonked you into a grand universe, without even controls to do anything, with the exclusion of X3, where there is a flight school, that simply tells you how to move your ship. To start this mission, you must open communications with it, which the game neglets to give you the command to do so)\n\nMany people were also afraid of the bugs when it first came out. Most of the serious bugs have now been squashed, and the game playable, there are still errors that can be easily seen, but thankfully none that impact the gameplay massivly (the worst ive seen is a group of NPC ships getting stuck together). Although I feel that Ego was going for a major shift in gameplay, alienating many fans of the X series. I do not think that this was made to be a Space management game. Trading takes too long, and profits made during runs are often not worth the time. However, I feel that Ego was going for a more, action RPG type game, and tried to blend the X formula into it.\n\nFor example, combat is a lot more profitable now, than in previous games. Repairs for your vessel could cost upwards to a few million credits in any previous X game. Here, it should cost less than 100 grand, no matter your hull. This isnt even accounting for the seemingly Hyperinflation that occured during the time of Rebirth, money is no longer measured in the hundreds of thousands, but in up to 4 digits. For example, say I had 5,264,194 credits in my account. Any previous game would show that as 5,264,194, here it is shown as 5.264M. It does not go into detail about exactly how much money you have, which would be necessary in a detailed management game.\n\nThe speed of combat, and the changes in the combat system have also been changed to be a lot more faced paced. Another change to make it into a more robust Action game. There have only been a few instances in which the player was actually given a character, however those were really only referenced in the main plot missions, and then it was simply by name most of the time. Here Ren Otani (thats you) is not only given a name, but a voice and a very slight personality. He can walk around on ships, engage in talks with other people, and the player now actually thinks about who it is driving their ship, rather than the mystical being who manifestes as a space suit.\n\n\nI shall be continuing this review as i get further into the game, but for now, a TLDR section.\n\nX Rebirth, is not worth $40, it is an okay Space sim, with some light space managerial options and a heavy emphases on combat. It is a good game for new players into the X series to try out to get used to the ideas of how a X game operates, before moving onto a previous title if they are intrested in the management and stratergy of those games. But for now, pick up the game on sale (for $15-20 bucks or less), itll be worth your time if you havent tried out the X series and wanted to learn about it, although this game is not an accurate representation of how a X game operates. Although, space exploration is an absolute pain in this game, and areas quickly become generic.","September 28, 2015","true","11.4"," 122 of 183 people (67%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","67","122","183","10","0"

The space graphics while not Crysis are not bad in my opinion for something of this scale. I liked the new transit system as the gate system from X3 was feeling really dated. In general I liked the interface for this X game better than X3. X3 felt like a where's waldo game when you were trying to find the right command or menu for what you were looking for.  Some would chock up some of this as cut features (and it is to a large degree a simplier game than previous installtions), but I still think they did a better job with the interface this time around. It was easier to tell what a specific weapon was going to do or what effect it was going to have on my ability to fight. Hooray for not having an ai that suicide bombs into asteroids like in X3 too.\n\nThe Bad: The graphics when in a space station are ♥♥♥♥ poor by any standard today. The textures and models for NPCs are worse. There isn't a lot of variety in this game. You only get to actually pilot one ship. The dialog lines repeat...a lot! I've heard the same string of dialog from the same person 3 times in the course of 2 minutes and I didn't try to make them talk either.\n\nThe Ugly: The bugs, oh god, the bugs.  I can't say I wasn't expecting this one though. I challenge anyone to name a game of this scale that hasn't had a lot of bugs. It's just inevitable with this size of a game where it's not a linear game like Call of Duty. That isn't an excuse for them releasing it this way, but take it for what it is. The game made me rather nauesous, but I can't put my finger on why. I suspect it was somethign to do with the FOV, but I haven't had issues like this with any other game so I don't know. Trading is done now by docking and actually walking to the trader. This is nice at first, but tedious after a while when a vendor only sells a few of each ware. It makes it hard to trade. On the other hand there are little "trade hubs" for lack of a better term that allow you to dock on them and buy or sell a resource en-mass. Though it took me a while to find them. It was still really restrictive and I only ever seemed to find basic wares with this method.\n\nSummary: This game isn't ready for purchase unless you're willing to deal with the "The Ugly" section mentioned above. I hope they can make another X game and that this doesn't kill the company because I liked where they were going with some of the stuff they added.","November 25, 2013","false","3.5"," 96 of 141 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","96","141","0","0"

Rebirth was the most "attractive one" for me. New interface (let's face it, the old one was terrible -> keeping it complex doesn't mean that it should also be inaccessible), station interiors, a story line that will suck us in and so.\n\nWell, first of all, the cockpit design was good, at least as an idea. Being able to wander around in your ship is also good. As an idea.\n\nWhat Rebirth did wrong is that, all the ideas that would elevate the gameplay were implemented so bad that, they actually hurt the title.\n\nThe interface causes more issues than fun. Yeah, every space sim fan loves to wander around in their ship, experiencing the roleplay of a space farer. However, when that cockpit causes you to loose your tradeships, fail your missions, limit you from using other angles to see your ship, etc. it becomes a burden. Come on, Privateer had multiple angles and camera views AND a cockpit view. A game that came out two decades ago!\n\nThe story, it could've been interesting, even if being a total cliché. However, the voice acting KILLS the atmosphere. God, the voice acting is SO bad that, you will IMMEDIATELY want to turn the audio speech off. The dialogue scripts are also terrible. It is as if a kid wrote the whole script. You meet with the remnants of a long time enemy, in two sentences, you decide to help them fix their base. They are not surprised to see you, you are not surprised to see them etc.\n\nThe interiors are all the same, with little to zero difference. The station dialogue stuff is basically trading menus while staring at an NPC, a very badly modeled one to be exact. The "dialogue like" menu is also completely useless. It looks like a pre-alpha stage Mass Effect dialogue tree used for a menu system.\n\nThe co-pilot you get in game as a part of the story is also completely useless. Whenever you are occupied with something else, she just... well, she just "exists" that is all. No autopilot, no anything.\n\nThe dialogues with other NPCs are also terrible.\n\nThe only thing I liked about the game was the graphics. They weren't on today's high end standards and the game crashes or stalls more than a player can bear, but they were still good.\n\nHowever, gameplay elements of the game were poor at best in every sense and in every department that, it would be disrespectful to recommend this game as a part of a genre where you can find titles like Privateer, Freelancer (in all its flaws), IWar, DarkStar One (even that one is better) and worse, other X games. Heck, even playing back the very old classics like Elite would be much more fun, while you await for the upcoming Star Citizen and Elite 4 as a fan of the genre.\n\nI was really hopeful about this game, even pre-ordering it.\n\nSuch a shame... So much potential down the drain.","November 25, 2013","false","4.5"," 68 of 96 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","68","96","0","0"

So believe me when I say I could not be more disappointed with how X-R came to be. 7 years in development, when in reality it was 7 years of Console development, a failed pitch to Microsoft, and a quick cash grab to recoup the costs of their monumentally dumbed down game.\n\nFrom design decisions based on programmer's personal beliefs (no automation, jump drives, SETA, mind numbingly boring minigames), to decisions that simply boggle the mind (no cancelling of trade orders, your ship carries no cargo, you personally have to drive around and order your ships to trade, literally nothing in the game is 2 button presses to issue an order)\n\nSure, the space cities look damn pretty. From the outside. Because they had to be, because to even interract with one of these gorgeous space cities, you have to scour the entire external surface with a fine-toothed comb to even dock. And when you do, you'll wish you hadn't. X-R features the most hideous, badly rigged and designed character models I have literally ever seen. The models in X2, a game over 10 years old, looked better. Between that and the mandatory hunting of arbitrary pilots to pilot your ships *for* you (because you will never leave the Skunk for something better), the disgusting 'find the crates' minigame, and the heavily Consolized conversation wheels, you'd wished you stayed outside, and wonder how this ever because a feature.\n\nNext we have the Universe. Something that the X series is pretty well known for; it's huge, sprawling universe that you are but one speck of. Well good look seeing the universe, because the new map system is taken out of a preschoolers scribble book. Not that you would even need a map, because there are only 4 regions to explore. Admittedly, they are divided up into 5 sectors, dozens of zones and plenty more inbetween, but cmon. X3AP had 213 individual sectors, and there was more life in the empty sector of Maelstrom in X3 than there is in 90% of the zones in X-R. There simply is no life. Lots of show and distractions, but peek behind the curtain and you realize that all the NPC ships around you only exist when you're there. Ships in space highways literally do not exist outside of those highways. The flowing traffick that weaves through space cities? Completely arbitrary ships with 1hp that have no repercussions for you shooting 10,000 of them.\n\nI literally cannot recommend this game to anyone on the reasoning that Egosoft has patently *lied* about the kind of game Rebirth was going to be. "Less complicated, but the same complexity. Complexity is good, complicated is bad" keeps being one of the biggest phrases attributed to this game, but it simply is not true. The 'new and better, more intuitive' UI is literally light years behind the UI in X3, and that is seriously saying something.\n\nPlease, do not buy this game. Give the money to a charity.

I'm a veteran of the X series of games, and familiar with the development cycle that Egosoft implements.  Their games are deep, and complicated; and while this one goes in a rather different direction, it is no exception.\n\nIt's just that as it was released, it was a pile of alpha code that was being charged a premium price.   And really, I can't really advocate that pattern of behavior.   But I do accept it, because Egosoft follows through.\n\nThey could have just given up, as a company like EA, Sony, Microsoft, or Activision would.  Just leave the game as a failure and move onto something more profitable.   But Egosoft continues to work on the game, refining it and polishing it to a point where it meets the expectations set out for the game in the first palce.   Is this the best way to develop a game to 1.0?  No.  And make no mistake, what is 1.60 according to Egosoft is really 1.0 according to the fans of the series: The first version the is the full game, released as promised.\n\nBut it is here, and it is a good game.  Again, not without flaws, but it is now a worthy member of the X series of games.   And anyone who enjoys these types of space games is going to get their money's worth from  X Reunion.\n\nJust a final note about the reviews:  Most of those negative reviews come from the initial release of the game, where it was more or less universlly panned by a righftully-dismayed crowd who purchased it.   But look at the recent reviews!   Now that the game is fully patched up, it is getting mostly positive reviews, and people who might otherwise reject this game becuase of that review ratio should please take note of that fact.","October 30, 2014","true","18.7"," 143 of 225 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","143","225","7","0"

In an effort to try to be more friendly to newer players and stem the complexity of commanding your fleets, they’ve pushed the menus towards an even more difficult mess.\n\nInstead of having a point-and-click interface, time was spent in generating a main menu that uses a radial design[...] The downside is that while the design works alright for the controller, it caused keyboard inputs to suffer. [...]\n\nTrading seems to be tuned for some interesting changes.  For “bulk orders” you don’t order a ship to a station, [...] you enter into buying and selling agreements with a station that you assign to a capital ship on your behalf. [...]\n\nThe downside is that with this method, trading is slow and prone to failure, with what appears to be a fairly critical bug if the ship can’t complete the trade. In this case [...]your ship is stuck with these goods permanently. Hopefully we will see this resolved soon.\n\n[...]\n\nWhile on a station, you’re given the opportunity to take everything that isn’t nailed down. While the game seems to acknowledge the strange behavior in the form of the main character Ren Otani asking his companion “What’s wrong with you?” as a direct response to her suggestion that you steal everything, nobody else will seem to mind. [...]\n\nOne interesting thing that I’d like to see explored further later on is the use of officers for capital ships. While you are limited to one ship, the Albion Skunk (complete with anthropomorphic suggestive hull paint and all), you can gather a fleet of capital ships and smaller ships. In order to have them operate correctly, you must hire a captain (for capital ships) along with support crew like a defense officer or engineer, or a pilot (for smaller ships) and assign them to their craft. This is a little tedious[...].  With that said, this gives a little bit of an RPG mechanic as the characters you are hiring have different skill levels that will ultimately affect the effectiveness of your fleets and also gives a little more personal approach to fleet management.\n\nVisually the game is stunning. Space tends to be extremely busy around stations and it doesn’t have a problem showing you that. Egosoft mentioned that each ship was supposed to be important, representing a functioning piece of the economy, but it seems that a smaller vessels around stations (that may represent civilian traffic) don’t really have a purpose as they just circle the stations endlessly. [...]\n\nThe voice acting is pretty disappointing. While I’m not one to expect anything stellar from Egosoft seeing as how the studio is based in Germany, the stark difference between previous games and X Rebirth is there. It doesn’t help that they managed to get someone that sounds more variable in tone and a native English speaker to play Ren Otani, while your companion falls in line with what sounds like a script reading. Previous X-games were consistent in voice talent quality, X Rebirth isn’t which makes it worse.\n\nRepeating lines are a common problem too. While on station you will hear anyone and everyone mention at least five times that they are amazed that the inter-station highway, used for fast travel between sectors of space, wasn’t present 40 years ago. It doesn’t help that in some cases you’ll have a chance to talk up people you want to do business with that will also have Ren Otani spout off how it’s amazing the highways weren’t present 40 years ago as well.\n\nFor all it’s faults and all it’s problems, X Rebirth has a decent game to play once it’s chiseled free from what is marring it. [...]\n\nWhile I am writing this recommendation, I only do so as a service to friends and readers. Buy the game if you’re wanting to get a look at it, just expect it to be a little rough until Egosoft has made it’s sweep on trying to clean it up. Otherwise hold off for a little until after.","November 18, 2013","false","9.1"," 74 of 109 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","74","109","0","1"

The Devs have done a lot of hard work to fix many things, and it shows. Many people I have spoken with believe the game has gone from a 1/10 to a 7/10 and counting. The great thing about egosoft is they don't release a game and then forget about it. They constantly add to it and update it over time.\n\nI feel like X-R at release was simply the release of a foundation/framework that was meant to be built upon over time, both by the devs and the modding community. This turned many people off because they expected a completed game with every single bell and whistle they desired. Those bells and whistles were not in at release, but they are here now.  Either by the devs or the great modding community.\n\nThe devs have fixed almost every bug I've ever heard of/encountered. They have added very nice UI improvements and quality of life features.The mod authors have filled in the gaps with afew nice things, but I wouldn't be surprised if the devs added them to vanilla.\n\nAll in all I am excited for the future of the game! I am actually having fun this time around.","October 15, 2014","true","90.0"," 160 of 254 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","160","254","3","1"

To their credit, they've come a long way and made some good progress on this one.  I can at least say that any product you get from Egosoft, they will absolutely stand by both it and you 100%.\n\nUnfortunately there are still some big problems.  There is currently no good way to control and issue orders to large fleets of player controlled ships.  Even when issuing orders to a single vessel, you actually have to engage in a conversation with the captain of that ship to tell them to do something.  20 seconds to issue a single command?  Not good.  Especially not good in combat situations.\n\nThe campaign was an attempt to train the player in all the things they can do in the X Rebirth universe, but it doesn't do a great job.  For example, you are shown how to board a ship.  What it doesn't tell you is that the team of 8 marines you do this with would NEVER be able to take a similar ship during the real game, most especially not one at full health.  Thus when you attempt your first real capital ship capture, you are met with spectacular failure no matter how many times you reload until you finally hit the forums to discover that you've been misled.  Also, now that you've captured your story scripted ship, how does one go about fueling and repairing it?  No explanation given in game.  To the forums, once again!  Not acceptable given the campaign itself is supposed to be answering these sorts of questions.\n\nX-Rebirth has come a long way since launch, and I would definitely do business in the future with a company like Egosoft, who so clearly stand by their products.  But can I recommend this one for a full $30 price tag?  No.  Sadly, I still cannot.

This game is a different approach to the Space genre in which the original X Series takes place. Similar to ELITE or other sandbox type Space games.\n\nOne word in advance:\nDo not exspect anything like the X Series you know abide the familiar Universe it takes place in.\nAlso it is frankly said very much dumbed down in terms of depth compared to X3 Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude. The player can only directly control his ship which can be upgraded with various things such as weapons,shields, engines,drones, etc. Most of these upgrades lack completely in variety though. Compared to X3 this is nothing but a arcady version of the amount of gear and weaponry that a player could aquire for a vast array of ship types which he could all fly himself or let the Ai control.\n\nHaving been in the pipeline for about 7 years (and that is a peculiar amount of time which does not reflect either in content or polish of the released product) X Rebirth was released late November 2013 and was greatly anticipated by the fan base and new players alike. It was quite a success commerically at start unlike the X games before.\n\nBut the policy of the Developer Egosoft and the Publisher Deepsilver not to send out playtesting promos to the Press and the concealment tactics of the Lead Developer on presentation in the media and on gamescom lead the trail of lemmings right to the slaughter.\n\nReleased in the EU for a hefty price point of 50€ which is far more exspensive than other similar productions of that proportion and in other markets like the US for only 30$ the price policy alone must give us thought, given the fact that the major fan base of X was always European sounds like cash cow milking and promoing the new markets with a lower price point.\n\nWell if a developer thinks his game is worth 50€ then he better deliver on spot....no?\n\nWhat the customer got on release day was nothing but a bloating mess of desastrous bugs,\ncrashes, plot stoppers.\n\nDespite the old and dated directx 9.x based engine and the very strongly indicated signs of a failed XBOX360 development in the codebase the game looks very good but suffered and still suffers on various framerate issues an slowdowns on even the most powerful systems.\n\nSome work has already been done on that with early patches..but still the game is released in a state of not being playable at all.  All crtiic sites reflect that opinion.\n\nNevertheless it hurts to see the game series come to this point of cataclysm...\nbecause the problem with X Rebirth is....you WANT to play it....you WANT it to be good ...and it keeps making you come back to it every now and then to check if things have improved. A lot of people might not have the patience.\n\nMy verdict after 50 hours not being able to complete the plot or enjoyably play a game in Free Mode due to bugs:\n\nDo not pay full price for unfinished business. Wait at least 3 months and grab when deals are available and the most painful bugs have been hopefully ironed out.\n\nMy word to the developer... Repent and change your paradigm of how you interact with your fans\nand how you release a product. Next time we want to see you go OPEN about it not in closed\noff forums hidden away with a group of elite community people. No this needs EARLY ACCESS\nand lots of input to be a better product next time.","November 25, 2013","false","80.1"," 53 of 76 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","53","76","0","0"

I have never written a review about a game before but being a long time X fan since X3 Reunion and loving Egosoft for always supporting thier games forever ... not for money but to do the right thing for thier product and customers, I feel that the overall review score on Steam is now an unfair one.  When this game came out I was so disappointed and it was almost unplayable.  Over two years later this is the game I expected on release.\n\nSeriously everyone completely forget the reviews from 6+ months ago or so.  This is a different game.  This is a playable game. This is a very emersive fun to play game that has the unique X universe feel.  You can really do what you want in the universe Egosoft created.  Be a pirate, mercenary, trader on a micro scale doing everything yourself or simply sit back and coordinate your fleets, fighting or trading, and let the game be more of a macro sim.  Even better ... mix the two!!\n\nThe character models are not the best and walking on stations and interacting with NPC's isn't as emersive as something like Mass Effect, but the space sim feel is deep and emersive.  If you like open world type games like GTA and you like space, then give this a try.  If you are an old X fan who was burnt when this was released or if you never have picked up an X game, after this 4.0 update now is the time to do it. I have the Teladi DLC and I will be buying the Home of Light DLC too.\n\nThis game will give you many hours of fun and has high replayability as well.  There are some high learning curves if you have never played an X game before, but it is very much worth it.\n\nTL;DR.  Forget the past two years of comments and reviews, this is a new game, one that should have been released in this form. Open world (universe) space sim unlike any other I have played. Egosoft the best developer who doesn't chase profitttsss but supports thier product and customers for years after release.

We were told that we'd get to walk around in ships and stations, but this did not happen.  We get to walk around in a tiny fenced-off area of those ships and stations.  Those vast beautiful structures you see from the outside?  Nope, you get to walk around in a tiny section that takes about a minute to explore fully.  The station interiors themselves are copy-pasted and completely uninspiring.  The NPCs might as well be vending machines for all the immersion they add.  The graphics you get in these walking around sections are low res awfulness with crap shaders that might have been considered adequate ten years ago - a stark contrast to the lovely visuals you get while flying your spaceship.  The voice acting is also worth mentioning as being terrible, but I think that's always going to be a feature of X games.\n\nAs for the things I liked... well, as I said before, the visuals while flying around are pretty good, but I'm not convinced they're any better than the graphics in Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude.\n\nOverall, if this had been a £10 game from an indy developer, I might have enjoyed this game.

I was playing their games before steam was even a conceptual thought, and have logged god only knows how many countless hours into the entire trilogy, which\nincludes XBTF, X-Gold, X2: The Threat, X3 Reunion, X3 Terran Conflict, X3 Albion Prelude, and all those games were awesome, the best in my opinion is a fair tie between Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude.  I liked Prelude because of the stock market, that didn't exist in previous releases.\n\n...then came X-Rebirth... an entirely different story... we waited a long time for it's release thinking they were putting a lot of heart and effort into the game, to make it as good if not better than the previous sequels, then when it was finally released as a FULL release mind you, and not the Beta release now displayed along with it's title, it was a complete mess, with nothing working.  We all paid full release prices for a game that wasn't even worth calling an "Alpha", and to this day, the patches are released far from what we would have otherwise wished for on the scale of progress in giving gamers what they paid for.\n\nI suppose this is a game that Egosoft was hoping the modding community would bail them out, and for some just may have, but for the hard core gamers, and the gamers-4-life, such as myself, being 43 years old, and a gamer all my life on PC platforms, I can say I won't touch this game anymore, until Bernd stops stuffing coke up his nose, and gives us paying customers what we paid for.\n\nMy verdict: YOu don't always get what you paid for, especially now days, sometimes you get ripped off.  Don't buy this game, and if you do plan on buying it, at least watch others play the game, and keep an eye out for the problems that people are finding with the game...

The whole story and freeplay are played from the bridge of the Albion Skunk (no way to change the name or ship) you can build a fleet and command them even visit your other ships but not fly them personally. For me this is and was a let down, Imiss being at the helm of my cap ship to get attacked and fly out in my fighter to intercaept with my wing to protect my goliath cap ship, but i was the pilot of that cap and the fighter my choice, and if i wanted to fly the cap again just land if i can (not anymore) you will be able to land at your cap not fly it.\nThe space station interiors are very generic with only maybee 3-4 designs and that might be pushing it, and some of the trading is a little coveluted because you have to search for the person on the atation and they they still might not carry the item you want to sell or need,But that is part of exploring and that type of variation at those dealers does cause one to venture out more to find where you can move that item. However the station offer system is a pain as you will find youself having to micromanage these menus by flying back and forth between stations that carry what you are buying and selling so you can keep abreast of offers.\nIf you can see past all the changes and approach this as a BRAND NEW game it's fun, its not very buggy, runs great, and has substance and plot however the story is shorter than most at about 60 or so hours.  I like it, its different and i had to warm up to it but i like it.\n\nAnswer to weltall_of_id 1st comments\nI understand your question, and no I am not sure why there is so much hate,there are some real gamechangers here in Rebirth and as i continue playing i will continue to revise this review. I hate the minigame for hacking and conversations its annoying as i cant exactly figure the thing out as i get changing results all thge time that dont seem to follow an exact pattern. as far as being able to fly a cap ship, i found it really neat do dock get out and watch it fly from the docking hanger while issuing orders like i used to, i found this trick when my hull was so damaged i needed somewhere to hide and had gotten my ships back, so actually commanding a capship has become MORE fun for me as i get really cool scenery going by ang get to watch a lot of the battles from the safety of inside the ships bay. This is really a new version of x universe and its hard to transition to from what the old games were like, i am getting the dlc today as its on sale and i can actually see me finishing this game and wanting more at this point.  I may not have such hard feelings because i started the series on x3 terran conflict, it was great but also had its flaws. This game is a different game set in the same recreated universe that is more beautiful than ever, the collision deaths have been eliminated "my greatest frustration with the old game" which is wonderful,and there are a lot of new things to do, Im not gonna say its a bad game, its really cool in its own right I think people need to do more of the Think part of the game and they will discover its as deep as any X UNIVERSE game and not just a shooter its a real strategy game now, maybee they just dont think enough they want easy answers.:steamhappy:\nReply to #2\nwow this review is going to get long and in depth I will try not to give spoilers:\nTo all upset X-Universe players ALERT you have missed the boat with this game, remember being in your cap ship having to either screw with a camera to see a battle your ship was in with terrible AI or jump into a fighter well now you can have both at your fingertips if you use your noggin and have a great view of battles at the same time and even participate of course. Yeah ok you cant change ships per se' cry instead of think ( not adressed to 1st responder), wow.. I c'mon guys it's build fight think and trade all here, you really have to think though, and yes this game is REALLY FUN after patches though i must admit i need ao use the trade agents forever or another code for trading due to lack of sateltes, one huge drawback as i hate these types of cheats or any as a matter of fact, but im backed into a corner with trading otherwise, as far as the convo minigame it still pisses me off and i havent gotten a steady result from it, its a feature i avoid like the plague, but its my main complaint besides the trade system, but with one click of a button all is well and this game is really worth playing, just use that trade agents forever or revel things cheat and youll be set, ( wish you didnt have to maybee the minigame cheat would be better ) my NEXT playthrough yep im gonna play the story more than once I'll try that and maybee even when i get the hang of the new universe and where things are not even that. I am really enjoying this game sorry to evryone who is too stuck up to give it a fair shake its great in sooooooooo many ways and has its flaws too but really it's a four out of 5","November 26, 2015","true","101.0"," 81 of 126 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","81","126","4","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999904169/recommended/2870/","76561197999904169","Atum Hadu","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999904169/","82 products in account","Let me preface by saying X Rebirth is quite possibly the most amazing-looking space game of all time. My complaints run the gamut, but graphics are not among them.* X Rebirth's developers built on a massive scale appropriate for space -- this isn't a space sim where the universe feels small, or where stations are half-hearted efforts to give players a place to dock their ships. The stations in X Rebirth are glorious affairs, with Blade Runner-esque lights and signs, intricate manufacturing modules where you can see machinery sculpting products from raw materials, nooks and crannies to hide your ship from hostile forces, and often jaw-dropping detail -- when you do a slow fly-by around space farming stations, for instance, you can see every leaf of the vegetation growing beneath massive domes, and machines strafing those spacegardens with water jets.\n\nLikewise, the devs clearly paid attention to planetary scale. When you're in orbit around a planet, the planet should be almost incomprehensibly massive. It should dominate your field of view. And in this game it does, providing an amazing backdrop for pitched battles and ambushes. The designers also did a fantastic job of increasing visual immersion with the way the Albion Skunk's cockpit is rendered -- the ambient light in the cockpit changes with the light source from outside. That means if you're headed toward a station close to a star, your cockpit is bathed in vivid yellows. If you're in deep space, the cockpit's hues are subdued.\n\nStill, I can't recommend X Rebirth. Lots of people have reported problems with framerate, even on high-end systems. This has been acknowledged by the developer. Personally I have not had that problem, but the problem is, it's nearly impossible to tell if the game will run appropriately until you install it on your own machine. Secondly, there is merit to the complaints about inscrutable menu systems and unnecessarily complex in-game tasks. Getting your fleet's ships to dock, refuel, and take on cargo can be a nightmare, and the difficulty is apparently arbitrary. Sometimes it works flawlessly, sometimes you're waiting an hour until you fly in to inspect the problem yourself and see that, for some reason, drones are not off-loading cargo.\n\nLikewise, there's a difference between hand-holding and obscuring features beneath menu layers that make it difficult for players to get their bearings, nevermind figure out how certain tasks are accomplished. This is a game that can't be played without an open web browser to help get through frustratingly, needlessly complicated tasks. You'll also need the web browser for figuring out how to progress, because the game doesn't always make it clear if you're prepared for certain zones or missions.\n\nConclusion: Save your money. If X Rebirth plunges to $4.99 or $9.99 in some future Summer Sale or flash sale, it's worth picking up just for the joy of exploring the game's systems and starbases. And maybe, after the better part of two years, the game will be smoothed out by then. We'll have to wait and see.\n\n* Caveat to praising the graphics: The space station interiors are pretty awful. All of them are nearly identical in decor and visual style, if not layout. It makes little sense that a civilization cut off from the rest of humanity would build stations exactly like everyone else, but there you have it. And the NPC models are so poorly done, it might have been better if the devs dropped the idea of interiors altogether.\n\n","September 27, 2014","false","36.8"," 96 of 153 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","96","153","3","0"

Full of plot holes..one after the other...I describe it as egosoft randomly picked employees to write different chapters, the employees didn't talk to eachother and then they just pasted the sotry together...BAM, Xrebirth story...the ending to the campaign is the worst ending I've seen to a game...the most unepic boring thing you'll do that leaves you feeling lost when you finish the game...The story is linear, like i said, deviate and you'll just screw yourself....Devries has very little resources and no stations providing an AOE ware bonus so they consume them quickly....if you get there to slow, you will HAVE to hack your save to get the plot going again....\n\n2: Artificial Intelligence....\nIt doesn't exist in this game....Anything you encounter you can destroy WITHOUT upgrading your ship....no skill needed...if the combat AI needs to attack something it'll to a beeline straight for it...3 shots and it'll die and it won't do any dmg to you in the process...90% of the time, AI will ignore you until you attack it..after that it'll target you, but usually you'll blow it up in 1 second so it won't matter...(I'll talk about trade AI later in the trade part)...Larger cap ships are also the dumbest ships you'll encounter...even in numbers, just get behind them, destroy the engines and the ship is basically a sitting duck...just strafe shoot kill hide behind it, let shields recharge, rinse repeat, launch boarders and the ship is yours...some ships have weapons defending their engines but they are few in numbers and you can easily dispatch them...this is how you make money in the game...nothing else will come close to the amount of money you can make by capturing succs for 18million and selling them every 15 minutes....cha-chang...If you do play, you'll encounter bundles of ships just sitting there waiting for you to kill them....awesome....Escort ships take routes into buildings and then get stuck, I've watched 4 police ships hump eachother on the side of a station cause they couldn't figure out that they could go UP...Seen cap ships just fly thru everything, but this is intentional as if they didn't they would never get to their intended targets when you call for them as any ship in the sector can't figure out basic navigation....what do you mean I can't just fly thru this building..why not....\n3: trade: IS BROKEN AND FAKE\nI don't care what the fanboys say, the economy is not dynamic...you see ships flying in the sector but they don't trade, ships don't go from sector to sector...it's an illusion...I believe it's an area of effect kind of thing...if your station makes this item that the stations around it could use then it supplies them just by being around it....I've explored every aspect of trying to figure out how the trade system could be dynamic and everything in the game says it isn't..except egosoft....they also say every ship has a purpose but they don't..only ships that have a purpose are yours, everything else is just there to make it look like they are doing stuff but they are not....Now when you start trading you'll encounter the horrid trading AI...it takes the most god awful routes to things...my advice..leave the sector, something changes when you leave a sector. I was watching these trades for hours just waiting because you hit a brick wall in the plot and you have to trade to build...well, after hours of watching this ship just circle around, I left to do a mission, Bam, done as soon as i got a few sectors away...wtf...so I did it from a distance with the trade software...BAM...almost an instant trade...well, this should  be a clue to how the engine of the game runs in the background.....ships aren't moving around in the background....\n\nGraphics:\nSpace graphics are great....flying around...awesome....but this can get boring really quickly....Now, NPCs like Yisha...holy hell did they screw the pooch here....they are awful...whoever thought this was a good idea should not be in computer programming or have an artistic job....They all have this joint at the base of their skull so when they turn their necks it's like the exorcist....they all look old and fake, seen better NPC graphics in games that were from 2001...The dialogue in this game should just be erased...especially yishas...it sounds like they just grabbed people from off the street to record dialogue...nothing makes sense and they are all somewhat hostile or way too friendly...and get ready to hear the same stuff over..and over...and over...and over...sometimes in rapid succesion...missions where you kill something in a sector..kill 10 ships really quickly, and you will...you'll hear the same thanks, station probably blah blah blah, guess you want money..blah blah....Every dock seems to have a bar..but I guess its a strip club without the strippers...probably for the best..if I saw one of those Npc's in a thong I'd barf...Yisha has the largest camel toe, the station pictures all scream sex sex sex...but nope..none...least yisha could give you some road head on those highway adventures...more on highways later....hate this game...\nMinigames....\nYEAH!!! minigames, everyones favorite right...well, what they did here was turn minigames into nightmares....need loot..awesome, turn on the ping thing and go out to space and repeat the same process over and over looting lockers...yes, lockers...millions floating out in space full of junk that you can sell for 100 credits...oh boy, loot a million of them and maybe you will be able to afford your first upgrade....there are also lockers and boxes all over stations and vents...cant forget vents...again, full of junk, steal it all, no one cares....The highway..i spent more time in these highways staring at the butt of a ship then actually fighting....Someone at egosoft was sitting in traffic one day and decided that this would make an excellent minigame....fire that guy....if it was bernd, go find another company to work for as bernd no longer holds the interest of ANYbody.....more mini games include some dialogue Bs but your responses don't match anything and you won't know what to do....I can't express how much I hate this game...it is horrid, don't buy it, buy another game...\nReview is 1/10....the 1 is for graphics (in space only) the rest is garbage....\n\nPS..if you think the mods will fix this....they have already abandon ship as egosoft made this game unfriendly to modders....\nPSS..if your waiting for patches....egosoft will be gone soon, they ♥♥♥♥ed up badly and will have to declare bankruptcy soon\nPSSS ..dont buy this game....\nPSSSS ..EGOSOFTS MODs IN ACTION....http://illidiantx.tumblr.com/","January 22, 2014","false","46.7"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","36","50","0","2"

Were they making a game where you control lots of ships or just one ship? What was the point of walking around on a station, was this supposed to be like a shooter or something? Everyone looks the same and trades different wares, but all this serves to do is make the simple act of buying and selling enormously tedious. The previous games had a relatively simple interface for trading, managing your ships, and viewing the map, these things are all convoluted and cluttered in a series of menus which aren't really explained.\n\nBeyond that, there's really not a lot of fun. The main quest for example has you build a URV forge at one point but the build process requires materials you can only buy from a hostile faction. Okay so go pirate and steal what you need, right? Well not exactly, in my game Fusion Reactors just weren't being traded anywhere, I guess if I let the game run non-stop over a period of several days the economy might right itself, but I ended up just altering my save file to get on with things. What ended up happening is the URV forge completed but required me to provide a mining ship. I go to purchase a mining ship which must be built first, so I build my mining ship and nothing happens because, again, it's missing some resource to finish building it.\n\nIf you fell asleep during the description of gameplay in that last paragraph I wouldn't blame you, the quests are just that boring, I wanted to love this game but it finally occurred to me that I wasn't having any fun playing it. It's a beautiful game no doubt, but honestly if they just took the previous X games and slapped these graphics on them that would have been great, it would have been released sooner, with fewer bugs and higher reviews. You're given very little instruction about how to play the game and you'll find yourself spending more time in Google looking things up than you will blowing up badguys.\n\nAs far as the combat goes, well you have the option to auto-aim at everything which makes it boring OR you can turn off the auto aim and try to manually aim but the weapons don't track very smoothly and you'll find the simple act of killing an enemy a frustrating endeavor. Adding to this, some ships like corvettes don't even have a lead indicator but maneuver like fighters. There are some great mods out there, the capital ship bridge mod for example is so wonderful that you have to wonder why it wasn't included with the game, but overall I've noticed that modders tend to abandon their work due to frustration with the limitations of the game engine, This can lead to corrupted save games and having to start over but more often having to make do without mods you had come to enjoy.\n\nI really wanted to see a better end-game played out, the possibility to conquer whole sectors of space and wage huge intergalactic wars, I wanted to see a smoother interface and tighter fleet management, the ability to control my wings of fighters and carrier groups against large scale invasions, the ability to lead a squad of commandos in an exciting, if rudimentary, boarding action on an enemy starbase or capital ship. Maybe those things exist somewhere to some degree at some point in X Rebirth, but I don't have the stomach for all the endless tedium one must endure to reach that point.","March 14, 2015","false","41.2"," 60 of 93 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","60","93","5","0"

Either something I do in game, something that happens outside of my control in game that makes everything stop functioning, a random CTD, a graphical glitch or some game-breaking situation. Considering I played X3TC until I conquered half of the map and had more fleets and production facilities than I could count this game is a MAJOR diappointment. It lacks any sense of progress, and after waiting for it with glee and anticipation, paying £50 for the version that had the soundtrack (the collector editions had sold out) I really feel ripped off. In fact I've never before felt quite so ripped off and shocked as I was with this. Half of the mods people make and release for it are functions that anyone woul d have expected to already be in the game. Nothing about this game even feels like an X game should feel. I appreciate that it was supposed to be a revamp, but to me a revamp should not mean taking the top ten most amazing things from X3, deleting them and replacing them with week-old fish-paste; and that's basically all this is. Do not buy, even if you really really badly want another X game (we all did).","September 25, 2014","false","71.6"," 83 of 134 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","83","134","3","0"

I want to encourage those who found this game as maddeningly buggy and unfinished as I did at launch to consider the immense improvements that have come with patches and DLCs, and to give this ground breaking game a second chance. Yes, despite the age of X: Rebirth, I still consider it to be modern and groundbreaking. The level of freedom and immersion achievable in this game is absolutely unparalleled by similar genre titles.\n\nIt's strong ambition, however, is also it's greatest failing. The tools provided to the player to build their empire of trade and conquest are exhaustive, but unintuitive. So much so that after 60+ hours I am still learning to navigate the endless menus of information about the economy and struggling to fully comprehend the station supply techniques that allow for self sustaining empire building. I have at my fingertips the ability to see hundreds of trade offers, complete with supply and demand based pricing, but to earn that right I must search out and play a tediously simple mini-game at each and every station I desire to track trade offers from. Likewise, while I have the freedom to issue specific and complex orders to individual crew members of my various combat ships and fleets, the only ship I can directly pilot is my own, which is limited in its combat role. Thus, I find myself in awe of what complexity X: Rebirth permits while I am simultaneously confused about certain design choices that seem to hinder the sense of player freedom that the game strives to instill.\n\nThe campaign serves more as a lengthy tutorial to the game's many features than as a draw for those most interested in story and lore. I found myself very engaged from beginning to end, as the player is unintentionally caught up in conflict and forced to take sides while  they explore the X universe for new allies and trade opportunities. The ending is unquestionably rushed, however, and is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise well told narrative. The voice acting, it should be noted, is far from triple-A quality, but while the lines were not always delivered in the most effective way, it never cripples the narrative beyond recovery.\n\nMany of my issues with game mechanics were easily solved with a quick trip to the Steam Workshop. The modding community for this game is small, but among the highest quality and most dedicated that I have seen. The complexity and scope of many of the available mods really turn this game from a B- into a A-. X: Rebirth does not require mods to make it a tremendous experience, but a minor tweak to the interface here and a slight additional convenience there can really give the player a much more fluid expierence.

But, not too surprisingly, I decided to wait for a couple of big patches after the desastrous release. 2,5 years later and version number 4.0, I finally jumped into the game. A lot of things have changed and some of them were not for the better. Only a single ship, indirect trading and kinda limited order and fleet options of other ships, the weird weapon mechanics of the player ship, some things really seems not thought through.\nHowever, many things still work pretty good. I prefer the new station building over the old one, to be honest, even though trading just feels less important. Capital ships now have hardpoints that can be destroyed. Hiring crew for specific tasks is kinda cool, too.\n\nI think I still prefer Albion Prelude over Rebirth. However, ultimately I felt entertained enough to be able to recommend this installment. I just hope that Egosoft will listen to people's opinions about Rebirth for the next game and improve the weak points.","May 18","true","91.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

I like the whole empire building, trading, exploring etc concept. I also tend to like more complex, steep learning curve games; this qualifies as that.\nIs this an X4 for those who have played X3, NO. Is it based in the same universe that and X3 gamer would recognize, YES. Can you change from a trading ship to a scout to a heavy fighter then to a capital ship, NO. Can you build huge complexes that are self sufficient and make you tons of money , NO. Can you set up universal traders to make money, NO.\nSomething else that is different from X3 is the use of highways to move around. Previously in X3 to speed up movement one would engage SETA (basically a fast forward button). The issue with SETA is that it hogs up ram and on a 32 bit program you have a limited amount of ram to work with. The use of highways can get you from place to place without SETA and FPS going into the single digits. Rebirth is 64 bit (now) and this is not so much of an issue, but the highways are still there.\nSpace stations can still be built, but they are now built in stages and cannot be connected to one another to create a complex. The price of building a station has gone up quite a bit as well.\nTrading is changed as well, since you cannot fly a freighter yourself, you must delegate trading to individual freighters.   Say you want to trade energy cells, you need a freighter capable of hauling energy cells and you then bring up the trade menu to see who is selling energy cells the cheapest, and likewise who is buying them for the best profit. You tell the freighter where to go, but this is all unseen it's kind of boring.\nCapturing ships is still possible as well. Fighters can be captured should you make the original pilot bail, but you need to have your own pilot onboard your ship to be able to do so. Capturing larger is easier then in X3. Now you can cripple a ship's engines and weapons prior to launching your 50 marines (how do they fit in a corvette sized ship?).\nSo, bottom line, if you like complex trade empire building games and can get over the differences from X3 then you will have fun with this game.","December 19, 2015","true","444.1"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","30","42","2","0"

Safe to say I love the series and all the freedom it brings. As you could probably have guessed I pre-ordered X rebirth and as a result was one of the many that were shocked at how Egosoft could even dream that the game was a finished product. I persevered but after about 10 hours of pain I resumed Albion prelude and tried to pretend Rebirth never happened.\n\nThat was 2 years ago...\n\nI recently returned to X rebirth to see what 2 years of bug fixing looked like. Credit were its due as the game is much improved. Yes there are still bugs and no it's not the same as the games that preceded it but I have to say it works. The immersive feeling of adventuring, exploring and conquering a vast and beautiful universe is there. The size and complexity of the ai stations is incredible and the changes made to the way sectors work is enjoyable (I kind of like the way the transport system works).\n\nNow I've yet to progress that far (and from what I know of the X series in guessing I have a lot left to discover) but the foundations of the gameplay are there for me and not simply a repetition of the previous games.\n\nOverall yes there's still more to fix but as is, the game is very enjoyable and hugely immersive.","March 5","true","806.9"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

Egosoft meant to accomplish this by removing, fixing or adding features and streamlining them to be more accessible.  Egosoft's promises, however, proved void.\n\nThe 'X' series have always been beloved because it is virtually the only franchise that offers a complete sandbox experience in a singleplayer environment.  A massive universe with a plethora of ships to fly and opportunities to pursue made the 'X' series a behemoth in space sandboxing.  However, all this sandboxing always came with a price - a clunky, inaccessible game with a learn curve akin to a 90 degree angled wall sunked in grease and other lubricants, unfortunately doing away with most people giving the franchise a try.  Again Egosoft promised it would tackle these problems.\n\nHence, considering their past 15 years of experience, Egosoft was trusted that it could release the biggest, best and most accessible 'X' game to date.  Unfortunately, they couldn't have been more wrong.\nIn it's current state, Rebirth is an unplayable mess.  Severe lack of optimisation, horrendous UI, atrocious character models, abysmal story, game breaking bugs, feature incomplete, frequent crashes and whatnot.  If anything Rebirth is the epitome od unfinished products released to meet publisher enforced deadlines.  It's amazing (give or take) seven years Egosoft brought a very promising and well-established franchise to its knees and even more amazing is how little they achieved with Rebirth.  Not one design goal that was mentioned in their first announcement has been completed.  Trading is utterly broken and even corrupts save game files, controlling AI ships has never been more tedious - regardless of what game we're looking at - horrendous performance on high-end systems show little to no interest in the PC market.\nIf you have a midrange computer at your disposal most of the performance issues will not apply to you, however.\n\nWhile Egosoft has done everything it can to continously patch the game and we have seen a barrage of patches come our way, this game is not worth a purchase at all.  Unfortunate as it might be and as pretty as the screenshots may be, the game is an utter and complete mess.\n\nFor those coming back as veterans of the series, Rebirth has nothing to offer but instead is a step down from the sandbox that is X2/X3.  For those coming to take a peek at the 'X' series, Rebirth could have been an excellent starting point to ease into the series, if it didn't come with so many bugs, glitches and crashes.  If anything Rebirth is not your harbour if you are coming back or if you are just starting which is unfortunate, because when and if Rebirth works it's an absolutely gorgeous game (in space) and has a lot going for it.  It's a step up from games such as Freelancer in both offering a sandbox and complete experience.  It just turned out the be not the game Egosoft or its fans were hoping it'd be.","November 25, 2013","false","5.5"," 38 of 58 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","38","58","0","6"

One thing I haven't seen in other reviews is that you are limited to using one weapon at a time - at least I coouldn't find a way to fire multiple guns at the same time. The other thing is that the menus are not as 'snappy' as they were in say X3. Once you knew the keyboard shortcuts in previous X games you could get to any function pretty fast. In this game after quickly pressing 'Enter -> 5 -> 5' it only recognizes the first '5' keypress and I have to wait for the game to finish rendering the new radial menu before I can press the second '5'. Makes for a lot more sluggish interface.\nThe rest of the problems (trading, highways, station interiors, etc.) have been already detailed in other reviews so I won't duplicate those.","December 9, 2013","false","19.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","1"

Dare I say that it's pretty good. It's worth to try it regardless of whether you are a die-hard X fan or new to the X universe.\nOne thing to keep in mind though - it's an X game, but from a different perspective. If in original X games, it took you forever to get your first M2, and you could easily fly it and decimate everything in your path, then this game is geared more towards encounters in your M6 equivalent (Albion Pride/Skunk) or humongous fleet battles, where Xenon (Rogue AI machines) can take down half your fleet.\n\nThere are still some problems here and there. Most annoying things that i've encountered in 4.0 are:\n1) Trades for your cap ships take forever for some reason. Was much better in 3.61\n2) Capital ships now bump into asteroids when boosting, instead of flying through them. This might have seemed like a good idea at first, but the execution in sectors with alot of particles, begs for flight AI to be altered(flight path must be around asteroids, go off-ecliptic!).\n3) Capital rebalancing - with introduction of Olmekron and Fulmekron destroyers, Taranis seems like a toy, while costing the same. Egosoft, please, add 2 more Plasma/Jet turrets on each side. It has spots for that afterall. Do It! And while you're at it, swap Astrobee launchers for V Crushers like on Arawn.\n4) More Capital rebalancing - fix Teladi cap ships!

I did not play the game at release or anything near to it, so my review is in regards to the game circa early 2015.\n\nX:Rebirth is a many-headed hydra, where each head does not fit well with the others.  Presumably to reduce the reliance on menu's seen in previous X games, X:Rebirth features a 'walking in stations' system.  At no point does anything you do while walking in stations add anything other than a terribly looking character to your game experience.  As soon as you figure out how to do the same thing via menus, you will.  It is faster and more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe core of the game is an economic empire simulator with the player as a trader CEO who for some reason also engages in combat and exploration.  All of this is accomplished from one ship that has a paltry number of upgrades that only require vast wealth to acquire.  The control of underlings is accomplished through a terribly poorly designed ui that requires repetition of multiple clickthroughs to achieve even the most simple of tasks.  Reassign a fighter from one wing to another? Requires comms to the pilot, choose how to assign them, pick their new superior, and then you are actually forced to wait while their confirmation dialogue plays.  All this could be accomplished through a single drag-drop, but not in X:Rebirth.\n\nThe space part of the game looks great even without mods, but most of your time is necessarily spent flying around stations.  Although the stations have a wonderful diversity compared to say Elite:Dangerous, no one really wants to spend hours and hours flying around them.  Yet you must in order to discover trade opportunities, missions, and the discounts that make trade profitable.\n\nEven with a fair amount of modding to reduce the tedium of things like scouting stations, I still found myself bored and frustrated by ~70% of the campaign.  I also ran into a game breaking bug that apparently others have not experienced involving a full stop in campaign progress due to a missing NPC.  I had kept hoping that at some point the tedious exploration, lackluster combat (I think 90% of my missiles missed no matter the type I used) and poorly voice acted story would evolve into a fun trade empire simulation, but, for me, it never happened.\n\nEven at a reduced sale price, it is hard to justify the purchase of X:Rebirth unless you give Egosoft a lot of credit for aspirations rather than accomplishments.","April 6, 2015","false","48.6"," 41 of 64 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","41","64","0","0"

When it first released, Rebirth copped a lot of deserved flak, it was buggy, it was confusing and many of us were questionable about particular game elements. But that was a different time for Rebirth, and it has improved significantly since that time with its 2.0, 3.0 and soon to be released 4.0 and Home of Light DLC. Kudos to Egosoft to sticking to their guns where most developers would sink the franchise and move on.\n\nWhat stands out in Rebirth compared to other space sims of the day? It has incredibly deep gameplay in an incredibly beautiful and dynamic universe. There is a satisfying early, mid and late game as you gradually build up an empire of ships and stations and dominate interstellar markets with your own assembly lines and your fleet of trade-ships. You will always be up to something in Rebirth, whether thats scouting out potential bargains for your tradeships to supervising the construction of your first station or commanding your personal battlefleet into a war against one of the major factions. You can even be a pirate and steal wares and ships from any of the factions in the game.\n\nEvery Star system in Rebirth is very unique, offering its own visual style, ship and station types (mostly), story and culture. Where other space-sim games like to go the procedural generation route, Rebirth offers a beautifully handcrafted galaxy that on the most part seems authentic.\n\nRebirth still has its fair share of issues, the command system when dealing with NPCs can be frustrating at times and fleet commands still aren't that great, though it has improved substantially with adding basic commands that are necessary. NPCs are still stiff and bland and don't match the visual style of the outer galaxy, this was an issue with previous X games as well but its more jarring here as you are forced to interact with these NPCs more.\n\nOverall, if you like base-building, economic games, space-sim games, i'd definitely recommend X:Rebirth. With the Home of Light DLC coming out in the next few days which adds 3 new star systems (There are currently 6 systems pre-HoL ) it may be a good time to pick it up and give it a go.","February 21","true","568.6"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","26","38","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Traslogan/recommended/2870/","Traslogan","Traslogan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Traslogan/","439 products in account","X-Rebirth drew in a lot of hype from the X fans from what I remember seeing. It was due to renew a truly epic (albeit somewhat hardcore) series. I feel that failed.\n\nTo explain how I think Rebirth failed, I feel that it was the choice of components they overhauled that was the bad decision.\n\nGiving us a 1-command-ship system. This was a big mistake in my opinion. Although upgradeable, it ends up limiting fighting capabilities without relying on AI support, effectively making the player more like a little commander who sometimes needs to hide behind his other, AI-controlled, ships.\n\nStation Trading was another critical failure in my opinion. We've always had AI merchants at stations. But they weren't our main option, and they were easy to access. We just opened a menu. It was actually easier in the past. Having to haul around a station's recycled interior to find traders and get info is really annoying at times, and keeping the old comms-menu from X3 but with the new characters would have been great in my opinion. Having points on a station we need to explore to access was a little odd too. It wasn't a critical flaw, but surely it would be easier to detect any mission-givers around a whole station upon detecting the station? Assuming they are legal missions, of course. Seems odd to have them practically hide their missions.\n\nIf the developers had stuck with a more centralized station-interaction, I think half the issues with stations would be avoided.\n\nBack to the player's ship. The Co-Pilot. I wouldn't believe the developers if they told me the voice-actress read the script before-hand, given the voice-acting quality. Also there's a serious limit to what she says, which just makes it worse. I've heard "Now shut up Betty!" a few too many times for one game series. I can understand forcing her to be present in the campaign, but in freeplay it would be better if she wasn't there at all.\n\nNow, NPC-interaction. This is kind of the same issue as the stations, as they are just tough to track down and we have to intentionally go seeking through more menus than before to find them. Surely if they are publicly revealing their presence, then wouldn't it be easier to download station information across all access points on the station? I had quite the hard time trying to find the right NPC for anything I wanted. Especially construction. Although in hindsight I was told that getting NPC's for stations was just due to them being in select areas. Again, the issue that they aren't obvious without my manual searching.\n\nMy final big criticism is the new menu system itself. It's great that Egosoft  wanted easier-access. But what we ended up with is a really odd side-menu that just didn't agree with any decent resolutions. I run 1920x1080, which I feel isn't exactly out of the norm these days, but damnit the menus feel so chunky and so...console-ish, courtesy of the bloated interface. I assume Egosoft made it this way to save on visual differences and for immersion, but it really didn't pay off in my opinion. The new system seems to have focused too much on being nice to the new controller support (Although Albion-Prelude had it too, at least it was designed for keyboard and mouse). Re-arrangement would have helped newcomers to the series, but the old menu system, to me anyway, felt far more effective, far less chunky, and left players with greater control.\n\nOverall, I'm giving X-Rebirth 5/10. They did well overhauling transit, graphics, AI-pathfinding, and ship-control, but failed on so many other fronts. I'm probably adding 1 extra point out of 10 on just for the nice main menu. (Again, in my opinion.). Only modding can save it now.","May 12, 2014","false","10.0"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

I have played it for as long as I can take, I have tried to play through all the bugs and poor performance top see if there is a deeper game hidden away waiting to be discovered, and found its just not there.","December 28, 2013","false","109.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

I've not touched it since except for today when I looked at some of the videos posted of the game. Having reinstalled and played it again I can see a massive improvement in many areas. This game is now holding my attention and I want to play it.\n\nJust to make it clear this is not an X3 sequel, its only slightly similar in some aspects. I still crave for a proper "X4" type game which this certainly isn't.\n\nThe game is far from what I hoped it would be but with some mods installed the game is improved beyond its original state at launch. For example there is a simple mod which removes the cockpit so you get a decent view of the space in front of you.\n\nI recommend to anyone thinking of trying it to watch videos on Youtube etc. It helps to understand some of the basics as this game is still not right without some configuration but its now perfectly possible to change some of the most irritating parts making the game much more enjoyable.\n\nIf you are a X series fan then its probably one to avoid because you can't help but make unfavourable comparisons. If however you're able to conceptually separate this game from the X series then its not too bad. I guess in the end I bought it expecting something else but over the years I've come to terms with the fact that this game is never going to be what I thought it should be.\n\nI still hope one day for a proper X3 sequel...","November 14, 2015","true","6.7"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","30","46","2","1"

It is still not as diverse and vast as its predecessors in the X series but I have found the game enjoyable enough to play almost 500 hours in little over a year.\n\nStarting with the graphics, they are satisfactory. Much of the gameplay will take place in the Albion Skunk's cockpit which allows you to look out at the beautiful galaxies and stunning spaceships which the X Series have never seemed to fail in impressing us. Then there is the staion/ship deck veiw... Although walking around in the many ships and station is really cool and the interiors are as great as the galaxies you get to admire, the people are somewhat unimpressive statues that come with one of three different faces. Although getting to walk amongst a station/ship's crew and interact face to face with a trader, the whole experience is lessened by the fact that the people look like they were taken straight from a 2004 pc game and just pasted into a 2013 one. Overall the exteriors/interiors, shadows and lighting are enough to make you overlook the fact that the NPC's are just so awful looking, however I still have a lot of fate that Egosoft will pull through and revamp the npc's appearance.\n\nThe campaign storyline is awesome! Fighting alongside the renements of  rebel forces against a massive power hungry corporation always scores big points in my book. Without giving too much away, I would like to just say that storyline introduces you to some fascinating characters (That still look terrible!) that only thicken the plot and further immerse you into the storyline. My favourite part is that you are no longer alone in  the vastness of space, you now have a copilot/partner?/Friend to enjoy space with. Though she is very similar to the other female npcs in terms of appearance (can be fixed using certain mods), she is actually quite comical in the campaign and actually a real good addition to the normally lonely universe we've grown use to in previous X games.\n\nThe ships and Stations you encounter and can buy/build will not disappoint you but I know one thing that will! You can't fly them...Any of them, you can dock and tell the captain to take you somewhere but thats as close to flying a capital ship as you will get. I do not mind such, personally I believe it is more realistic in not being able to pilot a capital ship. especially now that you get to hire members of your crew yourself. But I too have spent many hours flying my Thor in X Prelude and blasting Xenon to bits, its just so fun.\n\nThe music is okay, it isn't quite up to par with that which we listened to in X3 series but its still not bad, except for the bar music though. I hate the bar music (Did I forget you can visit a Bar while docked in a station?) The voice acting is okay as well though there is a lot of repeatitive dialogue amost NPCs but the small talk mini-game is fun to play when you really want something at a station.\n\nThe game as a whole has come a long way since its release, many features have been added (I've left out a lot, I might add them to my reveiw at a later date) and many of the bugs that resulted in crashing have been fixed. I have only had my game crash once since 2.0 and it may have been my fault as I was running a lot of other programs in the background. Despite the poor game rating and hundreds of negative reveiws this game has recieved during its intial release, it has become a VERY enjoyable game to play. There are still many things left to fix but given the amount of work that has been put into fixing and patching the game, my hopes are high.\n\nTo anyone looking to buy this game, it is well worth it at this point. There are many mods out there right now that fix many of the issues many people have ingame and some added new features or galaxies which helps keep the gameinteresting while the developers continue to patch and add features themselves. I recommend buy the Teladi Outpost DLC with the gam though, it adds several more ships and fractions that only add to the game as a whole.","July 26, 2015","true","604.1"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","36","57","3","1"

If this were reverted to the old system I would probably change my review to positive. The fact that you are essentially wed to one ship (the albion skunk) is perhaps its second biggest downfall as I feel as though there are far fewer ship types and therefore play styles available.  Oh also SETA drive (speeding time up by up to 10x should never have been removed)\n\nTerran Conflict was a better game except for the graphics and rebirth has a (minorly) improved fleet control system.

I first got into the X Series back in X2: The Threat. Being able to command big capital ships was something that was a very memorable experience. Trying to get into big fleet battles was interesting. You had the whole universe of hundreds of systems to play in and play with which is the best part of any X Series game.\n\nX Rebirth was something of a disaster, especially at launch. Many of the bugs were fixed with upcoming updates for X Rebirth but the gameplay and the Freedom that was once there is no more. You no longer have the freedom to fly other small ships or “Captain” Capital Ships in any way or form. You can “Own” many ships but cannot “Fly” any ship. You are locked to a ship named “Albion Skunk”, ♥♥♥♥ poor name in my opinion, and are limited in not only a dozen weapons.\n\nThere are only, currently I believe 4 or 5 systems vs the Hundreds of systems previously accessible in the other X Series games. Would rather have hundreds of systems to explore rather than 4 or 5 with smaller sub areas you can visit.\n\nX Rebirth, has certainly improved somewhat in combat and most certainly graphically from its predecessors. There are many new gameplay mechanics, such as the Space Highway System, Bigger Space Stations with multiple dock locations and areas to explore. However, many interiors are identical to one another, faces on all characters are all nearly the same and various other small things just almost don’t make it worth your time to dock and talk to people.\n\nThere have been many improvements since Launch, and some great content has been added. But the freedom to do what you want, that made the other X Games so successful, is no longer there.\nTo summarize this all up without going into a 5 page essay as to why this game is a disaster, I would NOT recommend buying the game unless you got money to blow.","September 3, 2015","false","92.2"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","33","52","0","0"

There are definitely some serious flaws in the game but there is still alot to like about it and I wouls still recommend it, although with only about 18 hours in the pilots seat, I still have allot to investigate and try. Here's my opinion about what is good and bad about X Rebirth, not that my opinion matters...\n\nGood:\n-Awesome graphics. The game looks amazing and runs perfectly smooth on my system (i7 4970 @ 3.6ghz, GTX770, 16gb DDR3).\n-Lots of huge and wildly varied space stations and other vehicles to see.\n-Really cool Bladerunner/Fifth Element kind of atmosphere.\n-You can actually dock at the stations and get up and walk around the ship and into the station.\n-The "highways" and "super highways" IMHO are kind of a cool way to get around systems.\n-I have found ship to ship combat to be great fun in XR.\n-The "flight" controls, for me, are about as close to perfect as they can be. I use a G940 stick/pedals/throttle in a fighter jet sort of arangement except for the addition of strafing controls assigned to a little mini x/y axis hat. IMHO thia is an ideal setup for the way I like to "fly".\n-No fuel issues!!! In other space sims it seems like I am always about to run outta gas. Not an issue in XR.\n-The navigator argues with the ships computer.\n\nBad:\n-Extremely limited systems and sectors. The XR universe, although quite varied and beautiful, feels very small compared to other space sims. I have an XR "galaxy" map and there aren't but maybe half a dozen systems on it. News flash! The 'verse is a whole lot bigger than that!\n-The system and sector maps just plane suck in XR. That's all I need to say about that.\n-I rarely ever have time to play multiplayer anything so it isn't that big of a deal to me, but no multiplayer at all? Really?\n-Only one ship with a really stupid name that cannot be changed. Although you can own other ships, you cannot pilot them although I have heard there are "bridge" mods so you can sort of "be there" on the bigger ships.\n-My trackIR 5 won't work in XR.\n-You can get off your ship and walk around the stations but all the stations and people are very generic and look alike.\n-No standard FTL/jumpdrive.\n-An FTL/Jumpdrive can be found now, thanks to the version 4.0/HoL update, but it isn't something you can just buy and install. Apparently there is some sort of quest for this experimental drive that has you trekking all over the galaxy, such as it is, looking for parts and pieces.\n-Did I mention that the system/sector maps really suck?\n-The navigator is always arguing with the ships computer.\nThere may seem like more bad than good, but other than two or three of those issues, they are mostly just personal preference. There is still allot to like about XR and I definitely enjoy playing it.\n\n","March 26","true","25.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I also enjoy the DLCs quite alot (only one is shown in the shop so far, but another one is coming, which is even more worth purchasing).\n\nTo be frank, the campaign story is kind of meh, especially the last mission, but the story was (except for the very first X-title X-Beyond the frontier) never a focus point of the games.\n\nAs a fan since the beginning of the series, i hated the new highway system in the beginning because i thought making the warp gates more rare and instead focussing on highways was a betrayal to the series, especially since i did not care about the Albion sectors in the X3-series. But after a while i must say that i love the new highway system, its a great way to enjoy the scenery and to take a short break while flying from sector to sector.\n\nIt also has great mod support, a really nice mod community and a really great community overall.\nAnd i must emphasize, unlike many developers who have a bad/broken launch and just abandon the game, Egosoft is known for supporting and improving the game even years after it's initizal release, and while almost every title in the X-series was incredibly broken at launch (hence the many bad reviews) Egosoft always did their best to improve the game to make their games great, even if it takes many years of (usually) free updates and patches.\n\nThe only huge gripe i have with this game is it's over-complicated and over-complex menu/sub-menu system to do simple things.

Also a DLC in the form of the Teladi Outpost, with a further one planned Feb 16 - Home of light. It's because of this support to the community that I would say this as a good game, it has plenty to do, a beautiful universe to explore, campaign mode and free play modes also structured start modes such as pirate, trader. Etc.. There are a ton of mods available from the very clever people in the community which make it even more playable. If anyone held back based on early reviews of the game I would say give a go it's very playable now, unfortunately the early reviews of this game still give it such a bad name on steam and it would be good to see some of the people who left those reviews at the time perhaps update them (if they still play the game that is, as I know most of them got refunded and don't own it anymore)!

While I've enjoyed each iteration in the series, there have been many things I found frustrating and, ultimately, after Albion Prelude (2011) I decided I'd had more than enough of being punished for my dreams: I vowed never to buy another Egosoft game.\n\nEarlier games were massive time sinks, Pretty and often fun, but requiring weeks if not months of REAL TIME graft to get to the big ticket rewards like capital ships and fleet battles. There was also an inordinate amount of tedious repetition involved in trading between sectors and stations. Worse, items always cost so damned much. New guns for your ship? That'll be hours of monotonous trading, please. New ship? Come back in a week!\n\nAt their worst, earlier X games felt exactly like that real life job we are supposed to be gaming to escape from.  Dull, monotonous and frequently punishing. Some like that: for me, it was torture having the dream of a space game so close but unable to achieve it thanks to some obstinate design decisions. Because I love space games, and because Egosoft were producing the ONLY A-grade space games out there for the longest time, I held out like a battered husband, hoping things would eventually improve.\n\nX Rebirth is that game. The improvement I'd always hoped would happen.\n\nIt had a very rough start. Egosoft should not, under any circumstances, have released the game in the state they did. By all accounts it was buggy and broken, on top of being a severe departure from earlier games. Not having bought it I sat back and laughed at my bullet-dodging cleverness.\n\nHowever, a couple of years later, after huge amounts of polish, tweaks and additions by Egosoft, Rebirth is now an absolute gem! A sparkling diamond in place of 1.0's jagged black coal. I've been playing it non-stop since I bought it. I can't stop playing it. This redesigned universe just makes so much more sense than it ever did. Activites make more sense, feel more logical. The graphical improvements are enormous, and a joy to behold (the stations are breathtaking!), but it's the gameplay that now really shines. So much opportunity everywhere! Missions that finally pay out decent rewards! Items priced low enough that a mission or two can afford them! I can repair my ships now without spending a week trading to offset the cost!\n\nI love this game!\n\nYes, there are still wonky bits. The narrative is compelling but awkwardly told. NPC modelling and animation rarely looks right. Voice acting is average at best, ear-destroying at worst. The menu-driven UI can still be a bit fiddly. And there's so much to [re]learn. But these are now minor complaints considering the rest of the game design now offers so much fun.\n\nI heartily recommed buying X: Rebirth at the earliest opportunity!","March 1","true","89.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

This game had a bad release...very bad in fact. But guess what, Egosoft dosen't abandon it's children. No, they stay and rebuild, and what they have made out of it is worthy of the price tag.\n\nHonestly there are a few things to note.\n\n1: It's X:Rebirth, and removes a lot of ship controling and other features since X-3. It's more liken to the older X-Beyond the Frontier, in which you only owned one ship to fly, and upgraded it to suit your needs. X:Rebirth has attempted to bring back that feeling.\n\n2: They tried something new and it didn't turn out right. Honestly I hate when these games come out and everyone bashes them for being 'off target' from it's origenal. Do you seriously expect a game to sell if it's just a copy each time and no risks are taken? It dosen't work that way. Even Nintendo, the big daddy of video games, has experimented and gotten smashed. Paper Mario Sticker Star for example... The fact is, you can't judge a game completely on it's predisesor, as everyone is diffrent, the new game that comes will also change.\n\nSo the game it's self visualy is breath taking. Giant super structure stations, wonderful space backgrounds, massive fire fights. The AI is also nice (But it's definatly not AGI) they can do some weird things, but are there to bring the automatic ecodemy and atmosphere of thousands to life. Gameplay can be rather dull at times, scaning stations, trading long distence with radios, running around on stations for offers and hidden godies. However, once you get an empire going you have meny things to do. The X series is a trading simulator in space with combat. Not a go shootem all up (that is until rather angry AGI and aliens attack.) My personal experience with the game is good. I've experienced very little problems other then a few scan points being inside the super structures (which you can glitch in and out of if you bounce around enough on it.) I recomend it for X series fans or someone who likes this type of game, but don't take this as the X series greatest impression. Play X-3 and it's expantions to get the full idea of how it works in good practice.","March 16","true","83.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I didn't actually notice that I'd played from morning to morning until I got a surprisingly beneficial CTD (you should stop playing and go to bed now).\n\nThis is completely and utterly playable and worth the NZ$48, and a must-buy at NZ$12 Sale. Haven't actually bothered leaving Omicron Lyrae yet, let alone newly explored the six or so other systems.\n\nOnly issues are the mind-numbingly boring small-talk to get trade updates in every station because it is the most important thing ever and the -graphics related (AMD?)- crashes and visual glitches, which aren't that bad if you keep autosave on. Also having to manually sell your station wares; kind of wish managers used tradeships to sell as well as buy instead of just letting them wander around aimlessly until they need to buy something.","February 27","true","253.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I have an iCore5 Haswell  CPU with 8GB of gaming RAM and an ATI 7700 Series graphics cards. I could barely muster 15 frame per second, which made me feel like being in the 90s, the only kid stuck with an 5 year old Pentium and can't play any latest games.\nThis is not the case here. I can't actually find a game, that would bring my computer down so much. Not even Crysis 3. And Rebirth isn't even that great looking to begin with.\nAs of this review, the game is patched to 1.21 and the framerate has improved and some bugs have been corrected.\n\nRegardless of patches, there are much much deeper problems with this game. I doubt they ever gonna be fixed, since they are "features".\n\nAppearantly, the dev team thought, that everyone wants to navigate a space trading/fighting simulator with an XBOX controller, where there are multiple menus and submenus and sub-sub-sub menus to deal with, instead of giving a simple keyboard shortcut.\nAppearantly, they forgot, that PC games have 101 keys + at least 3 mouse buttons. I won't even mention people, who got joysticks.\n\nHere is an awful example to compare: Battlefield or Call of Duty both are heavily console-aimed (now), and yet I got shortcut keys for everything, even joystick support for flight.  And we are talking about a simple shooter on a comparabily small map to play on, unlike Rebirth, which has numerous sectors, zones, systems and stations.\nI could go on with the menu system starmap, which I have never even heard of.  Dumb down games like Mass Effect has a starmap for crying out loud, even though the space part of game is just some visual  addition, not really required.\n\nHere is the deal.\nYou may have fun looking at the space stations and flying around for a bit. Heck...you may even have some fun successfully trading or pirating a freighter from the enemy faction.  But I can almost guarantee, that this game will go stale on you, once you realize , that after the first space station built with tremendous amount of work to be done, you'll be doing the same thing for the rest of the time you play. It's not getting easier, it's not getting harder, because you could have billions of credits if the raw materials needed are not there, or you have to travel for 1 hour all around in the sectors to find a cargo freighter carrying the right stuff.\nBy the time you get to that cargo ship, you'll realize, that your traders are stuck somewhere or being destroyed, without your knowledge,  or your trading computer "forgot" where things are bought and sold and the sectors you have already scanned are showing up again as unscanned.\nYou are going to get sick of this game real fast and only the most patient will go ahead to continue for a while, possibly install 10s or 20s of mods just to get by or constantly edit his save file to make it someone bearable.\nAvoid it...wait for some great space games coming out next  year (Elite: Dangerous, Star Citizen), which are already probably in a better state as alphas, than this "release" version of a giant mess called Rebirth.","December 31, 2013","false","259.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

I liked the first games, but was wary because of all the really horrible complaints made about it when it first debuted. So, I waited until it was on an unbeatable sale and picked it up. I still got robbed. Don't spend anything on this at all.\n\nPost BIG 4.0 PATCH! Notes:\n* The game wasn't made any better. Not even a little bit. OK, SETA is back, but once you get used to life without it, it doesn't add enough to increase the value of this game. Patch 4.0 is all about selling the new Home of Light DLC. I'm not paying my money for it unless it gets down to $2 or less, so no review from me.\n* There's a cool new bug that you sometimes encounter. Egosoft apparently doesn't want you to Alt-Tab out of their game, so they put in an eternally long loading cycle every time you task back in. Well, they also somehow forgot how to make fullscreen DirectX application lock focus. So, sometimes when you start up, every click will switch focus to or out of the app. What that means is when the game loads and you click, you are taken to the desktop. If you click anything, you are taken back to the loading screen. Infinite cycle. The only way I've found out of it is to hard power down. And the best part is that you get this beautiful new bug without even buying the DLC! Yay?\n\nOriginal review:\nI knew about all the changes from X3 up to X Rebirth. I have read all the threads and gotten myself up to date on all the issues and complaints.\nThey're all true.\nThis is a very bad space combat sim that has some trade stuff somewhere in it.\nI got about 2 hours into the campaign and hit a game-breaking bug. Really, I was about 40 minutes into the campaign but I'm having a very hard time overcoming the horrible controls to be effective enough in the 12-versus-1 combat situations you randomly find yourself in. It's not that the opposing AI is any good; it isn't. It's just that AI boats are high-performance dogfighters carrying 360-degree NeverMiss InstaPwn(TM) cannons stolen directly from LucasArts' worst titles while all you have is a canoe, a paddle, and a slingshot. I've tried both keyboard and controller techniques; both are awful.\nAfter all this time, X Rebirth still is not ready. If you want a space combat sim, find another developer. If you want the Trade Fight Build Think of older Egosoft games, buy one of the older Egosoft games. X Rebirth is just terrible. Except the visuals. You get a long time to look at their pretty visuals on each 10 minute "Game Over" screen.\n\n* The main voice actor is a minimal OK. All the rest that I've encountered so far are so bad that it would be a shame if someone didn't make a parody. You will relearn the definition of "annoying" every time your copilot tells your ship to shut up (about every 10 seconds or so).\n* Navigation just doesn't ever make any sense. I didn't find the space highways to be nearly as terrible as the complaints made them out to be, but I never know where I am or how to get to anything else. The map system just doesn't make nearly as much sense as it did in the ghosts of X past. You'll be flying along and it will tell you that you're 150km away from your destination, then suddenly things will flash and the wayfinder will shift and your destination will be 20km away in an entirely different direction. It's like the areas are stitched together but the boundaries don't line up, or something. You can't select targets or set waypoints or really do much of anything useful with the maps.\n* The controls are just terrible.\n* The menu system was made to be exceedingly awful so that the controls wouldn't seem so bad.\n* Accessing the various commands for your other assets is so painful that you don't want to do it. The game is deep like old versions but it's almost as if they learned nothing from those experiences. They should have saved some of the money that they spent on the visuals to hire at least one UX expert.\n* The exterior visuals on the stations are kind of OK but you're forced to fly around them and scan every little surface. It just doesn't make sense. And after the third station, you really don't care anymore. The explanation for why you have to do this is ridiculously shoddy.\n* Trading is a really miserable experience now. In good Xs, you could type in the number that you want. Now you have to use a slider that is about as precise as ship steering. I could probably go on for a very long time on how bad the trade system is compared to good Xs, but let's just say that "rock bottom" is the highest point that it reaches.\n\nAs for that bug, there is a point in the game where you have to use a hacking drone on a station. The problem is, no one in the universe will sell me that drone. I can buy any other drone -- any other item, for that matter, but when I visit a vendor that has that item, the quantity slider doesn't work. I can only "buy" zero quantity. The vendors are another thing that don't make any sense. You can "buy" and you can "sell" -- it's the exact same screen with the exact same elements, but the slider only works in one direction.

Sure, space looks pretty, but there's a whole lot of ugly under the hood. The interface is stunningly broken (made for controllers, at the expense of the traditional and most effective flight sim control scheme on PC - joystick/mouse/keyboard), the AI is atrociously poorly implemented (won't follow orders, there are many orders you *can't* give, such as meaningful fleet control or automated trading by stations or ships), the setting is far smaller than previous games in the series (and the map is utterly useless), every station is identical or nearly so (down to the "hidden loot items" being in the same place in each).\n\nIf you believe the marketing, if you expect this to be anything like previous X games, prepare to be sorely disappointed.

If bugs and performance issues turn you off, then you should not consider purchasing this game for at least a few weeks. However, this is NOT an abandoned title. The developers are keen on fixing these bugs, and they release regular weekly updates which do improve the game.\n\nIf you are coming from older X-titles, then you probably expect more of the same. While many things were carried over from the older games, X Rebirth is very different in many respects (for better or worse):\n\nGOOD (non-exhaustive list):\n• The universe feels more alive than in previous X-titles.\n• The space-flight visuals are often cinematic, reminiscent of sequences from movies like Blade Runner and The Fifth Element.\n• Fewer loading screens. Similar to other open world games, such as Skyrim, or GTA, you can travel vast distances without encountering a loading screen. The highways, for instance, will save you hours of travel, but you are also free to travel outside of them if you wish.\n• Capital ships appear much more massive than in the prior X-titles. Dock with one of these ships and walk around on its platform in the middle of a heated battle, and you will feel very small.\n• I have not finished the campaign, admittedly due to bugs, but so far I do enjoy it more than the campaigns in prior X-titles.\n\nSORTA-GOOD, SORTA-BAD (non-exhaustive):\n• You may only fly one ship. Some people will enjoy the fact that the game has been balanced around the abilities of a single playable ship. Others, especially veterans of the prior X games, may miss the freedom to choose what to fly.\n• SETA is gone, replaced by a more immersive system of highways which connect zones together, offering fast (yet still interactive) travel between them. Without SETA, unfortunately, some players will grow impatient as their trade ships lumber toward their destinations.\n• You may now walk around inside stations. There is a lot of potential for gameplay-depth here, but the feature is currently not very engaging and appears unfinished.\n\nBAD (non-exhaustive):\n• Trades are tedious. Expect to babysit each of your trade ships. Automation made trading tolerable for me in the prior X-titles, but this feature doesn't seem to exist in X Rebirth. Not yet, anyway.\n• The NPC models are ugly. I don’t know whether it’s the artificial gravity, or the lack of a proper atmosphere, but human skin apparently doesn’t hold up well in space — expect to either laugh or cringe at the organic sights that await you on space stations and capital ships.\n• Stations, although populated with NPCs, feel mostly lifeless. NPCs sit, stand, or weld metal objects, but rarely do anything else — they do not interact with each other, nor do they walk around with any purpose whatsoever. This aspect of the game needs a lot of improvement.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nX Rebirth is an incredibly ambitious game, and when it works it delivers an experience you won’t find anywhere else. At times the game is frustrating, but the developer is working hard to address the issues.\n\nI recommend this game to enthusiasts of the space genre who do not mind paying full-price for a game that is still beta-quality.","December 6, 2013","true","63.7"," 160 of 290 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","160","290","0","1"

The one truly good point about this game is the developers did spend a large amount of time making it stunning visually. The depth of a planet you get close to the stars within the game all the lighting and particle effects are top notch, but the good news stops there.\n\nUnlike the other games in the x series you are limited to one ship with the ability to use drones. The drones themselves have various uses but in the end seem superficial compared to being able to pilot full fighters. The worst part about this feature is your ship many times will get completely destroyed as you try and use the drones even when there was no threats present.\nIn addition to this the so call "reactive/interactive economy" is anything but either. Most of the ships in game are fluff as bots that have no purpose other than to make the space ports and space station's look busy. The ships you can interact with seem to randomly disappear after leaving/docking with stations or ships on some occasion's. its disappointing that such a huge part of the prior X games is regulated to a unusable mess.\n\nEverything within the game from getting your other ships to do as you want to trading bulk items #i.e. energy cells and such# is nothing but a complicated chore that ruins any hope of you having fun or at least feeling like you accomplishing something. In addition to this many of the in game commands and the very ships which made up such a big part of the other X games will not respond, move, or work in any way no matter what you need them to do.\n\nThe ability to move around stations is a bit fun but ultimately pointless. It seems the real reason you go from station to station is to rob the lockers of items and get illegal items in air ducts to supplement your cash flow as you cant get anything else within the game to work for making money properly. Though there are workarounds for these issues you should not need them as you spent money on a game that should of been ready after 7 years.\n\nLastly we have combat something truly enjoyable within the prior X series. Its sad, boring, dull, uninspired, slow. If you though you would have fun  think again. As stated before you only have one ship. Wanted tons of turrets? Think again. Wanted to be able to use 8 front mounted plasma throwers? Not gonna happen. You can have one of each weapon but that's ONE only. There are no multiple banks of weapons on your ship and no way to add them. The customization you can do to the ship is very shallow when compared to the other games within this series.\n\nThe final verdict is i would hope and try to believe that this game will be fixed by the developers. If not them than the gaming community at large through many mods that defined other games in this series. Alas i cannot see this happening as most of the issues seem to stem from core portions of this game not something that can be modded or fixed without major changes to the game it self. We will just have to wait for the next true X series game or perhaps the new Star Citizen that seems to have allot of promise.","December 10, 2013","false","61.2"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

What Egosoft was thinking when they released it in 2013 is beyond me. At its launch, the game was terrible. Barely anything worked, game breaking bugs were everywhere, it felt more like an alpha test for the game than anything else and because of that it suffered.\n\nI decided back then that I wouldn't give it a review back then due to the sour taste it left in my mouth and just put it on the backburner for 3 years. Yea ... 3 years.\n\nWhen I saw the 4.0 update I decided that it was time I gave the game another chance, a lot of people were praising it since the Teladi Outpost DLC for beginning to show its colors as an X game.\n\nAll the bugs that existed since launch have been fixed, I've managed to complete the campaign without hitting any kind of issue. The story has its ups and down, but in my opinion its final act and ending are not what I expected and somewhat unimpressive. The good part about it is that it leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe gameplay is what you'd expect from an X game. You start with a ship, some credits and your personal skills. What you do from there (if you don't start with the campaign) its up to you. Either go the route of a pirate and harrass the NPCs till the dawn of time, take on missions that are either combat, trading or exploring, go out on an exploration trip to find rare materials that can sell for a high price or maybe even some derelict ships you can capture or just build up an empire and slowly conquer the galaxy. Yep, just like an X game.\n\nNow there is one thing I need to mention. What is a very big difference between this X game and previous titles is that you cannot fly more than 1 ship. You better get used to the Albion (Pride) Skunk because that's the ship you'll fly till the dawn of time. And yes, you can reconfigure your cockpit so you can have a difference look about your ship, but honestly, its still just one ship.\n\nRight now, the game is worth buying.

I played nearly all the predecessors from the series and, assuming this would be another iterative improvement with a new engine and better UI, got sucked into a pre-order.  This is not the X game you were looking for. It doesn't even seem to be an X game, just a console port that was never accepted for its console of choice, and so was sadly pushed into a PC launch wayyy before it was finished.  Ubiquitous bugs aside, the game just isn't done.  Maybe another year of development could have turned it into something special, but then it would have to compete with Elite and Star Citizen, something I sadly cannot see this game ever doing.  You can see what they were trying to do, but oh my did they miss the target, every time.  It just feels like a poorly implemented console game with none of the richness and depth that made the X series what it is (was).

What could you do in the other games that you can not do here? Almost everything. They dumbed down about every part of the X franchise for 8 year olds that throw games on the floor with any depth.\n\nNow, all that being said, Egosoft has always had a hell of a community. They were always modding the game, improving it for the better. Egosoft realized this and has in the past released player created content as 'Signed' content, meaning its possible to obtain it without modding the vanilla game.  So could modders do something crazy with this game in the future, I'm sure they could.\n\nLike I hinted at above, they have dumbed down about every aspect of the game here to appease a younger generation with a higher need for instant gratification. You pilot one ship, not a super awesome highly customizable ship that you can really make your own either. There's like 5 different types of components that you can buy for your ship, and maybe a variety of 3 for each component. One engine gives more speed, and less maneuverable thrust, one gives more maneuverable thrust less speed, and one is a 'balanced' option. Could having one ship if dont correctly be ok? I'm sure it could be, but this wasn't it. It's not exciting to buy upgrades for your ship when there really is only a couple ways to go.\n\nAnother problem, not only could you not really customize your ship, but you are not worthy of a cargo bay. Modders have attacked this already, but the base game left out your personal ability to trade. To trade you had to take one of your ships that is meant for the ware you are trying to buy and order it to make the purchase while you are there in sector. What a most horrible system. In the other X games you could order your ship half way across the galaxy to do something, true freedom\n\nThe weapons made for your player ship are dumbed down versions of the older X games as well. Maneuvering your ship is easy, and fighting is as advertised, but like I said, no customizability. 5 Different weapons, MK1 and MK2 of each, what trash.\n\nI could tell you 100 different woes of this game, just trust me when I say that this is no X game. There are a variety of plays on the word rebirth out there that people are calling this game, and rightfully so. The game was released broken (expected as its an egosoft game, but who cares about that, they always fix their games. It's the game itself that has the problem) and there's no feel left from previous games.\n\nIn retrospect, maybe after a year when the modding community tears this apart from the inside out will it be a real game. For now, wait for this to go in the bargain bin for 2.50.","December 4, 2013","false","16.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Quite frankly because it stinks, this game has tons of potential but so far isn't living up to it, if you are a fan of the X3 games for the sandbox style of play, give this game a wide berth for now until the modding community finishes what Egosoft started. As it stands, you can only pilot the Skunk which might be tolerable if it was a capital ship but no, it's a simple fighter. Also the menu systems bring you to a dead stop so issuing commands in battle may do more damage then it's worth. Drones can be controlled by the player, but what point is there in using drones when your ship sits still for the enemies? I mean, you have a co-pilot that won't actually co-pilot, all she will do is pretty much sit there as a conversation piece. To be honest, i miss my auto-pillock from X3, granted it would crash me into stations now and then, but atleast it MOVED MY SHIP instead of having me sit there doing NOTHING.\n\nUpdate: Auto-Pillock is back! and the first thing it did was slam me into the station i was undocking from... Artificial difficulty make this less of an actual space sim and more of an FPS. problems from my original review are still present. will do another update at 3.0 or when patching is dropped due to being unable to plug the dam with a finger.\n\nUpdate: New menu system WOO!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/louskrad/recommended/2870/","louskrad","LouskRad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/louskrad/","3216 products in account","Edit: The below was written at the time of the initial release, and I gotta hand it to egosoft; they never game up on this game and they've done a massive number of fixes, feature adds/changes and content updates. The game was released with version 1.0 and at the time of this edit it is v2.50 - with a v3.0 on the way for December 2014. A lot has changed, and I personally haven't tested the game since. Added that they offered an upcoming DLC free for those that already have the game, it seems Egosoft is trying hard to make up for the launch mess. So there is yet hope that this review might turn into a thumbs up soon.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you're a fan of the serries like I am, there is one word to describe this latest installment: disappointment.\n\nThe game launched with more bugs than it has features. Added to these bugs are performance issues - but what is really disturbing with this latter is why it's there to begin with: The game is built on directx 9,  and a quick look into the config files, etc shows XBOX 360 commands all around.\n\nYes, the best way to explain why this game turns out to be so disappointing can simply be understood from that: it's a revamped down X game made having consoles in mind. The menus and controls reflect this (seriously, you don't even have keyboard shortcuts for targetting) and it takes out most of what made the X series what they were.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. You pilot one ship throughout the game (yes, only one) and if you have additional ships in your fleet, they can't even be in a different sector than you. So long for massive space empires. Given the AI is next to nothing, these ships stand and look pretty most of the time instead of firing their turrets or trading.\n\nAh yes, trading. Gone are the days you could dock at a station and trade directly. You have to assign a frigate you can't pilot yourself to do that and wait half and hour for it to dock and do it (you don't have seta). So when the lack of AI and major bugs get in the way, you curse having lost that half an hour and start editing the save file just for the game to keep running on.\n\nWell, you would expect dogfights to be good since you have one ship - it would be optimized you'd think. No chance. Dogfights are sitting duck shoots whether you're fighting a cap ship or a small fighter. Again, it's an AI problem.\n\nThe big thing with this X game that we all were excited about was to walk around stations ... guess, how it turned out? Yes. a disaster. All stations have almost the same interior where all walking around adds to the game is to open crates and get minor items. All these crates look the same and you wouldn't wanna do that all the time, trust me. Except, you have to; you can't disable it. Even if you wanted to talk with someone at the station, you have to dock and open some crates and walk around and open some crates and finally find the person to buy a ship upgrade (if you're lucky and it doesn't bug that is).\n\nGranted, the X games were always launched as a mess - and tidied up later on. But this is not the kind of mess that can be tidied up - neither by egosoft nor the modding community. The basic motto is not there: trade, fight, build, think? Can't properly trade, no challenge in fighting can't build wherever I want and all it makes me think about is what good I can write for the game in this review (without any success).\n\nI've already written long and haven't yet touched some major problems (NPCs, highways, etc). I won't either. I believe you got my point. This game is released as an unfinished mess, but even if it is patched up in the near future, what we'll have is not an X game that we were expecting.\n\nThe biggest sandbox in the X universe? No it's not. That's an outright false statement.","November 26, 2013","false","6.2"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

Launch bugs are to be expected, but this is equivalent to an early beta/access game - which this is not identified as. Required tutorial story line missions are stuck in a broken state that can't progress. Saving the game sometimes crashes and destroys progress. Basic issues that should have been caught haven't been - walk in front of a scripted robot cleaning the wall? Get pushed through the wall. Stand in front of a vent and open it? The grate lifts you, sticks you to the wall above it, and disables you from closing it. Sometimes, while looking at the ship's in-cockpit UI, the UI becomes non-interactive and can't be left.\n\nAwkward:\nEven for a game in the X franchise, this has the poorest usability of the series. Somehow, the focus on immersion lost out to having a decent, playable game. Having to wait for length animations for basic functionality that a player would do often adds to the tedium for the sake of immersion. Despite being in-space, navigation involves entering an animation where the character pushes back, rotates his seat, and waits for a display to activate. During this, the game world is active, so don't count on quickly breaking from navigation to defend your self. Accept a mission to pick up and transport a passenger? Dock and hoof it through repetitive hallways to that duplicated, shoddy model of the passenger, talk to them (without skipping dialogue), wait through their boarding cutscene, then hoof it or teleport to your ship. Want to ask an NPC for directions to a drone trader? Talk to them, press a dozen keys to navigate through multi-level, multi-paged sets of dialogue options in a Mass Effect style dialogue wheel, 6 at a time (4 + "More" + "Back"), until you find Drone Trader, so that NPCs can randomly decline to inform you *after* you've went through 20 - 30 seconds of this UI to hear a snide rejecting remark. The cut for entering the cockpit of your ship teleports from one side of the ship to the next with no fade - akward and unpolished. While entering the seat, the seat animation seems to be mirrored for your copilot so that she flails and rotates in an inhuman fashion. All of this you must bear each and every time you do so and there is no option to skip.\n\nReally wanted to love this - played previous entries in the franchise, played Eve-Online, played Freelancer, played Strike Suit Zero, supporting Star Citizen - but this is a very poor release and very, very poorly designed for any target audience. What would be immersive is just tedious, distracting, and counters any immersion with glaring flaws.","November 25, 2013","false","36.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

Three weeks after release and Egosoft has yet to provide a game which is either functional or optimized. Numerous bugs and poor graphical performance (even on high-end rigs) still plague the game. This may have been forgivable, but in the few hours I've been able to play, due to game breaking glitches, there isn't much to miss. The menu system is counter-intuitive and show none, I repeat NONE of the information I look to see on ships, stats, et cetera. The map system is an oddly unintelligible, two-dimensional take that is unhelpful. Moreover, the new highway system and removal of the autopilot feature from X3 makes navigation a committed and tedious process. In all of my save games, the trading is irrepairabily broken because trade ships wil not dock with stations to buy/sell goods, but this isn't a huge problem as it prevents me from continuing in the trite campaign missions (sarcasm). I can reconcile that with the tedium and obtuse nature of trade in this game. Unlike X3 where you could issue buy/sell orders to ships remotely without being near the station(s) where the orders were placed, X: Rebirth requires you to fly to each and every station to place each an every order in a system that is simply ludicrous. Overall, a HUGE step back in what was a fantastic series. Not only am I out $50 on this game, but I've lost all faith in future releases from the X series and Egosoft.","December 7, 2013","false","6.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

It has tons of problems, but they fixed them in later patches. Then Terran Conflict came out: very similar to Reunion but way better. So I knew that a bad launch was not going to be a problem in the long run.\n\nI understand the frustration of early buyers and fans, but now it is a great game.\n\nYou still see on forums the usual "is the game still broken?" posts. To those people I say: it is perfectly playable.\nI had one crash to desktop, but it was my fault (alt-tabing during screen-resolution changes on a dual-monitor setup, the game did not like it).\n\nI run the game at maxed out graphs, on a 1920x1080 resolution: no slow-downs in fps.\n\nSo here are my pros and cons:\nPros:\n+Beautiful game\n+Nice micromanaging\n+Lots of options to choose from\n+Great gameplay (altho different from other games in the series, again: not X4)\n+Constant improvements from the dev team (thanks!)\n+Good music & sound effects\n\nCons:\n-Repetitive dialogs\n-Some few-years-ago character models\n-The interface needs a little getting used to\n\nSo for all space-sim fans out there: I recommend the game. If you read reviews of the game, be sure to note that old ones might be from older states of the game, which was indeed bad, so for those who never played the game, at version 3.20 (3.50 soon!): it is a good time to start.

In an attempt to create more immersion within the game the player can now walk around inside the space stations, however this is very poorly done. The stations feel dead and empty. Their is very little personality, with the NPCs all being generic. There appears to still be the capacity to set up the same economic empires that were possible in the previous games.\n\nI think this game is not what it could have been, though I hope this is remedied in the future. Currently I would give it a miss and check out the earlier games in the series. Or check out the upcoming 'Star Citizen' (which isn't on Steam and is still in development).","November 30, 2013","false","3.5"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

I love the X series.  I've bought the games more than once.  This does not belong in the series.  The only controller that works right is the Xbox 360 controller, and the entire interface is made around being a console game.  The game only uses DirectX 9 (like Xbox 360), and the story line missions are buggy and you can get stuck and have to manually edit your gamesave in order to continue the game to fix things yourself.  This really feels like a failed console game that was ported to PC that was never supposed to be in the X universe.\n\nIndustry standard controllers, like the Saitek X52, do not work.  The button mapping is buggy, as well.  It sees everything as an XBox 360 controller stick for some reason.  Also, it won't let you map more functions to a keyboard and mouse than you could to an XBox 360 controller.  This is a PC game that is constrained by a console controller's limitations.\n\nI'm still in the tutorial and it bugged out on me and stopped giving me any story missions or objectives about 10 minutes in.  Now I'm abandoned.\n\nThe "universe" is tiny.  There's only one camera view for your ship and only one small ship to fly.  You will not be commanding a large capitol ship yourself into epic battles.\n\nThere are maybe 10 different NPCs reused everywhere and only 3 different tiny interiors of space station ports.  Going inside of the space stations is obnoxiously painful, and the NPCs treat you rudely for no reason and repeat the same few phrases over and over.  It is also a pain to find the vendors you trade with and the interface to trade is awful.  It's just like a big F You when I am talking to every NPC to try to get the story to progress and trigger something, and they all end a conversation with something snarky like "Nice chat.  NOT!"\n\nThe economy is less advanced than current convenient stores.  It's seriously like each little port is a mostly empty farmer's market with a few NPCs that will trade with you, but you have to find them and sit through their insulting chat.\n\nThere is a trading system you can do from your ship, but I cannot figure out for the life of me if I am buying or selling items and where they are going or where the money is going.  I don't know if I'm buying missles or selling them.  What is the difference between To Sales and To Offers?  I have no idea.  I think I accidentally sold all of my missles, which I thought were on my little ship, but maybe my large ship had them?  I couldn't figure it out at all.\n\nThere is no radar for space battles.   No radar.  NO RADAR.  How do you dogfight with no radar to track enemies?  All you have is pointers around your view screen for directions.\n\nOh yeah.  No targetting, either.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe art design for the ships and exteriors of the space stations are amazing.  The art direction really is inspiringly beautiful in how they designed things.  You can get a sense for the purpose of various parts of stations and ships just by looking at them.  It is a joy to first explore them.  Even with only DirectX 9, they did an amazing job for how it looks when you fly around.  (the NPCs and interiors of stations are not that inspiring, though.  The NPCs are especially creepy with how their face pops onto your screen first, then body parts appear at different times and they materialize in front of you, due to pop in)\n\nThe sound is nice.\n\nOne thing the devs did is almost amazing enough to send them a thank you, though.  The save files are .xml files, which means they are human parsable ane plain text, so you can edit them pretty easily when you need to fix things... or give yourself tons of money, because the economy is so painfully implemented that it isn't worth the time to make money legitimately.  Why do I like this so much?  Because it is a single player game and people want to cheat or do fun things with a game to sandbox it when they want to.  Many people will install "trainers" that are loaded with malware in order to cheat, or install other cheat engine programs that will get you blocked by some online games just for being on your computer, or are also fillled with malware.\n\nIt's time to bring cheats back to games.  ♥♥♥♥ acchievements and ♥♥♥♥ encrypted save files.  Thanks to the emphasis on acchievements in the game industry, debug modes and cheat codes have disappeared so that people don't cheat to get some virtual trophy.  The result is giant botnets of malware infested users sending spam, helping to DDoS, and make the internet a worse place, because they install some trainer and now their system is compromised.  Kudos to the devs for letting their users do what they want with their own single player games.\n\n\n\nWhat it would take for me to change my mind about this game;\n\nRevamp the interface to make sense for keyboard and mouse.  You can keep the console option for big screen mode people, but give us a choice.\n\nFix joystick and key mapping support, especially for the X52, wink wink\n\nLet me map to more keys than an Xbox 360 controller can handle.\n\nPut in the traditional targetting and a radar\n\nRemove the interiors of space stations and just give me some giant landing bays that let me add a station to my trade network that I can access forever from my ship.  Look, right now, in real life, I can use this magical internet to buy or sell anything I want, and even more things that I don't want.  THE FUTURE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING BETTER.  STOP TURNING SPACE TRADING INTO FARMER'S MARKETS.  No one would do that with the technology available.  THIS MAKES NO SENSE.\n\nFix the story mission bugs\n\nGive me fleet management tools that let me make decisions that don't ever involve flying to a ship to talk to someone in person.  I should never have to dock inside one of my ships unless I am delivering a physical person or object.","December 10, 2013","false","22.8"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chakkahn/recommended/2870/","chakkahn","Chakka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chakkahn/","245 products in account","Short review: If you really want to try this game, either (A) wait for a great sale (at least 1/2 off) or (B) buy X3 Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude.\n\nLong review:\nSimulation games, especially space simulators run a very tight rope. They must be open enough to allow the player to experience the universe, but structured and formatted well enough to ensure the experience is a fun and pleasant one. Anyone who has seen 2001: a Space Odyssey knows that simulating space exactly would be maddening, boring, and above all, not really a game. In the past, Egosoft has managed (with a great deal of modder and community help) to make an enjoyable space sim. They managed to balance the openness of the universe with (albeit a bit buggy) mechanics. Although the learning curve was steep, the rewards were worth it when you found yourself the ruler of an interstellar empire.\n\nFor X rebirth, Egosoft decided to sprint full speed ahead, oblivious to that balancing act, and fell off that rope before it even managed a single step.\n\nPros: (1) Graphics update, (2) Capital ships have subsystems you can target strategically, (3) Boarding and training marines are more straightforward, no more chasing marines in space or waiting for them to train. (4) I managed to finish a full length novel and download another on my kindle while waiting for things to happen.\n\nCons:\n(1) You have 1 ship. Which wouldn't be bad if (A) you could actually customize it beyond 1 upgrade for each option, (B) you could actually customize the ship itself, beyond changing the glass layout in the cockpit, (C) your AI ships weren't braindead or hell, even (D) if you had a copilot that did more than argue with the computer and\n(2) almost half my total play time was spent wasting time doing NOTHING while I waited for (A) NPC trade runs to complete, (B) trading to complete, so that construction could continue to complete, (C) follow/escort missions to complete, (D) scripted events to start, (E) scripted events to complete, (F) NPCs talking to themselves, especially during D and E, (G) navigating menus while listening to NPCs flirt with me about their "wares". (I even managed to finish an entire novel in the time I was waiting! I kept it close by for these times)\n(3) The design, and trade menus are awkward to navigate, having been designed for xbox360. There is no depth in the commands, options, or details of the ships. It is nearly impossible to compare ships or their capabilities without using Roguey's site, and even then, there's no real reason to choose a different AI ship because\n(4) AI is terrible. Normally this would mean that your other ships were on equal footing. However, based on the design and lack of command options, your ships will not attack unless you yourself are attacked, or you navigate three menues to command them to attack a target chosen from the map screen while you are under fire. They also love to run right next to enemy ships (especially the capital ships) instead of using long range weaposn.\n(5) Repairing capital ships is a giant waste of time, and takes forever; repairing any non-capital ships is impossible without a mod. In other words, anything less than a capital ship is useless.\n(6) Everything requires an AI NPC, that you must carry around in the back of your ship to transport. Built a station? Needs a manager and a rare speciallist that you must find in a wild goose chase.  Just capped a ship? Better hope you already have a captain, defense officer, and engineer sitting behind you! While I get the idea that capital ships need officers, there is no way to have a "transport" ship keep these NPC's around for you. And god help you if there are no suitable candidates with the skills you need in nearby stations, or you've run out of space for freeloaders in the back.\n(7) NPC skills have no visible or explained effect. My 5 star all around captain/defense officer combo is equally as useless as my 1 star duo. On the same ship. In the same fight...\n(8) You must visit every station, constantly, in order to trade. Want to trade somewhere you already visited? TOO BAD! Since the two minutes you last docked there, the trade offer is gone. Note: the trade offer is still there, but you have to revisit to remember it is there!\n(9) Voice issues and translations: while I understand there are translational issues, a single english speaking person could have cleaned up 90% of the voice over issues. Heck, I might have preferred their native speakers to voice it, with subtitles, as opposed to hearing terribly performed, gramatically incorrect gibberish.\n(10) If there is a "story" in this game, it is hidden behind hours of waiting, incoherent english, bugs, and useless interface.\n(11) I'm pretty sure the game is about some guy named Ben who found a laser space skunk and trained it to fight "the man" (and then robots I think?) alongside a pair of breasts in a skintight suit with a strategic breast window. They are named Isha and Terran.\n\n","July 31, 2014","false","76.3"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibeej/recommended/2870/","ibeej","iBeej","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibeej/","26 products in account","I initially wrote and posted this on the official forums and had around 140,000 views and 129 replies.  But here it is for those who missed it, and I still feel this way about it.\n\nX Rebirth - For Dummies ... Literally\n\nMy friends, developers, and our extremely tight nit community... boy where do I even start? I could start off with my prior X Series experience. I could start off with a rant. I could start off crying. I could start off being hopelessly optimistic. But the truth of the matter is, we are feeling all of those emotions.\n\nYou took the X Series and made X Rebirth: For Dummies. Literally and figuratively. Only the dummies, still feel like dummies. You accomplished 2 things with the design changes:\n\n1.) You attempted to dumb down the existing complexity, but instead you merely convoluted everything through a new cumbersome half baked console driven UI and interaction menu system. Things that you thought took "too much effort" to display or review before, take even longer now.\n\n2.) You took a play right out of Apple's playbook, and flat REMOVED features because you knew best. What happened to all the key bindings? Too complicated, gone. Want to target the nearest hostile? Nope, you think gamepads are the future, no bindings for that. Want to quickly spot your proximity to others on the Gravidar? Nope, gone.. you need to fly aimlessly around stations scanning for anything relevant.\n\nEarth & Beyond\nI am totally surprised nobody has mentioned this one. Maybe this shows my age, but for those of you who don't know... there once existed (emphasis there) a game studio called Westwood. OH yes, many of you know it, and if you don't.. you should. They were hugely successful. They brought us the Dune Series, Command & Conquer, and then one day, they decided they would build a space MMO called Earth & Beyond. I subscribed, and I played it up until it flopped and failed miserably.\n\nI can't begin to tell you how similar it felt running around stations that were lifeless, only to interact with zombie NPCs who had nothing better to do but stand there. Things that could have been accomplished quicker from space and ship menus, HAD to be station oriented because "it was cool" and the developers believed in a fallacy that it's what gamers wanted. Yes, you hear players say this over and over, "Man someday it would be awesome if we could get out of our ships and walk around stations." Sounds good in theory, but has failed in practice, in every space game I have ever encountered, short of ONE game that was heavily story RPG oriented. Mass Effect.\n\nDo you know what happened to Westwood after their Earth & Beyond debacle? They closed their doors. The company liquidated. Yes, they aren't Egosoft. But Egosoft are not immune to these kinds of failings. And I can assure you, this has an eerie resemblance.\n\n\nBorderlands\nTo make station visiting "worth" the time sink, Egosoft decided to put in "lootable" boxes or crates in the stations. It has a striking resemblance to wandering around a zone in Borderlands opening crate after crate to get loot, or more commonly, endless amounts of nickels and quarters.\n\nFreelancer\nNot to bash Microsoft, because Freelancer was actually a hugely successful game. The only problem here is, X has never been a Freelancer game. But for some odd reason, Egosoft decided to stick you in one ship and have you wander around the galaxy, bouncing from station to station doing missions and trade runs like this was "partially" a Freelancer game now. Where are the vast control for the 100's of TS/TP ships as Sector and Universe Traders going about their trade runs you meticulously configured? It's gone, except in the form of "Squads" where your "owned" ships follow you around the lagged Universe, hoping YOU might know where everybody is actually going.\n\nOblivion\nFor those who played Bethesda's Oblivion, you will remember the god awful NPC happiness system. You would spend stupid amounts of time flirting, threatening, or joking with NPC's for a little "kickback" on prices or information. Egosoft has tried this out with their "Small Talk" dialogue options on NPCs. Sounds interesting at first, but it becomes mindless drab and not only did players hate it, but Bethesda learned their lesson and removed it from their future games. Skyrim was a huge success, because not only did Bethesda go back to the drawing board, but they learned some valuable lessons and REMEMBERED them going forward. What exactly happened at Egosoft? The whole community already knows you learned valuable lessons, but it's like you came down with an epidemic of alzheimers when you worked for 7 years on Rebirth.\n\n\nX Rebirth: The True Problem\nWe all know Egosoft has a stellar track record to listen to the community and patch games with a plethora of fixes and new content. This is undisputed by nearly everybody who has been here long enough. But you see, the problem with Rebirth is more severe than the typical game launch issues, bugs, performance problems, broken missions, etc. No, the problem with Rebirth is the inherent DESIGN. It's 7 year design. And yes, the modding community can do a LOT of things to improve games. Even change them to a certain degree. But I can assure you, as a full time software developer in both business and video games (and enthusiast modder for many games in my life) this one is very hard to fix, IF you are looking for classic X2/X3 game mechanics. Egosoft is faced with making drastic underlining design code changes to bring their community what it wants right now. I'm sorry, but that's just the reality of this situation right now.\n\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are actually very pretty. In space. I wont talk about the stations. But I do enjoy the overhaul to the station exteriors. The lighting and all the effects. While in space, it is definitely a sexy looking game.\n\n\nBut that is all I can find, in me, that makes me want to play Rebirth. It's pretty when flying around in space. IN SPACE. Not wandering around cookie cutter stations like E&B. I like the sector/zone highways. And i'm still not sure what to think about the "Highway Leapfrog" mini-game that goes on when traveling through the highway system. In fact, I kind of hate looking straight up the tail pipe of other ships, crowding my already diminished view of space to make room for a beautiful cockpit which you can't even free-look.\n\n\nAgain, not to be crass here... but as an experienced software engineer, hell even in space games as an Indie, I have to ask Egosoft, what exactly did you accomplish in 7 years?\n\n\nBest Regards, and good luck.\n","February 20, 2014","false","8.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

In the 7 hours I played the game hard crashed 6 times and I lost save data every time. To complete a tutorial mission I had to edit a game save file in notepad and put my mission state further ahead because of a bugged ship that got stuck. After I finally finished the tutorial I closed the game and never touched it again.\n\nThe entire thing is optimized terribly and even in my high-end machine I could barely break 20FPS at the lowest possible settings. And I mean lowest. Don't be fooled by the screenshots on this store page. They don't reflect anything I ever saw with 12gb RAM, GTX 760 and a Core i7. It seems like when you walk around on foot the game is not only simulating, but rendering all of the activity outside of the station which causes it to run like complete trash even when you're standing still, doing nothing.\n\nNow they are rebranding as "X Rebirth 2.0" but don't be fooled, it's the same game with the same ♥♥♥♥ optimization. In the 7 months since launch they fixed a lot of the mission bugs and added the ability to not bother leaving your ship to go out on foot.  I think they also added some new cockpits and some different start conditions. But, maybe the worst part about the game is that even with all the bugs and optimization fixes, I don't think it was very good as a game... I only completed the tutorial so I don't have a great perspective but from what I played it was slow, clunky, and not fun.\n\nCherry on top: The price of this game hasn't dropped a dime since release. They are still selling it for $50. This game is not worth $50. If I could get a refund I would. That 33/100 metacritic rating doesn't lie.","June 22, 2014","false","7.8"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","26","43","0","0"

I paid full price when it was first released and regret it to this day. Bugs and glitches galor, and Im trying to give it another chance now that the 2.0 patch is out. The learning curve is very high, so the people sticking with it are a bit more hard core, or gluttons for punishment. The game is pretty, but if you have played any of the previous X games, you will be dissapointed to learn that you are limited to one ship, an annoying copilot, bad voice acting, and some ugly NPC's when you have to encounter them.\n\nI dont know anybody who likes to pilot sim games with mouse and keyboard controls, but there is support for a 360 controller, which is ok at best. And if you have a decent flight stick, expect to spend a good amount of time remapping controls till you get it into a useful configuration.\n\nSadly, there are no other current gen space sims on the market, though last I checked, you can get the X bundle of the previous games in this series for under $20. If that isnt good enough for you, its still a long wait for Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen.","June 22, 2014","false","22.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Not only the engine has undergone dramatic changes, if not even being rewritten from scratch, the whole gameplay was redesigned and changed. This results in huge performance problems even half a year after release - and yes, still in version "2.0" - as well as tons of bugs and lack of polish. The game still feels like a beta version at best. The graphics are shiny (except for the NPCs, they're creepy old-people dolls with dead eyes), but on many systems you won't get even playable FPS. If you think your rig is top notch - this doesn't matter. Look at the forums.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, they have not yet reached the complexity of their older titles. Important features are currently missing, like the ability to create a closed ecosystem when you are building a complex of stations and want them to only buy from your own supply chain. The UI still is uncomfortable, but to be fair, the X games always had that problem.\n\nPersonally, I had not much of possibility to play the game due to unplayable FPS. I am not sure if I like how they changed the universe to be much more dense and brought the action close to the stations. From what I have experienced, the universe feels too small for my taste. It's more like being in a giant space city, but the feeling of the vast space just doesn't appear. I think I would prefer a mix of the old X3 Reunion and Rebirth. Back to a sector based universe with lots of empty space to travel, but the stations as big and complex as in Rebirth. But I would leave out the NPC interactions. The idea of having to interact with NPCs to get tasks done might have good intentions, but it annoys me. Especially when they are as ugly and static as in X Rebirth. I prefer the good old ship computer and menus.\n\nSo. Would I recommend it? Not in version 2.0. Maybe in version 3.0 or 4.0, what I want to say is: when they have fixed the game. Keep an eye on it, stay informed. Egosoft always has supported their games for an extraordinary long time. It surely is an interesting title, but it currently has way too many issues in performance, bugs and polish to recommend it. Go get the X Superbox and play the older titles, they are awesome space sandbox goodness.","June 23, 2014","false","10.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I enjoyed the prior x games, but this is the 'special' cousin. If you enjoyed trading, forget it here. In an effort to 'streamline' trading, they basically made the whole thing shockingly frustrating. Most of your time is spent flying only a few meters away from each station searching for the hidden docking points. You will realistically spend 5-10 minutes just circling each station to find it has nothing of value to offer. I spent hours looking for a single profitable trade and couldn't find it. Epic fail on the trading side of the game.\n\nAll other aspects are just as broken. The system of highways makes you fly in predefined paths from one set of stations to another and forces you to play a really lame minigame that involves drafting other ships for added speed. If that even sounds interesting, think again. What it means is that travel generally consists of a low res view of the backside of some stupid civilian ship only meters off of yours.\n\nOh and the voice acting in this game made me want to hurt myself.","April 21, 2014","false","19.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I was alarmed when I read that there would be only one pilotable ship, but was assured that it would be wildly customizable.  They lied, there is virtually zero customization...  which primarily revolves around which of a half-dozen weapons to equip.\n\nThey touted on-foot exploration as a groundbreaking feature where we could explore space stations and factories that actually had working machines producing physical goods using physical resources.  They lied...  there are ~4 layouts of space stations with a minimal amount of space to "adventure".  Hallways are blocked off via doors painted on walls and piles of janitorial refuse.  None of them appear to actually serve any real function, although one was obviously intended to be a jail.  I guess some genius figured that nobody would question why 1/4 of the space stations in the game used to be prisons.\n\nThey got rid of the time acceleration feature, claiming that their usage of space highways would make the game faster.  Unfortunately it just means that your cargo ships now take hours of real time to get anywhere since they don't use the highways.

The icons of enemy ships and loot is still to small to see, there still is the boobs mini game... the stations still need to be identified (which takes hours), and the game is still 4 sectors big. Did not see new weapons.\n\nThere are a few new starts, the new cockpits don't block the view as much as the old ones.\n\nBe back later if I find the courage to try the game more...\n\nBelow: the previous review\n\nI don't usually write of reviews, but... this game has disappointed me so much.\n\nOk first: the history. This game is the "latest" from Egosoft, which had somewhat of a cult following by a growing community based on the X-Universe. Concept evolved a bit. At the start, you could manage only a single ship, and over the diverse iterations the game had, you could control the entire universe, pilot anything you could see in the game, board other ships, force other pilots to leave theirs so you could add them to your fleet. You could build ships, weapons, shields, food, manage the economy of the entire game... or not, if you wanted to. This was a plain good example of a sandbox.\n\nNot that the game was any way near perfect. From what I've seen, there was little changes in the core "code" and the multiple possibilities added in the game over a period of more than a dozen year were added as time went by. Also, core "concepts" of the game remained broken, like trading, like the awful amount of submenus you had to go through for simple actions, like the amount of micro needed to manage a semi-decent sized fleet, like the awful tutorials (few games have tutorials that players complain of not even being able to start), and pathetic "early" game hell (your starting ships usually are the ones needing the most skills to pilot, a choice a load of people found dubious at best - even then, there is a load of things that need to be learned for the game to work and the game barely explains any of it). Some sell this as "good game with harsh learning curve", but it's not really learning when the game expects you to know things it does not tell you. It did get a little better with the latest iterations of the game. The game was still harsh and unforgiving, but you actually could manage somewhat.\n\nThe community was very active, modders changed and influenced the game, as with the concept of scripting nearly everything open to them, it was very much possible to rewrite most of the universe, ships, weapons, trading and so on...\n\nWhat did players want for this last edition ?\n\nSimply a rework of the engine making the game more intuitive. More beautiful graphics. An expanded universe. A decent UI. Some other "simple" stuff.\n\nWhat did they get ?\n\n(Note that I'm voluntarily ignoring the fact I spent half of my "playing time" editing xml, and other bugs.)\n\nThey got a game with less possibilities on all aspects of the game. The starting ship cannot be switched and can irrealitiscally take on the whole universe with ease. Your fleet (you can remote control other ships) currently can barely be controlled and built, but the interface for doing so is actually WORSE than before. Before, you had to move through half a dozen text sub-menus to do a simple task. Now, it's half a dozen subscreens. Your own movement : before, it was slow, painfully slow of most ships with decent firepower, but you could alleviate this somewhat by jumping around from a sector to the other side of the universe. This is not possible anymore (jumping) without lengthy micromanagement, but the ship isn't faster as a result, making the game even slower than before. Building stations was cumbersome and annoying, but with mods you could somewhat do something. Now, it's just painfully long, cumbersome, annoying, and more expensive than ever.\n\nAbout the mini-games, like tailing other ships to speed on lanes... except half of the sectors in the game have no ships in them, so painfully slow at its finest. Another mini-game, each time you put on a subscreen, your copilot (which no one ever asked for) flashes her boobs at you... Bad taste at its finest, again. Yes, that's the minigame. I think. Well. Dunno. I suppose, it's written "trade" on one of the boob screens. The "conversation" minigame, which figures random (and therefore useless) rewards when you have a specific need. The "find people to pilot ship / station / build station / pilot fighter / repair systems / board ship" mini-game, which is the most time-consuming problem ever. If you fight a fleet with a cap ship and 3 fighters, and manage to board the cap ship and capture 2 fighters, you need to have 2 pilots (fighters), 1 captain (for the cap ship), 1 engineer (to repair the cap ship, otherwise you can capture it but it won't move), 1 marine officer (to start the boarding action). Except you have only 4 places in your ship. If you were doing anything like transporting a specialist to a station, finding an architect to build a station, you have even less places to use. Point is, you usually have to go though 2-3 stations and systems to get one guy...\n\nThis game was marketed as a "X-universe" game until about a day or so after it got released, after that, the community was told that this was not supposed to be a "rebirth" of the previous game, but another game. However: even forgetting all that you could do earlier and cannot do here, the game is STILL bad enough that you want to run away from it. Funny enough, a game in the same universe, with the same naming schtick, with the same motto, and named "rebirth" is supposed to be a completely different game. To illustrate, the guys from Egosoft are like trying to market Diablo 3 as a game which is not a Diablo-like. Except, they're not marketing diablo 3, they're trying to market a cheaply made copy of diablo 1 with good graphics.\n\nEgosoft does have some history about cleaning up their own mistakes, but here, problem seems to be that the main designer of the company does not seem to have a clue of why his game was "successful" in the first place, that they still did not hire an ergonomist (or maybe they've got an incompetent one, who knows ?), that their marketing service does not understand anything about the concept of "public image", and that they still have no quality checks for bugs in the game (that's been for a dozen years).\n\nMaybe when the company changes enough so this game series gets all this, I'll buy X-Rebirth 3.","February 23, 2014","false","75.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","1"

Because DeepSilver and ES new that they are releasing an incomplete product. That means they should be able to deduce that there will be no money in a long term as public ratings will not let sales to improve.\n\nSo, what was the logic? I doubt that DeepSilver was out of money. I think DeepSilver was simply indifferent, maybe it was their way of saying "promises must be kept". But hell no. The one who says it, does not understands software industry and should not be in it as per se. You always, always plan for delays and set offs in such huge projects. Thats why DS does not even have any huge games except X series. They simply do not know to work with such projects.\n\nQuality means money and thats one thing they forgot.

I am not a veteran of the series, since I just started playing X3 Albion Prelude less than a year ago (it being my first X game). I absolutely love the lore of the series and the core gameplay mechanics. This would have been a perfect addition to the series if it had just did the following simple things:\n\n1) Add a few more graphics effects to X3AP, like SSAO and the new anti-aliasing techniques such as FXAA and MLAA.\n\n2) Add good tutorials for the X3AP UI. (Don't make a silly radial UI; it makes the same quantity of data harder to read, makes complex functions harder to access by requiring the player to dig through menus, etc.)\n\n3) Improve AI decision-making\n\n4) Add in-game access to an extremely detailed encyclopedia about everything, especially the history of the Albion System and information about weapon systems and ships. This exists in X Rebirth, but much of the potential combat depth of X3AP is missing in X Rebirth.\n\n5) Build the rest of the game around it.\n\nAdmittedly, it would have run worse and not looked at good as X Rebirth does now, but at least the gameplay would have been better.\n\nThe biggest reason that this game is so buggy and broken is that Egosoft developed an entirely new game engine. That's right, this is NOT running on an older CryEngine. They spent a huge chunk of their development costs on creating an entirely new engine for the sake of graphics. This game will stand as a testament against the philosophy that graphics are the primary contributor to the quality of a game.\n\n\nFinal Notes: In X3AP, you could captain or pilot every ship in the game - including capital ships - yourself. You could create fleets of numerous types of ships all supporting each other in various ways, according to your specifications. For instance, you could purchase a carrier and dock dozens of fighters to it. If the fighters needed to rearm with missiles, you could stock the carrier with missiles. You could outfit one destroyer to support your fighter wing with anti-fighter and anti-frigate capabilities, or the destroyer might attack other destroyers while protecting a missile frigate (probably piloted by the player) that barrages fighters and frigates with swarm missiles and capital ships with torpedoes.\n\nIn X Rebirth, the tatical options have been limited for the sake of simplicity, rather than explained. Honestly, why couldn't they just make in-game tutorial videos for all the already-existing, complex functions? Change and improvement are often two different things.\n\nDo not buy this game, even if it's on sale for five dollars, unless it's drastically patched.","January 15, 2014","false","7.3"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

It is not of good quality, and certainly not Fit for use. Admitedly, it has got better over time, but not enough for me to justify the money I spent on it. I did learn a valuable lesson from it , which was never , ever again pre orer any game. The hype was amazing, and the spin that Egosoft put on it, made it look incredible. Well its not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedown/recommended/2870/","icedown","IceDown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedown/","65 products in account","I'm rewriting my review after a year of this game being out.  I'm also going to consider it from a stand alone point of view.  This is only an X game from a story line point of view, it does not hold anything else in common with the preceding X games.\n\nAs a whole, the game is free from major bugs, expecially the plot breaking ones.  The biggest problems I have with the game, is that for a game set in space, the areas are both cramped and to expansive at the same time.  The massive stations, while full of detail, can really become a hinderance while fighting near them as there is no reprecussions for the ai if they accidentally shoot them, but as the player, if you shoot the station or some of the civillians running around, you get reported to the police, have a standing drop, and if this isnt' your first time, get to have some of the police joining the fight against you.\n\nThese stations aren't so far apart that it takes long to get to them, but finding your way around them to a specific docking port can take a while if you don't have something to lead you to where it is.  This has been helped alot now though with the ability to gain access to all of the people on the station from near one of the dock ports.  You can also trade and recruit without landing on the station, with a slight delivery fee.\n\nThe stations themselves, while each type being very detailed and different, are rather limited in numbers.  Station interiors and NPCs also fall victim to this.  There are only about as many interiors as there are types of docks.  While each one is changed slightly, it's kinda like just rearranging a house without changing the base layout, there's only so much you can do.  The NPCs are all very generic, detailed, but ugly people generally.\n\nThis type of situation is the standard for the game.  Excellent detail on the individual parts, but so few parts, they repeated to many times.\n\nYour ship, the Pride of Albion(aka Albion  Skunk as the designers decided to name your ship without giving you a chance to rename it to something worthy of a leader's ship)  Falls vicitim to this detailed mototony again.  Your primary weapons, a variety of lasers, are all able to be equipped to the ship simultiously, though you may only use one at a time.  As your experience, and cash, goes up, you are able to purchase upgraded versions of these, but they are nothing more than more powerful versions of the basics.  The missile selection is a little more diverse, mainly attributed to  the latest patches, with a good selection to suit most suations.  The engines and shields are also limited in selection with an average version, then one version at each extreme.  3 "types" of engines/shields, and increasing levels of them.    Your "copilot" is probably one of the worst parts of the ship, she is repetitive, annoying and the choice of outfit just doesn't fit into the game.  While that's not usually an issue, it really does bug me for some reason, considering the amount of time she ends up on your screen. I'm all for hot space women with very little left to the imagination, but this one doesn't fit into that in any way, and the "boob window" as it is called, just annoys me.\n\nBasic ship to ship combat is very standard, run of the mill.  Captial ships are large lumbering and pretty much push overs.  While they do support good shielding and hull hp, they only take time and very little effort to take down.  They have plenty of blind spots to hide in and recharge your shields while being pretty much invulerable.  One good example of this is the drone bays.  Wide open bays you can park your ship in, with no real way for the enemy to attack you.  Once you have recharged, you can pop back out and start taking out the turrets again.  They are very slow, and while they can jump from area to area, they are hard to manage on a large scale.   Trading with them tends to be tedious.\n\nI do like the transportation system, aka highways.  they give you a nice view of systems,  balanced transit times, and are fairly well laid out, though it can take a while to memorize the network.  The improved maps in the latest patches have made finding your way around them easier, but I still think there is room for improvement on this aspect.\n\nThe missions and storyline are the one thing that really hasn't changed from the older X games or many other space games.  There are a couple set basic types of missions, and they are varied in difficulty by time, number of enemies, and such.  The biggest issue with the missions is that you have to wander around the massive stations looking for the icon to pop up,  there is no central place to find them, and you can sometimes take longer finding a mission than it takes to complete it.   I do like the story line and it fits well into the X universe and it's history.  The acting leave something to be desired of but on a whole, I do like this aspect.\n\nThe final part of this game that I'm going to cover is the sandbox.  Whether you start from the end of the story line or a custom start, this in my opinion, is where the game is most lacking.  I have found it hard to set goals that keep me playing the game.  Your ship is fairly limited in upgrades, so combat can quickly become monotanous, though boarding and capturing ships has become increasingly difficult with the latest patches.  Building stations is also a long and tedious process with very little return on investment, as well as the same thing with trading.  The main problem I have with all of this is that once you limit out your ship, the only reason you need any money is to restock your missiles, or build more stations and capitals.  Yes you can use it to fund large combat squadrons, and go around wiping out whole stations and zones, but since you can't seem to takeover/rebuild the stations, you are eventually shooting yourself in the foot trade wise.  This game just does not have the variations in the right areas to be able to set large, diverse goals that can keep you playing the game for extended periods of time.\n\nIn review, as a whole, this game has a large attention to detail in what it has in it, but there is just not enough general content.   The story is a bit of a grind at times, but worth completing I believe.  All in all though it is a pretty average game these days,  Excellent detail, severe lack of content.  On a positive note though, unlike a lot of the good indy space games that are out, this game has an attention to layout that prevents the confusion that many of this genre suffer from.  There are a lot of other games, that while they are much more diverse and open ended, suffer from a pieced together user interface that is cumbersome and hard to understand. This game is sleek well designed and easy on the eyes.\n\nOne more section to this review. If you have played any of the prior X games, do not go into this game with any expecations of it being like the rest.  You have been restricted to one ship, one race, even though there are 2 other races floating around, and a very limited selection of support ships.  From this aspect, they took the massive amount of content that the other games had, and removed it to provide high detail on a limited amount of content.  If they were to create DLCs that are X Rebirths for each race, and added them to the current standing game, not on their own indivitually, this game could eventually get much closer to the feel and playability of the original games, but I really don't see that happening.","May 26, 2014","false","75.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Luckly I purchased this game at a much later date when it was being sold for 50% off. As much as I want to recommend a game that developers put a ton of time into, I just cannot do it with X rebirth.\nHere are the reasons why:\n\n1.) We'll start with the campaign; One thing I like about Syfi games is immersion. If you can make me feel like I'm in living breathing world with things to do at ever corner, you've done a good job. Now I must admit they almost had me but when I found out that NPC's in the game where not actually doing anything they're simply there for cosmetic purposes, that killed me.\n\n2.) Voice acting, simply put, if I wanted to go see or hear talentless actors, I'd watch Twilight. The voice acting is absolutly, (ABSOLUTLY) atrocious. Coupled with bad resolution NPC models which a player would easily see that they all look simlar to one another, like a universe with a obvious incest problem.\n\nWhat I don't understand if you would go to the lengths to make the outer world beautiful, and unique. Why not apply that same work when you're inside the station walking around? Keep in mind AAA graphics is not the bread-and-butter of a game, but keeping graphics the consistant through out definitely helps.\n\n3.)  I've played the earlier installments of the 'X series' and enjoyed them very much, personally one of the things I enjoyed the most was being able to switch ships around for bigger and badder ones. Although piloting a ship is one-hundered times better in X Rebirth, you are limited to one ship. Many people will aurgue this, but point blank if you're going to compete with today's space sims this is a feature your game is going to need.\n\nThe good:\n\n1.) With all that said, the game does have it's good side. One, being piloting the ship and navagating through menus is awesome, takes some time to learn.\n\n2.) The "outer world" (when you're flying in space, near station (ect...). Is beautiful! And very futuristic looking.\n\n3.) The game does offer things to do being: Minging, Gas harvesting, Station building, Trading, and exploring.\n\n4.) I'll give it to Egosoft, they know they fu(ked up. But are working to impove the games mechanics, and any game braking issues. Hopefully the game will have a birghter furture, we'll see.\n\nFor sure this game is not worth the $49.99 it is currently being sold for, but it is worth the $25 or so bucks that I bought it for during the sale.","July 1, 2014","false","14.0"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

As it stands I give it 60% and an "only if you are a fan". Potentially, it could become one of the best games ever made.\n\nI'm glad I have it..and i'm sure these problems will eventually be worked around - but I'm not entirely happy with it. And, for that reason, I can't fully recommend it at this time.\n\n*edit* As of 21/07 ..or 07/21 if you are American, the game continues to improve, continues to get closer to being a finished product, and continues to remain unfinished. A little note on the "missions" changes, the new ones add much needed interest and direction for those who don't want to be stuck inside the "campaign" but, since you can't run into the quest givers from the freeplay mode trying to play this as purely a sandbox game still doesn't work - there just aren't enough random events still to make freeplay a valid option. If you decide to "go it alone", trade around a while, be a mercenary, set up a station, it just feels like you are doing those things in a bubble.

They're still pretty great, especially with mods.\n\nWell, Rebirth basically took all of good parts of the previous games and threw them out.  It's trash.  Combat is completely generic.  The trading system has been completely gutted.  The menus barely even work, and are bogged down with annoying animation to transition between the pages (and there are SO many pages).  The follower ships that you're supposed to hire and order around?  Wothless interface for orders, and they mostly just bug out and sit there.  The first person portions of the game, walking around on your ship and on stations are not even remotely interesting and only serve to distract and annoy from the already terrible gameplay.\n\nRemember how previous titles focused on setting up automated production/trade routes for profit?  Nope gone.\nAlso, you only get one ship.  Because someone at the developer thought that could possibly be a good idea...I don't know how.\n\nI really enjoy the previous titles in this franchise.  They were challenging and unique games that occupied a special niche in gaming for me, and nothing else has offered a economic space sim that was even close to as interesting.  I cannot express how disappointed I am in this waste of a game.  I'm not sure that I'd be willing to risk my money on future titles from this developers.

Ships frequently smash into things that they shouldn't and trading can be a bit hit or miss occasionally due to this issue.\n\nThe biggest problems lies within the story however, which is supposed to act as a tutorial. However it's fairly evident that little more than a quarter of the way through, the devs got pretty fed up with trying to make the story function as a tutorial and stop giving any advice whatsoever about how to acheive the required actions to continue the story. Unles you're already familiar with X you will not beat the story without a guide, and even with one there will be many hours of head scratching. There is no warning upon entering a mission that you will need a lot more finance.\n\nTo give a short example, I was asked to do a food supply run, with little instruction as to how. After 4 hours of reading forums and experimenting I finally figured it out and was ready to progress with the story. Unfortunately the game neglected to mention that I would also be expected to build a space station that would cost me well over 2 million. Considering the amount of weeks it would take to build up such money, I say dodge the story and try and enjoy free play for what it is if you really must buy it. A buggy, broken and questionable mess that at least looks pretty.\n\nStar Citizen and Elite: Dangerous leave this game in an awkward position, making it the lesser of the three despite being the only finished game, and your money would be much better spent on the superior competitors, one of which should release by the end of this year.","June 27, 2014","false","51.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It is sad that developers decided to make so many gamebraking gameplay decisions that simply make the game so frustrating, slow progressing and difficult to access. There is almost no automation, so you can forget having a big corporation like in previous X games, the beggining of the game is just disapointment after disapointment when discovering that you cannot do that or that, and you have to do it manualy, slowly and be present in the zone where its going to happen. Without the option to accelerate time (which EGOSOFT said they will NOT add) i had to stare at my trade ship to dock at a station for 25 minutes, as thats how long it took to dock. In the mean time there was nothing else to do at all. So EGOSOFT says that time acceleration will not be needed in the game as you dont have to wait for your trade ships that much. Probably 25 minutes of docking is not considered as sufficient amount of time to wait before it starts to fall under "need to wait" category in EGOSOFT.\nMany gameplay features are simply not working alongside with the games concept. The interior is suprisingly passive and you basically cannot do anything in it, not even turn your head.\nTo "discover" a new station in your zone, you need to be ridiciously close to it, we are talking about 500m for your computer to notice it. And than comes the weird duty of scanning the station, which means you need to come like 500m far from each module of that station, and not just anywhere on that module, on every module you have to find a specific spot that you need to get close to in order to scan it. So the whole scanning process of EVERY station will take about 10-30 minutes.\nWhat is that about? Isnt it in the stations interest to just tell me "Hey we are selling this for this much, want some?"\nI have to go thru so much hassle to get to know what do they make, sell and for how much that its beyond believe. After that, the whole frustration process of trading starts that again is so "un-independent" that making even the simpliest trades takes player so much time...\n\nEgosoft, there are many gameplay decisions you chose to implement that i can live with, but you have broken the whole concept of X games into small pieces that each is very frustrating and doesnt really go one with another.\n\nI want more interactive cockpit, i want to click on a small button above the radar screen to change its modes, modes like :zone map, sektor map, selected object info, basic trading info for the zone etc.\nI want to turn my head in cockpit\nI dont want to go inside of the stations and search for needed engineer hoping there is some everytime i need one\nI want to be able to communicate with the stations from outside, i shoud not need to dock at all if i dont need repairs\nI want to use more than one gun at the same time\nWell yes i will say it. I want the game to be a lot more like the previous X games were.\nYou said you will make it more user friendly but to me it is exact opposite, even when you know how to do stuff, it is pain to do it","June 9, 2014","false","6.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

Suddenly, there's a different game in my list claiming to be X-Rebirth and it is really good.\n\nI knew my birthday in 2013 was going to be amazing. I knew this because X-Rebirth was going to come out the day after. I gingerly thanked everyone that wished me a Happy Birthday and kinda more or less glanced over any of the gifts, because the next day none of them would matter. I was going to be fully engulfed in X-Rebirth. 2013 was going to be the best birthday ever.\n\nThen it came out. I might have played with it for 12-20 hours. Trying to get past the bugs, the glitches, the missions that won't work and force a restart, the loss of SETA, and everything else that I felt as though I had lost from the previous versions of the game. My birthday... was destoryed.\n\nA year later I noticed that I had been given the first DLC since I was one of the inital purchases of this awful game, so I thought I'd give it another shot. Add in a few mods and I suddenly had a tolerable game. I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't really like either. Things where progressing and I decided that I would continue to keep an eye on it.\n\nThen 4.0 Beta. A totally new game that keeps telling me that it is X-Rebirth, but this game is really really good. I've got quite a few hours in it now as you can see and this is only because of what they have done since the newest patches.\n\nIgnore the old reviews and read the ones for the DLC. This game is easily worth every single penny these days.","February 1","true","217.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Everything looks like it were aimed at consoles, but on the other end... not.\n\nUI is not only complex, but it lacks any sense of purpose. Earlier it was just complex but almost everything was where it was for a reason; and it worked after getting used to it. 7 hours into the game and I still have constant issues with the UI, never finding anything and things have been done VERY complex compared to what it used to be.\n\nStory feels nice and for that alone I will keep on playing, hoping that one day I get over the hugely confusing stupid UI Egosoft has created for Rebirth. I heard that a year ago the game was utterly unplayable and that doesn't surprise me at the least; it has been like this for a long time for X-series... Game is more or less unplayable for the first year and then it starts to get where it should be.\nI only hope X:Rebirth isn't where it should be, since there is so many issues still (at least for someone like me, who has spent literally thousands of hours in the earlier titles) especially with the UI and the way everything works.\n\nFighting is very difficult with autoaim set to off, using Saitek X52 Pro makes life hell - easier to play with a gamepad and everything works way more logically with that.\n\nAll in all, not a TOTAL failure. Not worth the full money even after a year of developement and bug fixing or the DLC. Still I get a nice feeling flying around trying to go on with the plot and the game draws me back in, calling me to play more.\nA lot of work is still needed, but if anyone can do it - Egosoft can.\n\nAgainst my better judgement I *will* recommend this game for everyone who are enthusiaistic about X series or "hardcore space sim's", but those who are not one of the two groups mentioned should really try it out first to see if they like it.","March 15, 2015","true","11.8"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","0"

However after playing X Rebirth for a decent amount of time the ship that you fly (The Albion Skunk) has really grown on me. Piloting the skunk around the universe as you build up your forces has a Han Solo feel to it.\n\nOverall the I recommend the game to anybody looking for a great sandbox space sim that features tons of emerging mechanics that makes each players experience vastly different. If you are on fence the about buying X Rebirth, wait until it goes on sale and pick it up for cheap.\n\nPros:\n+ Sound track - top quality stuff, definitely worth the money for the sound track\n+ Graphics - the older X games really felt lacking in this department and X Rebirth delivers\n+ Gameplay - piloting feels fun, and large scale fleet actions with capital ships feels omg epic\n+ Crew - you need to hire staff to run your empire, capital ships need engineers and captains. it adds a bit to the immersion\n+ Easy to learn - compared to the other X games the learning curve is less steep\n+ Replayability - with different start options and so much to do (start as a trader, combat pilot, or pursue the main story), the game evolves in so many different ways\n\nCons:\n- Weapons - choice feels very limited, and no real customization in this department\n- Pace - as with all X games, the game may be too slow for many people. it takes serious time to enjoy the game, especially if you are new to the series\n- Bugs - there are very annoying bugs, however none that I have encountered have been game breaking\n- Cannot fly multiple ships - this makes many people sad\n\n","March 23, 2015","true","163.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

I then moved on and bought elite dangerous which although technically brilliant as a sim it has no life and therefore no lastin interest.  Since the X-Rebirth has been patched it has come on in leaps and bounds to become the game it should have been. The only space combat sim that imo got the balance right was Freelancer which ofc is now barely limping along due to lack of support.\n\nGo for Elite Dangerous if you want a pure sapce flight sim (but thats all you'll get).\n\nThis is the goto game if you want something with loads of depth and life.

Much better than other space sims I've played. It is a different game than previous X games so if you're expecting the same as before you will be disapointed. That's probably why there are so many negative reviews, people's expectations are not met. But this game isn't trying to be just like previous X games. It's a whole new graphics engine and approach in general.\n\nDoes it have some quirky moments? Yea sure. One look at the save file and you can know that there is a million different calculations going on in this game constantly... so I'm not surprised that "occasionally" things might get a little "stuck".\nYou know what, deal with it! People aren't perfect and neither is Egosoft, give them a break. The game they first released certainly had many bugs but they have stayed with their game and addressed them. For the times it does get "stuck", it's usually just a matter of leaving the zone and coming back or reloading a previous save... done, that's all, no big deal.\n\nIf you don't like space sims, or thinking, than you won't like this. There are mods to make things move a long much faster... play the game first and then read up on the mods so you understand what they really do and then get what is appropriate for your playstyle.\n\nThe community for this game is awesome. People are always willling to help out and give guidance in the discussion boards.\n\nLike any game on Steam, I personally wait for  a sale, but this game is worth buying as long as you are willing to push through the learning curve... you tube, google search, and steam discussions are your friend.","January 31","true","252.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

Why?  Of the 7.1 hours I played, 6.5 of that was just figuring out keyboard commands with the lack of documentation provided by the game.  I finally gave up.  I’ve figured out command lines for Cisco network switchs' advanced configurations faster than I have learned how to engage basic functions in this poor excuse for a video game.\n\nOh, I don't mind a complex command layout—Freespace 1-2 had some of the most complex commands in a video game and they were epic games—but these developers failed to document the commands.  That is a serious problem: complex command structures combined with little to no documentation or tutorial.  Definitely an Underpants Gnome’s recipe for profit.\n\nFor example: early mission – acquire captain for your freighter.  Ok, no prob.  Get to said station, something Labs something.  It’s big.  Looking for a docking port.  Not showing one.  Looking at map, not showing a docking port.  Followed the beacon, takes you to a generic point on station.  Knock on the station “door” with the front of my ship – no answer.  Guess nobody’s home.  OK, consult in game control settings at this point (Esc > settings > control).  In the last X games, it’s comms, request permission for docking.  Tried that first, mind you, yet there is no comms with the station at all (a space station that does not talk to anybody, intereseting).  Going through settings > controls, nothing about acquiring/hiring personnel from a station that will not answer comms.  Out of desperation, just start hitting all other buttons to see if something works.  ‘I’ was the one—because, you know, the info menu is the logical place to put hire commands—and I was able to hire a caption after further difficulties with the info menu.  At no point in this little adventure did the game give you instructions.  All this took only 2 hours.\n\nMoving on.  Next objective: deliver said captain to freighter.  Get to freighter.  Again, no comms.  Ah, but I learned the magic ‘I’ command now.  Nope, nothing.  Ok, tried generic ‘F’.  Again, nothing.  It did let me ‘Auto-follow’ the freighter though, so decided to see how that worked for later because following ships is important in most escort missions.  Oh, bad bad mistake.  When you auto-follow, it takes away all your steering functions and speed controls.  And you know what happens when you follow a ship that is not going anywhere?  You sit there with no controls, no ability to accelerate, no comms, no ‘I’ of ‘F’ menus.  Nothing.  You sit there.  And you stare.  And you contemplate your meaningless existence playing this meaningless game.  And because you are in space, no one will ever hear you scream.  At this point, I’m struggling to keep calm.  Again, checked the setting > controls for help.  Surely they list the key command to disengage the auto-follow.  Surely.  Nope, FU player!  There is only two times in my life that I ever got so mad at a game that I literally snapped a keybroad in half and threw its parts across the room.  One, when my Lustitanni infantry wouldn’t take orders to adjust its position for a Roman flank attack in an epic 3-hour long battle I had in Rome: Europa Barbarorum (there is no saving in a battle sequence), and here when there was literally no way to disengage an auto-follow on a ship that was not going anywhere.  The first was a delight born out of a wonderful challenge in a great game, but this time was out of a sincere desire to hunt down developers to exterminate with extreme prejudice.\n\nAfter finding another keyboard and pulling the embedded half of the old one out of the sheet rock of my wall, I decided to reassess and continue.  Surely, I missed something.  Surely, no one would design a game so crappy that they would not document their user commands.  Loaded from another point and tried again.  Get to freighter, copilot says something about docking—well, no ♥♥♥♥ Sherlock.  Finally see the docking section of the freighter were ‘F’ works (not comms mind you, because that would make too much sense—see, I’m getting the hang of how these jerks think}.  Select dock, docking cut scene, now standing in my cargo hold.  The screen flashes a brief hint to tell your new captain to take command of the freighter by “[MAINMENU] 7-1”…  WTF does that mean?  I hit the ‘7’ key.  Nothing.  I try all commands I learned up til this point.  Nothing.  OK, I logically conclude that I have to find this magical [MAINMENU] that the hint speaks of.  Go to settings > controls.  Nowhere does it reference a main menu.  Oh, I have info on dialogue menus, I have flight and platform menus.  It will tell me how to walk and talk, how to take a ♥♥♥♥ in the station corner, but nothing about a [MAINMENU] or any other main menu at all.  Not a single reference.  By this time, I had wasted 7.1 hours of my life on this trash.  The game is just poorly designed.  I sincerely believe I spent more time writing this review of my experience than these crackhead excuses for developers spent in writing a reference guide for their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  So much potential, such waste.  And I do have the TO bundle with all current content until this point (Jan, 2016), because I know some people were like “it got better after TO DLC released.”  Well, if it was crappier than it is now, then may the video game gods have no mercy on the souls of Egosoft developers.  If I ran a software development company, I would thoroughly watch the credits to write down all the names of every professional who worked on this game and blacklist them from ever being hired in my company.  Yes, this game is seriously that bad.","January 3","false","7.1"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","58","25","43","13","3"

Don't get it now and check back in a couple of months.\n\nEDIT 11/4/2014:\n5 Months after release and the game is still a bug-ridden mess, just avoid this and get X3:AP instead.\n\nEdit 23/4/2014:\nPatch 1.30 hit and its improved joystick controls just barely make the game enjoyable but I did end up spending some time with it, so after ~20 hours of actually being able to somewhat experience the game I can finally write out some proper thoughts on the game.\n\nClunky, very clunky. There's no easy way to go about anything.\nWant to setup a trade information network? While in X3 you'd send a ship to automatically deploy satellites in every sector, in Rebirth you have to dock with every single station, walk around until you stumble into a NPC that you can "small talk" with, play a silly minigame and sit trough cringe worthy dialog and then hope that NPC can actually update trade offers.\n\nTrading itself is also an issue. Unlike X3 you can only order trade ships around via a special trading interface that lists all trade offers and allows you to queue up trades. The idea is nice but the execution is very lacking, the UI, again, is very clunky: slow, badly designed and lacks the hotkeys that even X3 had. Even if you get past the UI you'll find your ships stuck more often than not, requiring yet more painstaking minutes in the UI to cycle them in and out of your squad and re-assigning all trade orders.\n\nUnlike X3's simple 1 cargo bay + maximum ware size system Rebirth has gone with, err, a total mess. Trading ships can carry a single cargo type (bulk,container,liquid,energy), plus a separate fuel tank, plus a separate drone bay. That, again, doesn't sound to bad in theory but now consider you can't just directly transfer wares between ships, unlike in X3. Ships can only buy jump fuel for themselves, if a ship finds itself in a sector without a station that sells energy sells (I wouldn't even know how that station is called) its stuck. In my X3 save I had a ship parked around the center of the galaxy that I could quickly order to refuel any ship that couldn't jump any further, nothing like that is possible in Rebirth. If a ship runs out of drones you need to take it to a shipyard, go out of your ship, search for the ship dealer, hope you found the right one (there's no easy way to tell what classes a ship dealer trades in) and restock it via drones via a special menu option(again, doesn't participate in the economy). Ships can't just go and buy drones for themselves (only for trading).\n\nThe skunk is a story apart, there's a special "inventory" type for loot your collect from ships and scavenge from people's locker. These wares can only be sold to traders on stations and don't contribute to the economy or really add anything to the game. The skunk is also the only ship in the universe that can dock with stations and capital ships, fire missiles, strafe and is the only non-capital ship that can boost, carry people or launch half the selection of drones, it even gets its own special weapons that nobody else every seems to acquire.\nUpgrades to the skunk are also bought at special vendors that don't participate in the economy at all, and no AI will buy them.\n\nThe player really is a story apart from the rest of the universe, nobody else behaves like you do, nobody else gets the abilities you have, a shameful departure from the X style of doing things.\n\nShips and stations in Rebirth are no longer run by AI, instead they are crewed by people that you need to hire and transport around. Nice idea, bad execution. This basically adds a layer of complexity that isn't necessary and just isn't fun. I feel like I'm running a taxi service for an empire instead of managing it. X3 had all these ship upgrades that allowed you to over time delegate tasks to ships, Rebirth just plain doesn't. You'll always be the empire janitor/taxi instead of the manager you were in previous X games.\nFinding people to work your empire is again, very clunky. You can ask other ships directions to a specific person (again, trough a very clunky UI), but you still need to dock, walk around for a minute and hope the person you found actually wants to work for you.\n\nThe economy and general game balance is just broken.\nI spend 90% of my time fighting a slow economy with trade ships stuck half of the time and earned ~1mil. Then I invested 500k in boarding, boarded a ship and sold it for 10mil. I used that to upgrade my ship completely and get a great boarding crew. Boarded another ship, sold that and now I'm sitting on 30mil, bored, slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and writing this review.\n\nCombat is generally boring, there's only 5 weapons for the skunk, 3 capital ship weapons (surface elements) and 4 missiles. Plus you'll end up fighting the same type of drone 90% of the time. (Still more interesting than trade, sadly). Boarding has been made much more accessible, but the rewards are game-breaking high.\n\nA good bit: The atmosphere\nThe music and graphics are still quite the thing and are sadly the most enjoyable part of Rebirth as of right now. I'd have more fun calmly exploring the universe, listening to the amazing soundtrack and taking in the sights and not worry about the disaster of UI, ship control or being a taxi service.\n\nI'm no great writer but I really love the X series hope this review has helped other fans of the series make their mind up about this game.\n\nTL;DR:\nClunky, lonely, player is not part of the universe.\nTrade: You'll always be the empire janitor/taxi instead of the manager you were in previous X games.\nFight: 5 skunk weapons, 3 capital ship weapons, 4 missiles, same enemy 90% of the time\nBuild: Only in certain spots, limited in number, no self sustaining chains, little control.\nThink: see trade","November 19, 2013","false","25.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

During 4 hours of actual gameplay, you have to think that you have to add 2 hours of waiting because of the multiple bugs there are in the game!! You target spawn inside a station so you cant kill it, your capital ships wont go to a refueling station, you cant cancel trades and all the things that will make you enjoy waiting for hours. But when you think you finished waiting, another bug appears and you have to wait another hour!!!\n\nAlso, some feature of the game are hidden! And by hidden I mean core features that you dont know how to access! Even some of them are missing, for example, you cant cancel a trade! But why would you cancel a trade? Because of a bug that make your capital ship stand there, watch cartoons during 9000 years and when you ask him again, he look at you, and go back to his cartoons.\n\nSo if you want to buy this game, wait a year, that way youll be sure (or not!) there are no more bugs!

I would still wait for Star Citizen of you're looking for a really involved space sim experience buecause this isn't it, it may do to fill in time if the price drops below £10.

IF the bugs of station ships not working , traders not trading , It sure would be nice if there was a total overide command to wake the game or diagnose the conflict of what is wrong with the players game which said fix this or delete that or whatever without getting the error messages on startup saying cannot load game account stuff like galaxy communication not on because it was part of the problem and have to start all over in the game, or any other error message as a matter of fact on the menu selection.\nships not transferring wares between them and station bto builders not building got fixed along with the other bugs in the game got fixed when steam updates or modders update or egosoft updates . If everyone had some common ground to play the game the way they want to play it , that would be one heck of a game This game could really evolve into something far more that what it is. But everyone needs to work together with the creators of the game and steam and the modders. When a modder updates their mod and/or adds a newer version of the mod it kills the game for other players or at least the ones who do not know how to fix whats wrong, like me. I have come to the point of creating a decent empire only to have some bug mess up the whole game.

If this was released as "early access" it would be understandable, but they have essentially launched a game in beta (or even alpha) state and are hastily patching it. They spent a lot of time and effort on features that nobody wanted, walking around in stations, having a companion, talking to NPCs, etc. It feels like they played Mass Effect and tried to put what they saw into an X game, but failed miserably.\n\nBut remember that X3 was barely playable when it came out. Egosoft does have a history of launching broken games, but with great post-release support. There is already a good modding community that are working on fixing this broken game.

This is not the "X" game you are looking for...\n\nFirstly, let me stress that I am a massive fan of the previous "X" Games. When I saw "Rebirth" was due to be released I immediately found myself looking forward to getting lost in another massive, bustling galaxy with lots to see, do and buy. I always found the massive range of player useable ships meant I could always find something new to work toward purchasing and upgrading.\n\nNow, when I heard about Rebirth, and the ability to dock and walk around stations to trade, modernised graphics and a great new storyline campaign, I was ecstatic. I thought to myself "this is exactly the game I have been waiting for!".\n\nUnfortunately, when the game was first relased it received such appalling reviews that I did't even try it. I guessed (correctly I suppose) that if I waited a while then game-breaking bugs would be fixed, and the price would fall. So, with the release of the latest update, "Rebirth 2.0" which claims to have recitified the majority of faults and overhauled the gameplay based on player feedback (combined with the Steam promotion which was running at the time) I thought Rebirth might be worth a look. I was wrong...\n\nVisuals: Yes, it is pretty. Well... at least in space. Graphically this is a nice step up from the latest generation of X games, and is more or less what I had been expecting. However if you dock at a station, don't expect anything resembling realistic characters. Character models on the whole are grotesque, with extremely outdated visuals and horrible, frozen expressions. Stations themselves once you reach the interior, are simply cookie cutter copies of each other with very little variation at all. See one station, you've seen them all. At one stage of the storyline, an NPC aboard your ship exclaims "Wow, I've never seen a station like that before" (or words to that effect.) But as I clambered out of my ship, oh look it's the same docking bay/corridors/rooms as the previous 10. They're empty, lifeless, bland and generally uninteresting addtions to the game that in my opinion would have been better off ignored.\n\nGameplay: Well... Bland. That seems to be the most commonly recurring word I think of when trying to accurately describe the majority of the game in fact. At first, flying around in your ship is reasonable fun as you take in the view and fly through the highways. But it gets old, fast.\n\nFirstly, the small to medium sized vessel you begin the game with is the only thing you will be flying. The "Albion Skunk" is yours for the duration. Sure, you can fit it with new weapons and engines as you'd expect, but you cannot purchase or fly other ships, even though you may own them and hire crew to fly them for you. And as flexible as this ship is, I can't help but long for the days of being able to pilot just about any ship I could find. I didn't get any sense of achievement or reward being stuck with the same, rather bland (there's that word again) ship throughout.\n\nSecondly, the campaign itself. I admit, I completely abandoned this after around 4 hours. I kept thinking something wonderful would be just around the corner, however I spent the entire time flying through numerous sectors in which there was nothing to see, to numerous stations in which there was nothing to do. Once there, I would talk to one of the numerous copy/paste NPCs who would then send me to do the same at another station. There is no longer any form of time dilation to speed up travel, you're stuck staring at space.\n\nOn the whole, I think the biggest issue with this iteration is simply that there is nothing to DO... You spend your time floating meaninglessly through space filled with meaningless empty characters with no purpose. The large majority (and I'm really not exaggerating here) of NPC's will simply fly in circles without any concern for the world around them.\n\nI really, really wanted to like this game. And I tried, I really did. Unfortunately, it just wasn't to be. I am sorely disappointed, even after going in with low expectations following other poor reviews. Take my advice, and spend your money elsewhere.","May 23, 2014","false","11.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"

It's not perfect – there are still many graphical issues, performance bottlenecks, and annoying restrictions that keep the game from being great, but it is worth 15 or 20 dollars if you find it on sale for that price.\n\nFor fans of X3 and the series, it is worth coming back to and trying again.  I waited until 3.0 to get back into the game since its disappointing release.  It wasn't unexpected that release day would be problematic: There was plenty of evidence that this happened to prior games in the series and that Egosoft added many features post-release that should have been available on release day.  Still, despite how bad the game was when it came out, Egosoft has written the wrongs right.  I never had any doubt that they would get to 3.0.  But for those who are still bitter about the release: Their anger is justified, however, outdated.  X Rebirth has had a second rebirth.\n\nWhy does this game now deserve your time?  It is probably the easiest X game in the series to get started with.  Unlike the other X games, the story/tutorial does explain most of what you need to know in the game(although the campaign gets frustrating at times).  Egosoft recently posted videos explaining advanced features that I would have never been able to figure out on my own.  The missions are also more friendly, giving you the ability to make money early without drudging through 50 hours of poverty trading energy cells.  The combat isn't the best part; and I find that exploration is lacking a bit as well.  So if those two features drew you to this game, get X3TC or AP instead.  This game highlights station building with an emphasis on building an empire as well as trading and building a fleet.  Station building is the only feature I can definitively say I like more than X3.  It is my personal favorite part of the X series, and it may be the reason I end up playing X Rebirth more than the 1000 hours I put into X3.\n\nIf you are new to the X series, you may want to move on to X3 TC and AP if you're looking for more fun and more challenge after X Rebirth.  AP is also easier than TC, so that game may be a preferable next step.  I would recommend playing all these games with a joystick though.  I use a yoke myself, and I find that much more immersive.  You may also want to run the soundtrack for X Rebirth in the background -- it is absolutely awesome but half of the music doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the whole game.\n\nIn the end, this game isn't worth 40 dollars.  It probably isn't even worth 30 unless you've already paid 300 bucks for a ship in Star Citizen.  I'd say buy it if it's under 25 if you're a space genre fan or empire builder.  This is just my opinion of course; I preordered the collector's edition.  I have no regrets though.  It was worth it for me.\n\nNote: The Teladi Outpost DLC is a small addition of content, probably worth 3 to 5 dollars.  It's nice to explore and build in a new region of space.\n\nMy opinion and final thoughts: This huge game was made by a small developer, which inevitably means it's very rough around the edges. It's my opinion that most people who gave this game negative reviews think that it had a development team as large as Skyrim with a massive budget. I read many times about how X Rebirth (the game) was compared against Star Citizen (the idea), and somehow Star Citizen won almost every time. I find that line of thinking to be completely irrational. And I'm hard-pressed to find a game on steam that received lower ratings than X Rebirth (27% in 2014), even amongst games that were abandoned by their developers. X Rebirth seems to be the game that appeared at the wrong place and the wrong time.","December 13, 2014","true","596.0"," 44 of 80 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","44","80","2","0"

Very difficult to get around in X Rebirth because of this. I only hope Egosoft would consider redoing the ingame commands in a future patch to simplify them and be more inline with X3TC.  From what I can see 3 hours in you can't even dock like you can in TC.  And if that's not possible, how you can you ever tour the stations?

Looks like I've about a hundred hours in, and I've barely begin to scratch the surface - but I've been having a heckuva lot of fun playing.  This is a deep, rich, immersive game.  I start it up and the hours happily fly by.\n\nI'm gonna keep this short because given the choice I'd prefer to be actually playing the game.  I've only ever bothered to write one Steam review before, but I wanted to toss in my two cents on this game.  I don't know if you'll like it (evidently a good proportion of folks are still determined not to like it) - but I do know this game has given me what I've been searching for a long time.\n\nI've been trying a bunch of space / sci-fi games - many of them great games - but to greater or lesser degrees I always felt something missing.  I finally figured out what it was.  It was what I loved most about good sci-fi: the sense of Wonder.  Well I've found it here in this game.\n\nThis is a richly imagined space game, with a bit of a high fantasy edge - places feel different and alive and beautiful.  I've apparently spent a hundred hours just flying around, exploring, admiring.  I've done some missions, I've done some fighting, I've made some credits, I've made some friends and some enemies - but mostly I've just been smiling a whole lot.\n\nI've only seen the tip of the iceberg.  I haven't yet assembled a fleet, or even bought my first Capital ship; I haven't yet built an empire, any stations, or even my first trader; I haven't yet captured my first ship, or even fully pimped out my own.  I have yet to dip into the Teladi DLC, and have already pre-purchased the upcoming HoL DLC.  I see many many many more happy hours ahead.  I think I've finally found my Space Skyrim.\n\nIt must be disheartening for the Devs to see so much obstinate negativity; they had a vision and they've been working hard to keep polishing it (I'm on the 4.0 beta).  For my own part a big thank you to them, and their next X game will be an instant buy for me.\n\nAnyhoo.  If the first hundred or so hours are anything to go by, this game is right among my few all time faves - don't know if you'd like it, but then I don't know if you like ice cream either.

As a veteran of all of the previous X: Games, I can say that X: Rebirth is finally worth purchasing (as long as you buy the full version with all dlcs)  I would also recommend installing the capital ship bridge mod to round out the X feel.  It's not as complex as the previous X Games but I'm having a lot of fun and it's fairly immersive.

It changed the whole concept of what the X gameplay was like of late. The only controlling 1 ship throughout the game, while not my favorite, is a different direction. I just don't like how weak that said ship is. One ship to rule them all, and it happens to be some prototype ship.  That would be cool if it was a new prototype ship, that was also extremely advanced with many, MANY possible upgrades. It feels so static to me, which is unfortunate.\n\nThis game is extremely big in scope, and you can do so much, especially if you consider the mods available. I does take a lot of playing to learn everything, and I would say in this sense, it is harder to learn than your average game. I would still say if you enjoy space sim games, that give you the fighting, trading and questing options, this game is a lot of fun.","December 19, 2015","true","60.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Yesterday I spent hours on missions, getting loot for Sinza, Jumpdrive, trying out weapon mods, exploring the universe - it was dang fun. It was almost like in good old TC times, when I played 6 - 10 hours straight on weekends ... just one more sector, just one more mission, just one more Paranid scum that has to die.\n\nAfter this 4.0 gaming session I instantly bought the DLC. However, still missing the ultimate micro-management space empire, fleet management feeling of TC and the possibility to fly other ships.\n\nGood Job, Egosoft!\n\n4.0 Beta 6 (have not played since 2.0)\nPros Visuals & Effects\nMusic & Sound Effects\nMission System\nGreat Community Mods\nChallenging Boarding/Piracy System\nBetter User Interface\nDiscovered no game breaking bugs so far\nSETA/Jumpdrive/Crafting\nIncreased Performance\nCons Only one ship to fly\nHighways\nMinigames\nYisha/Audio Comments\n\nPros\nVisuals & Effects\nFly into an ice asteroid field, peacefully scan for loot and suddenly a huge asteroid blows up in an cinematic like explosion close to your ship - jeez. Jump into a sector, get a coffee, get back and watch Xenon destroyers jump in and starting a bombastic fight with battleships of local authorities - boom baby. New Shaders, SSAO and the usage of Reshade Framwork makes X-Rebirth to one of the best looking space games available.\n\nMusic & Sound Effects\nAlexei Zakharov ... all I have to say about the music. Sound effects: immersive and great\n\nMission System\nLots of missions to go for, accessible via bulletin board system.\n\nGreat Community Mods\nLots of mods that make life easier in X-Rebirth universe. Capital Brigde Mod by Litauen ... just to mention one of the great mods available.\n\nChallenging Boarding/Piracy System\nSend your marines and the ship is yours - forget about it. You have to think twice before you start a capital ship boarding operation. Bring the best marines - which you trained by capturing ships with less resistance -, take out or hack subsystems to lower the targets boarding resistance, have a great feeling when the challenging job is done.\n\nBetter User Interface\nThe sidebar was huge step forward, also it's a lot easier to get into the UI, command your ships or employees.\n\nGame breaking bugs\nWell, I only have around 18 hours in 4.0 Beta 6: discovered no game breaking bugs so far.\n\nSETA/Jumpdrive/Crafting\nThe Jumpdrive Quest was sort of responsible that I got hooked in the first place. I played kill mission after kill mission to get the components, kicked Xenon butts in Maelstrom - still missing one of them. Then I discovered the crafting/weapon mod system that just led to more kill missions. My skunk got well armed with modded weapons after a while, also it's supported by a fighter wing - this is where the real fun kicks in.\n\nIncreased Performance\nOverall the game runs much smoother on my mid-range system (i5-2500K, AMD R9-270). I found out that some things (like the fish tanks in stations) drastically drop the framerate in full window mode. With borderless window the framerate drops do not happen. I can now tweak X-Rebirth with Reshade options that led to a slideshow in previous versions, so I can tell for sure that the performance increased drastically.\n\n\nCons\nOnly one ship to fly\nOne thing I really dislike. I do not want to fully control the huge ships, but more Skunk class ships with different attributes and weapons would definitely be good. Also a gamestart as poor fighter pilot, small vessel trader who is working it's way up to the bigger ships would be kind of motivating.\n\nHighways\nThe sector highways are annoying and should be replaced by a different system. Coordinates to sector locations should be found out by either exploring, doing quests or asking other ships for coordinates.\n\nMinigames\nNo minigames, no talk about AI fuss please. Add quests to convince the NPC instead or let us dance naked if the NPC wants us to. Minigames suck, should be banned in the X-Universe.\n\nYisha/Weird Audio Comments\nCan be turned off thanks to mods!","February 1","true","148.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

While most game developers would aim to build on existing positives, X Rebirth's devs have taken everything GOOD about the original games, and thrown them completely out of the window in order to squeeze in some "pretty new graphics", which in all honesty, aren't that impressive to begin with and seem more of a throwback to mid 2000's graphics engines. The removal of third person views, multiple ship control, gate travel (a new "taxi tube" system has been developed to shuttle your ship from system to system, which is absolutely TERRIBLE) and many "new features" are actually fancy detractions from what made the original X series so great. The addition of being able to walk around in stations sounded great at first, but is extremely limited in it's function and serves no great logical purpose to the game that couldn't be solved easier with menus and communications channels, except to make the game boringly and frustratingly mundane each time you are forced to wander around stations upon docking. Trade is just about non-functional, often causing game-breaking errors and lockups, and combat although beautiful to watch is just as broken. I am sorry to say that I was duped into pre-ordering this game with the promise of great things...

I wished I had not, upon leaving the ship I was met by a man with boobs... actually it turned out this was a woman when I showed the screeny to all my friends but none the less it amused me so... I carried on walking and found a Robot that sort of looked like a cross between a Dyson Vacuum Cleaner and WALLE but my eye was caught on something better, Advertisments for the strippers... a lot of raw skin so I hurried my way to the main bar where I was met by not NPC's not even CCC's just badly modelled mannequins with nothing more thna insults to throw at me when spoken to.\n\nI met a man on the station selling illegal high grade missiles so I spent all my starting cash on them and returned to my ship where I saved my game... now I only play this when I want to mess about shooting at random objects.

There's a whole storyline that you can play to get familiar with all the controls and options, then can keep playing or start a new game as a trader, fighter, etc, with good starting capital.

I thought I might start with an anecdote.\n\nTasked with building a space station in an ally's territory, I only needed about 60 fusion reactors to complete it. I searched every sector for it, but nobody was selling. I soon found out why: these were only being produced at 3 stations and my enemy, the Plutarch Corporation, owned one of those and was buying every reactor that came off the production lines at the others. So what's a poor rebel to do?\n\nRaid their shipments, obviously.\n\nI waited several kilometers away from one of the factories with my cargo freighter standing by. After seeing a Plutarch ship dock and then pull away, I scanned its cargo, revealing that it was carrying my coveted fusion reactors, I made my move.\n\nI used my dumbfire rockets to quickly disable its engines and warp drive, then went to work on the main hull. This was a long process but I found a safe spot just behind the engines where I could go to recharge my shields. Woe to the unwary freighter that travels without fighter escort.\n\nThe freighter destroyed, I tagged the cargo for my own cargo ship to pick up. As a swarm of drones buzzed toward the remains, I spotted a Plutarch destroyer in the distance. Several seconds later it was apparent that it was headed straight for me, most likely in response to my little Space Pirate schtick. I had no means to fight a destroyer, but I did tangle with the wing of fighters it sent ahead of itself in order to protect my cargo drones. As the last drone made it safely into the cargo bay, the destroyer began to open up on my freighter. It's a hardy vessel but it wouldn't last long under that hailstorm of fire. I ordered the captain of the freighter to get us out of there, then swung my craft around to the front, briefly exposing myself to the destroyer's fire to dock. I watched from the deck as lasers streaked across the sky and missiles exploded against the hull, hearing the faint sound of the frieghter's jump drive charging up. Moments later, explosions were replaced by silence. The jump had taken me and my freighter hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, with our precious reactors safely aboard (and with no load screen in between).\n\nI chose this little anecdote because it perfectly encapsulates X: Rebirth's interacting systems of trade, construction, and combat. But I neglected to mention a few details.\n\nDuring this whole scenario, I encountered a massive drop in framerate that persisted until I left the zone and returned. The game crashed inexplicably some time after I transferred my wares. I originally tried boarding the freighter, but found that while 8 marines was plenty to take a destroyer in an earlier story mission, a full complement of 50 marines was totally incapable later on of capturing even a much smaller freighter than my target. The station repeatedly reminded me that my rash behavior "isn't tolerated in these parts," but apparently forgot to attach a consequence to their threats. Even now I can trade with that station as with any other. And the whole excursion was made necessary because my previous shipment of some 114 fusion reactors inexplicably disappeared from the freighter's cargo holds--the freighter made it, the goods didn't. It still had the order to transfer the wares to my construction ship in its queue. Upon deleting and reissuing the order, a message told me that it had no fusion reactors in its holds. Gone into thin air.\n\nMy point is this: At its best, X: Rebirth is the most full-featured, exciting, strategic space sim available that I know of. Though dogfights are a little awkward because the smaller spacecraft are so maneuverable, combat overall is exceptionally exciting. The game has made me think in terms of real logic (how can I acquire this good by any means available) as opposed to game logic (how can I exploit this system to get 1000x as much as I'll ever need). It appears, so far as I can tell, that the entire game is driven by a real economy: goods cannot be used until they're produced, and producing these goods means someone has to mine them, extract them, refine them, and manufacture them. This creates a living world unlike any I've ever seen before, and when I close my trade console and nudge my throttle forward (I use a Saitek X52 joystick) towards the next station, or merge into a highway and switch on the auto-pilot while I give orders to my fleet, I really feel like I am there, interacting with a real world in space. Seeing a station suddenly pop into view as I exit the space highway, or docking on one of my larger vessels while it jumps me across space (with no loading screens!) are experiences that just never get old.\n\nAt its worst, X: Rebirth continues to sport more bugs and headaches than are really excusable, especially with it being the fourth iteration in the series. You will encounter glitches. Your framerate will inexplicably drop to a crawl (only happened to me twice in 24 hours play though). You will experience crashes (save often). The story dialogue is fair, but most of the other conversations and text might have actually been written by a third grader (hearing a Marine Officer randomly chirp, valley-girl style, "Eww, slimy green lizardy things are everywhere!" is just bizarre, and some of the logbook entries are so poorly written as to be indecipherable). The game does not explain itself very thoroughly, and you will spend much time trying to figure out how many of its systems work (or don't work, as is occasionally the case).\n\nI had great anticipation for this game's release, so I was very disappointed when I read that it was basically an unfinished product. The free weekend just recently spoke a great deal about the developer's confidence in the current state of their product, and I believe that confidence is justified. This is now a very playable, fully-featured game, and if you are patient and have a good tolerance for the occasional bug, it can give you some of the most fantastic gaming experiences you've had in years.","March 16, 2015","true","199.8"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","20","35","2","0"

Playing on ubuntu on an under spec machine but it still plays decent with not one crash in 10 hours or so. So far I'd give it a 6/10 for gameplay. Very steep learning curve but that's one of the things I'm enjoying is learning how to get things done. Universe feels generic, ie finding a lost colony that's been isolated for hundreds of years, but they have the same clothes, same dang space station interior and space highways. The space station premise is poorly executed and feels like a waste of time but it looks like some functions can be managed over radio at least. I don't like the limitation of one ship, that was part of the cool factor of x3, but it's not a deal breaker.\n\nI am going to keep playing, partially out of stubbornness to look past the faults and partially out of enjoying what does play well.","March 21","true","6.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It has many features missing, many game breaking bugs, and many systems in place that do nothing but try and ruin the game for you.\n\nThey force you to go through stations in order to get crew for your ship, and upgrade. The stations are mostly cut and paste between less than 5 models, and are meant for you to go blindly through and rob it blind. Character models look like something from the 90's, and there is no variation in communication.\n\nIn space, nobody can hear you scream as your trade ships lock up. Your combat ships might as well be ornaments since you can't tell them to attack, and unless it's a capital ship, it's dead before it can attack back. As of writing this, you can't buy small ships to outfit your fleet or small trade ships to embark on cheap trading.\n\nIf you get far enough from station, you can no longer access trades that were previously there. Stations are not able to be freely placed, and if you don't pay careful attention, they don't function.\n\nThe save files are uncompressed XML files, meaning if you have access to notepad, you can cheat your way to achievments by editing them to your hearts content. The install is laden with files that are meant to be used on XBox. Regular controls for computer such as the keyboard/mouse/joystick don't function as well as a computer game should run. XBox controller has full support though.\n\nThis is an alpha port, the developers are patching every day or two to fix issues. When it finally fixes enough issues to be a full release, I'll ammend this.","November 25, 2013","false","34.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Whether or not it was intentional, I think you know that what you have released was not as advertised.\n\nI am an avid PC gamer, and have been playing PC games since they began. I'm also an avid space sim gamer, and have enjoyed all manner of space games from back in the first Elite days. I enjoyed your previous games. But my disappointment in Rebirth is, well, palpable. Based on many posts in many forums, while my exact feelings may not be shared by all who have purchased X Rebirth, you know I am not alone in my dissatisfaction.\n\nI know you are a very small company, and given the posts I've seen, you seem to be working hard to scramble together fixes for game crashing bugs, mission breaking glitches, and issues that leave the player immoble. My immediate reaction is - any amount of playtesting would surely have shown some of these very basic game breaking issues - why didn't you take care of these gigantic issues *before release*? I understand that no software is released without bugs, but come now - surely you see this as excessive (perhaps even for a beta, much less a release)?\n\nBeyond the game breaking issues, there are so many changes that would be necessary to make this a game that doesn't seem to be some sort of weird retro alpha project stuck in the mid-90s, that I don't feel right about paying you with my hard earned money to attempt a belated fix for something that, frankly, may simply need to be scrapped and redone to even approach a mediocre product.  And the way this game was advertised vs the actual in-game exprience is approaching fraudulent. It seems like a joke.  Just not a funny one.\n\n7 years? You worked on this for 7 years? I honestly don't buy that. Even a single developer working on a project for *7 years* could produce a much better designed product with much fewer crashes than this. You had a good base from which to start. What did you do for 7 years that this was the end result? I'm sorry Egosoft, but I want my money back. And I likely won't get a refund. Congrats for taking one more sucker for his $50, but "fool me once..." It will never happen again.","November 25, 2013","false","2.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ranged/recommended/2870/","ranged","Ranged","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ranged/","260 products in account","X: Rebirth looks to be an immersive game, but ultimately the gameplay is neither fun nor even engrossing.\nAs a massive fan of space games and someone who loved X3:TC and X3:AP (51 hrs and 59 hrs), I was eagerly anticipating the X: Rebirth launch as a chance to reengage in the space genre, but this time as a freelancer pilot in an exciting universe.  Unfortunately, X: Rebirth is not that game.\n\nUltimately, the game may be fun at some point, but there are far too many constant gameplay aspects that try to be immersive and accessible at the expense of true immersion and fun.  It feels as though the game was not properly play-tested by players, and the experience suffers.  That being said, I’m sure examples would help.  This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some highlights.\n\n1.	In order to trade larger trade goods, you must fly and find trading points to setup the order.  While that means you need to travel, this doesn’t make sense in context of being “in the future.”  How is there not a global listing for known trade hubs/markets/etc?  I understand wanting people to fly to these locations to make them more real, but ultimately this feels forced and unrealistic.\n\n2.	In order to trade smaller goods, you must dock at a station point and then run inside the station to get to individual traders.  This is not realistic nor immersive. I have drones, warp-speed and ‘advanced’ computer systems, but I can’t make transactions via my ship?  It’s like the trade system was designed for a medieval RPG.\n\n3.	Exploration consists of sending out a radar-like beacon and flying to hits.  I really liked this initially, but unfortunately it’s mostly just random items in cans and I have no way to distinguish junk from large ships or hidden nuggets (if they exist).  Once I retrieve these goods, I have to walk in a station to trade said good.  This doesn’t make me feel immersed, this makes me feel like I’m playing a poorly designed game.\n\n4.	I’m only able to fly in my one cockpit view.  It’s neat how I move to my seat and can move around the ship, but the display is far too obstructive.  ~30% of the viewing space is taken up by cockpit walls/dashboard.  It is incredibly restrictive, and ultimately doesn’t make sense.  When I’m in a car, the top of the windshield isn’t 15% of my field of view so why would a spacecraft be the same way.\n\n5.	GUI and map interface are atrocious.  Yes, the game was designed for console players, but unfortunately things are just archaic feeling.  Why can’t I zoom in/out of the map?  If I can, why isn’t there a button on the map to press?  Why do I need to use a Mass Effect style convo bar to access menu items that could easily be accessed by a sidebar or escape menu?\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, but it’s not really a game and more of a chore.  If you enjoyed the world immersion of X3:TC or X3:AP, look somewhere else.  Maybe EVE Online for the truly immersive world.  Forcing someone to walk around like a character in a medieval RPG is not actual immersion, it’s only a narrow-minded developer opinion of true immersion.\n","November 25, 2013","false","16.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

It's so incredibly bad, that I got the distinct feeling of being swindled. Like, old-timey swindled, by a man wearing a stolen coat, selling a bottle of cure-all on the corner of two dirt roads, with a pet monkey napping on the hood of his dusty car.\n\nI'm serious. It's so bad, that they had to know it was bad. They knew it was bad, and put it up for pre-order and release, knowing they'd rake in a rather large sum of money before the game was playable.\n\nHow is it bad - there is no single way in which it is good. The voice acting is worse than the most pathetic attempt at game-making by students. Junior High School students. The graphics look as though they were brought here from 2004. The storyline is all but non-existent. The writing is about on-par with that of a 3rd grader. The character design is something you'd see in the back of a homework folder on that weird kid's desk in High School - you know, the one who thinks he's an artist, but can't draw. The ship, there's only one by the way, is all of 3 rooms, only two which can you walk in, and there is zero interactability within those rooms.\n\nThe pilot interface is awful. The entire game interface is awful. It's very clearly made as a console port, except they never said a word about consoles and released to PC first. The game is riddled with so many crippling bugs, that it's literally unplayable. After only 20 minutes, I was forced to restart, because a game-breaking bug halted any progress that could made.\n\nThe music, for which they attempted to sell pre-release soundtracks, is mediocre at best, and only by a 2004 standard. The interior of space stations is the same, in every station. The NPC speech is apalling, they say hello, then immediatley say something rude to you, and cut off speech. There basically isn't any reason to speak to any of them. In fact, there isn't any reason to *do* anything at all. They touted the game to be so many things, but in the end, it isn't even playable.\n\nDo not waste your money on this game.","November 25, 2013","false","1.6"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

You better watch your step when going back to your ship.\n\nI do not wish to have these bugs influence the score too much because Egosoft used to fix such bugs in previous titles.\n\n\n\n2 - Gameplay\n\n2.1 Learning Curve:\n\n3/10\n\nThe game is once again extremely hard to learn how to play.\n\nI take the risk and dare to say it is far harder to understand the game than in previous titles.\n\nWhile previous titles like "X3 Albion Prelude" had icons and colourful effects at every space station and ship telling you "Hey here's a quest!" or "I'm taking damage!" X Rebirth doesn't have that.\n\nThey wanted to make the gaming experience more intuitive but they did that on the cost of obviousness.\n\nAs a new player and even as an experienced player of every single previous title you have absolutely no idea what to do or how to actually do it.\n\nThis comes along with a problem with the UI: it doesn't scale with the resolution!\nAt a for today very normal resolution of 1920:1080 your UI becomes so tiny that it's absolutely not the player's fault if they miss something.\n\nThe tutorial uses the same lines as the subtitles.\n\nEventhough there is no text overlapping it is still a very bad idea, especially because you constantly get tutorial messages for just piloting the ship during the normal gameplay.\n\n\n\n2.2 - Human Gameplay\n\n1/10\n\nDuring the gameplay it is necessary to stand up from your seat and walk through your tiny ship or some tiny levels that resemble the interriors of a space station.\n\nI don't even want to pick on the fact that you don't seem to have a body yourself, what's far worse is that you run through the stations with far too high speed.\n\nYou can barely interact with your environment and the interactions that are actually there feel very clumsy and poorly designed.\n\nIt is clear that the development team or the game engine itself is not capable of implementing an organic gameplay within a space game.\n\nTogether with 3.1, 4.1 and 4.2 the human gameplay is rather a huge bother than an enjoyable side experience.\n\nThe human gameplay is a requirement to play the game properly and overall I'd say it has the level of the worst games that infect the market with their low-quality rip-off poison, I've seen super-low budget games that did a better job, I'm sorry to say.\n\n\n\n2.3 - Ship Gameplay\n\n5/10\n\nI'm pretty nice here because I see the little details they added to the franchise over time.\n\nYour ship doesn't just "turn" if you move your mouse, it drifts into the previous direction, till your accelleration overcomes the former vector.\n\nYou can see your actual speed in real time, there is no restriction when it comes to flying around.\n\nI do see the relative speed they added to the game, so you don't get crushed by a carrier, while you're flying inside its docking area or anything.\n\nI do see that they really did put some effort into it.\n\nBut the ship gameplay is not just the 360° controls, it's also the interaction with your environment and that's where the score dies.\n\nTo interact with a station you have to fly really close to its hovering icon.\n\nOften you find yourself clicking and clicking and just not getting that stupid icon to highlight.\n\nIf you concentrate too much on keeping the icon in the center of your crosshair you will find yourself crashing into the station with mach1 or faster (that doesn't sound healthy).\n\nSince they removed the targeting system you're usually left having absolutely no idea where your ships are.\n\nAt the beginning of the story mode you get a large trading ship, but I couldn't find it!\n\nI had no idea how to get to it.\n\nIt was on my sector map, but I could only get a rough idea of where it must be, I couldn't highlight it.\n\nWhen I finally found it I had to go to the front of the ship to be able to access the docking menu.\n\nBeing 10m away from a big moving obstacle and moving to it with the speed of sound is a BAD COMBINATION.\n\nAside from that I did notice that the ships you meet in the highway are just there for the minigame.\n\nIf you leave the highway through its gate none of those ships come out, and there are a lot of ships in there.\n\nPrevious titles told you when an enemy gets into or out of your weapon's reach, now you have no idea when to shoot.\n\nThe distances are less detailed now, you only get kilometer displays.\n\n\n\n2.4 - Menus and Control Panels\n\n2/10\n\nI wished there was anything enjoyable but not even the main menu feels good.\n\nYou have to switch to arrow keys + enter/esc to use the menu properly.\n\nMouse input doesn't work very well since you often don't know if the game actually took the double click or not.\n\nThere are a lot of issues with things like the trading menu.\n\nWhile I already transferred the bugs to the stability rating, the menu also feels unintuitive.\n\nI had no idea who trades with whom and in which direction the wares are going.\n\nThe few menus and control panels that are present are a bother to use!\n\nAnd it's not just what's there: It's also what's not there.\n\nI have the strong feeling that the game would have been better off with far more control panels than that.\n\nThe "intuitive gameplay" is a huge failure and without a proper control interface with a high grade of obviousity you cannot play the game properly.\n\n\n\n3 - Graphics\n\n3.1 - Human Character Models\n\n1/10\n\nDuring the gameplay you will soon notice the incredibly ugly character models.\n\nMost humans you meet look so old, you'll be afraid they drop dead any second.\n\nAside from the age they look like their parents were very sad fishes.\n\nhttp://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/469793673227446070/40D404604FC504953A6296C198E7CC544F400BA5/\n\n\n\n3.2 - Human Animations\n\n1/10\n\nThe models are also barely animated.\n\nNo mocap studio was used for those animations, and you will definately see that.\n\nThe animations are extremely rudimentary.\n\nIt is very obvious that someone doesn't know how to rig clothing to a mesh, so you'll often see hats and glasses move differently than the bodypart they are attached to.\n\nAlso often animations don't fit together and lead to weird dislocations.\n\n\n\n3.3 - Ship and Station Models\n\n6/10\n\nI'm sorry to give this such a low rating, because most ships look very beautiful, especially the larger ones.\n\nSame goes to the majority of the station models.\n\nWhat's a bother though is that not all of the models look good.\n\nActually some of the models have an incredibly low polygon count for the fact that during the normal gameplay you have to stare at them closeup.\n\nAside from that many parts of the space stations are made of alpha-textures instead of 3D models.\n\nYou often get to see really ugly flat pictures instead of beautiful 3D models, and they will ♥♥♥♥ your eyes until you hate the game.\n\n\n\n3.4 - Textures and Effects\n\n4/10\n\nSome textures look pretty nice and the effect quality is very high.\n\nYou're often stunned by the beauty of the environment ...\n\nBut the rest of the textures real","January 29, 2014","false","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I had high expectations, because I LOVE the X series. I own every X game that exists (and about 5 or so other space sim games).\n\nLet me just say WOW, now that the game is working and running amazingly smoothly, 1 crash in over 20+ hours of gameplay, that may not even have been atrributed to thier game engine. The frame rate is awsome on my GTX 770 maxed everything.\n\nTHE GOOD\n--------------------\nGRAPHICS:\nThe grahics are next-gen for a space combat game, they are amazing and fun to watch every, single time.\n\nSPACE COMBAT:space combat is fun and the AI is better than most space sim games out there. It can get repetitive after a while doing nothing\nbut combat for hours on end but you can just go do something else, build some stations, conquer sectors commanding your capital ships and just watching the battle\nfrom a commanders perspective. You can start a trading empire, or become a pirate and depoy remote detonation bombs on ships... it goes on and on.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\nAs a Uninty game engine developer, I'm pretty amazing at what you have achieved with scale in this game. At first I couldnt tell if some of those large scale objects (Planets,Shatterd Moons) in the background were part of the skybox. I am very impressed with how you scaled the game and made it look so good. Though I suspect some kind of trickery at work with your Shaders! You should let me borrow some ;)\n\nGAME PLAY:\nYou can board ships and take them over. nothing new here BUT, the pods come out of your ship and attract to the target like an action scene in a sci space film. So far it has been fun to watch every single time. Im addicted to capturing enemy space ships at this point just to watch the pods fly out. (they could add some drilling and molten metal types of animations and particle effects to make them appear to drill into the surface).\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n-The sound effects can get a little old, if we can add more varition of sound effects and voice overs for the expansion, that would make this game more imersive and truly make it the greatest space sim ever made. Also, they need to write a script to limit how often a voice over is played from a single character controller, since you tend to click on them repeadedly when shopping for better crew members or ammo for your ship. You hear the same person repeating themselves 2-3-4 times... its annoying!\n-`They should add the voice over limitor function to the ship as well to keep it from reapting based up what the condition was that produced the previous voice over sound effect.\n-I had to look stuff up on google alot to find keys because there are SO MANY controls, there are controls for your controls! The control edit needs a form input search element to search through available controls quickly! This will be extremely usefull and save alot of time for beginners! Most people will be customizing thier controls. I am using keyboard and mouse and hated the default layout. I went from bad to pro once I changed all of the key controls and practiced for a while.\n-If you run in between two colliders it will bounce your around until you clip through into the interior of a station or a ship. It has happen to me many times and had to retart because your cant clip out from the interior. You need to control the unrendered side of your verticies and add a program\nto remove the physics colliders from the non-rendered side.\n-Your "bounce" physics on colliders needs to be toned down, so that clipping is less likely.\n- Also sometimes ships in your fleet clip through objects and get stuck, then I believe your fleet will bug out if that ship is within its group. Your fleet wont travel through gates if a group member is stuck. Mabey I'm wrong but,\nI had a ship clipped in a station and my fleet would not travel through a jump gate within any time frame. It seems the bugs I have encountered are more or less related to kinks that need to\nbe worked on in your physics engine. You guys are awsome though for what you have made with such a small team.\n\nI'm sorry that I was so mad, I did not realize the scope and the work that is needed to make a game like this until I actually became a game developer myself and learned c#. You guys should of just\ndelayed the game another year and avoided that mess and you would have made ALOT more money. Does'nt your CEO get that? Seriosly, that crap launch you pulled hurt your sales!\n\nIf you like space sim, BUY this game. It does have a learning curve, but it is well worth it to experince the fleet combat and amazing visuals and to realize that when this is improved slightly, it will\nbe amoung the top space sim games ever made if not the best single player space sim every made.\n","June 3","true","121.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The breathing taking views of space, planetary bodies, and ships are still there, but they added trivial mini games like the space hightways, ugly NPCs and horrible interior areas that make the game tedious and not worth playing. Spend your money elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE (9-12-14): Ego has released the 2.5 BETA 7 patch as an opt in. I've noticed that the patch has improved stability, the menu system, and I can talk to vendors and other NPCs without boarding. Patch details show that its supposed to fix a bunch of other stuff too, but I haven't gotten to those yet.

Playing it you feel that there is great potential in this product.\n\nThat being said, this is not so much a game as an open beta of one. The entire game shows lack of polish and lots of bugs. This game has poorly optimized graphics, leading to constant lag. A lot of features are simply missing or have basic placeholders. There is poor ai, and very poorly designed station missions.\n\nFinaly this game has a clunky and poorly desighned management interface: everytime you give an order you end comunication. To give a ship an order often requres multiple comunication attempts to first cancel their order, then give them a new one. Since dialogue can not be skiped this takes minutes as you hear the same scripted message over and over.\n\nThe poor desighn choices don't end there: as when the ming ship or a trade ship finishes there missions, they will imediatly go to your location regardless of what you are doing or where you are.

Stations can have multiple different docking locations, shops inside and outside docking locations, multiple levels inside docking locations, and NPCs are not easily findable. You often have to ask other NPCs to help you find the NPC you're looking for, and they will usually tell you to sod off (really, they do).\n\n*Waypoint navigation is confusing at best, game suffers from the same limited-time missions as before, but now it's twice as hard to figure out where to go. I spent 4 of the first taxi mission's 5 minutes circling the area I was being told there was a docking location at. After the mission expired, I may have found one near, but in a ship not actually attached to, the station highlighted by the waypoint.\n\n*Voice acting is bad, whole game is now voiced, you must speak to NPCs on a regular basis. One is on your ship.\n\n*Needless walking from place to place with an half-♥♥♥♥♥ feeling first person mode.\n\n*Pointless item hunting, suddenly space stations leaving loot in boxes everwhere, which you steal. Some hidden in airducts...because that makes sense. Entirely out of genre trope, and the trope doesn't really make sense in the correct games.\n\n*Main questline still buggy - decided to quit after being told to sell energy cubes to a station, sold more cubes than the quest expected and it ignored it and expected me to go back and get more cubes so I could sell *exactly* 100 cubes to the target station...\n\n","March 29, 2014","false","10.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandalle/recommended/2870/","sandalle","Lolmer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandalle/","166 products in account","Too many bugs. The idea of the game seems fun and I'm really trying, but I have to fight the interface (worse than prior X games) every time I want to do a task. Submenus upon submenus upon submenus, under the menu, only to find that's not the right place to send a fleet command for your non-combat ships to stop following, even though you were looking for fleet commands. Missions are fairly broken as well, you will need to do save game editing to fix/get past some of them. In fact, I'm stuck on selling 300 Food to some station in Fervid something as they won't seem to accept any of the 5,000 Food I've picked up in my Construction Vessel nor a Lepton that has precisely 300 Food on it. Neither of those ships will complete the trade with the mission station. I've heard that I have to buy the 300 Food from a specific station, but the mission never mentions it and the mission "briefs" are just that, brief and uninformative.\n\nThe walking around in stations is a huge waste of time and is often laggier than being out in space. Trying to do trades in the game is a joke, especially if it's a trade for a mission, your ships will often get "stuck" traveling between systems or even wandering aimlessly around a station and never dock, like its supposed to, to start the trade. I've watched one of my ships (Construction Vessel) dock twice at the correct port, only to never unload its cargo and instead immediately undock. This game is an endless series of frustrations with a few glimmers of joy.\n\nI almost forgot to mention your singular ship that you fly, which can only have one gun of a certain type (plasma, mining, etc.) "active" at a-a-time, you cannot have, say, four plasma cannons all blasting away. The only way to upgrade your weapon is to upgrade that one weapon to a strong version. Also, any time you open a menu while your ship is flying, your ship will STOP. So don't even think about multi-tasking while flying to some distant object, even for a brief moment. All forward momentum will immediately cease.\n\nOh, and yes you can capture ships, but only to sell them. In theory you can fly the ships, but as part of your boarding process you destroy the jump engines and drives, which makes the ship incapable of moving and there's no way to repair the ship if it doesn't already have Construction URV drones on it. Some ships don't even have drone bays and it's only a random chance (I have yet to see any included Construction URV drones after capturing 9 vessels) that they would pre-exist. You then put an Engineer on the ship which randomly (or you edited your save game) has Construction URV drones who then may, or may not, repair the ship. I have three Balor class ships sitting around with engineers and Construction URV drones, but the engineers refuse to do anything. One says he's repairing, but it's been 15 hours of in-game time of nothing. The other two engineers aren't even pretending to do their repair work on the engines.\n\nDid I mention selling the ships you captured? Well, that's only if you didn't tell one of the first ships to dock at the Ship Trader (you can only modify/sell ships to specific traders that know/want that type of ship) and repair itself, only to find out that the ship cannot move to the repair dock because the engines are destroyed and the engineer won't repair it. Now that Ship Trader is "stuck" on that order and will refuse to do any business with you, including selling any of your other ships. The only way to fix this is, again, to edit your save game and remove the repair order or just delete the offending ship. Also, you need Pilots to capture small ships (e.g. Fighters) and Captains to command the larger capital ships, plus an engineer to (maybe) repair the capital ship, but you may only carry a few (seven I think?) crew on your ship. You need a Marine Officer to even do the boarding, so that's one down already, so don't even bother with Pilots and trying to capture smaller ships. Best bet is to capture the ship, destroy anything Yisha asks you to in order to help the boarding process, and then immediately sell the ship. Don't try to fix anything. If you want a ship, go buy one from a Ship Trader.\n\nSeven years in the making? I seriously doubt that, or they spent all their time using developer hacks to do the fun events during QA and never played it like we mere customers would have to.","March 31, 2014","false","214.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It will take you hours upon hours of maneuvering through convoluted gameplay mechanics and glitches just to find out how shallow the game really is.\n\nIt has taken them "7" years to shovel this garbage out the door. A space sim(?) in which joystick/HOTAS support are held together with scotch tape, no physics (like all X games, it feels like moving around in spectator mode from Counter-Strike 1.5), no freelook (much less TrackIR), no radar, no target filtering, etc. In short - it is a big mess.\n\nSome might say it was a failed console game, and by Egosofts own admission they had it working on the Xbox 360 and would love nothing more than to have had X Rebirth as a console game. Instead, they vomited this out on to the PC. I suspect even Microsoft didn't want anything to do with it's poor quality and turned them down.\n\nI wouldn't bother waiting for it to get fixed, either. X Rebirth feels like a "last hurrah" to cash out of the business before Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous carry the space sim genre for the next decade. And we will all be better off for it.\n\nTRADE: Broken and cumbersome. Lacks information that should be easily accessible. Fly around convoluted space stations and pick up trade offers that only last an hour. Waterboard yourself as you wait 30 minutes for your transport ship to fly to the station and break while trying to complete an order.\n\nFIGHT: Incredibly shallow. Fixed view to make you nauseous and you're unable to look around. Cockpit takes up 40% of the screen. No radar or target filtering of any kind. Not even going to go into the AI.\n\nBUILD: Broken with an incredible lack of information letting you know wtf is going on or what you're doing wrong/how to do it in the first place. What can you build? AN EMPIRE!? Yeah, sure....some more stations to do more broken trading.\n\nTHINK: You got that right. You'll spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to do basic things only to find out that they are convoluted or don't exist in the first place. Scratch your head in wonder while asking yourself how this garbage could make it out to retail. Be in awe with the slapped together design decisions.

Stations can have multiple different docking locations, shops inside and outside docking locations, multiple levels inside docking locations, and NPCs are not easily findable. You often have to ask other NPCs to help you find the NPC you're looking for, and they will usually tell you to sod off (really, they do).\n\n*Waypoint navigation is confusing at best, game suffers from the same limited-time missions as before, but now it's twice as hard to figure out where to go. I spent 4 of the first taxi mission's 5 minutes circling the area I was being told there was a docking location at. After the mission expired, I may have found one near, but in a ship not actually attached to, the station highlighted by the waypoint.\n\n*Voice acting is bad, whole game is now voiced, you must speak to NPCs on a regular basis. One is on your ship.\n\n*Needless walking from place to place with an half-♥♥♥♥♥ feeling first person mode.\n\n*Pointless item hunting, suddenly space stations leaving loot in boxes everwhere, which you steal. Some hidden in airducts...because that makes sense. Entirely out of genre trope, and the trope doesn't really make sense in the correct games.\n\n*Main questline still buggy - decided to quit after being told to sell energy cubes to a station, sold more cubes than the quest expected and it ignored it and expected me to go back and get more cubes so I could sell *exactly* 100 cubes to the target station...\n\n","March 29, 2014","false","10.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandalle/recommended/2870/","sandalle","Lolmer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandalle/","166 products in account","Too many bugs. The idea of the game seems fun and I'm really trying, but I have to fight the interface (worse than prior X games) every time I want to do a task. Submenus upon submenus upon submenus, under the menu, only to find that's not the right place to send a fleet command for your non-combat ships to stop following, even though you were looking for fleet commands. Missions are fairly broken as well, you will need to do save game editing to fix/get past some of them. In fact, I'm stuck on selling 300 Food to some station in Fervid something as they won't seem to accept any of the 5,000 Food I've picked up in my Construction Vessel nor a Lepton that has precisely 300 Food on it. Neither of those ships will complete the trade with the mission station. I've heard that I have to buy the 300 Food from a specific station, but the mission never mentions it and the mission "briefs" are just that, brief and uninformative.\n\nThe walking around in stations is a huge waste of time and is often laggier than being out in space. Trying to do trades in the game is a joke, especially if it's a trade for a mission, your ships will often get "stuck" traveling between systems or even wandering aimlessly around a station and never dock, like its supposed to, to start the trade. I've watched one of my ships (Construction Vessel) dock twice at the correct port, only to never unload its cargo and instead immediately undock. This game is an endless series of frustrations with a few glimmers of joy.\n\nI almost forgot to mention your singular ship that you fly, which can only have one gun of a certain type (plasma, mining, etc.) "active" at a-a-time, you cannot have, say, four plasma cannons all blasting away. The only way to upgrade your weapon is to upgrade that one weapon to a strong version. Also, any time you open a menu while your ship is flying, your ship will STOP. So don't even think about multi-tasking while flying to some distant object, even for a brief moment. All forward momentum will immediately cease.\n\nOh, and yes you can capture ships, but only to sell them. In theory you can fly the ships, but as part of your boarding process you destroy the jump engines and drives, which makes the ship incapable of moving and there's no way to repair the ship if it doesn't already have Construction URV drones on it. Some ships don't even have drone bays and it's only a random chance (I have yet to see any included Construction URV drones after capturing 9 vessels) that they would pre-exist. You then put an Engineer on the ship which randomly (or you edited your save game) has Construction URV drones who then may, or may not, repair the ship. I have three Balor class ships sitting around with engineers and Construction URV drones, but the engineers refuse to do anything. One says he's repairing, but it's been 15 hours of in-game time of nothing. The other two engineers aren't even pretending to do their repair work on the engines.\n\nDid I mention selling the ships you captured? Well, that's only if you didn't tell one of the first ships to dock at the Ship Trader (you can only modify/sell ships to specific traders that know/want that type of ship) and repair itself, only to find out that the ship cannot move to the repair dock because the engines are destroyed and the engineer won't repair it. Now that Ship Trader is "stuck" on that order and will refuse to do any business with you, including selling any of your other ships. The only way to fix this is, again, to edit your save game and remove the repair order or just delete the offending ship. Also, you need Pilots to capture small ships (e.g. Fighters) and Captains to command the larger capital ships, plus an engineer to (maybe) repair the capital ship, but you may only carry a few (seven I think?) crew on your ship. You need a Marine Officer to even do the boarding, so that's one down already, so don't even bother with Pilots and trying to capture smaller ships. Best bet is to capture the ship, destroy anything Yisha asks you to in order to help the boarding process, and then immediately sell the ship. Don't try to fix anything. If you want a ship, go buy one from a Ship Trader.\n\nSeven years in the making? I seriously doubt that, or they spent all their time using developer hacks to do the fun events during QA and never played it like we mere customers would have to.","March 31, 2014","false","214.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yes there were issues and hurdles that had to be over come here and there in previos versions and some that never got resolved; I had hoped that this would be the truth here too as a new direction in this groud breaking thought line.  I have been playing the last 4 itterations of the Xuniverse franchise (I got hooked with the original X2 big time).  I was hoping that maybe all the hype was just due to this being a complete revamp of the entire design, alas this is not completely right, yes it is a revamp but with the redesign I find it more fun to play any space game but this one including DarkStar One, which advertised the same but was a bit of a fun yet still a flop of a game.  I would argue that nearly 90% of the intelligence and aspects of what made the previous game difficult to develop and create were removed or cheated out (Ships would commonly fly THROUGH stations so they do not have to die by the station simply becasue they can not fly around it).  If you wish a list of items that no longer exist then please ping me any time I will give you far greater detail as the game is no longer "A Living Economy" but now a totally fake and DEAD one, and I primise not to just wine because they changed the paint job, this game really does make me very sad that I spent the money to buy it.  I would have been better off spending that money on ANY other game including variants I do not like playing on PC, I hate to support horribly done games and I have to say I really am dissapointed in the developer I tryly enjoy games from (EGSOFT) thinking this was a releasable game (not to mention the number of serious buggs in it), after within only a few minutes of my first maiden flight I got runover by a freighter and pushed "through" the walls of a station and locked inside it making it impossible to escape and having to completely restart the game.\n\nI highly reccoment as a gamer that you stay away from this title, get all of the X3 previous titles if you want to really enjoy a game for a long time and have endless relayability (I normally do not replay game but I have done so MANY times with X3 itterations previous to Rebirth).\n\nI am truly sorry EGSOFT, you really let everyone down on this title, pleaes go back and look at why the previous game was so enjoyed and rethink the architecture including the rendering engine.  I KNOW you can do FAR better then this even in Beta class games.","March 24, 2014","false","27.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","4"

Instead I shall list suggestions which would make this game's experience fantastic because the original concept is indeed fantastic, but unfortunately not exploited. All I mention here is based on enough hours of playing and completing the whole campaign (thanks to the 1.24 patch).\n\nRemember that Egosoft have already invested a lot of time, money and resources for the existing content, so do not expect much improvement on this project. They might decide to release DLCs but these are not solutions to existing problems, they are extensions of existing problems.\n\nHere it goes:\n\n__________________________________________\nHardware\n\n-Make the game running smooth on the average modern PC\n\nControls\n\n-Enable look around using numpad as in X3\n-Split roll function in two button: roll right, roll left and assignable on gamepad as in X3\n\nX Universe\n\n-Add Boron and Paranid factions (it's unfair if they come in payable DLC)\n-Add Pirate stations. If not directly visible give hints, indications that they might be somewhere near some zones and we'd explore for them\n-Make trade/missions possible with Pirates\n\nGraphics\n\n-Make MPC characters look and act more realistic\n-Stations/ships/objects should not be visible while outside nebula cloud\n-Nebula cloud should be visible from any distance while in the sector, not just from its zone.\n-Prevent ships going through one another or through stations as if hollow\n\nOptional but doable cool and practical graphical suggestions\n\n-Make it possible to dock in stations manually with animation of opening hangar and docking procedure (if enabled by player   in settings)\n-Make it possible to travel in a station from one dock/area to another using a local train or something cool\n-Make planetary descent possible (limited areas only if too complicated) for trade and exploration, alone or with party (yes it's possible, Evochron series have this fantastic feature with realistic atmospheric characteristics)\n\nUI and cockpit\n\n-Remove radial menu and replace with command/property menu as in X3\n-Add radar display\n-On info display, while targeting ships, add distance and velocity\n\nIn albion Skunk\n\n-Disable/modify Ysha speech “Requesting permission to dock” when docking at own ship/station or Xenon stations\n-Enable free walking around the cockpit when not seated\n-Enable Click on pilot chair to be seated while free walking around instead of the control switch in the corridor\n-Enable interaction functions with other tools/computers in cockpit for small routine maintenance/monitoring (engineer cannot do everything)\n-Enable more speech with co-pilot and crew to kill the silence and stillness\n\nNavigation & map\n\n-Enable jump drive for Skunk: gate to gate and point to point (unfocused optional but cool)\n-Enable zoom in/out in map, not just press sector/zone...\n-Add written details on map for stations, ships and objects, not just clickable list o right side\n-Enable filter map content for display\n-Let us select our own speed in highways instead of following other crafts\n-Have boost consume its own energy storage, not from shield or enable upgrade like energy splitter or something\n-When docked in carrier/capital ship fix the “plot course” function, or provide clear instructions\n-Add many more systems including our solar system\n\nStations\n\n-Give traders appropriate stores/workshops, so that trade doesn't take place in a bunk or bar\n-Give NPC more dialog variety and more casual\n-Modify Ren Otani speech: “Show me your wares please”, to something more realistic, casual and add variety, not always the same sentence (appropriate the the service in question)\n-Make NPC give small missions (e.g. “provide 20 units of teladianium paneling”, “ship this package at this station to this guy”...) which would affect on discounts and rep on faction.\n\nTrade\n\n-Enable more than 3 planned trading trips per ship\n-When more than one trade trip is planned for the same station keep the ship docked till all transactions are finished\n-Add button in trade menu to view/edit/delete planned trade trips in detail\n-Add best buy/sell software upgrade (e.g. MK1 limited to sector, MK2 limited to system, MK3 for whole map)\n-Add many more upgrades for the Skunk\n\nShipyards\n\n-Enable command ship (all but Skunk) to go to selected shipyard for repair/upgrade without having to go there yourself first (with command menu X3 style this would be possible)\n-Enable purchase of fighters (if there are I must be blind) to use them as wings\n\nCombat\n\n-Enable “Lock on Target”: when selecting a target it should be possible to press lock on target to stay locked on that target till it is destroyed or out of scanner range or you manually select another target.

Close to countless reviews found on just about any gaming website can elucidate the extent of the problems this game presented. I just wanted to highlight some that mattered most to me.\nGiven that it's near impossible to get a game released these days without a slew of bugs and glitches, I don't want to spend too much time focusing on those errors. That said, it is worth asking how on earth a company as established as Egosoft could have possibly thought XR was worthy of release. A few glitches here, maybe a bug or two in that feature there, sure but what they gave us was just an utter shock. And you have to imagine that at some point, they sat down during some meeting just before launch and said "well this is ready to hit the mainstream. We have a good product, a functioning product or at the very least a passable product but as we all know now, not one of those held true. NOT a one.\n\nTo be frank, as consumers we have a right to expect a game to not have at least half the bugs XR had, especially in a AAA title. I'm not implying that every game released be absolutely bug free, but I equate this to gas prices. At a certain point in time, our country raises gas prices from oh, let’s say $2.00 a gallon to $4.50. Of course we're outraged but this persists for such a long time that when they finally reduce the price to $3.95, we jump for joy and hug our pets in excitement. Again, I don't expect the gas to be free, but I expect it to be reasonable. The games that have been released over the last few years are akin to charging a good $6.00/g for gas and nowhere has this been more true for me than with XR.\n\nI was so utterly frustrated doing the infamous 100 energy cell mission within the first hour of the game that my gf had to pull me away and take me to dinner to calm me down a bit but I let the game continue in hopes that my ship would find it’s way. Two and a half hours later and my freighter is still taking a sightseeing tour of whatever galaxy we're in (something I doubt I'll ever learn given the incomprehensible map system). Unfortunately, when I submitted for a refund 4-5 times, Steam laid this  as evidence against me stating I had played 20 some odd hours and therefore must have in some way approved of the product. Like most people I've spoken to or read about, the vast majority of that time was spent alt tabbed checking forums, practicing calming breaths, thinking about taking up religion again or going out to more dinners aimed at diffusing my ticking time bomb of frustration. Many others have stated this very thing in their own way and yet it shows us logging on more hours than we ever actually played.\n\nSO that all said, let’s say the Egosoft fairy waived her magic wand, which I'm sure is rife with glitches and probably using the wrong batteries and fixed every bug and glitch in the game. Know what we're left with? An glitch free POS. Look, I'm not trying to be some kind of hater. I, like everyone else tried time and again to justify the money I threw away in this game. And like some others also stated, there is the skeleton of a game buried in there somewhere, but I really did try. I have everything to gain in liking this game given the brick wall I've ran into with steam customer service. All the bugs aside, the design decisions they made in this day and age are just beyond understanding. I understand these guys are based in Germany but could they really not afford getting just one guy, ONE GUY who speaks native English on their staff to share some phrases with them that would pass off better than "Go Boil your Head" or, "Nice talking to you...NOT". Forget how utterly annoying it is that nearly every NPC is angry at you for no reason....well wait, they all appear to be over 70 years old, so maybe they're just old grouches.....that are supposedly piloting space and building empires......sigh.., forget the annoyance, if you can anyhow, but the dialogue left me embarrassed for them in some odd way.  How full of yourself and out of touch must you be? And How many times did Bernd say the word "Immersion"? Yisha, the co-pilot is by far and away on my top three list of hair pullers. Forget her really creepy incomprehensible animation, not sure if she's pooping in her ventilated space suit, is she's part arachnid, fighting the urge to eat me, or doing calisthenics. What I don't understand is why they put her there. I know others have voiced this in their own way, but here's the bottom line. She doesn't do anything. At all. She doesn't pilot, trade, she is nothing more than a permanent plot prop piece. I've tried finding the woman who did the voice acting for her without success. Perhaps that's for the best. She doesn't need career changing advice from some yankee. But oh my sweet jesus is it awful. It again, ruins the whole immersion. Poorly written dialogue, made worse by the worst voice acting. Missions requiring me to go here to pick this up, then there to drop it off, then here to pick up something else, then there to deliver it. I'm a fed ex truck in space stuck on rookie training duty.\n\nWhat i did find funny was how very early in the game, the crew to which Yisha belonged to paid me good money (I'm assuming its good since I haven't really had a chance to see an economy function) to keep her with me. It totally sounds like a made up excuse to get rid of her now that she's no longer on their ship. Out of the  literally 12 times I had to restart the game, that was the only thing that made me smile until I realized it was me they pawned her off on. If I could have ejected her from my latrine shoot, I would have right onto their windshield.\n\nI mean the list goes on and on and on. The one thing everyone was really excited about, or at least most people, myself included, was walking around space stations. God what an exercise in frustration that was. Cookie cutter, with every NPC doing the same task  in the same corner. Every box and locker making the same sound and getting you stuck in the process 25% of the time. It was all just one big horrible horrible horrible experience. And they charged us $50 for it. They made a lot of money while many of us gave a significant chunk of our meagerly paychecks for something we were hoping would take our minds off our meagerly paychecks. Instead, I’m forced to face the harsh realities of just how much spending $50 on the wrong present for myself can impact my life in a negative way. I’ve since moved on but then I saw that Steam is finally allowing us to write reviews so here is me waving my hands telling anyone thinking of XR to change course, go somewhere else. Dive into an empty swimming pool and incur more enjoyment.\nOne a last note, I emailed egosoft early on and the Bernd man himself replied. I wont bother with the details cuz he didn’t give me any. It was short, condescending, blowing off my thoughts and recommendations and still full of himself with regards to that incredibly inappropriate “We’re a Success!” message he tied onto his failing apology. In short all that said was, we failed, you bought it, and we MADE MONEY OFF YOU!!! Yay!\nSigh. Hey Egosoft, if any of you ever read this, go and apologize. Not to us cuz that would take the remainder of your lives to do. Rather, apologize to every other gaming company for the bad faith you instilled in all the gamers out there that will inevitably think twice about purchasing something at launch. You screwed up the curve in the worst possible way. So to all of you that made these decisions to the ones that knew better but lacked the courage to tell those in power  what time of day it was and that they’re releasing a big failure, I say SHAME on you.\n","December 2, 2013","false","37.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Yes there were issues and hurdles that had to be over come here and there in previos versions and some that never got resolved; I had hoped that this would be the truth here too as a new direction in this groud breaking thought line.  I have been playing the last 4 itterations of the Xuniverse franchise (I got hooked with the original X2 big time).  I was hoping that maybe all the hype was just due to this being a complete revamp of the entire design, alas this is not completely right, yes it is a revamp but with the redesign I find it more fun to play any space game but this one including DarkStar One, which advertised the same but was a bit of a fun yet still a flop of a game.  I would argue that nearly 90% of the intelligence and aspects of what made the previous game difficult to develop and create were removed or cheated out (Ships would commonly fly THROUGH stations so they do not have to die by the station simply becasue they can not fly around it).  If you wish a list of items that no longer exist then please ping me any time I will give you far greater detail as the game is no longer "A Living Economy" but now a totally fake and DEAD one, and I primise not to just wine because they changed the paint job, this game really does make me very sad that I spent the money to buy it.  I would have been better off spending that money on ANY other game including variants I do not like playing on PC, I hate to support horribly done games and I have to say I really am dissapointed in the developer I tryly enjoy games from (EGSOFT) thinking this was a releasable game (not to mention the number of serious buggs in it), after within only a few minutes of my first maiden flight I got runover by a freighter and pushed "through" the walls of a station and locked inside it making it impossible to escape and having to completely restart the game.\n\nI highly reccoment as a gamer that you stay away from this title, get all of the X3 previous titles if you want to really enjoy a game for a long time and have endless relayability (I normally do not replay game but I have done so MANY times with X3 itterations previous to Rebirth).\n\nI am truly sorry EGSOFT, you really let everyone down on this title, pleaes go back and look at why the previous game was so enjoyed and rethink the architecture including the rendering engine.

There are so many bugs with the trade ships that I just could not do it after a while. Often times, ships would just stop out side a port where they had gone to buy cargo and never move again. Some times credits set a side for a trade would vanish and the trade never happen. The space combat is fun and can be really neat when you factor in drones and other ships into the picture but some times, for no reasone I could find, my FPS would drop to 2 untill I restarted the game and after reloading my save the same events would pass and every thing would be just fine.

Looking back on the other X series games I have played, this game will definitely not get fixed up to spec anytime soon. There are still bugs with their other games that the community had to create fixes for (through modding). This game is beyond and kind of patch.\n\nDespite how ugly and badly designed the game is, if you can even get it to run, or continue running without crashing every other couple of minutes, my hats off to you.\n\nDo not purchase this game. Even if it goes on some holiday sale for 75% off, it will end up eating most of your time trying to work around things. The trading system and other elements in the game that are main features are bugged or not working properly. It was unplayable. On a high end rig, this game runs like doo-doo.

I've played the hell out of them and they were awesome. I have games in the series in and out of steam.\n\nThis game is unplayable, buggy, dumbed down, poorly designed UI, bad AI (still), poor optimization for PC, way too expensive for what it is, unresponsive, extremely poor fps on a wide range of PC's to the point of making it unplayable, and has made the steam forum so congested with bad reviews/complaints that you cannot even find workarounds for bugs that the community  might have solved on their own. There are so many problems with the game that they can't be listed. Heck, the devs have a pinned topic on their forum with a list of current bugs and other things that are game breakers which span over two pages long.\n\n\n\nBottom line:\n\n================Do not buy this game.================","December 4, 2013","false","3.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There is no external view or option to disable the cockpit that I could find. The storyline is hard to follow and very buggy. The game feels highly dumbed down from what you have come to love and expect from an X game. This game would require a massive patch that I doubt will ever come.\n\nClearly EGOSOFT was attempting to rework the classic X games into something new and evolved but lost their way from what made the X series awesome.

There are a ton of great mods out there designed to correct some of the shortcomings and for that I am very grateful. It seems that from at least X3 to X rebirth the game has been left to modders to fix. I have a highend computer and still run into graphics issues in populated systems. The Trading is still very much in need of simplification and player control. Combat isn't to bad as long as you can do it in the middle of nowhere as to not lag out and die. The ability to build is nice but at the leisure of A.I. which is in no hurry at all. Ships still just sit with resources just out of reach and it takes days to build (left Comp on and active to try this ) anything worth having and still isnt completed after bringing them supplies myself. The content is shallow and unguided. Some of the needed missions for vanilla are still broken even after all this time. I don't know if theres still plans for future releases and fixes from egosoft or not but I'd recommend to not purchase until something comes down the pipe from either the devs or the modders about an aboslute game fix.

X Rebirth is NOT X3, just leave that thought else where. X Rebirth is a new direction on the X Universe.\nThere are many differences good and bad and some concepts are implemented a bit more simpler and some are far more complex.\n\nYou take the role of a single ship captain and view the universe from one perspective.\n\nI think the latest version is extremely enjoyable, 3.53, far more so with use of Mods. If you loved the role of playing statistical manager from the safety of a itemized data screen then this game is not for you. The ability to directly control mass ships via a remote display map screen in X3 is not as easily, or not at all the same in Rebirth. Think of it as traveling through the universe in a single ship with emphasis on what is in front of you.\n\nAs a FPSS (first person shooter ship) this game is a whole hell of a lot of fun. It is easy to organize fighter squads under your wing and with a click order them to attack a target. This aspect of the game is wonderful.\nDrones, missiles, and underlings are your path to survival.\n\nAgain look at it from a single point character as you fly the Albion Pride influencing the universe as you go. You can personalize the cockpit, or mod your own!, to make your ship more to your own liking.\n\nFor Trading I think it is far more satisfying than previous games. No, you can't personally captain the largest freighter in the universe. What you can do is have freighters in your squad and as you fly through the universe quickly assign them trade jobs. This is even made easier with trade software and you can do this all from a menu screen. Give a single freighter 4 or 5 trade jobs and go do something else, or dock on that trade ship and watch the action from the bridge.\n\nYou are not the captain, you are the Admiral, and Admirals don't drive, they command.\n\nThe campaign I find enjoyable. Much more simplistic than many missions in X3 but it serves as an excellent Tutorial which was greatly missed in prior X games. If you find yourself starting to see the short failings of certain aspects of the game CONGRATULATIONS you've made it further in this game than most do in the previous X3 games :P\n\nWith that said, no, Rebirth does not have the same Universe longevity as say X3 TC. You will hit that end game moment a bit sooner and find less to do, at least at the moment. Then again the X series has always been about what you make of it, so try something new, or mod.\n\nIn ending, yes I can now recommend X Rebirth as the game is excellent and becoming better and better each official release with amazing mods to make the universe remarkable. Has it overcome X3 TC/AP ? not quite, but it's damn close.","May 13, 2015","true","141.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wit3tyg3r/recommended/2870/","wit3tyg3r","wit3tyg3r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wit3tyg3r/","461 products in account","Good music and beautiful space vistas are the strongest aspects of X Rebirth. Unfortunately, that's where the "good" ends and the "bad" begins.\n\nDespite all of the bugs and glitches (which have mostly been addressed in the 2.0 update), there are fundamental flaws in the basic game design. The X series has been well known for its deep economy and combat systems. X Rebirth took most of that away. The X series has been touted for providing a large universe to explore and secrets to discover. X Rebirth took most of that away. The X series has been a staple in the space simulation genre for its meticulous attention to detail and giving the player immense amounts of freedom. X Rebirth took most of that away.\n\nAs you can see, X Rebirth is a mostly step backwards rather than a revisitation--or "rebirth"--of the series. I purchased the game on release day and have been regretting it ever since.\n\nThe biggest flaw that stood out near the time of release is the fact that you are limited to a single ship; to make matters worse they called it the "Albion Skunk", a ship that was once known for its prowess (and went by a different name) but was later found in ruins and scrapped. Having only one pilotable ship should have been the first sign to me that this game would never live up to expectations. Because of this limitation, major mechanics that are considered "norms" for the genre, like trading, are handled by pilots you hire who can fly other ships. This limits you to focusing almost completely on combat. There are a handful of missions you can run, but they mostly consist of bounty hunting.\n\nOne of the key aspects that was announced before the game released was the ability to step out of the cockpit and walk around stations. The concept was fantastic and it has rarely been done in the space sim genre. Sadly, X Rebirth failed to make that as exciting and innovative as it was made to seem. There are basically two types of interiors that you'll see. Every station uses one of those two layouts and tried to make them unique by blocking off certain sections for each station. It's fun and interesting to walk through the stations the first few times, but it quickly becomes frustrating when you have to go through a maze of corridors to get to your destination to talk to a vendor or mission contact. Additionally, the stations are almost completely devoid of life. There are maybe 20 people in any given station, and all of them stay in the exact same spot and do absolutely nothing. Which leads me to my next point...\n\nCharacter design is terrible! Other than the few key characters in the tutorial campaign (such as Yisha, your copilot), every other person you see is just a copy. There are maybe four unique character designs: human male, human female, and roughly two alien humanoid species. They are then copied and pasted throughout the stations.\n\nThere are many other examples of poor design and rushed development that I could continue to list (such as terrible UI, bad voice acting, etc.), but I think my message is fairly clear already. X Rebirth essentially attempted to make the X series more streamlined and accessible, but it seems like their answer for that was to make the game more casual-friendly by ditching fundamental space-sim mechanics and to change the focus on the series and genre completely (You don't even have 6 degrees of freedom! Everything has an UPWARD orientation which makes absolutely ZERO sense in space!).\n\nHowever, X Rebirth doesn't fail completely. There are a few things that stand out and are worth mentioning. As I stated earlier, the music is good and the space backdrops are gorgeous. Additionally, activity outside of the stations actually makes the areas feel populated. Each stations will have hundreds of ships flying around, traffic heading in and out of docking bays, police ships scanning and chasing criminals, military cruisers fending off attackers...

Unfortunately, that's where the "good" ends and the "bad" begins.\n\nDespite all of the bugs and glitches (which have mostly been addressed in the 2.0 update), there are fundamental flaws in the basic game design. The X series has been well known for its deep economy and combat systems. X Rebirth took most of that away. The X series has been touted for providing a large universe to explore and secrets to discover. X Rebirth took most of that away. The X series has been a staple in the space simulation genre for its meticulous attention to detail and giving the player immense amounts of freedom. X Rebirth took most of that away.\n\nAs you can see, X Rebirth is a mostly step backwards rather than a revisitation--or "rebirth"--of the series. I purchased the game on release day and have been regretting it ever since.\n\nThe biggest flaw that stood out near the time of release is the fact that you are limited to a single ship; to make matters worse they called it the "Albion Skunk", a ship that was once known for its prowess (and went by a different name) but was later found in ruins and scrapped. Having only one pilotable ship should have been the first sign to me that this game would never live up to expectations. Because of this limitation, major mechanics that are considered "norms" for the genre, like trading, are handled by pilots you hire who can fly other ships. This limits you to focusing almost completely on combat. There are a handful of missions you can run, but they mostly consist of bounty hunting.\n\nOne of the key aspects that was announced before the game released was the ability to step out of the cockpit and walk around stations. The concept was fantastic and it has rarely been done in the space sim genre. Sadly, X Rebirth failed to make that as exciting and innovative as it was made to seem. There are basically two types of interiors that you'll see. Every station uses one of those two layouts and tried to make them unique by blocking off certain sections for each station. It's fun and interesting to walk through the stations the first few times, but it quickly becomes frustrating when you have to go through a maze of corridors to get to your destination to talk to a vendor or mission contact. Additionally, the stations are almost completely devoid of life. There are maybe 20 people in any given station, and all of them stay in the exact same spot and do absolutely nothing. Which leads me to my next point...\n\nCharacter design is terrible! Other than the few key characters in the tutorial campaign (such as Yisha, your copilot), every other person you see is just a copy. There are maybe four unique character designs: human male, human female, and roughly two alien humanoid species. They are then copied and pasted throughout the stations.\n\nThere are many other examples of poor design and rushed development that I could continue to list (such as terrible UI, bad voice acting, etc.), but I think my message is fairly clear already. X Rebirth essentially attempted to make the X series more streamlined and accessible, but it seems like their answer for that was to make the game more casual-friendly by ditching fundamental space-sim mechanics and to change the focus on the series and genre completely (You don't even have 6 degrees of freedom! Everything has an UPWARD orientation which makes absolutely ZERO sense in space!).\n\nHowever, X Rebirth doesn't fail completely. There are a few things that stand out and are worth mentioning. As I stated earlier, the music is good and the space backdrops are gorgeous. Additionally, activity outside of the stations actually makes the areas feel populated. Each stations will have hundreds of ships flying around, traffic heading in and out of docking bays, police ships scanning and chasing criminals, military cruisers fending off attackers... There is no lack of visual fidelity when it comes to the station exteriors.\n\nUnfortunately, the few things that X Rebirth does right are too few. With the space sim genre coming back to fruition with games like Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen in development, it's very, very difficult to recommend or praise X Rebirth.","July 30, 2014","false","22.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

First I started playing with a Xbox gamepad, and had to select it on options menu to be auto recognized. Despite all the game being accessible, I didn't liked the ship navigation, so I dropped the gamepad and started configuring my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro + Razer Tartarus to play with every assist off and Hard difficulty.\n\nConfigure all the menus, options, interactions and shortcuts was very hard, because I didn't knew what those things do, and after 7 hours I still don't know what is everything. The movements was the most easy part, common to any plane/ship game.\n\nEnter inside stations is fun, see your crew in your ship too. Talk to people is interesting, because some of the same professions have different things to say. I entered in a bar with music and I loved the ambientation. I saw an alien guy there for the first time.\n\nNavigate is amazing. Around the stations the activity is intense, and sometimes the cops scan my ship and thanks me for the cooperation. The combat with joystick offer a good challenge and I lost a ship already, because while I was trying catch one enemy, the other was burning my crew and myself, haha.\n\nSo, that's my first impression. I'm very satisfied until now, and I'm still learning all the possibilities. For now the universe of X Rebirth is teaching me about all the ways I can play.\n\n• "Familiar" Impression [next]","June 17, 2015","true","78.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I even got it against my better judgement to the thoughts of 'maybe it's not as bad as they say it is.' 'maybe they just aren't adjusting to the new way the game plays' and 'maybe it has improved over time to the point where it is as enjoyable as previous games in the series'. I am very sorry to report that this is just not the case.\n\nIn some ways, I would have prefered it if they simply copied and pasted the X-3 universe, tweaked it a bit by adding a few new systems and adding better economy and then just selling THAT as a new game. At least I'd of probably enjoyed that.\n\nThat's not totally fair though, they DID make an effort, they just got it terribly wrong. In absolute fairness, I found that the storyline by itself had improved from previous X-games. and even though the one ship deal did put me off playing for a while, I got used to that. But every other aspect about it from the way it looks to the way it moves and that way it performs just... irritates me to no end... especially when I know these people can produce games such as X-3 and X-2. Let that serve as a warning to anyone looking to buy. They have lost a lot of fan support because of this... including mine. Sure they all had their own faults too but simply put... I liked those games, I can play X2 and X3 for days, weeks, even months at a time, I can barely just about manage to force myself to put up with X-rebirth for maybe a few hours.","June 17, 2015","false","14.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

Before, I'd say the metacritic scores were right on, but thanks to these updates, I feel that score doesn't reflect on the product as it stands now. If I were to bet, I'd bet Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous are going to be better games, but the X Series has offered things not found in many other games.  So, I'm changing my vote from "STAY FAR AWAY" to a hopeful "it's worth trying out"...

We will even ignore design decisions such as police ships with sirens in outer space.\n\nIssues with this game range from low performance, buggy animations, buggy AI, terrible voice acting (I cannot stress this enough, it is by far the worst voice acting I have heard in recent years), game breaking bugs that make finishing the campaign impossible, crashes and corrupt saved games.\n\nThe latest patch even introduced a new bug that completely disrupts trading in the game (and thus almost all production as well). Hopefully this issue will be patched soon enough. If you are considering purchasing this game anytime soon, I'd recommend disabling automatic updates and only allowing the game to patch after you've checked the forums for any major new issues.\n\nWhile Egosoft does have a good reputation for supporting their games for a long time and adding new content over time, that cannot excuse the extremely poor quality of this release.","November 26, 2013","false","4.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

They got my $50 before it even arrived, and I stayed up late just so that I could dive in as soon as possible... Well it just so happens that the pool was empty. Marred with a litany of bugs and technical flaws, and quite possibly the most consistently bad frame rate I've ever experienced, X Rebirth seemed more like X Abortion. Even turning all the settings down didn't help. Oh and, I could barely get 20 minutes into the game without it crashing multiple times.\n\nMaybe they can patch it.

It will be months, maybe even years before all of the glitches, bugs, Artificial Intelligence, framerate, and interface issues get resolved, if ever. Bugs can be patched, AI can be fixed, but even then, the game still might not be salvagable. It is the core design choices built into the game itself that is the real problem.\n\n1) The entire UI needs to be completely scrapped and redone from the ground up. It is just that bad.\n2) The System:Sector:Zone map scheme is absurdly frustrating, to say the least.\n3) Nearly all of the gameplay elements Egosoft has spent years introducing, refining, and polishing in the X series have been scrapped. No more SETA to speed up tedious portions, no more jumpdrive in the ship you actually pilot, no more autopilot, no more sector/universal traders, no more realtime monitoring of commodity prices using a satellite network, no more customizable keybinding, no more hotkeys to cycle through targets (you literally have to click on a ship w/ your cursor to highlight them and get aim-assist).\n\nAs many others have said before me, this simply isn't an 'X' game. They should have called it 'Y'. As in Y the hell would anyone play this?\n\nIt pains me to write this. I know Egosoft is comprised a a dedicated bunch who have a long history of commitment to thier customers.

Complete garbage produced over a 7 year period a team with years of experience designing space-sims who really really REALLY should have known better.\n\nHere's to hoping the modding community can fix what Egosoft has broken.

The video trailers are completely misleading, as were all the hypes and promises made by EgoSoft. The voice acting is terrible, sounding like someone reading (for the first time) off a script with little to no emotion. The NPCs are all static and don't move anywhere around the cut-and-paste station interiors. No matter what the station looks like on the outside, it'll probably look pretty much the same on the inside.\nCombat is clunky- the first bit of combat where you fight a couple of drones, your ship maneuvers like a stoned whale, so you can barely hit them, and from what I've seen from others, this doesn't particularly improve.\nWhile the universe, artistically, is gorgeous...the rest, not so much.\nIf you want to travel from point A to point B, you'll have to fly manually the whole way, often using the weird space-highway system. Having to circle a station for 5-10 minutes to find where you're supposed to dock adds to the frustation.\nAs does suddenly losing a chance at being liked by an NPC due to some sort of (completely unexplained) conversation minigame coming up and disappearing before you know what's happening.\n\nYour supposed crew members looking after your ships have all the intelligence of a sub-average brick. They have to be told exactly what to do (and sometimes still won't do it) through a maze of menus and submenus. Your co-pilot is worse- she throws random lines out here and there which make no sense whatsoever, her voice acting is terrible and cliched, and she provides no extra purpose to the game beyond being an annoyance.\n\nOVERALL:\nWhile the space-graphics are pretty, and there's a lot to potentially do....the game is fundamentally fubared, with some parts completely ambiguous, others blatantly and utterly broken, and the majority of it frustrating.\nConclusion:\nDon't buy it, like I did.

But if you want something a little more involved that isn't too steep a learning curve then give rebirth a shot","July 13, 2015","true","179.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","2"

Nothing works. But that's not even the worst thing.

But at the core, they offer a deep and rewarding space sim sandbox experience. The clunky UI and sheer scope of the game overwhelms most first time players. But when you finally overcome all obstacles, you're in for a real treat which might consume most of your social life. With all that in mind, i pre-ordered this game. It was supposed to be a PC exclusive, hardcore space sim. It was made by seasoned developers with years of experience under their belts. And man, look at those graphics! What could go wrong here?\n\nPretty much everything.\n\nX Rebirth is pretty. The space cities look amazig, they're richly detailed, there's plenty of space ship traffic around them, and the game looks really nice at first glance. The backdrops are simply stunning. Every sector has its own unique look and feel. It's by far the best looking space game to date. And that's the end of the positives.\n\nThe interface has been overhauled, supposedly, to be more accessible. In reality, we get something both newcomers and old time veterans will have hard time getting used to. The UI is once again unintuitive and badly thought out. Half of the stuff you could do in previous X games has been thrown out of the window. There's no radar. The world map is unreadable. You can't give out basic orders to ships under your command. You can't tell if they're moving or not. You can't see their destination, speed etc... But if that's not enough, you can't even switch between your targets with the keyboard! In a god damn space sim! You can't rebind most of the keys either. And every time you want to check something on your ship's computer (the main UI window), you're forced to watch an annoying animation.\n\nThe game is filled with pointless minigames. There's a minigame for pretty much everything you do. From flying through space highways or walking through space stations (in search for random containers filled with loot and free credits), to gathering collectible points for shop discounts or scanning your nearest vicinity for random junk floating around in space. They're pointless, tedious and repetitive. And they definitely don't belong in a space sim.\n\nYou can now walk freely inside the space stations. A nice idea - in theory, but in this case it's just another chore this game didn't need. There are 3 different space station layouts. Do i need to say they get old pretty fast? And they're filled with butt-ugly, lifeless NPCs, which are nothing more than a visual representation of the trading/ship managment UI. The voice acting is as bad as you'd expect from Egosoft, except, it's actually even worse. Prepare to listen to your main protagonist repeat the same lines over and over again, making the infamous Bethesda "arrow in the knee" or "i saw a mudcrab the other day" lines look fresh and original.\n\nThe game world is small. That's the cost you have to pay for those pretty graphics. And the persistent, reactive world we were promissed was a lie. Rebirth's world is filled with constant traffic. There are hundreds of ships, large and small, moving through space. But most of them are there just for show. For example, hardly anything leaves of enters the highways. So, in reality, the world is mostly filled with dummy props and cool looking graphical effects.\n\nOh, and there are bugs. Serious, gamebreaking bugs that make you lose hours of gameplay. The AI behaves in ridiculous ways... when it's not completely idle. That's especially annoying if it happens to one of your ships.\n\nThe game is bad, and don't hope it will ever improve. It's broken at its very core. No ammount of patches and mods will undo 7 years of bad design and pointless features. Seriously, if you're a fan, stick to X3 and its expansions, if not, get X3: TC or AP. Don't waste your money on this steaming pile of fertilizer like i did. I bought it so you don't have to.","November 26, 2013","false","6.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","2"

"\n\nWhat i can also say is that yes at times the game seems to screw you over so badly it seems like pure Majik and blind luck that the mission you have finally done was one son of a bith to get going right and finally let me carry on about my buisness.\n"Yeah, for you guy's that have allready been there i bet ya's had guessed it that i was on about the #100energycellsmission ! "\nPURE FREAKIN NIGTMARE TO GET WORKING RIGHT,\nAnd i was on the latest version, version 3.53(193580 - 64bit),\nI swear to holy GAMEEOBA i must have done at least 5 clean restarts of the game before i finally sussed it all out and how to go about doing the mission.\n\nUn bloody believable.\n\nHowever when the game dose work right it does do it well.\n\nNow, there is still some major issues there that need to be fixed and patched from what i have been reading here and on the egosoft forums.\n\nPersonally i havent come across any game breaking bugs that are so bad that you are unable to play.\n\nMy performance is ok, not the best i would like it at but i can still play with some wiggle room before the fps dips every now and again.\n\nOverall i intend to put a lot more hours into this game and apart from the crap at the start with the #100energycells headache fiasco extraordinaire, then things do seem to get better with the missions/campaign.\n\nOne thing i will say though when using the rahanas for the deliveries is that you have to be patient, you have to WAIT untill you are notify'd that they are there and picking up the goods,\nYou have to remain patient,\ndont forget you are part of a major huge economy when you are playing any X: series of games, so you have to wait just like any other transport or delivery vehicle when you need to dock your other ships, with the Albion Skunk, you dont have to wait, you can slalom around the mines and sattelites and mining headqurters as well as check out asteroids to your wee hearts content.\nThe mods to this game are really good.\nYou can get it where it makes the game much harder than it is allready by adding in wars - faction wars - xenon fights - tradeing - fighting - exploring !!! there is a fair few there, but if you look through and read about the high ranking ones and most liked and subbed then you can guess that the mod is safe and good to go/use.\n\nAnyhows time to end this review.\n\nBare in mind anybody that does read my review all the way to now, as this bit is really important.\n\nIf you are looking for a decent and deep learning curve space sim, then YES, you have found the right game with X: Rebirth, just bare in mind that there is a lot of negative reviews hating on the game as it wasnt how they expected it or that it wasnt like the older X: Games, i'd say read them BUT also take them with a pinch of salt, the games been out a while since then and it has improved quite a lot from what i had been reading about it.\n\nStrange thing is i was going to buy it about a year ago but was put off by the Bad Reviews, How i wished i had brought into it back then, then again that said, i wouldnt have also gotten it at the deal i did either recently.\n\nThe game has significantly gotten better from what i can see and read, from the train wreck of the apparent release of it.\n\nAnyways this is my review and score :\n8/10\n\nCheers\nmark117h","August 4, 2015","true","42.9"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","14","25","0","0"

It will make you want more\nup to this point.\n-Two)Playing the earlier games will give you an appreciation of\nwhat may become.\n-Three)Rebirth is very different to the others. It is more\npicturesque. It Makes the earlier games graphics seem dated\nIts one of the most stunning, graphicly, space sims I have played.\nI have a few.\n\nPROS:\n-X-Rebirth is beautiful. (full stop) the burning sides of capital ships\nas pound laser into them. The wondrous asteroid fields to drift in.\n-Nice sound tracks\n-Piloting in and around the space stations with little rewards for\nsimply exploring is refreshing and fun.\n-Its a great space sim.\n\nCONS:\n-You have to compare it to its predecessors and it lacks any to\nall the depth of game play, variety in ships and items and freedom of\nthe early games. It seems a very pretty but empty shell in\nthe face of its foundations.\n-If you had never seen the earlier games X-rebirth would make you\nvery satisfied but the wonderful story and history of the X-universe\nis what makes it rich as a universe. You will end up playing the earlier\ngames and wonder what happened.\n\nSo. Again the first things first, and dont be in a hurry, its a big universe\nan X-universe. I hope that helps.\n\n\nI will now rant to add detail.\nI must say I have in the first play of the Rebirth\nexperienced many bugs and issues. Freezers, crashes, lost ships...\n(Thats fixed now)\nBut..\nI kept going, the past 'X' incarnations had bought\nme far to much to joy and inspiration. I really can\nnot discribe how much I enjoyed all the 'X'-universe series.\nThe only word that comes to mind is devotion! I even have the novel\nIts really good!\n\nEven more devotion was obvious from the developers of 'X'\nto innovation, originality, fun, real progression and all the detail that no other games\ndeared to have. My experiences of the X-Universe are breath taking.\n\nFor the memories and mutual devotion I pushed on and would not\ngive up on 'X' rebirth'. Playing saving and waiting for\nthe inevitable freeze. I had to find the fun for two main reasons.\nIt was worth looking for.\n\nFirstly I trust EgoSoft and our wider community to over\ntime fix and improve.\nIt is in a lot of ways the proof of progress and courage to change.\nA vision of the future.\nI entrusted in the egosoft developer community with hours or near\nyears of my escapist time, to thier creativity and hard work.\nI believe it was time well spent and many out there would be happy to play\nX-Rebirth in the same way.\n\nSecondly I started to take a lot more notice\nof what was there in the game rather than\nwhat wasn't there.\n\nI had thought if this was my c64 and the\ndata set had just stop squeaking to reveal\nX-rebirth on the screen, I would have wept\nat the beautiful art work that is stunningly\nstylized, music, physics and the collective ambiance\nis like awaking from one dream in to a better one.\nThis is a beautiful game. But just a baby\nnew born, reborn.\n\nI had been pretending that I am\ntraveling in a damaged ship that has lots\nof issues and its system crash a bit.\nLike a game freeze is life support power loss\ndead in space again.\nWhich seemed fine because its an old ship?!\n\nFor the first time I / We are not alone. Theres the co-pilot\nwhich for me seems awesome. To be in a\nvirtual way sharing the journey which will be\nepic and should be shared. I really like the co-pilot feature!\n\nSo. The x-universe has been reborn, this is 'Elite' on your 64\nbidding to grow up to be fronter then beyond and beyond some more. The cycle\nis starting again better bigger.\nWe are here to help it watch and guide its growth. A bit of trust and\ninvestment and the rewards will be there. Give X-Rebirth a chance\n\nX-Rebirth, I like it. But cant wait for whats to come.\nHow about you?\nRegards,\nNathan","November 18, 2014","true","27.7"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

The basic gameplay centers around completing various missions for pay and reputation with different factions. Inbetween these, you manage your other assets, including myriad capital ships, freighters, mining vessels, and space stations.\n\nCombat sends you against marauding fighter bands and massive carriers, hostile space stations and shoals of drones. Shield energy powers your boosters, meaning the player must choose when to fight and when to run, and guessing wrong with leave them naked and stranded under fire. Enemy fighters dogfight with the player and each other. Huge capital ships can wreak havoc, but their engines, turrets, and shield projectors are vulnerable to damage. The weak AI is an issue, and larger targets can seem rather bullet-spongey for a player with few resources. Still, disabling and capturing that troublesome destroyer near your new factory is very satisfying.\n\nOn the economic side of things, the Great Material Continuum flows like a river from station to staion in the form mass traffic, cargo vessels, and large frieghters. And it is constantly under attack from pirates and other hostile forces. This means there are plenty of opportunities for would-be tycoons. Materials must be mined. Food must be grown. Parts must be manufactured. Freight must be transported. Ships but be built and supplied. Stations must be constructed and defended. And everything needs staffing. It's a lot of fun to plan out your installation and manage its construction and operation. Oddly moreso when you've screwed up something and have to rework everything on the fly.\n\nWhile I recommend the X Rebirth, it's certainly not for everyone. It's a trainset of a game, crossing into simulation territory just enough to be intellectually stimulating, while still providing the visceral thrill of arcade space combat. It's a casual-friendly game that lets you dip your toes into the deep end of the pool.\n\nHappily Youtube has come to the rescue of the scrutinous. Mylo-s did a fairly thorough playthrough of the gameplay mechanics. While there are some plot spoilers, the plot itself is just an overgrown gameplay tutorial.","June 3, 2015","true","430.6"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","0"

Egosoft fixed a lot of bugs and its finaly good enougth to play and you wont have any more problems, I promise !\n\nI pre-ordered the collectors edition, on release date I skipped school just to play it from the first moment. After the installation I sat down with my can of redbull and chips, I was hyped to Albion and back, I was so ♥♥♥♥ing hyped, I was the hypetrain itself. BUT after the first 2 hours of gameplay I just sat infront of my PC, tears in my eyes, clinching my teath. My body was shakeing, I was angry, so angry. You had failed me Egosoft, I spend hours of my life playing your games, I played X: Reunion around 800 hours and X: Albion prelude around 500. I was so disapointed, you failed me, YOU *UCKIN FAILED ME !\n\nI didnt touch the game, or just rarely when they released new updates...but after some time it came to my mind that you, dear Egosoft, builded a new game from scratch. You left the old X behind, you made something truely new, something unique, something fantastic... after this reaisation I wasnt mad anymore... you build a new game from scratch, with a new engine, with a new AI and with new graphics/ships/stations, it took a lot of work, a lot of willpower and a lot of blood to create the basics...but you did it. It wasnt finished, but it does not have to be. You Egosoft, you care about your games, and this is what came back in my mind. The first X3: Reunion build was buggy as hell, the skripts didnt work the halft time and ships constantly crashing in my stations and jumpgates...but you fixed a lot in the first months/years...\n\nAND you did the same with X: Rebirth...after a year its finaly that what it should be, a masterpiece...and I know there is much more to come, because Egosoft, you CARE about your games and I just can tell every player/owner, buy/play this game, it is worth it. Its playable, dont listen to the people who are trying to badmouth it. X:Rebirth is complex, its difficult to programm and you should give it a try. Its good money and you spend, I know but its worth every penny, because Egosoft gives you free DLCs and Patches, Fixes and content for the next years.\n\n\nNow to the game:\n\nGameplay:\n\nMassive changes to trade/build/fight/explore-content, you only own a single ship now, the Albions Pride/Skunk. Many people see this as a downside but I like it. You can change it to your likeing (new engines, cockpit, weapons, etc.).\nAlso tradeing and building got more time consuming and rewarding, because you realy feel like you have archived something. Missions realy pay out now, not the crappy 20k for fighting fregatts or whole fleets, now you can easily earn millions with one misson (it will be a difficult one, but fun) so yes...overall a little bit more difficult.\n\nAI:\n\nMeh, there's still room for improvement, but thats normal. You have nice fights but you mostly will get beaten because of the mass of the enemys fleet.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nA.W.E.S.O.M. 'nougth said !\n\nGraphics:\n\nWAY better than "X3: XXXXXX"s Graphics. Nice improvements - still its hardwareconsuming, so watch out. Maybe Egosoft will reduce it in some more patches.\n\n\nFazit: solid 8.5/10 from the current phase, maybe a 9 for the free DLC, thx for that :D","December 23, 2014","true","104.9"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","1"

I sit looking at the screen thinking “now what?” Put the bugs and performance issues to one side for now (I am reasonably confident they will be dealt with), this game appears to have nothing in store but tedium now the plot guidance has disappeared.\n\nI need to make money in order to progress. The prospect of either long range scanning, or constantly flying around huge stations to try and get missions or establish what is for sale/wanted fills me with despair. Especially as I have yet been able to establish how I get my freighters to refuel. Is the only way to do this be by ordering them to buy something then telling them to buy fuel first when they tell me they have no fuel? (that has yet to work BTW). I have the trading software and even though I have traversed from the end of the plot to Far Out, I bring up the trading menu and there seems to be little that I can buy, what little that is available I cannot sell as I am an enemy to most of the stations that require the wares (PMC). What am I progressing to? Is my purpose solely to get the economy going? Can you order a cap ship to attack something?\n\nThat station I built, due to bugs and not being able to find freighters that held the required materials for building the various sections, was mostly completed by hacking the save. It has yet to produce a single item for sale. Modular station design seems to be a good idea, only being able to select and build one module at a time seems bizarre. Especially when I cannot seem to be able to contact the architect remotely (I can’t even comm the captain and ask them to go and get the architect). Backwards and forwards again and again, why would I do that for more than the required station? Please tell me that it is different for a construction ship that isn’t part of the plot.\n\nI have mixed feelings regarding the use of shield energy to boost speed, if I knew how many enemy ships were close, trying to kill me and what type of ship they were it would be a good idea (I can make a judgement call and run if need be).  But as I can only see red triangles at the edge of the screen I do not have enough information to know when to run.\n\n“Shut up Betty” was funny the first time. The highway mini game was was fun the first few times. Hacking while your co-pilot seems happy to let the ship get blown to pieces is ridiculous. Hacking in general is ridiculous once you throw the mini game into the equation along with some hacking points being many km’s apart. I am not going to comment on the small talk mini game. A mod has put paid to “shut up Betty”, I refuse to play the highway mini game anymore and I had no choice with hacking.\n\nClusters are too small, the distance between them is too large and I am loathe to jump out of a highway on the off chance that there may be something interesting.\n\nWriting this wall of text has allowed me to determine what is wrong, in my mind, with the game. All of the fun, mystery and potential sense of achievement has been removed. I don’t want to micro manage on a face to face basis. The saddest part is that now I have finished the plot I don’t know if I want to fire the game up again.\n\nMaybe the complete lack of any useful game information (how to, what is, why does etc.) is keeping me from the best gaming experience of my life. I may never find out.","November 20, 2013","false","104.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kabacus/recommended/2870/","kabacus","Kabacus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kabacus/","596 products in account","I have finished the plot and have 65 game hours on the clock. I sit looking at the screen thinking “now what?” Put the bugs and performance issues to one side for now (I am reasonably confident they will be dealt with), this game appears to have nothing in store but tedium now the plot guidance has disappeared.\n\nI need to make money in order to progress. The prospect of either long range scanning, or constantly flying around huge stations to try and get missions or establish what is for sale/wanted fills me with despair. Especially as I have yet been able to establish how I get my freighters to refuel. Is the only way to do this be by ordering them to buy something then telling them to buy fuel first when they tell me they have no fuel? (that has yet to work BTW). I have the trading software and even though I have traversed from the end of the plot to Far Out, I bring up the trading menu and there seems to be little that I can buy, what little that is available I cannot sell as I am an enemy to most of the stations that require the wares (PMC). What am I progressing to? Is my purpose solely to get the economy going? Can you order a cap ship to attack something?\n\nThat station I built, due to bugs and not being able to find freighters that held the required materials for building the various sections, was mostly completed by hacking the save. It has yet to produce a single item for sale. Modular station design seems to be a good idea, only being able to select and build one module at a time seems bizarre. Especially when I cannot seem to be able to contact the architect remotely (I can’t even comm the captain and ask them to go and get the architect). Backwards and forwards again and again, why would I do that for more than the required station? Please tell me that it is different for a construction ship that isn’t part of the plot.\n\nI have mixed feelings regarding the use of shield energy to boost speed, if I knew how many enemy ships were close, trying to kill me and what type of ship they were it would be a good idea (I can make a judgement call and run if need be).  But as I can only see red triangles at the edge of the screen I do not have enough information to know when to run.\n\n“Shut up Betty” was funny the first time. The highway mini game was was fun the first few times. Hacking while your co-pilot seems happy to let the ship get blown to pieces is ridiculous. Hacking in general is ridiculous once you throw the mini game into the equation along with some hacking points being many km’s apart. I am not going to comment on the small talk mini game. A mod has put paid to “shut up Betty”, I refuse to play the highway mini game anymore and I had no choice with hacking.\n\nClusters are too small, the distance between them is too large and I am loathe to jump out of a highway on the off chance that there may be something interesting.\n\nWriting this wall of text has allowed me to determine what is wrong, in my mind, with the game. All of the fun, mystery and potential sense of achievement has been removed. I don’t want to micro manage on a face to face basis. The saddest part is that now I have finished the plot I don’t know if I want to fire the game up again.\n\nMaybe the complete lack of any useful game information (how to, what is, why does etc.) is keeping me from the best gaming experience of my life. I may never find out.","November 20, 2013","false","104.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","10"

Firslty, it is very clear that this game was not finished at release.  I've been waiting until around a few days ago to give it a try.  Egosoft has still not come through with the patches they promised.  The trading is completly bugged and if one thing is done wrong it flat out does not work.  The navigation system is not only confusing and buggy but is near impossible to find the information you need/want to know.  Combat can be fun at times.  It feels a little slow to pace and from time to time you simply explode for no reason.  The game has a good look to it but the cockpit feels completly worthless and has almost no value as far as mechanic.  And lastly, not only do you have to leave the cockpit to talk to your crew but the ship only has one room on it.  Somehow with one room (that has nothing functional in it) can fit you, your co-pilot, an engineer, eight marines, and a marine captain on it.  It has a few very cool festures like how to scan for long range.  the station landing feels very dry and unpolished as well as the fact that your ship can be attacked while you are docked and can plainly see it on the landing pad.  The game feels like it was the test system the quickly slapped some polish on and said "That's good enough, right?"  All in all, I wouldn't recomend this game to anyone until Egosoft fixes most, if not all of the problems with it.  Personally, I feel that I have been scammed by Egosoft and they should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this game.","February 23, 2014","false","69.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Firslty, it is very clear that this game was not finished at release.  I've been waiting until around a few days ago to give it a try.  Egosoft has still not come through with the patches they promised.  The trading is completly bugged and if one thing is done wrong it flat out does not work.  The navigation system is not only confusing and buggy but is near impossible to find the information you need/want to know.  Combat can be fun at times.  It feels a little slow to pace and from time to time you simply explode for no reason.  The game has a good look to it but the cockpit feels completly worthless and has almost no value as far as mechanic.  And lastly, not only do you have to leave the cockpit to talk to your crew but the ship only has one room on it.  Somehow with one room (that has nothing functional in it) can fit you, your co-pilot, an engineer, eight marines, and a marine captain on it.  It has a few very cool festures like how to scan for long range.  the station landing feels very dry and unpolished as well as the fact that your ship can be attacked while you are docked and can plainly see it on the landing pad.  The game feels like it was the test system the quickly slapped some polish on and said "That's good enough, right?"  All in all, I wouldn't recomend this game to anyone until Egosoft fixes most, if not all of the problems with it.  Personally, I feel that I have been scammed by Egosoft and they should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this game.","February 23, 2014","false","69.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm a big fan of X3, and was so looking forward to this addition to series.  I just wished I would have waited until it was on a steam discount deal before I purchased it.  Game performance is verry slow, even on the lowest settings.  I'm able to run games such as Skyrum, Bioshock, Warthunder, all on extream graphics settings with no problems, and adiquit frame rates.  But X Rebirth is very choppy at the lowest settings.  Not sure what kind of graphics engine they are using, but it's horible!  And the bugs are to numerous to count, hell there is a bug that just teleports you out into the middle of no where?!\n\nNow, with that being said, I will give the programmers credit, they have been comming out with patches on a regular bassis (almost weekly) in an attempt to do damage control, they have made some minor improvements to FPS problems, so there is hope for X Rebirth yet.  So I would recommend that you not purchase this title at this time, give it about a year, wait for it to be on a Steam daily deal, get it at a reduced price, by then hopefully they will have most if not all of the bugs fixed.\n\nSo for now, I'm not going to recommend this game, hopefully I can change my recommendation at a later date.
