I´ve had a lot of fun with the characteres names and powers. It´s not that easy to unlock the last worlds. I only wish I could play multiplayer or had something to compare my records like a ranking. I would recomend this game to take a break between other major and sometimes serious games.","May 10","true","4.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"
