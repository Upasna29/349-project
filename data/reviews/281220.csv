Not owning any consoles and being a PC gamer I thought I would never get the chance to play the next installment in the Bloodrayne series. So when I logged into Steam today and saw Bloodrayne: Betrayal had finally made it's way to PC at last, it was an instant purchase and I could not be more satisfied. This game is simply fantastic.\n\nThe art style is phenomenal and the soundtrack is perfect for the relentless action going down on screen as you mutiliate everything in sight. The game looks beautiful and runs flawlessly without a hiccup. I highly recommend the Xbox 360 controller which also works and performs flawlessly as expected. I think it would be a very difficult game to play with keyboard and mouse and have not even attempted such myself.\n\nThe controls themselves are pretty simplistic but seem to have a fair amount of depth to the different special moves and combos that you can perform. The game heavily encourages you to be stylistic and flawless in your execution with a grade scale for each level. It does not pull any punches and will force you to perfect your vampire slaying art, especially in the later stages. Nailing a fluid combination while dodging enemy attacks and dismembering and feeding on every enemy in sight is a thrill to see play out in perfect, gory animated detail.\n\nRayne looks as sexy and deadly as ever and with Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and solid performance, this appears to be a fantastic PC port of the console version. If you're a fan of 2D side scrolling hack 'n slash-beat 'em ups, Bloodrayne or both, you definitely do not want to miss this game. It's quite possibly the best Bloodrayne game yet and that's coming from a huge fan of the original two Bloodrayne games.\n\nSimply put, this game kicks ♥♥♥! Then cuts off it's limbs and sucks the blood out of the remaining torso before carelessly tossing it aside to move onto the next victim. Rayne herself would be proud. Highly Recommended!","April 30, 2014","true","11.3"," 69 of 80 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","69","80","2","0"

It's a huge departure from it's original series, but for all the right reasons. The action is precise, responsive, and deep. You can button mash, but it will only take you so far. At a certain point of the game, it becomes a lot more demanding, and knowing your move set properly will be required. The game looks gorgeous, and the soundtrack compliment the action. A strong entry to the brawler genre.\n\nPositives:\n- Fast, responsive combat.\n- Unique "all offense" mechanics.\n- Very good looking.\n- Great soundtrack.\n- Explodes with badassery.\n\nNegatives:\n- The menu looks generic.\n- Might be too hard for some.","May 2, 2014","true","4.8"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","43","55","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/281220/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","With 3 video games and 3 movie tie-ins, BloodRayne is an unusual franchise in that it's recognizable without ever really meeting huge success. Set during World War II, it's sort of a grind house film of a game, where a sexualized half-vampire clad in skimpy leather kills Nazis and monsters. It's been a while since we've seen a new BloodRayne game, and for a while, it looked like the franchise might have gone to an early grave. WayForward, developer of fantastic titles like Shantae and Contra 4, were put in charge of reviving the franchise with the PSN and XBLA title, BloodRayne: Betrayal. The result is a game that is not only the best in the franchise, but also a fantastic platformer and action game in its own right.\n\nThe plot in BloodRayne: Betrayal is so light that you don't need to know anything about the BloodRayne universe to play and enjoy the game. Players are cast as Rayne, a half-human and half-vampire mercenary for hire. Betrayal focuses on her being hired to assault the castle of a vampire lord — who also happens to be her father. There aren't a lot of twists and turns here. Rayne is a very straightforward character, and you hardly see anyone human over the course of the game. It's more reminiscent of an old-school NES title than anything modern that's laden with cut scenes. This works in the game's favor, as it can be silly, campy and incredibly enjoyable without being bogged down in the characters or plot.\n\nCombat is built around Rayne's twin blades and they are the only weapons you'll need. The combat system is simple but is surprisingly deep. While Rayne doesn't have a huge selection of attacks, each has a purpose. The default combo is fast and damaging. Adding an extra press to that causes Rayne to kick the enemy at a foe. Using different directions can allow Rayne to knock enemies at one another, sweep them off their feet to stun them, knock them into the air for longer combos or even bounce off them to remain in the air longer. There is no such thing as a useless move in Betrayal, and figuring out where to use which attack is a big part of combat. Defense, on the other hand, is relegated to a single move. Rayne has a dash move, which scoots her across the screen and renders her pretty much invincible for the duration. Use it wisely, and you can go through most enemy attacks. Time it poorly, and Rayne can be stunned by an attack and pounded into the ground.\n\nRayne is half-vampire, and with that comes the vampiric ability to suck blood. This is one of the more unique combat options at your disposal. As long as enemies are alive, Rayne can suck their blood. You do this by stunning an enemy with an attack and then tapping the Circle button. This is where things get interesting. Holding down the button lets Rayne suck the enemy's blood, instantly killing them and refilling some of Rayne's health. It's worth a minimal amount of points, though. On the other hand, tapping the button causes Rayne to bite but not kill the enemy. This "infects" them, represented by the foes turning a sickly shade of green. The next time Rayne taunts, the enemy explodes like a bomb. This does massive damage to anything nearby and can even trigger a chain reaction of explosions.\n\nIn addition to your swords and vampiric bite, you also have access to a couple of guns. By default, you have the Magnum, which has powerful shots that penetrate every enemy between you and the edge of the screen. This is balanced by the Magnum's limited ammo; you have five shots, and you're drained until enemies randomly drop more rounds. It's an incredibly effective crowd-clearing weapon, but you have to use it in the right place. Midway through the game, you get the Sun Gun, which is mostly a tool to solve puzzles but can also be used in combat. The Sun Gun has infinite ammo and fires a concentrated burst of solar energy at the target, like a sun-powered laser beam. If you hold the laser on enemies long enough, they'll heat up and explode. It's a tough weapon to use in combat, but it is better than nothing if you've exhausted your Magnum rounds. If you're careful, the Sun Gun can be used to hit certain tough-to-attack enemies.\n\nBloodRayne: Betrayal has a pretty disappointing lack of variety when it comes to enemies. For the bulk of the game, you fight the same two enemy types over and over again. Occasionally, one of a handful of others will be thrown in, but can usually be taken down in one hit as long as you're close. As the game progresses, you encounter a few new types of enemies, but even they get repeated again and again. The combat system is fun enough that it isn't too frustrating to repeatedly fight the same guys, but some diversity would have been welcome.\n\nWhile BloodRayne: Betrayal doesn't have a lot in the way of enemy variety, it makes up for it by having a bunch of different backdrops. Pretty much every other battle takes place in an arena with a different gimmick. You may be fight above a volatile pool of acid, while lasers shoot at you, fight in darkness with only enemy silhouettes to guide you, or fight entirely in mid-air over a bottomless pit. The fights are fast, frantic and interesting despite the limited variation in enemies because you have to learn how to best utilize the arena. You get more points for knocking enemies into traps or environmental hazards than you do by just stabbing them.\n\nFor the most part, the platforming is fair and fun. It's difficult but never feels cheap. You have to be fast and precise to make it across the acid pools, spike traps and bottomless pits that line the castle. It's reminiscent of a more smoothly controlled Castlevania game. There are times when it can feel more frustrating than fun, and even at the best of times, the game expects a lot from the players.The game is pretty lenient when it comes to death, so you'll simply respawn at the last blood fountain that you passed.\n\nThere is another style of gameplay, but it only appears briefly. At a certain point in the game, Rayne gets the ability to transform into a raven. In raven form, she can fly freely, knock enemies around with a supersonic caw and get through small passages. These areas focus on flying and dodging deadly obstacles. While these segments are fun, they feel a little forced and out of place, as they don't mesh with the rest of the gameplay. Areas where you use the raven form are basically worthless for her human form, and areas where her human form shines tend to have traps that disable the raven form. Compared to similar transformations in games like Castlevania, it feels too divorced from the main gameplay to feel natural.\n\nBloodRayne: Betrayal is an absolutely fantastic-looking game. WayForward's usual high-quality sprites are present, and every bit of animation is stunning. Rayne's movements are fluid, and she attacks with a fantastic grace. The enemies are large, disgusting and have a surprising amount of detail. Some of the environments are used in extremely clever ways. There are a few really cool sequences that take place in total darkness, using the light of the moon or a small fire to turn the on-screen characters into silhouettes. The music is quite good, with fast pulse-pounding tunes setting the tone of the levels.\n\nBloodRayne: Betrayal is one of the most enjoyable platformers I've played in a long time. Even if you didn't enjoy the previous BloodRayne titles, there is a lot to like here. There are a few minor complaints, but the high quality of the rest of the game more than compensates for it. The high difficulty level and relative lack of replay value prevent this title from being a must-have. It plays smoothly, looks fantastic and offers enough challenge for the most seasoned gamer, but it's still forgiving enough that casual players can muddle through it.","November 27, 2015","true","11.2"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","35","44","3","0"

I could not wait to play, and enjoyed the first half of the game.\n\nNow for the bad. The game eats inputs. For a platforming game that eats your jump inputs when holding right half the time is unacceptable and becomes completely unplayable towards the end of the game when timing multiple jumps becomes necessary to complete the level. For the first half missing a jump isnt the end of the world, but still can be frustrating.\n\nSecond major issue is hitbox detection. Getting hit by things not touching your characters image, being able to stand half into spinning saws without being hurt, falling through platforms that you jump on, or even taking spike damage from the top edge of the platform, but not the spike part you can jump off of...\n\nThird some of the abilities/moves not intuitive. The game also does not say a controller is recommended. I would argue its STRONGLY recommended. I may purchase on psn to see if using a controller solves this.  Now doing a high jump involves running, releasing ALL keys, then pushing jump, but only if Rayne is sliding, if she just comes to a stop she will only do a regular jump. This mechanic is balls.\n\nLastly, I love the concept, music and its fun once you get used to the controls even on keyboard. It pains me to not recommend the game, but with the game eating your jump command, and it being necessary to do many timed jumps in succession to complete some levels, I just cant in good faith tell people to pay money for this. If they patch the game I could see this being a thumbs up, 9/10 or 10/10 Please buy now review.","June 28, 2014","false","20.9"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

The game plays like a budget Castlevania, which sounds great as a concept, but the unbelievably stiff controls keep me from saying the game is "good".  Every movement and attack feels stilted and slippery, and as the game throws more and more death traps at you it's not something you adapt to; it's just bad.   It's certainly a challenge, but it's much more a test of patience and willingness to put up with frustration than a test of skill or memorization.  The soundtrack is pure generic butt rock that's just cheesy enough to be enjoyable, though it could use a few more tracks.  Overall Bloodrayne Betrayal is forgettable aside from the fact that I somehow powered my way through it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilis/recommended/281220/","epilis","epilis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilis/","305 products in account","This is a 2D sidescrolling game that can be compared to Castlevania 1/3 on the NES. A controller is highly suggested for this.\n\nThis seems to be a perfect port from consoles as I own it on PS3 and have beaten it several times. I was very glad they brought it to Steam. It's nice to see the game up close and that's always enjoyable. The controls for this game may not seem responsive, but they are. It's not like Strider where you can press attack repeatedly and get results. Think of it more like the response of controlling a character from a fighting game. You'll have to learn the difference on how to execute a toe-tap vs a down-stomp after jumping. Once you launch an enemy in to the air, you can either jump up and pound on them, or you can send them flying. You have all the basic moves from the beginning, so you won't have to worry about learning them as you progress. There are, however, a couple of powers you do acquire later on in the game.\n\nI've seen a couple reviews for this game on major gaming sites and they are overly harsh. This stems mostly from complaining about the difficulty. I can tell you right now that this isn't anywhere near as difficult as a lot of other games out there. At the same time, I can say that it'll only be easier while being enjoyable if you learn how to properly control BloodRayne.\n\nThe graphic style goes perfect with this game. The music is superb. The brain behind the music is Jake Kaufman. I highly recommend you google for him. The options screen has just about enough video options due to this being a 2D game. You only have resolution size, windowed/borderless/full screen, and vsync.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of 2D side scrolling games.","May 1, 2014","true","6.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simonm7/recommended/281220/","simonm7","SimonM7","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simonm7/","332 products in account","If I made a list of things I think constitute bad video game controls, almost everything about BloodRayne Betrayal's controls would be on it. Confronted with every option of doing something to make the game flowing and fun, or making it feel numb and clunky, they seem to have opted for the latter.\n\nIt doesn't matter starting out. The game is gorgeous and has a modestly budgeted feel that makes it quite easy to forgive and even like initially. More maneuvers are introduced before long, and although it wears thin eventually, you have a decent amount of combat options to mix things up and express yourself with that stuff.\n\nBut when they take what is a fairly functional 2D brawler and apply it to platforming sections, it just turns into a miserable experience. Not miserable because it's impossible - it's not - miserable because there's absolutely nothing fun or stimulating about the arbitrary gameplay segments they force on you. They are just a chore. If you simply describe those sections to somebody - that you're asked to bounce on enemies to keep afloat while fighting other enemies - it sounds challenging and fun because you imagine that the controls are suitably responsive, but boy they sure aren't.\n\nTruth is I really wanted to like this. It looks really, really cool and it's a fun and clever use of the license. There are plenty of moments when it's easy enough to gloss over its issues and enjoy, but when you first pick it up, the game immediately feels less snappy and responsive than you want a game like this to feel, and before it's over it asks you to perform precision movement that make its shortcomings impossible to ignore.","April 17","false","4.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/281220/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Far away from the teenage romance novels and goofy Dracula renditions that have come to be associated with vampires, Bloodrayne explores a darker take on the age old monsters, its titular femme fatale being something of a female counterpart to Van Helsing out to rid the world of the demons that threaten to destroy it. Betrayal from WayForward acts as a departure from prior games in the series and stands as a rather polarizing title from every angle; as instantly dismissible as it is alluring.\n\nI won’t get into any story details because it’s entirely forgettable and even the little emphasis placed on it is more than it deserves, but in essence you are Rayne called in to deal with a demon infestation that’s been terrorizing the local towns people. That’s about all the story I needed and could have done without the melodramatic text bubbles, but as it stands it allows for a lot of people to die by your hand, which is ultimately the entire point of the game.\n\nBetrayal is structured like a typical side scrolling brawler. You move from screen to screen clearing out hoards of monsters, taking part in occasional platforming segments or a larger than life boss fight. You have a modest but well rounded collection of moves, with nice touches like sucking blood from enemies to restore health or Rayne’s trademark pistol add a nice amount of personality to the otherwise routine fights.\n\nOn paper, Betrayal has everything in place for an excellent brawler, but when you actually get your hands on it it’s immediately clear that a lot has gone wrong in the translation to an actual game. Most unforgivable, WayForward commits a cardinal sin by constantly locking your character into animations. What this means in practice is combat feels slow and unresponsive, causing you to continually fail because it’s impossible to dodge mid-attack, and getting knocked down leaves you open for more attacks as you’re entirely helpless for a handful of seconds before you pick yourself back up (which as you can imagine creates a circle of falling down and getting kicked to death with no retaliation possible).\n\nEven when you aren’t trapped in a string of animations, controlling Rayne is excessively clunky and unintuitive. Moves require precise inputs to execute, but these are commonly misread or ignored making anything beyond a basic attack unpredictable and more dangerous to attempt with a constant swarm of enemies around you than it’s worth.\n\nWhat I’m getting at with all of this is Betrayal is a frustrating game; a VERY frustrating game, and one that shouldn’t be anywhere near as difficult as it is. It’s a contrived challenge, the combined result of poor controls, animation lockouts, and checkpoints that are placed almost intentionally to cause you to quit from having to replay huge chunks of a level each time you die (which will be often). It starts off hard and by the end raises the bar to an outrageous degree, to where I was gritting my teeth and praying I’d get through it so the game would finally end.\n\nI wanted to love Betrayal, and for all its flaws I don’t regret playing it and even enjoyed portions of it a great deal, but any recommendation I could give it comes with so many connotations that I find it hard to say with any sincerity that it’s something you should spend your time with. Aside from its slick, hard drawn art style that looks absolutely stunning (especially in the dark, when all you can see are silhouettes against the background), it stumbles all the way from the start and had me questioning if it was really worth continuing with.  In the end, I’m still not sure of my answer.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 27, 2014","false","4.3"," 73 of 124 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","73","124","0","6"

With a new developer at the helm, how does a 2D/anime/Arcade rendition fare?\n\nIt fares as much as you would expect.\n\nStory...what story? I don't know, a couple of cutscenes with some soldiers and a guy trying to be some mysterious swoon bait that is really a bird...evil guy trying to take over the world and I think there may be a betrayal or two throw in for legal purposes. Honestly, the story is just there to drive the game and place you in the levels. I had little care on how the story progressed.\n\nFor the real (bloody) meat, we have the gameplay. Hack N' Slash that involves slight button mash, slight skill, and slight memorization. You have a blade attack that you can push to do simple combos, a jump, a shoot button, a dodge, a grab (bite) ability, and finally a button solely dedicated to making people explode. You can send opponents into the air, juggle them around  cut them to pieces and suck their blood for health. Following up on that last bit about the explode button, yes you can bite a blood filled enemy to make them poisoned with explosive fluids. If you push the explode button then any poisoned baddie will ...\n\n*spoilers*\n\n\nExplode.\n\nMost evil dudes follow the general same pattern: Try to get close and do a melee move, or use a simple ranged attack to knock Rayne off her guard. Almost all encounters can be bum rushed with little to no consequence. The dodge ability is where the skill comes in as with precise timing, Rayne will negate all damage done to her. There are a few bosses thrown in and all of them are actually pretty unique and fun in their own way. Finally your magnum is Rayne's trump card which decimates enemies. Most will be knocked down and killed in 2 shots and even the most toughest foes will go after 4+ shots. This leads to the upgrade system.\n\nIn each level you can find hidden skulls that when you collect enough allows you to upgrade your health or ammo. What I like about the upgrade system is you may find the game hard so you think health is the obvious choice, but later you will realize just how crucial an extra bullet can be. Considering most skulls are out of the way and dangerous to get, makes you decide which ones are worth searching for and which can be left behind. Without the upgrade system, this game would have fell flat.\n\nI do have to discuss a really sore spot in the game however: Obligatory platforming\n\nThink a dash of Super Meat Boy, only simplified and not with tight controls. Also if you slip up you may go back a couple of fights or annoying sections as opposed to just retrying from 20 seconds in the past. This was the worst part of the game and at one point I got close to leaving this game for dust. I am glad I continued but it is not too far away to say that the platforming can make players uninstall the game.\n\nAlways easy to go on and on but I'll end with replayabliity. You get graded (very strictly) for each level. Grading exclusively depends on how much health you lost, the time it took to beat the stage, hidden treasures found and how stylish you were in combat with the latter having the least impact. The grading is very unforgiving and on a normal playthrough you'll most likely see F grades across the board. Trying to get S ranks on all the levels may quite possibly be one of the toughest challenges to achieve in a game...good luck if you decide to go on that masochistic endeavor. I beat the game, looking for secrets and replaying a few levels to gather more skulls/up my grade finishing with about 5 hours of playtime.\n\nIf you can't get enough Blood Rayne or you want an old school 2D hack n slash then give this game a try. It's hard to recommend at the asking price of $10 but at $5 or less it is worthwhile!","March 4, 2015","true","5.6"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","17","26","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpageable/recommended/281220/","unpageable","Unpageable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpageable/","477 products in account","If you are familiar with the Bloodrayne series, then I must first warn you that it plays nothing like the previous games, an open mind is required should you decide to purchase. This is a challenging platform brawler that has 15 stages in total, not a Metroidvania with free roam. You can obtain secret skulls that can extend your life bar or bullet count, but you won’t unlock new move sets or level up.\n\nIn terms of graphics, I feel the screenshots didn’t do it much justice. While it may look like a flash game in still frames, the animation is extremely smooth and pleasant to look at. The stage backdrops are detailed and befitting in most cases, while the blood splatters never gets old. I do have some gripes on the lack of variety though, as every single enemy of the same type will look the same every time, not even a colour swap, this was just plain lazy.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the controls are fine; they just require very precise timing to pull off properly. I managed to complete the game using a keyboard, while countless speed runners did it on Youtube with various controllers. This is a case of casual gamers spoiled by handholding mechanics, blaming the controls when they just need to git gud.\n\nMusic is where this game really shined, every track was pumped full of adrenaline and atmospheric, the ending song "Cursed Dawn" was especially memorable. Sound effects are numerous but very distinctive from one another, I can perfectly tell what was happening amidst the chaos just by listening alone. The game even came with a whole set of 8-bit soundtracks as an Easter egg, so it is virtually impossible to complain in this criteria.\n\nThe only downside to this game came from the level design, which is admittedly a little repetitive. There were too many spike, acid and cannon ball traps laden across later stages; almost to the point of annoyance. The difficulty scale is mostly justified in lieu with the game’s progression, but the 13th stage was just completely evil and totally uncalled for. It got a lot of people to rage quit at that point which I can relate with. Whoever designed that stage was just sadistic.\n\nIn conclusion I feel I must recommend this title to anyone who’s up for a challenge, it is very underrated and often blamed for the wrong reasons. It may not be a canon entry to the series, but it has enough merits to stand on its own.","April 10","true","25.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

I, I rather hate it.\n\nPros:\n- Cool art style\n- Gore\n- Blood sucking\n- Enemy variety is ok\n- Boss fights are kinda cool\n\nYea. That's about it.\n\nCons:\n- No difficulty setting\n- Bad controls\n- No story\n- Boring gameplay\n- Platforming is extremely annoying\n- Not much original content\n- Insta deaths\n\nThis game is only 10 dollars, so for that price I can kinda almost recommend it, but I won't, because I feel it's an extremely lazy attempt at a video game. The start of the game feels ok, the combat is more or less enjoyable at first, but after the first few levels it gets extremely repetitive. You will be presented with quite a few different enemies over the course of the game, some of them bosses. Those fights are somewhat cool, though you can feel overwhelmed by what is going on on the screen at first. You literally only have 2 attacks. Press X for melee combos and RT for a gun shot. You have limited ammo, but there are usually enough drops. You can also bite other vampires and either suck their blood for health (which I found extremely necessary and which makes you invulnerable for the duration) or infect them and detonate them with Y. That's about all you get with the combat. You can also jump and dash through most attacks, which is also required to survive.\n\nLet's just say this game is not for casuals. I'm not bad at brawlers, but this one is just boring, because all combos are simply "press x". You can vary things up with the direction pad, but that's it. And at times you even need to to solve a "puzzle" (juggle an enemy and launch him into a grinder for example). I find it extremely boring. What's worse is that you can't dash out of a combo, meaning you mash the x button to kill enemies, but you can easily get hit by another attack, because your character does not accept the dash command while hitting someone, instead of cancelling the attack or transitioning to the dash action. Combine this with the fact that you fall to the ground when you get hit and that you can die really easily once you're on the ground since there does not seem to be any "quick get up" mechanic (or I've missed it) and you can quickly lose a battle against multiple foes.\n\nThe save points are also weirdly positioned. Often they are ok, but sometimes you have to complete a difficult fight and then complete an even more difficult platforming section or the other way around. And when you die, it's back to last checkpoint. That can be quite frustrating. That being said I am not at level 12 or 13 (of 15 I think), so you will get through sooner or later if you're not a hopeless case, but the amount of unncecessary frustration is high.\n\nPlatforming: Whoever designed the controls for this game needs to be punished. They are unprecise and the required backflip is executed by first running in one direction, quickly turning and pressing the jump button. This is infuriating throughout the game, because not only do you need some space to do this properly, you also need to judge where you will land. It is even a required mechanic during a boss fight, which can screw you over hard. You can also wall jump and dash in midair.\nLater on there is also Flappy Bird in the game. Great. Just what I was looking for.\nOh and let's not forget the poison. The ♥♥♥♥ing poison, which kills you instantly and sends you back several minutes.\n\nThe art style looks pretty at first, but it gets so boring after a while, because you're only in this one big castle, going down, then up, then down again...the setting never really changes.\n\nThe story is presented in boring chat bubbles in game...the little there is of it. Meh. Forgettable. You can't skip that ♥♥♥♥ either, so if you die at some point it can happen that you have to watch the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "cutscenes" over and over again.\n\nHow one is supposed to get a good score in the game is beyond me. It rates you at the end of the level. I have never even come close to even getting one extra point for time or health. I dunno. I'm apparently just "worm chow", yet worm chow can apparently beat the game. Meh.\n\nThere are also skulls to collect. You can upgrade health or ammo with them. Most of them I didn't even find, some I didn't try to reach, because the risk reward system is severely misjudged.\n\nConclusion: If you love Bloodrayne and 2D Brawlers and want a quick fix you may want to get this. Everyone else should stay clear...it's not expensive, but it's also not very good.","April 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 32 of 55 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","32","55","0","0"

And for some reason, it works so well to the point it might be even better than the actual BloodRayne games that came out years ago. BloodRayne Betrayal is not for the casual gamer, with its all balls-out approach to platform difficulty, you would have a frustrating time just trying to get a better score in each level and the action comes fast and hard. Very quickly, to the point that Dark Souls almost looks kind in some respect. This is truly a homage to the platform games of old like Castlevania, which seems to be the main inspiration here.\n\nThe soundtrack is lovely. There's no voice-acting but the music is exciting and really gets you pumping as you get killing through each level of the game. Graphics are nice and controls seem to work fine. Fine, but not a 100% perfect. BloodRayne looks hot, as usual and she has all kinds of ways to kill the numerous types of enemies that come her way. There's not much of a story here which probably won't do much anyway as you'll be literally killing non-stop.\n\nIf you're one for the difficult platform games of old, then this would be a good buy. If you're not the type that can withstand the frustration of getting hit and killed over and over again, then stay away at all cost. It'll take everything from your hand-eye coordination and memory of combos to get the work done.","June 26, 2014","true","2.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

They had fun over the top action, a decent storyline, and generally good graphics for their time.  BloodRayne (along with Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines) may very well be the best in this very small genre of vampire video games. I had seen the mixed reviews for BloodRayne: Betrayal on Steam and elsewhere, but being a fan of the franchise, I decided to check it out anyway.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the criticism is well-founded. The two major criticisms of the game were its controls, and its unbalanced difficulty. The controls are not as responsive as you’d expect in a 2D platformer. You’ll often find yourself positioning yourself at just the right location to suck an enemy’s blood, or finding just the right timing to execute certain basic attacks. Now about the difficulty, I’m not usually one to complain if a game is too hard. Although the game has a higher than normal level of difficulty throughout, every once in a while you’ll reach a level that is just so ridiculous, that you may question whether it’s really worth your time trying to beat it considering that the game isn’t that good in the first place anyway. These two criticisms are unfortunate, because I think that had the controls been more responsive and the difficulty more balanced this may have turned out to be a great addition to the BloodRayne series.\n\nIf you were a fan of the first two games like me, you will probably pick this up anyway in which case I’d recommend waiting for a sale. If you are new to the BloodRayne franchise, I would recommend passing on BloodRayne: Betrayal and picking up BloodRayne 1 and 2 instead.\n","May 30","false","4.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Could be caused by me for switching windows and stuff.","June 16, 2015","true","24.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The controls were awful for a side scroll beat'em up. The bosses (I only played to the second one) were just a reskin, same badguy with a weird if you fall off me you don't reach the end of this bottomless pit I just suck you up and spit you above me so you can kill feature. Yet as soon as you kill it you reach the bottom. Anyway back to the reskin, the first time I fought it I though hmm thats annoying but interesting. its added in 4 little targets I have to hit not just smash its face like everything else. The second boss they are like 2 minutes before hey use this random skill you've had but we never told you about to open this one wall. Now boss time! Same exact boss but they made it so you have to use that one pesky skill to break open its weak points, and since that would be too simple lets just throw hordes at you while you do it.\nEven that I could have lived with but the kicker of why I'll never play this again is the backflip. Apparently a double jump feature is just so over done they had to add in a backflip. Logically you just have to push a button to do it right? wrong you have to make her run one direction then quickly turn and run the other way to make her slide then hit the jump button and she will backflip. Now the first couple times its annoying but doable at the later stages when you have to do it on small platforming sections I found it near impossible to complete both on controller and keyboard.\nOh and if you want you can mario stomp enemies because your highheels will kill them, and there are sections of using that to kill your way up long drops which I found pointless especially since you had to time a attack as you landed on them rather than just let it land on them.\nThe gun I have so far I don't know about the whole game but atleast upto where I quit is a 5 shot pistol that damn near 1 shots everything in a line. While that sounds cool the ammo for it comes and goes so sometimes you can spam it other times for levels you won't find a single bullet.","January 4","false","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A fun sidescroller with new-age retro graphics that make the game look nice. It surprisingly controls really well, nice and tight. The game is a good challenge however is somewhat short. It isn't the greatest game so its short length is actually fine. For a side scroller game like this, 5-6hrs is actually pretty long. The score system is pointless. The fact that after every single level the score system tells me I scored an "F - Worm Chow" is like a April fools joke. An F on every level because i didn't combo right or kill fast enough. lol who cares. Some of the later levels have god awful checkpointing and the last boss is frustrating but I still managed to finish the game in average time.\n\nPretty good but not stellar.

My first impression of the game was that levels looked beautiful and the comic book style graphics were charming. As the game progressed I noticed that new enemies became less and less frequent and i was just mulching over the same ones over and over. The story. Well there is bascially no story. its basically just banter and pointless conversation between three characters (unless i missed something). The gameplay. In the beginning its enjoyable but as the game progresses the stages get harder and the enemy hordes get bigger. as the hordes get bigger and the stages get harder, accurate controls and staying mobile while fighting becomes neccessary. This game delivers neither. your forced to play through incredibly hard levels with irresponsive controls and a gimped combat system. to make matters worse,checkpoints become less frequent which means if you die you get sent WAYYY back.Overall this was a game I felt had alot of potential. It could have been amazing if it didnt have half-♥♥♥♥♥ controls and an actual story but instead we got this. a game that pushes your patience to the limit and truly puts your ability to stay calm to the test. i only wish i could get back the time i put into this game. if i never have to play this game again,it will be too soon.\n","September 29, 2015","false","6.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The game may seems short at first, but I'd say it's because I'm used to the kind of game it is.\nThe game has amazing 2D graphics, with a good sountrack. Rayne has some cool move like sucking ennemies blood, poisoning them to make them then explode. Some of the sequences and bosses were enjoyable (the last boss and the boss before the last one.) with learning patterns etc.\nHowever the game is highly flawed in my opinion. In the first place, the controls. The controls aren't as responsive as they should be. The moving and platforming is okay, when you fail a platform, it's your fault, but the fighting mechanics are just frustrating as hell. It's simple, you're just mashing the X button to hit the ennemies, again and again with few variations. Besides, there is no invulnerability frames when they put you down, which means, a lot of time you will be back up but will go again down because they keep hitting you while you can't do anything. With more than 4 ennemies on the screen, the fighting looks like a mess and I had almost no idea of whom I was hitting and where I was.\n\nThere are some scoring to do and some collectibles to find, so for scorer or the achievement hunter, there are some thing to  go back on. Same for the others, the game is still good enough to make you go back to it even with its flaws.","May 14, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other wise its not actually all that difficult, with the exception of some of the later levels.\n\nThe art direction and music is fairly well done; the soundtrack is fast paced with gothic and orchestral undertones, and the animation quality and level design is for the most part good.\n\nTime wise the game should take about 7-9 hours to complete, depending on how often you die. There is a considerable amount of replayability though, as there is a level rating system and collectibles.\n\nAs a Bloodrayne game there are noticible differances from the previous entries; for starters the Rayne in Betrayal has a considerably different design; she looks younger, possesses much smaller armblades and does not wear her iconic black and red leather outfit, instead wearing a predominately black gothic-inspired outfit.\nIn addition, she is missing most of her powers and equipment - She no longer has her rage move, her harpoon, her carpathian dragons, nor her signature feeding method.\nHowever, despite this Rayne still feels like Rayne; though minimal, she does have her sense of wit, she is still a tough character, and she still fights with acrobat ferocity, just like in the previous games.\n\nStory wise Betrayal has no relation to the previous games; Kagan is still alive, the Shroud never happened, there is no mention of the GGG. So if you were hoping to a resolution to BloodRayne 2's cliff hanger, you are not getting it.\nIt does introduce a new character, however he's only really there to give Rayne a new gimmicky power.\n\nFor the most part Betrayal does feel like a Bloodrayne game; there's that familiar over the top level of violence and humor and the story is gloriously ludicrous.\n\nOverall it is a well crafted 2d platformer and an adequate, albeit unorthodox entry into the BloodRayne series.\n\nHowever, I still cannot draw myself to recommend this, as Rayne's original outfit, which was featured on the very cover art of the game, is not in the game itself. I found that to the extremely misleading, and a clear attempt to pander to the franchise's fanbase.","March 22, 2015","false","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

BloodRayne: Betrayal is a platformer from Abstraction Games. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe artwork in this game was great. It had a very retro/comic book feel to it (something that really works for platformer games, in my opinion). The animations were, likewise, well done. Combat looked good and everything played out smoothly. Movement looked smooth, but there were some problems there that’ll I’ll get to in a bit.\n\nThere was a sufficient amount of gore; definitely as much as you’d want from a vampire game. Occasionally there is a Mortal Kombat-esque blood explosion, but it really adds to the whole atmosphere in it’s own charming way.\n\nThe Bad\n\nMovement is pretty clunky in BR:B. Some areas require you to perform a ridiculous backflip to access. If you knew how tedious it is to perform a backflip in this game, you’d know why that is a bad thing. Or, you can just take my word for it.\n\nSpike traps are a lot more like “let’s plaster razors on everything traps”. Barely grazing the side of a spike trap will result in a hefty amount of damage to you.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this game didn’t have much of a story line if it had one at all.\n\nThe Meh\n\nThe game itself is repetitive in several aspects. Enemy variety is limited and you’ll be fighting a lot of the same monsters over and over again in varying quantities. The music is okay at first, but it too gets old after a while. While the combat animations are pretty nice, combat will seem repetitive in a hurry as well.\n\nThe controls really aren’t all that streamlined as far as platformers go and gameplay starts to become a bore.\n\nVerdict: Nay\n\nIt’s been a few reviews since I had to give a game the thumbs down. BR:B is mediocre, at best, but, if you’re a fan of the Blood Rayne franchise, you may enjoy it.

This... is supposed to however, be a game developed by WayForward, people who have in the past impressed me greatly. If you're a fan of sidejumping in Mario games, the BloodRayne sidejump will probably mess you up a dozen or so times. If you've walljumped in Megaman X, don't worry, they expect you to do that here.\n\nRight from the get go, there is no real story given to you at all about anything, other than you're working with people who don't trust you on account of being a dhampir, and that you kill things with great prejudice. I've gotten about three levels in and there has been almost no exposition besides finding an underground castle. I had to stop when I came to a jump I don't know how the devs expected you to make. Apparently via sidejump, except I crash into spikes, and walljumping seems out the window.\n\nThe controls are just frustrating, much less so on a controller. The gameplay is very repetitive. The one boss I encountered was a mechanical crab steampunk-esque monster that just... appeared. No rhyme or reason. You're often shot while in the middle of a combo, can't shoot back fast enough to interrupt the guy pulling a gun, and while you're crouched down charging an attack or in the middle of a combo, you can still be hit. To be good at the game requires some level of devotion while not providing much of an incentive to get better or even continue playing. You get either slashy blades or a magnum. No combos to buy, no weapon upgrades several levels in, or rewards for doing well. All I had to do for the most part was just hit the attack button, only slightly deviating now and again to try and keep it interesting for myself. And if you have to change your own style of gameplay for the sole purpose of making it entertaining to yourself, you know something is wrong.","September 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The core gameplay is there and is fun, as are the graphics and sound. The game plays very similar to pre-SotN Castlevania, which is great.\n\nThe problems with the game boil down to the controls and difficulty, which are in some ways two sides of the same coin. The game is almost ruined by some of the downright unfair and cheap segments later in the game, which are made worse by the not-100%-responsive controls.\n\nThe story also leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't necessarily expecting anything that great from this game in this regard, but it ends way too abruptly and I feel the game should have at least another four or five levels of content. It's like they cut off the last quarter of this game - final boss and all. The game is also laughably short, even for a 2D platformer (I beat it in three hours on my first try at the game). This could've also been fixed with a few more levels added.\n\nOverall, this game is good, but leaves a lot to be desired. If you're just looking for something to play that reminds you of old school Castlevania, it's a thumbs up and you should try it. Anything else? Probably not so much. Maybe try it if you're bored and see it on sale.","June 4","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I honestly wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't majorly in to hack and slash games or want to play a more casual game. Since there are some annoyances which I think takes away some of the enjoyment of the game.\nFor example, the difficulty can vary greatly. At one point I was strolling through a level without having any problems with the combat or the platforming, that suddenly changed when I came to a bunch of platforms that I had to jump across, those platforms would disappear if I stayed on them for too long. If I fell down from the platforms I would end up in acid which would kill me in one hit and I would have to start over from a checkpoint. There was also missiles flying around in random patterns, as well as enemies who would throw bombs at me. Since the platforms were so small, I would fall to my death if I ended up getting hit by a missile or a bomb.\nThis required way more skill and luck than what was previously required of me. Varying difficulty can be a great thing, but I don't think it's so great when it happens in the middle of a level.\n\nThe combat itself isn't really hard, in fact it's pretty easy and the enemies only do a few types of attack with little variance. However, the game with often require you to be very precise with your actions and will also often feel unresponsive when you try and do certain actions. You get knocked to the ground extremely easy. The weakest attack will knock you down if you're mid-air. Enemies will often hit you while you're getting up from the ground, which will cause you to get knocked down again.\n\nIt is also sometimes very very hard to tell things apart, especially what's in the background and foreground. This is espeically prominent in chapter 15.\n\nBut besides that, it's a great game. It's easily worth 10€ and really enjoyable if you're able to look past those things I listed.","May 1, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Most of the elements for a great action platformer are here: Stylish art and animation, good level design, decent music...The only thing conspicuously absent from this game is actual playability. WayForward's latest addition to the BloodRayne series lets you struggle through 15 agonizing levels of clunky controls and unweildy, luck-based combat. I'd really like to meet the guy who decided that this game's stupid backflipping maneuver was a better idea than implementing a simple double-jump. It's probably the same guy who put in a completely useless dodge. Adding to my consternation is the fact that the most basic peon enemies take about a dozen hits to kill, and literally everything in this game has higher attack priority than you. So enjoy getting those flashy combos interrupted nonstop while you're trying to rack up that completely arbitrary score. Not that it particularly matters, since it seems like pressing the attack button gets the game to roll at random from a large list of offensive movements, each with different hitboxes. A truly terrible game, and not worth one second of your time or one cent of your money.","October 21, 2015","false","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Originally, I had this game for XBOX 360 Arcade. But I gave up on it because the XBOX's d-pad is too poorly designed for this game. BloodRayne requires some pretty precise movements for many of the levels, so any sort of inaccuracy is often lethal. That being said, I bought this game on Steam and played through it using a Playstation controller instead. Since the d-pad is much much better on Playstation controllers and others like it, the game was much more enjoyable. While the difficulty remained pretty high, the better controls made the game infinitely better so that I was able to actually finish the game. In short, if you like platformers, especially edgey ones, and have a controller with a good d-pad, then this game is for you indeed.","April 19, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I was well aware the gameplay was going to be drastically different in this, I just wanted to make that clear.\n\nNow while the art style is nice, the soundtrack works well enough and even the bulk of the gameplay is efficient and satisfying... there still remains a few flaws and gameplay elements I've recently grown to detest. Let's start with the actual flaws before I rant about how insecure I am.\n\n1) The platforming; it's a'ight. The problem is that it has to be uber-precise. There's some weird hit detection going on. Not with the enemies but with these spiky platforms you've gotta jump up. There are no spikes on the side and it's difficult to get a direct landing on top with the er, unconventional controls. So you end up doing a little wall graze and jumping up- well, at least you try to. Instead Rayne must jam her foot into one of the spikes as a form of self punishment for not doing it right and so you just do an old-school Ouch-that-hurt-flop on to the platform. Kinda frustrating.\n\n2) The contoller input; starts off a'ight but gets frustrating quick. The game only processes one button press at a time, meaning when you push a button you have to watch Rayne do the full animation before you do anything else. Not a madly common problem nor would it be a gamebreaker alone but it really ruins the fluidity of the gameplay and can sometimes, ironically, betray you in combat. Unless of course you know exactly how to do everything and do it well. The most frustrating thing for me was trying to feed. You have to hit someone/thing and stun them before you can feed but if if you're too close or late you have to watch Rayne grab at thin air and then get royally fisted. Also there were one or two occasions where mo'♥♥♥♥ers would basically juggle me. There doesn't seem to be a get-up attack which I think would do wonders at times.\n\nBoth of those flaws can be overcome if you're really good at the game but the fact that you have to suffer through such punishment so early on, for me, is a deep flaw in gameplay.\n\nNow most of what's stopping me play it is that other thing: ranking systems and hidden collectables!\n\nI'm hating these things more and more recently. I don't mind not so hidden collectables like the orbs in ENSLAVED or ones that just unlock extras. That's fine but but if they do nothing; pointless and if they upgrade the character it becomes a double punishment. Not being good early on can make it more difficult for you later. And some of them are not just hidden but require you to perform very specific acrobatics in order to get them. That's just a pain in the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd then you've got the ranking system... why do games like to remind everyone they're terrible? It's demoralizing. When the game calls me a cadaver and ranks me a solid F it just makes me think "well if you're gonna be like that I won't bother with you anymore". Kinda like my last relationship.\n\nNow I could easily get much further into the game than I am but I probably couldn't do it to the games high standards and so, I'll just stick to Mark of the Ninja for my animated, side-scroller hack'n'slash needs and Rayman Origins for the platforming. Get in on sale if you must, it might be right for you if the above things don't bother you much.","April 18","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/281220/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","ContextBloodrayne: Betrayal is a 2D action platformer. It has a very gothic setting and flashy combat, but is simpler than it would appear.\n\nThis game is basically Castlevania meets Helsing meets Fleshgod Apocalypse. And personally, that freaking awesome! I'm a big fan of Castlevania (older ones), and this is as close to those as you can get. Plus, it has a great, modern soundtrack, in the same vein of Castlevania's.\n\nIt's not Metroid-vania, though. Think NES Castlevanias, where you had a several levels through which you had to progress, with a few BossFights in the middle.\n\nWhen I first started, I was having a blast! However, the game doesn't add much in terms of weapon and enemy variety, and often suffered from misguided design in the later chapters. Regardless, it's certainly worth it, if you're into the genre!\n\n\nPresentationVisually, it's a strange game, quality-wise. In regards to style, I find it awesome! The characters have a bit of an anime style going for them, although it would have been cool to have gone a bit more into the over-the-top.\nStill, as I said, it reminds me a lot of Castlevania (you know, Vampires + lots of red) and Helsing. The combat style is a bit more Devil May Cry, only in 2D.\n\nAnimation\nThe character animations looks really good in combat, with some great distortion effects to simulate the blades' motions, but it looks a bit amateur when idle or just running. I'd put my finger on a certain lack of detail on those, ending up looking a bit bland. Still, you'll be fighting most of the time, and it looks great when doing so!\n\nEnvironments\nThe environments are mostly well designed, with a couple of exceptions. First, there are some textures that feel really out of place. It has a very detailed cartoon style, while the metal textures don't feel as polished. Not too bad.\nThe other problem, is how some of the walls are deceptive, leaving you in doubt whether or not they're part of the background or the foreground. It cost me a few lives. Overall, I think this could be improved a decent amount.\n\nFilters and Effects\nThis is mostly non-existant, with the exception of the last chapter. For some reason, they applied a red filter over the game, plus fire, on top of an already red game. The result is: you can't see ♥♥♥♥. Were that not enough, they also shake the screen constantly. I got some slight motion sickness because of that, and honestly, it didn't look very good. I understand what they were trying to do, but it wasn't necessary.\nThen, there are a few silhouette scenes spread throughout the game. These looks cool, but are completely unpractical, since you completely lose track of the animations (both yours and the enemies') and will often lose your character from sight. It's more of an annoyance than "hey, it looks cool!". They should have been tweaked with, but hey, not a major issue.\n\nFluids\nThere's a lot of blood in this game. And a couple of other fluids. Instead of doing these in the same cartoony and stylish way as the rest of the game, they implemented some physics. They seem well done, but feel out of place, to me. I would have prefered to have seen the blood splashes drawn instead of Worms-like physics. Oh well. Again, it's a minor thing.\n\nSound-effects\nThey're mostly effective. The main character's scream when she dies is a bit annoying. But other than that, the combat slashes sound pretty good. I'm not sure how much of it is due to the sound-effects alone, but the combat is pretty visceral and feels good.\n\nMusic\nI was excited to get to this point. The music is absolutely amazing. Do you know Jake Kaufman? Shovel Knight, Contra 4, Retro City Rampage, etc.? If not, you should. He's certainly one of my favourite modern video-game composers, and I didn't expect this to come from him at all. Usually, he simulates the NES sounds (to be played on the actual hardware) and it sounds great! However, he composed a full Symphonic Metal soundtrack with a Classical vibe to it (Fleshgod Apocalypse, minus the vocals and over-the-top drumming). And yet, there's also an NES version of it that you can unlock in-game. It's awesome! It would fit Castlevania for sure, and it's something I'll be listening on my own!\n\nThe music also changes its tone when you're near-death, providing good feedback.\n\nGeneral Structure & Basic MechanicsThere are 15 Chapters/Levels in this game. There are 4 Boss fights spread out, although they seem to have been designed in pairs (almost upgraded versions of the other). I'm okay with that, since they still had significant differences.\nYou start out with your Blade and a Gun, and later receive an additional Beam Laser. That's all, and it's unfortunate. It seems the kind of game that would have benefitted a lot from different weapons to keep the combat more engaging. Still, its was fun throughout!\n\nIn each chapter, there are skulls to collect. These are often hard to see AND hard to reach. Every 5 you collect will earn you either an HP upgrade, an Ammo upgrade, of your choosing. I like that they've put these into the game, making me explore more than I would otherwise have. But, it has a significant problem, for me -- Many of them only give you one chance to get to them, unless you restart the level. The reason for that is that many require some creative platforming, often using carefuly placed enemies to do so. However, if you accidentally kill those enemies, they don't respawn, so "bye-bye, skull".\nThe worst part of it is that you can easily kill those enemies before seeing the skull. It feels a bit cheap.\nTake into account that this problem is only significant if you want to get the achievement (or get most of the skulls because it's satisfying), and does not actually hurt the overall game.\n\nEnemy variety isn't great, but I think it's enough, for its length. There are several different enemies that require different approaches, and the encounter design usually has you face different combinations of them, so that's good!\n\nThe game also features a ranking system for each level. I ranked miserably on all of them. Part of it was due to time, the other part due to getting hit. If you do like perfecting your playthroughs, you'll certain enjoy this game!\n\nGame Mechanics' IssuesPlatforming\nThis game is a very solid, stylish brawler. However, as I usually see, it tries to do challenging platforming, and ends up being far too frustrating and having serious control issues while at it. It's infuriating how many great game at doing X screw it up for unnecessarily trying (and failing) to Y.\n\nFirst off, the character is big. And that fine, for the combat! It gives better animation, and it's an overall upside! Not for tight platforming, however! Then, you can't cancel out of most moves. When the game tries to combine combat, platforming AND timed sections, it's a mess. Seriously, it's horrible.\nIt has a particular enemy that's a rocket(?) that travels in a wave pattern. If it hits you, you get knocked back a lot. (Sounds familiar?) For the love of God, the times I fell down from platforms because of it... There are too many sections that require you to quickly jump to and from tiny platforms while those things randomly spawn, often impossible to dodge or hit... Chapter 13 in particular (I've written a full post on the Community Hub about it).\n\nIt's really unfortunate. It has a similar system as Guacamelee, where your combat skill are also your platforming skills.\n\nConclusionI hope that covers most of it, I was carried away -- hope that shows that I enjoyed it a lot!\nIt has many serious issues, but it's still a very fun game, and one that I didn't expect to enjoy as much! But I'm biased, since I love the genre and style of it.\nIf you like the NES Castlevanias, definitely give this one a go!","March 1, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I payed $1 on a steam sale and I still feel ripped off. But I will go into detail and pretty much say what every other negative review has said so far (BTW this is my first negative review ever)\n\nThe Pros\nThis game looks great. I love the art style. I hope the art department gets the $1 I spent on this game because they are the only ones in the company that deserve any money for this thing.\n\nThe Cons\nPretty much everything else, but let me go into detail.\n-The biggest one, the controls. They are completly useless, and don't fool yourself this isn't a simple remapping problem solved kinda thing. The way they are divided between keys and how they interact is the issue.\n-The backflip, what can I say it looks nice. Who ever came up with the mechanic for it tho you should of fired on the spot. Sprint, change direction and jump. Ok ok that really not so bad, but the overly long and overly complex (complex for the controls not complex for a sidescrolling game) platforming parts its a nightmare to pull off and is punished serverly.\n-The combat at first seems kinda nice, slashing everywhere and blood and all. Then 2 min after the first fight and ur fighting mobs on boths sides you realise it only registers one key press at a time. Which then leads to the next problem.\n-Your gonna get hit. which is fine. But the knock down and getting up animation is so slow I might as well get up and get myself a drink in the time it takes to completly which then causes enemies to juggle you around a fair bit. Which leads me to the next point (getting good at these segways tho)\n-The enemies. I think there are like 6 in total or something like that. Not even 6 types with varying skins. Nope flat out cut and paste 6 types. Most of which make no sence. A weird toad thing, A rocket knife? wtf? (and more segwaying)\n-There is no story to this at all. Not even a hint of way. Space invaders has more of a story to it than is. Yet magiclly having no storyline at all they manage to still make it not fit in with any of the bloodrayne story. Oh shes working with Brimstone? wonder if they are going to explain why she is after the events of the 2nd game - Nope, Oh shes fighting Kagan her father again? Wonder if they are going to explain how he is still alive after being decapitated in the 2nd - nope. Wait maybe this is before all that (ignoring that there are rockets and lasers)? Nope you kill him at the end. I would say thats a spoiler but you will probably stop playing this 50% of the way into it.\n\nTL;DR - If you like playing a platformer with broken controls thats 80% luck based then you have hit a gold mine with this game. If you were looking for a sidescroller hack and slash game that added to the Bloodrayne storyline then its a completly waste of time.","April 21","false","8.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

At a glance this 2D action-game mixing the styles of classic Castlevania and some ideas of Devil May Cry-like combat-systems seems to be alright. If you plan on casually playing it and just getting to the end, things are going to be just that: alright - mediocre, but alright if you don't mind the random crash or freeze every couple of hours. Once you start playing this for score and ranks it becomes incredibly frustrating.\n\nEven when turning off VSync, the game feels clunky and unresponsive. Especially moves like the backflip are cumbersome to execute, thanks to a very specific timing that felt counter-intuitive to me - there is also a lack of double jumping which would have helped the game in my opinion. A lot of platforming sections will be on your nerves thanks to some weird hitdetection issues - my "favourite" bit has to falling through platforms (in most cases when jumping through them from below) eventhough it looks like Rayne should connect and be able to land on them.\n\nThe same goes for the combat, which is pretty limited and mostly buttonmashing. Occasionally you are forced to headstomp or juggle enemies to advance but it's hardly anything to write home about. It certainly has been done before. Again, hitboxes (huge!) and even more importantly invincibility frames are kinda messed up. You will notice that in certain spiked areas where an unlucky fall means you cannot get up anymore cause you have but a fraction of a second to get out of a situation - combined with knockback you will rage. Hard. Slow (startup) animations were usually the reason I got hit and there seems to be no way to properly cancel out of them either. So if you combo an enemy you cannot move before the hit animation has ended. It almost feels like my inputs and Rayne go out of sync at times.\n\nThere is not much else to say, really - the 15 stages are on the short side. If it weren't for the Skulls (every 5 skulls you get an upgrade of more ammo or more health) which were actually fun to search and collect there is not much incentive to go back to previous levels. Enemy variety is limited (and they are mostly cannonfodder) and I didn't care for the dumb storyline either. The presentation is a mixed bag too, with some nice background graphics that have a proper gothic feel to them but some horrible faux manga sprites in the foreground that look more like fanart rather than proper game assets. The way the game looks (particularly the animations) seems very "flashgame" which just adds to the "this is kinda crappy"-factor.\n\nIt's not a terrible game, but feels very derivative and lacks polish when it comes to the finer aspects of platforming and fighting. Not recommended.","May 10, 2014","false","5.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

The combat system is simple yet robust, the platforming occasionally tricky but rewarding when you finally figure it all out and it’s all presented in a rather pleasing animation style.\n\nA few downsides are that combat encounters can feel rather repetitive due to a limited number of different enemies, and visually some backgrounds are a bit of a mess. The game also feels a bit inconsistent when it comes to story, as in it can’t seem to decide whether it wants to tell a story or it just wants to be about Rayne storming Kagan’s castle.\n\nHere’s hoping we haven’t seen the last of BloodRayne games in this style, or of the BloodRayne franchise in general.

You do not control very well when airborne with that one "backwards running jump" move, and it is sometimes a bit hard trying to land your attacks on the right target. That was the main thing keeping me away from buying this at first, but as I have discovered so far, this can easily be overcome with a bit of practice. Still, an update with reworked and smoother controls (and a simpler way to pull off that high jump) would be very much appreciated.\n\nThe art style is also neat and visually-appealing, the soundtrack is beautifully put together, and once you get a hang of the controls, pulling off combos becomes a very pleasing to do.\n\nI would have to give this game an 8/10.

The combat system is simple yet robust, the platforming occasionally tricky but rewarding when you finally figure it all out and it’s all presented in a rather pleasing animation style.\n\nA few downsides are that combat encounters can feel rather repetitive due to a limited number of different enemies, and visually some backgrounds are a bit of a mess. The game also feels a bit inconsistent when it comes to story, as in it can’t seem to decide whether it wants to tell a story or it just wants to be about Rayne storming Kagan’s castle.\n\nHere’s hoping we haven’t seen the last of BloodRayne games in this style, or of the BloodRayne franchise in general.

I love the art style and animation and the background music. The soundtrack isnt very vast at all but still enjoy what is there.\nThe combat is very hack and slash with some dashing and backflipping thrown in there and OH! bloodsucking, lots of drinking blood to recover any lost health. I have found myself still draining my enemies dry even when i was full health lol. You will find out that you are invincible while in the feeding process so I have used it to avoid being hit.\nLastly instead of holding the button down to drink your enemies, you can just bite them to infect them and press another button to make them go BOOM!\n\nOnward to the bad part. Completion time. With just 15 short levels, I was able to finish the game in just under 5 hours. That was even with me going back to earlier levels over and over to find the hidden skulls that i missed. So I imagine a speed run would probably earn you maybe 2-3 hours of gameplay.\nThis could be due to there budget for the game, I dunno. I will defend them a little by saying what is there, is good and challenging enough a times. Also the price point i believe is kind of high. I dont think you will get enough out of this game for 9.99\n\nMy lasting impression - I love the Art style, Music, and gameplay. I strongly recommend purchasing this game when it goes on sale again. With a very short playthrough and leaving you wanting more, I feel that you should just save your $10 for something else. I purchased this game for .99cents during the holiday sales.\n\nFor the price point, lack of voice acting, and short playthrough, I give this title an overall rating of 6.5/10\n\nI still recommend this game for when you can catch it on sale!","December 6, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks good and has a fantastic soundtrack. Platforming is fun too.\n\nBloodrayne Betrayal is a fantastic game that features unique platforming and a deep combat system that will be familiar to fans of spectacle fighters, yet its 2D aesthetic makes it play like an old school fighting/beat 'em up game. It's a mesmerising and delightful combination.\n\nRayne has a standard assortment of sword attacks that can be combined with launchers, sweeps and dashes to create combos. The dash movement is performed with a single button press and gives Rayne temporary invincibility, in addition to allowing her to get close to enemies to continue combos. It can even  be performed aerially, which allows for awesome combos.\n\nNaturally, she can suck blood from some enemies to restore her health and she can also infect them. This turns them into a living bomb which can be detonated. This is useful for crowd control and it's even possible to chain explode multiple enemies.\n\nCombat is the game's strong point. There's nothing more satisfying and exhilarating than combining all of these mechanics and become a whirlwind of blades, bullets, blood and explosions.\n\nCombat balance is excellent in that Rayne is very strong but her moves can easily be interrupted by enemies who themselves are quite damaging. Aerial control is quite robust. Each attack in the air staggers Rayne's rate of fall and it's possible to advance forwards and upwards as well. Aerial dashes can be mixed in to enhance mobility and combos, and you can jump off of enemies' heads to stay off the ground and avoid taking hits from damaging attacks.\n\nI enjoyed the platforming. Just like with the combat, you are given all the individual tools you need, and are then required to properly combine them.  One thing I appreciated was that the platforming and the combat feel integrated. You are able to use all the platforming mechanics in combat and you often have to! It doesn't feel like they're two separate things and as mentioned before, there are times when aerial attacks are required for the platforming sections because they stagger your rate of fall, elevate Rayne and move her horizontally.\n\n\nVisually, I generally liked the way things look. There's a Gothic, high-contrast art style that suits the game and movement animation is smooth. The soundtrack is killer and fits the game perfectly with its dramatic, orchestral score blended with heavy guitar riffs and solos.\n\nThe story is unrelated to the previous two games and the game is linear. You'll play through\neach stage and do not have the option to backtrack like in a Metroidvania game. You can select completed levels and replay them to improve your score or get any collectible Ancient Skulls you may of missed.\n\nOverall I found Bloodrayne Betrayal to be surprisingly excellent. It's a stylish, responsive and rewarding. The combat and platforming is challenging in an old school kind of way. The game expects you to pay attention, learn and adapt yet it's still generous enough with its checkpoints. I also enjoyed feeling in control of all the cool stuff that Rayne was doing. This is not the kind of game where you have to dial in QTEs for awesome things to happen.\n\nIf you like 3D spectacle fighters like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden, then you'll be at home with the game's combat system and difficulty. If you like 2D beat 'em ups and platformers, then you'll find a uniquely satisfying yet familiar experience. Just think of Bloodrayne Betrayal as a 2D spectacle fighter - a bloody good one!","December 12, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I saw that it was available on Steam, I bought it immediately. There doesn't seem to be any changes between the versions. Which is a shame because there was room for improvement. The rating system has always baffled me. I've rarely met 'C' criteria despite how many times I sped through the levels, taking little damage. The insta-death attacks are as annoying as ever, though I'm used to them from my first play through.\n\nHonestly, Betrayal is the best of the BloodRayne games. As much as I enjoy the first two out of nostalgia and camp, they aren't that great. I see some people complaining that this game doesn't have a great story. While they are right, the other games didn't either. None of the games in the series have a deep or coherent story. The first game couldn't decide what it was about, the second game was about revenge and Betrayal isn't any different.\n\nBetrayal is tough. The platforming isn't the greatest, but I still enjoy it. I like that they put a spin on the environmental hazards introduced in BloodRayne 2. Kicking enemies into objects to get through blockades and infecting enemies and making them explode to destroy their surroundings is really neat. I wish there were more upgrade options than health and ammo, but it doesn't do a disservice to the experience. The levels get progressively difficult and I like the rush it gives. The game keeps you on your toes. It is a very satisfying experience. Jake Kauffman's soundtrack is great too.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game if you enjoy a challenge. It will improve your platforming skills. It's no Castlevania, but it's fun.","October 23, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks good and has a fantastic soundtrack. Platforming is fun too.\n\nBloodrayne Betrayal is a fantastic game that features unique platforming and a deep combat system that will be familiar to fans of spectacle fighters, yet its 2D aesthetic makes it play like an old school fighting/beat 'em up game. It's a mesmerising and delightful combination.\n\nRayne has a standard assortment of sword attacks that can be combined with launchers, sweeps and dashes to create combos. The dash movement is performed with a single button press and gives Rayne temporary invincibility, in addition to allowing her to get close to enemies to continue combos. It can even  be performed aerially, which allows for awesome combos.\n\nNaturally, she can suck blood from some enemies to restore her health and she can also infect them. This turns them into a living bomb which can be detonated. This is useful for crowd control and it's even possible to chain explode multiple enemies.\n\nCombat is the game's strong point. There's nothing more satisfying and exhilarating than combining all of these mechanics and become a whirlwind of blades, bullets, blood and explosions.\n\nCombat balance is excellent in that Rayne is very strong but her moves can easily be interrupted by enemies who themselves are quite damaging. Aerial control is quite robust. Each attack in the air staggers Rayne's rate of fall and it's possible to advance forwards and upwards as well. Aerial dashes can be mixed in to enhance mobility and combos, and you can jump off of enemies' heads to stay off the ground and avoid taking hits from damaging attacks.\n\nI enjoyed the platforming. Just like with the combat, you are given all the individual tools you need, and are then required to properly combine them.  One thing I appreciated was that the platforming and the combat feel integrated. You are able to use all the platforming mechanics in combat and you often have to! It doesn't feel like they're two separate things and as mentioned before, there are times when aerial attacks are required for the platforming sections because they stagger your rate of fall, elevate Rayne and move her horizontally.\n\n\nVisually, I generally liked the way things look. There's a Gothic, high-contrast art style that suits the game and movement animation is smooth. The soundtrack is killer and fits the game perfectly with its dramatic, orchestral score blended with heavy guitar riffs and solos.\n\nThe story is unrelated to the previous two games and the game is linear. You'll play through\neach stage and do not have the option to backtrack like in a Metroidvania game. You can select completed levels and replay them to improve your score or get any collectible Ancient Skulls you may of missed.\n\nOverall I found Bloodrayne Betrayal to be surprisingly excellent. It's a stylish, responsive and rewarding. The combat and platforming is challenging in an old school kind of way. The game expects you to pay attention, learn and adapt yet it's still generous enough with its checkpoints. I also enjoyed feeling in control of all the cool stuff that Rayne was doing. This is not the kind of game where you have to dial in QTEs for awesome things to happen.\n\nIf you like 3D spectacle fighters like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden, then you'll be at home with the game's combat system and difficulty. If you like 2D beat 'em ups and platformers, then you'll find a uniquely satisfying yet familiar experience. Just think of Bloodrayne Betrayal as a 2D spectacle fighter - a bloody good one!","December 12, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've heard a lot of complaints concerning the way the game controls, but I managed to make my way from beginning to end without ever feeling like it was the fault of the game. The difficulty is high, but for anyone who grew up on Sega Genesis or Super NES games it'll be a walk in the park.\n\nThe enemy types can get repetitive, but the levels were varied enough in design and challenges that it didn't bother me much. Combat is a lot of fun, the blood drinking mechanic being my personal favorite touch. I will advise that the game doesn't sprinkle checkpoints every ten steps you take like some modern platformers, so if you're easily frusturated by unorthodox jumps that lead to instant death, you might want to try something more along the lines of Super Meat Boy (high challenge but smaller areas).\n\nGot the game on sale for two bucks, and it is now one of my favorites. Highly recommended to anyone who likes a good semi-hardcore action romp.","July 28, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a big departure from the first two games in the series (feels much more like castlevania now) but it is still fun. Rayne returns to cut her way through hordes of monsters and descend into the underworld. It has been simplified a lot compared to the older games which can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. Some of the platforming parts are extremely tricky and it might be hit or miss with returning fans, but if you can find it cheaply it is still an entertaining entry in the Bloodrayne series.\n\nIf you want a more detailed review you can look here:\n\nhttps://mythoszephon.wordpress.com/2016/02/21/bloodrayne-betrayal-overview/","February 28","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know how to lead into this so I'll just say it.  It looks like a cheap flash game from the 90's.  I understand it went from 3D to 2D.  That's fine.  The play style changed from Tomb Raider esc to Castlevania esc.  That's fine to.  But everything just feels cheapened.  The animation at the title screen even looks like it was pulled out of those flash games that get put together by 1 person for giggles.  The tutorial is lacking, heck watching the intro video teaches you more about what your character can do than the tutorial itself does.  The controls seem very sluggish as Rayne is dedicated to any individual move you make until the animation is complete.  Just all around animation cheap 90s, controls sluggish, story unrepresentative, gameplay unrepresentative and unfun.  I'd go through and adjust the formatting in this review but why should I put in more effort than the developers did with this?","May 23","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the atmosphere that attracts me most, and it lets one forgive unimpressive graphics and stagnant storyline. It is worth mentioning that Jake Kaufman made a true feat, and the NES version is pure art. You can feel the influence of Scriabin in the final boss soundtrack. That piece of awesome music deserves to be transcribed as a concert étude for piano solo.\nP.S. You may consider me insane or even impale me for the following statement, but Bloodrayne Betrayal is not difficult in any way and the controls are OK. In fact, on an average mechanical keyboard with full key travel distance, an avid gamer learns the control scheme rather quickly.
