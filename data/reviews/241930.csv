"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/241930/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","Shadow of Mordor is an excellent third person action game that takes the best parts of the Batman Arkham games, places it in Mordor, throws in a little (of the best of) Assassin's Creed and some outstanding voice work and out comes an excellent game.\n\nHere's the tl;dr Pros/Cons:\n\nPros\n+ Looks great. Sounds great.\n+ Exceptionally optimized. Don't be fearful of the requirements. I came across no bugs whatsoever.\n+ Takes one of the best combat systems in recent gaming history and applies it to a world that it really excels in. Combat animations are brutal (in a good way). Sneaking up on orcs and/or mauling a large pack of orcs is fun throughout the entire game. Some awesome "orc death" animations. The sight of an orc head flying away never gets old.\n+ Strong story in a world that is teeming with stories.\n+ A TON of stuff to do.  Sidequests, hunting, collectibles, challenge modes. Nemesis system essentially creates a neverending enemy hierarchy.\n+ Encourages further reading of Tolkien.\n+ Stealth is fun and easy to get the hang of.\n+ Fun with Carigors! When you hear an orc say "It's a carigor!" Climb up high, and have fun siccing them on orcs.\n\nCons\n- Story can be finished quickly unless you take your time.\n- An absolute fart of a final boss fight. Total copout in terms of design.\n- A smattering of quicktime events that are annoying and take you out of the immersion.\n- Some forgettable supporting characters. Lack of Middle Earth races represented. Mostly just men and orcs.\n- Respawning of enemies in areas cleared prior happen almost immediately and is another immersion killer.\n- Game map (there are two sections, one opens later in the game) seems small for a game that is a 35 gigabyte download.\n- A bit easy. Lack of a choice of skill level hurts replayability.\n\nI'm writing this review shortly after completing the story. According to Steam, I have 20.3 hours invested into it. I did not do everything there is to do and I imagine had I taken more time I could easily have gotten 50 hours into it. However, I found myself into the story and enjoyed the missions a lot, so I kept at it especially after gaining one particular ability. I won't spoil it, but it starts with a "B" and you get it roughly 60-70% of the way into the story and can totally change how you approach any skirmish in the game, big or small. Needless to say "B" is awesome and plays a key role in the lead up to the final confrontations. I am on the fence as to returning to the game to finish the plethora of side missions and I am probably going to wait until story DLC before I do so.\n\nWithout going into too much detail of the story, the game is one that grabs you immediately. Put simply, the Shadow of Mordor is a story of revenge and the opening is done so exceptionally well that I was immediately engaged and wanting to destroy orcs within minutes of taking control of the main character, Talion. While the game does a decent job of keeping this interest, I do feel there were some shortcuts taken in almost every respect. The story is not immediately predictable, but does run into some typical cliches that may have been unavoidable.  The big bad guys that are your true "targets" (they're not orcs) are more fearful in terms of their look than their bite once you fight them.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of the game is what's being termed as "the nemesis system". What this means is that when you are defeated in battle, the orc that defeats you grows in power, remembers you, and you are encouraged to seek him out to exact your revenge. There is almost a neverending limit to orcs that get promoted, so as you kill one,  another will take his place in the power hierarchy in essence creating a constant power struggle amongst the orcs of Mordor. They will even fight themselves, plot against one another, and you can essentially push this one way or another by the choices you make. Unfortunately, this system does not have an effect on the story and could almost be considered a meta game as the story missions are mostly unaffected by this system until nearer the end. Despite this, the nemesis system is one that I imagine will be copied and perfected by other games. I am already imagining something like this in a game of political intrigue, or with a terrorist mastermind who becomes stronger via the choices you make. This is an excellent mechanic that deserves to be explored more fully.\n\nQuickTip: Focus on Ranger abilities first. They are integral to strengthening Talion.\n\nMost of the enemies in this game are run of the mill orcs. Some are stronger than others (i.e. Captains) and require some aspect of a mission (kill X number of guys a certain way) before they appear.  It is very Arkham-esque in certain respects as most of the foot soldiers are complete pushovers. That said, I found most of this game entirely too easy. The only times I felt truly challenged by my enemies was when they were completely overwhelming or I was stuck in a chokepoint unable to defend myself. You will die, but I guarantee you will feel "cheated" at times regarding your manner of death. The lack of a skill level selection hurts this game's replayability.\n\nQuickTip: Run a benchmark when you first launch the game and experiment with the settings from there. I was able to Ultra everything even if the benchmark put me at high on everything!\n\nAll in all, I am extremely impressed by Shadow of Mordor. It's an engaging and fun third person action game in a familar world with great mechanics and some new ones that should be staples in future games. It's technologically sound, and while I felt extremely let down by the final boss "fight", the journey was worth it. I wanted Talion to succeed and that is half the battle in a game like this. When the player cares about the "avatar", you've got yourself a great starting point. If you are at all a fan of this world, you owe it yourself to play this game.\n\nOverall: 8/10","October 2, 2014","true","33.9"," 2,063 of 2,186 people (94%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","94","063","2","36","44"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Botcher/recommended/241930/","Botcher","Botcher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Botcher/","603 products in account","The experience that stands out most for me was encountering an Orc named Zakadush The Warrior. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ showed up everywhere. He was also immensely terrifying. Not just because of his insane strength, but because of his personality. You see, Zakadush never spoke. He would only breathe heavily, giggle, and scream. There were many times I found myself with the upper hand in an intense combat situation, only to hear heavy breathing from behind -- and BAM -- Mr. Giggles (Zakadush) would ambush me, fling me around (literally), and beat me to a pulp. When I finally bested him during one of his many ambushes, I felt sweet relief and satisfaction. I was finally done with that psychopath.\nNOPE.JPEG.\nZakadush somehow found his way back from beyond the grave and hunted me down again. This time, scars covered his face and gave him the look of an all-familiar clown villain from another series we're all familiar with. Mr. Giggles continued to be a pain in the ♥♥♥ for the rest of my game. I finally threw him off a cliff about an hour ago. Since I didn't cut off his head, there's no way to know for sure if that's the last I'll see of him. I want to believe he's dead, but I've learned that this game is cruel.\n\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor may be one of the most surprising games of the year. My expectations were hugely surpassed by this gem -- and a shiny gem at that, the game is gorgeous and smooth. The main storyline is alright. The overall plot is interesting, but it feels disconnected between missions and has odd pacing. You can tell it isn't the main focus of the game, which is fine as I spent all 32 some-odd hours crafting my own story.\n\n\nThe combat flows smoothly and is incredibly brutal. There is weight behind every sword swing, stab, leap, throw -- you see where I'm going, it feels good to control. The combat is heavily borrowed from the Batman: Arkham games, but I feel it adds its own flavor to it as well. The animations are amazing through and through and make the combat, movement, and just about everything else feel very immersive and smooth.\n\n\nThe open world exploration is heavily reminiscent of the Assassin's Creed franchise and a bit of the Far Cry series. Movement feels good and climbing is nowhere near as clunky as it is in Assassin's Creed. Climbing isn't without its faults though, there are a few hang ups with the parkouring system, though they aren't big issues and are hardly worth commenting on. The stealth system is a nice mix between what is found in the Batman and Assassin's Creed games -- overall, there is a bit to be desired, but the mechanic is satisfying nonetheless.\n\n\nI have beaten my enemies and have been bested brutally many times. The game isn't a cakewalk and rewards quick-thinking as well as slow tactic. You can be easily overwhelmed if you're not careful and sometimes you can't bounce back. As you get used to the controls and systems at play, the game naturally gets a bit easier -- especially when leveling up. As a difficulty junkie, I was still experiencing death in the late game, though significantly less often.\n\n\nDeath is satisfying in Mordor -- it's the main way you build stories with your many enemies. The Orcs who slay you will grow in power, they'll taunt you the next time you meet, and they remember every meeting. They'll recall their defeats and your demise. You develop an enemy -- a nemesis. The system is dense.\n\n\nThe nemesis system is probably one of the most dynamic, deep, and satisfying AI tech I've seen in quite awhile. The stories that unfold through the gameplay are amazing -- they're also unique, in that they're YOUR stories and experiences. The replay value is absurd. It's incredibly hard to stress just how great this game is, but it may be one of my all-time favorites now. The potential this game has met, and the systems it has introduced, are immense. I very much look forward to experiencing more of Middle-earth and I'm going to be playing in this world for quite some time.","October 3, 2014","true","37.2"," 1,017 of 1,098 people (93%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","93","017","1","74","23"

One hacks, slashes, stabs, shoots one's way into Mordor.\nOn the look for Orc Hunter Sim? Look no further!\nDeveloper: MonolithProductions, Inc\nPublisher: WB Games\nRelease Date: 30th September, 2014\n\nRemember when Assassin’s Creed was first released? I bet you were just running around, climbing and jumping your way through the land and feeling free. You could do the missions whenever you want and you literally didn’t have a care. Those were good times.\n\nDo you also remember when the Batman Arkham Asylum was released? Boy we were all speechless. I mean the combat system was sweet. You really felt like the Dark Knight. Counter here, break a limb there … Sweet. Not to mention the Story. I never thought they could pull off such an impressive Game yet they did.\n\nBut then again … while you liked both of those games individually you always thought they lack something … But you just couldn’t put your finger onto it.\n\nEver wondered how awesome it would be to have the movement of Assassin’s Creed and the combat system plus a Story as good as from the Arkham Batman games in one game? Well me too buddy ... me too.\n\nNow sprinkle some blood and Orcs into it, take Mordor as your location et voilà you have your game which you’ve lusted for a long time … Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor!\n\nAfter I got you excited … Let’s get onto the review!\nIn Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor you slip into the role of a Ranger of Gondor, by the name of Talion, who seeks Revenge after he witnessed how the Black Hand of Sauron killed his family in front of his eyes. After he watch helplessly how his family has been murdered, the Black Hand kills him as well though Talion survives thanks to his new Best Friend a wraith, an Elve. Thanks to his new BFF he now also has wraith-like abilities. That’s pretty much the Story, well as far as I’m going to spoil it.\n\nSo what exactly does this mean wraith-like abilities?\nFor starters you can jump from any height without breaking your legs and if that doesn’t sound cool enough, you can also interrogate Orcs. By interrogate I mean that your BFF will get you the information you need.\n\nMissionsWhile this is pretty much a free roam game you actually have to do something while you enjoy your man … I mean orcslaughter.\n\nI don’t want to get too much into the Missions since I feel it would spoil way too much of the Story but there are side missions involving a creature we all know from the Movies and Books and Missions including the Slaves.\nPersonally I’d say that you just tackle the game anyway you want. You can start of with the story missions and do a side mission every once in a while or just focus on something. The decision is yours.\n\nCombatLove it or hate it but the combat is exactly the same as in the Arkham Batman games. That means you deal your blows while also focusing on enemies attacks so you can go ahead and counters those. Once you reach a certain hit combo you can go ahead and execute enemies so they stay down. Usually that means you see a head flying in the opposite direction of the falling torso. Always good for a giggle.\n\nBesides that you can also mount mighty Caragors, beasts which you have to dominate, basically you show them who’s the boss, and you can rush into battle with one of those.\nCaragors are way more agile than they look, meaning you can actually climb walls with one so you don’t have to demount every time one of those puny Orcs flees in fear at the sight of you and your beloved mount. The sight might remember someone at He-Man …. so that would explain why they flee.\n\nAnyway. Health is actually rather rare in this game. You gain health either by implanting runes in your weapons which grant you a bit of health every time you kill an Orc or you gather plants which replenish your health completely.\n\nNemesis SystemSo here’s the beauty of Shadow of Mordor. The Nemesis System.\nThat is one sweet feature let me tell you that. Basically, the Nemesis System tracks certain Uruks. Those are either Captains or War Chiefs pretty much the crème de la crème.\nSo what exactly those this System do besides showing you who’s the most badass among Sauron’s Army? Well we all know that Orcs and Uruks are just mere brutes. Some more intelligent and some less.  Meaning they will fight and kill each other in order to climb up the ladder. So they get stronger with every battle they survive. Therefore becoming harder to kill for you.\n\nSo killing those leaders rewards you with two things: You weaken Sauron’s Army and each time you chop of their heads you are rewarded with a rune.\n\nUpgradesSo your reward for every kill is a rune. You can use those runs to upgrade your Weapons. They drop different type of runes every time you kill them and the rune type, whether it’s a dagger, sword or bow rune, depends on how you killed the Leader.\n\nA rune gives you certain powers. One makes you immune to poison while another gives you +10 health every time you headshot one of those beautiful creatures.\nSo you see hunting and killing those is actually a pretty sweet way to make yourself stronger while weakening your enemy.\n\nSo runes aren’t the only way to gain more power. Completing missions and killing Orcs grant you experience and once you have enough you gain abilitiy points which you can use to gain certain abilities.\n\nThen there are also Mirian. To get Mirian which you need to upgrade your attributes like max health or the number of rune slots your weapon have you need to complete challenges.\nChallenges require you to either kill a specific amount of animals or gather some plants.\n\nSo you see there is actually a lot of stuff to do in Mordor.\n\nLast wordsIf you enjoyed Assassin’s Creed and the Arkham Batman games you will love this game to death. There’s not much left to say. It’s just way too much fun for me. I mean I could run around for hours and just backstab, behead or just spook every Orc I see.\nI’d even go as far as to call it Orc Hunter Sim 2k14.","May 29, 2015","true","48.8"," 1,025 of 1,111 people (92%) found this review helpful 256 people found this review funny","92","025","1","256","22"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/puenboy/recommended/241930/","puenboy","Warhawx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/puenboy/","206 products in account","Disclaimer: At this point, I have finished the main story and have dabbled into much of the sidequests.\n\nThis review will be split into 4 parts and each will be rated out of 10, with a final average score at the end:\n-Story\n-Gameplay/Mechanics\n-Visuals\n-Sound\n\n[STORY]\nThe story is full of cliches and tropes, such as but not limited to a badass ranger having his family killed in front of him, but survived and goes on a roaring rampage of revenge. Nothing new in particular, but I believe it can be excused by the fact that it was Tolkien who kickstarted much of these tropes and trends.\n\nThe writing takes creative liberty of gutting the lore often. While it is a subjective as of what it does to the story, I believe that the bending and breaking of the lore (i.e. elves cannot be wraiths) works to the strength of the game, giving it a more interesting story. To sum it up, the story is a good story, yet lacking in originality. The worst part is probably how rushed it is towards the end, but nevertheless it is a memorable plot anyways.\n\nConclusion: 7/10\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\n\nThe gameplay can be viewed as something of a cross of Arkham games with a smidge of Assassin's Creed thrown into the mix. I personally view the criticism of it being an "Assassin's Creed ripoff" as invalid, largely because of the fact that the only thing that is a rip-off of AC is the free-running mechanic, which is smooth for the most part. It does have stealth kills, as does the AC franchise, but nowadays stealth kills/takedowns are so common in gaming that it can hardly be considered a rip-off, and even if it is, it is a very well done rip-off. It is also published by WB, so I don't believe it to be wrong to rip-off another game under the same producer. (Batman Arkham Asylum/City/Origins)\n\nThe combat is much more challenging than either AC or Batman, in my opinion. While it is still relatively simple to completely obliterate orcs, there are usually huge numbers, especially in strongholds, and berserkers and shields make it quite difficult to just breeze through. While there are instant kills in the form of stealth kills and finishers, higher level captains/warchiefs are much more resistant and immune to this, making it a real challenge to figure out the weaknesses of certain uruks, meaning that it is challenging, but not unfair.\n\nThis brings us to the nemesis system. It is very well designed and gets rid of a bit of the repetitiveness of the game. This system means that all the captains and warchiefs are unique. Some are strong, some are weak, and if one kicks your butt a few too many times he might even become your arch-nemesis, meaning that he will keep coming back! My personal nemesis was Ratlug the brave, who was immune to everything but explosions and ranged attacks, forcing my to turn him into a pincushion every time I face him. What's worse is he has the Ambush trait, meaning that he keeps showing up in the worst of situations, such as when I'm fighting another captain or warchief, or when I'm running for my life from a horde of ghuls, poisoned and heavily injured. I would not like to divulge much as it would spoil the game for you.\n\nThe lack of bugs and glitches is also amazing. In my 15 hours of playtime, I have not run into a single bug and only one glitch one time, where I tried to drop assassinate a captain but was stuck frozen mid-air above the ground for a few seconds, before the game teleported me to the spot next to my target, who was unharmed.\n\nConclusion: 8/10\n\n[VISUALS]\n\nI was unable to run this game in Ultra, as it requires an absurd amount of Video RAM (6 GB, holy moly!). However, the texture quality, while not ground breaking, is still rather decent most of the time with the occasional terribly textures, but nothing immersion killing\n\nThe cutscene quality is reasonably high, and weaves itself seamlessly into the in-game visuals. I believe a good amount of it is pre-rendered, but it is very hard to see the difference. Overall, the visuals are not hugely amazing, but it isn't too shabby either, and the landscape and map design in general is beautiful.\n\nConclusion: 7/10\n\n[SOUND]\n\nI have had some audio cutoffs and stutters in cutscenes, but I believe that is most likely a framerate issue instead of a sound issue. The sound effects are top-notch, you can feel immersed with every single sword blow, arrow shot or explosion as you shoot a barrel full of putrid uruk grog, really making the gameplay feel very smooth or impactful when it needs to. The soundtrack is also quite a fine tune.\n\nThe voice acting is flawless, as I can't find a single thing wrong with it. Every single line of dialogue was delievered with clarity and emotion, and the voice actors have done a very good job. From the protagonist and the antagonist, the supporting cast in the main quest to the idle musings of random uruk grunts or the complaints of the human slaves littered around Mordor, not a single line of dialogue struck me as strange or not well-delievered.\n\nConclusion: 10/10\n\n[OVERALL]\nMiddle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a great game. While it lacks a lot of originality, it makes up for it by using the right ideas from the right places and implementing them very well. While the story is nothing to write home about, the way it is delivered to the player through the visuals and the sounds makes it a memorable one, with a host of memorable supporting casts, especially a certain dwarf!\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and it is very satisfying to hack at an uruk and send its limp body flying or to decapitate a warchief, but here lies the problem; the gameplay is good, but it is also repetitive. It means that you will most likely not get to do much else in this game but run to a place, kill some uruk, rinse and repeat. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable experience.\n\n[FINAL VERDICT: 9/10]","October 2, 2014","true","18.7"," 586 of 678 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","586","678","0","48"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/necrolophous/recommended/241930/","necrolophous","Necrolophous[PL]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/necrolophous/","4258 products in account","I finished this game after about 33 hours of playing.\nWas that good fun? Yes, for sure, but it wasn't exactly what I expected.\nI started playing this because I thought it will be mix of RPG and action in open world of Middle Earth. And all of this is true besides one thing. RPG element is very, very small in that game, what was a problem for me on the beginning. But when I gave it some time, I realised that even without RPG, this is still really good game. Not so great as I expected, but really, really good.\nSo action part is just great. There is probably best melee fighting I've ever seen. You can slay orcs and sometimes monsters in many spectacular ways. You won't be bored of slaying for hours, that's for sure. You will kill them in open sword battles vs. superior forces, you will stealth and kill them silently and you will shoot them using your deadly bow. All of this is perfect and you will be delighted of this.\nBut to be honest there is not much more than fighting. Of course, you can collect herbs and some hidden items, but all of this is just irrelevant and not very engaging. In second part of the game you will be able to control orcs and other creatures, which is definitely great idea and it's implemented also very good. But besides this, there is nothing more. Don't expect any dialog options, any hard choices or things like that. If you're expecting this is RPG game, let's say it straight, it's not. It has little RPG elements like quests (filled with fight and stealth only) and character progression, but that's it. Nothing more.\nTo be honest for me it's something like unfinished game. On the one hand, everything what is implemented here is perfect. But on the other hand all the time I had feeling that this should be something more, some epic RPG with great story and all that stuff. But somebody just forgot to implement this second part.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you expect good action game in open world and you want to slay few thousands of orcs, this is it! You will be delighted.\nBut if you expect something more than action, I'm afraid this is not the game you're looking for.\n\nLike this review?

If you enjoyed those games, you are gonna like this one then.\nThe story itself is strong enough, with some nice fan service (you will even find Gollum in it), but definitely one of the best features the game has is the Nemesis system, which is extremely good. Maybe at first you’ll think it’s nothing really special, but trust me, it is! and it works very well, the way orcs can remember the encounters you have and how they talk to you when they meet you again is really effective and credible and it’s going to arouse your emotions, especially when they kill you and grow in power because of that.\nYou can get your revenge and also avenge people in your friend list if you want. Eventually you will have your own story of vengeance and confrontation.\nThe orcs have their own ranks of influence and power which are always changing not only based on your own actions, but on their own and oh boy! they are selfish and ambitious and will do everything, even betray their own, to gain more power.\nThe Nemesis System is actually so good that I hope they implement more things like that in other games, it makes the game feel alive.\nAs you play you will gather information about your enemies so you can always have the advantage (if you want) of knowing which their weaknesses are and even turn them against each other and have a lot of fun with your powers as they increase.\nThere are other activities which are not part of the main quests and they can also be fun and challenging.\nKilling so many orcs can become a bit repetitive at some points, but you won’t get bored easily, the combat system is fun and intuitive and there are a lot of options to engage and kill your enemies, I’m sure you will find some very creative ways to get the job done. If you like the stealthy approach or the kick the door and kill them all style both are gonna work in different situations.\nYou earn ability points that can be assigned the way you want and get runes that can be applied to your weapons to customize your gameplay even more.\nThe graphics are really good and well optimized for PC specially with the HD textures (By the way, you don’t actually need the 6gb vram to run them, but the more you have, the better - obviously).\nFinally, I would recommend to play with a gamepad, it’s amazing!, the keyboard and mouse combo works , but it is just not as intuitive nor as comfortable.\nAt the end Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a great game with a AAA production value, a precious one!\n\n\nEn verdad disfruté La Tierra Media: sombras de Mordor, es una buena adaptación de mundo abierto del Señor de los Anillos y de la Tierra Media y el cual combina la jugabilidad y el estilo de Batman y de Assassin’s Creed de una manera adecuada ya que el combate y la progresión en el juego están bien implementados y son divertidos. Si disfrutaste de esos juegos, entonces este también te gustará.\nLa historia en sí misma es buena, e incluye “fan service” (¡te encuentras con Gollum!), pero definitivamente una de las mejores características que el juego tiene para ofrecer es el sistema Némesis, el cual es extremadamente bueno. Tal vez al principio creas que que no es nada especial, pero creéme, ¡lo es! y funciona muy bien, la forma en la cual los orcos recuerdan los encuentros que han tenido contigo y como te hablan cuando te enfrentan nuevamente, es en verdad efectivo y creíble y va a hacer vibrar tus emociones, especialmente cuando te maten y crezcan en poder al hacerlo.\nPodrás vengarte y vengar gente en tu lista de amigos si lo deseas, eventualmente tendrás tu propia historia de venganza y confrontación.\n(Por cierto, mención especial al doblaje latino que esta excelente, encontrarás algunas voces conocidas como la de Humberto Vélez, si, Homero Simpson da vida a las voces de algunos orcos, puede incluso parecerte que en cualquier momento dirán algo así como: “¡morirás montaraz... D'oh!”, ja ja ja)\nLos orcos tienen sus propios rangos de influencia y poder los cuales cambian constantemente no solamente basándose en tus propias acciones, también en las de ellos, y vaya que son egoístas y ambiciosos y harán cualquier cosa, incluso traicionar a los suyos, con tal de obtener más y más poder.\nEl sistema Némesis es de hecho tan bueno que espero implementen cosas como esta en otros juegos, ya que hacen que el juego se sienta vivo.\nA medida que avances obtendrás información sobre tus enemigos para así tener la ventaja (si lo deseas) de saber cuáles son sus debilidades e incluso enfrentarlos los unos a los otros y divertirte mucho con tus poderes conforme estos se incrementen.\nHay otras actividades que no son parte de las misiones principales y que también pueden ser divertidas y desafiantes.\nMatar tantos orcos puede volverse repetitivo en algunas ocasiones, pero no te aburrirás con facilidad, el sistema de combate es divertido e intuitivo y hay muchas opciones para enfrentarte y matar a tus enemigos, estoy segura de que encontraras algunas formas bastante creativas para hacer tu trabajo. Si te gusta el enfoque sigiloso o el de patear la puerta y matarlos a todos, ambos estilos funcionarán en diferentes situaciones.\nGanas puntos los cuales puedes asignar a tu gusto y obtendrás runas que puedes aplicar a tus armas para personalizar tu experiencia de juego aún más.\nLas gráficas son muy buenas y están bien optimizadas para PC, especialmente con las texturas HD (por cierto, no necesitas los 6gb de vram para correrlas, pero entre más tengas es  mejor, obviamente).\nFinalmente, recomiendo jugar con un control, ¡es incredible!, la combinación de teclado y mouse funciona, pero no es tan intuitiva ni tan cómoda.\nAl final La Tierra Media: sombras de Mordor  es un gran juego con una producción de AAA, ¡uno precioso!","February 23","true","89.9"," 185 of 196 people (94%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","94","185","196","19","20"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Middle Earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Monolith Studions (known for such works as the F.E.A.R. and Condemned franchises) and published by Warner Bros. Interactive. The game's story takes place in Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' universe while gameplay takes inspiration from the Batman Arkham titles as well as some elements from the Assassin's Creed franchise, and at the same time, featuring an all new mechanic called the 'Nemesis System' where Uruks (Orcs) in the game world vie for promotion and domination by either fighting each other or killing the player.\n\nPLOT (No Spoiler):The player takes on the role of the Gondorian Ranger Talion who, after seeing his family murdered and he himself executed at the hands of the servants of Sauron, was given a second chance at life as an undead ranger by the wraith of an ancient elven lord named Celebrimbor. Together they seek revenge for their murdered families and at the same time, break the curse that binds them to the moral plain.\n\nPROS:+ Good graphics, animation quality, special effects and over-all art style\n+ The 'Nemesis System' is a novel concept that is both fun, and adds a lot of game time to the player's main campaign\n+ Great use of the 'Lord of the Rings' franchise and material\n+ Good character progression for both the player and the Uruk (Orc) Captains and Warchiefs\n+ Excellent voice acting and over-all sound design that adds to the atmosphere and immersion of the game\n+ Lengthy game time: I personally sunk 20+ hours on my first game not including the DLC\n+ Relatively large map with several side missions and collectibles\n+ Combat gameplay is fun and satisfying making good use of the Arkham/Assassin's Creed gameplay\n+ The Uruks (Orcs) have authentic personalities that adds to the atmosphere of the game\n+ Good quality story DLC: Although I personally think the Bright Lord DLC could have used more polishing it does have a way more entertaining and challanging final boss battle than the main game.\n\nCONS:- Orc Captains / Warchiefs level cap at 20 (25 if you're playing the Bright Lord DLC) which leads to...(see next CON)\n- Gameplay is not as challenging as I would have expected from an action-adventure game\n- Story bosses, specially the final boss, were unstatisfying to fight (Arkham Asylum Syndrome)\n- Added little to no improvement or change on the Arkham Style of fighting aside from the mind control mechanic\n- Story is a bit weak and some of the characters were not particularly memorable\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and I would like to see more of the franchise. Shadow of Mordor is a fun title and is a must buy for action-adventure fans regardless whether or not they are fans or non-fans of the LOTR universe.\n\nWORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price so if you see it on a sale, then it's a no-brainer. The game does carry with it a slightly heavy system requirement to be fully enjoyed so be sure to check it out before you purchase.\n\nFINAL NOTES:It adopts a unique take on the 'Lord of the Rings' universe by opting for an action-adventure genre rather than an RPG style of gameplay and surprisingly enough, the said action-adventure genre works well with the game mechanics of this game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It is an absolutely awesome game with reasonably good storyline. The graphics are very next gen with a beautiful landscape that is full of detail, amazing lighting effects and interesting characters both new and old characters to the J.R.R. Tolkien's lore.\n\nThe combat is very similar to the Assassins creed franchise and even more to the Batman games. With swift, immersive gameplay that will make every kill feel beautiful but it can be quite challenging when you face more than a dozen enemies at once. With three different weapons, the Sword, Dagger, and Bow. There are plenty of ways to take out you enemies , going silent with a knife or bow or just rushing head long into a pack on Orcs. You can then use your wrath powers to stun enemies and unleash a fury of attacks, or shoot an arrow to teleport to your enemy and take him on one on one.\n\nThe game takes place open world of Mordor, in which you are trying to kill off Orcs and their Captains to get to the top of the tree. Killing Captains will give you runes that you can put on your weapons and skill points which can be used to unlock exciting new skills.\n\nIf you are a fan of Lord of the Rings or Hobbit franchise and enjoyed the combat from the batman games, then you will love this game from the start to the end, therefore I highly recommend this game for you. Even if you aren't into the franchise of LOTR or The Hobbit, the game is still an amazing game with its appealing graphics, very fun combat and a smooth and beautiful open world.","October 1, 2014","true","20.4"," 359 of 427 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","359","427","0","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ubercock/recommended/241930/","Ubercock","Moiderah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ubercock/","301 products in account","Orc Murder Simulator 2014 is a game that's centered around killing orcs. That's the vast majority of Orc Murder Simulator 2014, and pretty much everything revolves around the Murder of Orcs in this Simulator from 2014.\n\nJokes aside, this game wound up being surprisingly good. The nemesis system, despite sounding like a gimmick, wound up being an extremely impressive, and occasionally downright personal, part of gameplay. I can tell vast tales of the clashes I've had with other orcs, the battles and attacks that I've suffered and caused, but that would take time away from the review.\n\nLet's just say it's a system that uses randomized orcs, gives them interesting characteristics and has the orcs give you lines depending on how you've interacted with them in the past, how you meet them in the present, and how they expect you in the future. I've had many orcs mock the sheer absurd number of times I've died. There was one who asked if my brains were scrambled, since, and I quote, "Every time you've fought me, you've died!" It's an incredibly deep and impressive system, and one I'd love to see in more games.\n\nCombat-wise, this game is essentially ArkhamAslysassin's Creed, but it does that well, too. The combat is responsive, the bouncing between orcs mid-fight feels incredibly good, the animations are top-notch in quality, and the brutality of the combat lends itself a kind of weight to the fights. It's all really smooth and fun.\n\nIn terms of challenge, the game also requires the player not just rush in and fight. It's certainly possible, it's just not a very good idea, and the player WILL be overwhelmed if they don't retreat when he or she needs to. It necessitates proper planning, stealth and scouting. The player can look over the landscape, see if there's a more powerful orc in the midst, and make sure they finish their objective/grab their collectibles/do whatever without being terribly murdered.\n\nActually, that's something else to discuss. When you die, the game doesn't just reset your progress. The orc that murdered you, if it's a grunt, will get promoted to a captain, and the side-missions will progress without you. It's a great way to give a price to death, and an even better way to have the orcs remember you when you die. Just makes me love the game that much more.\n\nThe story is essentially "Middle Fanfiction: Shadow of Headcanon". It's not super-great. The voice-acting and production values are high, but I didn't care too much about Gruffy McGravellyvoice and his Elven Stand. I cared much more about Ratbag (Who was funny up until his face was rearranged) and Torvin, and the ending was kind of garbage. But in the end if you're playing this game for the written-story you're missing the point.\n\nOn the technical side of things, I've experienced a few slowdowns but that's probably because my CPU is getting old and needs better cooling. It will set your game to some settings that are optimal for your machine, and I had zero problems running it at 60. There shouldn't be too many issues.\n\nOverall, the game is great. It plays great, it runs pretty damn well, and it has one of the most impressive mission-framing-mechanics I've witnessed. I want more games like this.","October 23, 2014","true","38.6"," 204 of 237 people (86%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","86","204","237","37","3"

Enjoy\n\nShadow of Mordor puts you in the shoes of Talion, a former ranger of Gondor who watches his family murdered in an unexplained ritual before being murdered himself. Revived and bound to an amnesic ghost, Talion embarks on his quest for knowledge and vengeance.\n\nShadow of Mordor takes elements from the Assassins Creed and Batman Arkham games along with a unique setting, excellent soundtrack, brutal combat, memorable characters and with a breathtaking story creates a game that pulls you in, and you cant pull yourself out until you finish it.\n\nShadow of Mordor gameplay mechanics were well done, since i use a keyboard/ mouse setup that is all i can tell you. The controls on the keyboard was organised well, you easily switch between wiping out opponents without anyone knowing you were there, but if that isn't your way of doing things you can just as easily run up to an Uruk and kill him to his face. It really doesn't matter how you do it, taking Uruks out from above and below, poisoning grog, freeing caged beasts and exploding barrels seeding discord, becoming the unseen shadow that they fear. But if that isn't your style become the other half, the unstoppable ranger, that enters a fully manned Uruk fortress through the front gate, and leaves soon after covered in Uruk blood from head to toe with none left alive, becoming the clearly seen monster that they fear. In the eyes of Talion it doesn't matter, as long as no Uruk remains alive and you aspire ever closer to your vengeance.\n\nNow onto what makes Shadow of Mordor a real experience, the Nemesis System. A system that makes Sauron's army not a programmed force with its directives fully controlled from start to finish, but a real army filled with unique opposition each with their own strengths, fears, personalities and weaknesses. The system is shaped by your actions, making your experience unique,for every Uruk you kill another will take its place and each will have their own story. A particular Uruk i had problems with was Shaka the Sickly, i first met Shaka by decapitating him  and i thought that was the end of him, how wrong i was. Our second meeting was a surprise for he still had his head! so i decided to see if two times the charm, but it wasn't to be Shaka was prepared, the Nemesis system granted him an immunity to combat finishers and i was already very low health, so i died and Shaka became a Captain, becoming stronger and my revenge target. I encountered Shaka four more times throughout the earlier parts of Shadow of Mordor until i unlocked my new favourite ability, brand, the ability to control any Uruk and when i next encountered Shaka, head now covered in cloth that if i cant kill him lets make him my slave and then i took it a step further, for Shaka was the strongest Uruk around due to his multiple encounters with me and Shaka the captain became Shaka the war-chief.\n\nShadow of Mordor is a game that makes your actions matter, if you choose to blitz though the campaign without considering the other aspects, you will enjoy the game but you will cheat yourself into missing out all of what Shadow of Mordor has to offer. I died three times in Shadow of Mordor and every time i did Saurons army changed from what it was promotions, treachery, feasts, recruitment, hunting, initiations, executions and more happened while i was gone. Shadow of Mordor was a game that the longer i played, the more i enjoyed it and it was done i felt a combination of satisfaction and sadness. Satisfaction because i saw the climax of what was one of the greatest games i have ever played,and sadness because the main campaign was over. But i didn't despair for long, for much was left to be done Uruks to kill, Catagors to ride, Graugs to kill, Artifacts to find, Challenges to be completed and weapons of legends to be made.\n\nOverall Rating 9/10 - An amazing game that cant wait for any DLC to be made.","September 29, 2014","true","29.3"," 438 of 561 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","438","561","0","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/241930/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Monolith’s first adventure in Middle-earth, Guardians of Middle-earth, was less than stellar, but the developer has rediscovered its mojo. Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game, and it shows.\n\nYou take the role of Talion, a Ranger that’s soon thrust into the harsh reality that Mordor and Sauron’s forces aren’t quite as dormant and broken as Gondor has been led to believe all these years. After witnessing the deaths of his son and wife, Talion himself is then slain...only to reawaken later to discover that he is for the most part immortal, and now bound to a particular Elven wraith. The opening moments of the game are, as you’d expect, a tutorial in the guise of introducing you to the Shadow of Mordor. We get a crash course in sneaking, basic combat and are then thrown into the open world of this pre-Lord of the Rings slice of Middle-Earth.\n\nThe fairly basic set-up is elevated immensely by some superb performances. Talion’s mission for revenge never feels forced, and the slow revelation of his elven companion's identity and past is genuinely engaging. Even the addition of Gollum fits neatly within the narrative, and gives Shadow of Mordor a solid link to the film adaptations without forcing it and smacking players like they were a fish on a rock.\n\nNever before I have played an open world third-person action game that involved so much running away, but Shadow of Mordor is full of ‘tactical retreat’ moments you’ll be facing, otherwise you’ll just be whisked back up one of the few towers spread throughout the game world for fast travel. Combat itself is inspired by the close-up brawls and acrobatics from the likes of Rocksteady’s Batman: Arkham series, and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed. That’s not exactly a problem although Shadow of Mordor can at times become a little unwieldy with enough foes and obstacles surrounding you. Counters to enemy attacks are generally easy to do with a single button, but dodging can run into trouble and those sharp pikes hurt – a lot.\n\nAs you keep slaying orcs and uruks in your travels you’ll be accumulating experience which you can eventually spend on new abilities, or some that unlock during specific story missions, so you can begin to see some unique flavours emerge. One of the Wraith abilities will let you use our bow to teleport to a target for instance, helping you get out of a tight spot. Then there’s always covering ground riding a Caragor, or even a mighty Rancor-like Gruag. Talion has multiple upgrade paths available to him. Not only can he upgrade his martial skills, and his ranged and stealth based wraith abilities, he also can modify each of three weapons with runes, which alter their effects when used. Coupled with unlockable skills and combat moves, Shadow of Mordor provides more depth in combat alone than practically any game on the market, and it's all in service of the wholesale slaughter of orcs.\n\nBut where Shadow of Mordor really shines...is the Nemesis System. Enemies are for the most part a generic horde you’ll be swinging a blade through or firing an arrow at, but that’s where Monolith’s Nemesis system plays its part. Sure you’ll be wading through the grunts of Mordor but very quickly you’ll find yourself being introduced to the higher echelons of orc and uruk society. Captains aren’t your average grunt as they’re much tougher with greater strengths, and early on they’ll have some debilitating weaknesses to exploit like a crippling fear of being burned.\n\nEach of the captains – all the way to warchief – have their own name and ‘motivations’ to give a sense of what they’re thinking. The more interesting part about this system is how easily the deck can be reshuffled. As you start picking them off lesser uruks and orcs will rise to take their place. This means there’ll always be a command structure for Sauron’s army but it also provides an endless array of more challenging foes, as Monolith attempt to make them ‘unique’. It’s a façade to be sure as they end up spouting the same insults eventually, and the models are recycled with variations, but it’s a neat little trick that does try to keep things appearing fresh. To help the Nemesis feature more is the ‘memory’ these captains will have of previous encounters with Talion, so much so that they could be all bandaged up, their eyes turned milky white, or gloating you’ve yet to beat them at all and instead died by their hands many times. If you think it’s easy to take these guys out then you’ll be rudely awakened. Just because you're a Ranger doesn’t mean battles will be easy. As soon as those uruks start swarming around things get heated fast.\n\nIn the latter half of the game things switch up as you no longer have to just slice and dice your way through the uruk hierarchy, but can instead brand them as puppets that’ll do your bidding. It’s definitely a welcome change of pace, tactics and fun than just butchering a load more generated captains. It allows for some pretty interesting power struggles as you effectively ‘gain control’ to a degree.\n\nExploring the land of Mordor is where the game really shows its quality, and is highly recommended. Collectables, upgrades, side quests, weapon upgrade quests, artefacts, and hunting missions are littered throughout the world. They're a completionist's dream, adding more flavour and some interesting rewards.\n\nMiddle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a strong foray into the Tolkien universe, backed up by popular combat from other major action series, with its own free-running style to boot. The Nemesis system does keep things a little fresh even if after a while it’s illusion of orc and uruk society does start to break down. The fact these captains are going about their business just as we are helps it feel more chaotic. It is without a doubt the best experience set in Middle-Earth, but also stacks up against any action fantasy adventure, whether with a cape and cowl or haystack diving.\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 29, 2014","true","40.1"," 205 of 246 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","205","246","5","4"

Running around and fighting everything at once while drinking coffee as I heard is not exact, but it's close to it after overcoming first obstacles. Some players won't appretiate this, but I think for many as myself it's good enough so I don't see it as a minus for this game.\n\n+ World\nThe game also offers not large open world, but what I liked about it most, is that you can walk or climb to every imaginable part of it, and really exploit enviroment, for example hide before Uruks by hanging from a pier or roof. Also every part of the world, every place, has its history and every creature, person, even flower has some info you can discover and if you are interested to read about it. For example who is The Black hand of Sauron or what and where is Barad Nurn and much more about it.\n\n- Story\nThe main storyline of the game is interesting, but short and not much complex. It's quick, few cutscenes and the game focuses mainly on your actions, which some players may appretiate. If you are fan of LOTR you might find it remarkable, but not deep enough.\n\n+ The Nemesis System\nThis is really unique and really perfectly made. Uruk leaders of Sauron's army must be the best warriors, so they fight to take the leadership. One uruk murders his superior and can get promoted on to his position, and this all is influenced by player. Every uruk leader has his own unique name, randomly generated visuals, rank (depends on how long he's in the system), strenghts and weaknesses (which can be revealed by interrogating another uruks), relations with other leaders (bodyguards) and fighting styles. All this is admirably made.\n\n+ Side missions\n10 rather challenging tasks for each of Talion's weapons (dagger, sword, bow) and 24 slave rescue missions are entertaining and alongside with collecting artefacts and pieces of The Lord of Light puzzle gives you points, which can be spent on improving weapons (by opening rune slots) and stats (hp, focus, arrows).\n\n9/10\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game and I can say this game really deserves GOTY award.","September 13, 2015","true","36.2"," 126 of 143 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","126","143","9","0"

The game is like Assasin's Creed mixed with Batman combat with the LOTR setting / story, and it turns out to be a great mix.\n\nIf you are a fan of Middle Earth and like Assasin's Creed style games, this is a must have.\n\nStory:\nI can't comment much on this yet as I am only a couple hours into the game, but the story seems decent so far, and there are quite a bit of story missions and cut scenes to help move the story along. The main characters seem interesting, not boring and the dialogue is well written.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat is like a mix between Assasin's Creed and the Batman Arkham games.\n\nThere are three weapons: Sword, Dagger, and Bow.\n\nThe bow is great for taking out enemies from a far and slow motion is enabled while using the bow to take time and aim.\n\nThe sword is used for hacking and slashing enemies and is the primary weapon to use when you are fighting against large groups.\n\nLastly, the dagger is used for stealth kills while sneaking up on enemies or leaping from the sky to take them out.\n\nThere are other skills used in combat called "Wraith powers" which are unlocked as you play the game and gain experience points. Examples are: stun enemies and unleash a fury of attacks, blow up fire pits to destroy large groups of enemies, shoot an arrow to teleport to your enemy, and many more.\n\nOverall the combat is very fluid and fun to play, especially as you unlock more powers. It seems like it will get repetitive over time, but why hack and slash game doesn't?\n\nOpen World:\nThe game is an open world sandbox of Mordor in which you are running around trying to kill off Orcs and their Captains. There are story missions marked on the map that help progress you through the story, and side missions as well that you can do whenever you want. You can also just run around killing orcs and looking for captains to fight to increase your character's power.\n\nThe game features the nemesis system which is a hiearchy of the Orcs' military essentially. You can gather intel from orcs to find more information about the captains and warchiefs in the world and find their locations. If you die in the game, you don't restart from a check point, instead the orc that kills you increases and power and moves up the ranks and will remember you next time you try to fight. Killing stronger captains rewards better rune drops which increase the power of your weapons.\n\nOverall:\nIf you are a LOTR fan and like similar mechanics to the Assasin's Creed games, then I would highly recommend this game. It has decent graphics, very fun combat, and some great game mechanics that let it stand out from other open world action games.\n\nI would highly recommend purchasing this game if you enjoy open world action adventure games.\n\nHow it Runs:\nGame is running on all High settings with High Textures at an average 60+ FPS (1920 X 1080 resolution).\n\nBenchmark: Max FPS: 250, Min FPS: 42, Average FPS: 65.\n\nComputer Specs:\nGPU: Geforce GTX 760\nCPU: Intel i5-3570K 3.40GHZ\nMemory: 8.00 GB RAM\nResolution: 1920 x 1080, 60Hz\nOS: Windows 7\nPSU: Corsair 750W\n\nNote: Game is running great so far and I am having a blast playing it. Will continue to update this review.","September 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 405 of 530 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","405","530","3","6"

I had rushed in, murdering many of the beasts until a filthy cannibal by the name of Ghâm challenged me, wretched sword in hand. He was a worthy foe, but in the end, the sight of fire turned him into a coward, and as he circled around to flee I stabbed him repeatedly so as to show the nearby brutes how weak they were. Then, as I reveled in my glory, Rûkdûg appeared wielding a filthy blade. He was swifter than any orc beast I had fought, and I was quickly losing control of the battle. I could hear more Uruks shrieking as they charged to join Rûkdûg, my strength was fading, and I could not run. Then as my eyes began to lose their sight, a sign of the coming quietness of death, Rûkdûg looked at me and told me that I was not worth the kill. He sheathed his blade and slowly walked away as a mad pack of Uruk swarmed around me and the world swirled into silence.\n\nOur encounters went on like this for days. As best as I could tally them, he had left me to die more times than could be counted on the fingers of my hand.\n\nThen, on the lonely edge of a hill, just past the plains where I had first met him, I ran into Rûkdûg and a group of Uruk.  I let loose my arrows, slaying some before they could raise their shields. Then my presence was made known and Rûkdûg asked me if I thought this battle would end any different from the last. I let a series of thrust and the beheading of his troops be my reply. With a few more slashes, all of his men fell and it was just us there on the edge of that cliff.\n\nWe were equals in combat, that much was surely true. As I got a quick swipe in with my blade, he would return it back to me. With each stab and cut, we both painted each other with wounds and scars. Neither of us could clearly see a victory. He even continued to fight me as the death grew in my eyes, as the grasp of expiry weakened me. And that was his mistake.\n\nA well time dodged left me a hair's breadth away from his sword, and with this chance opening I let loose a series of nimble and blind slashes, carving into his body. He was deranged now, making dangerous mistakes with his weapon. I dashed quickly to the left as he threw his body into an overhead chop, leaving his back against the open air. With one deft blow, I sent him over the edge of the precipice. He let out a frightful cry just as I heard the ground receive his broken body. All of those times he had afforded me his mercy by leaving me to die by the hands of his underlings, Rûkdûg the Merciful now lay to rot in the sun.\n\nI climbed down to see the body of my worth foe. I looked at his lifeless eyes and stepped closer to the mangled face that had lost the calm composure it used to wear in battle. I stooped down, as one does to see the tracks that lay on the earth. Then I stood again. And again I crouched, then stood, and crouched again, and stood...\n\n---Seriously though, Shadow of Mordor is a pretty fun game. Combat follows along the rhythmic nature made famous by Rocksteady's Arkham series with a bounty of skills and upgrades to bolster the standard counter, dodge, stun, and attack found in contemporary action games. The speed and motion found in this game make traveling between missions and combat fun: there are some mounts, a quasi-teleport to unlock, and your character can skillfully traverse almost any obstacle.\n\nThe stealth is rewarding enough for anyone to enjoy, even if the arsenal here pales in comparison to general combat. The skills you can unlock feel great, and there is a light looting elements with Runes that is not necessary to survive. The nemesis system is no doubt the highlight of the game. Dramatic cameras, names, and retorts all build up these little stories as you slay orcs. It’s a system that works excellently and highlights the games second strongest aspect (combat).  As someone who generally does not like open worlds (due to them feeling too empty for comfort), this was a really enjoyable game.\n\nThe main plot and characters are so bland I had to put one hand in a blender to stay awake during cutscenes, but every other aspect of the game more than makes up for that. I do wish I still had a fully functional left hand, but that's the price I pay for being dramatic.","June 27, 2015","true","16.4"," 116 of 130 people (89%) found this review helpful 132 people found this review funny","89","116","130","132","6"

R. R. Tolkien's novel, The Lord of the Rings, is revered by many fans and is one of the best-selling novels of all time. It's an extraordinary story that has spawned three extraordinary movies, but managed only a few ordinary videogames. Until now.\n\nOn the surface, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor owes a lot of its gameplay to the inspiration derived from the successful Batman: Arkham and Assassin's Creed series of games. Players are given an open world setting within Mordor to explore, and innumerable Orcs and Uruk-hai to battle, and it’s these battles that set Shadow of Mordor apart from its influences.\n\nThe combat mechanism is a familiar combination of hit and counter, but with an added “last stand” mini-game that allows the character to parry a deathblow to remain in the fight. Winning the mini-game and surviving feels truly epic.\n\nWhat’s more, Mordor introduces a fascinating "Nemesis" system for players to contend with. Enemy combatants stand to gain promotion (and effectively level up) from defeating you,  or from the death of one of their rivals. If you flee from combat, which is a perfectly valid option when faced against a dozen enemies, you will also be taunted should you face the same foes again.\n\nWhile not perfect--dead Orcs should remain dead--it can be enthralling, especially as more abilities become available.\n\nOutside of the gameplay, there’s also something for the screenshot enthusiasts out there. The most recent update has added a Photo Mode, which is quite fun in and of itself with the options  available to tweak shots. Check out the Community Hub for some great examples of the shots being produced from within the game.\n\nIt seems like the gaming industry has turned a corner with respect to licensed products. The Batman series is exceptional, and from what I understand, there’s even an Alien  game that’s actually very good.\n\nAnd now, at long last, we’ve got the one Lord of the RIngs game to rule them all.","November 6, 2014","true","35.7"," 133 of 155 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","133","155","4","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/recommended/241930/","nomedemon","[AReV]Nomed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/","1050 products in account","(TLDR? This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)\n\nMiddle Earth is a world with no shortage of lore but surprisingly enough hasn't always translated well to video games. It's ironic given the number of high fantasy games that have been strongly influenced by Tolkien's world. Monolith has stepped up to the plate to give us Shadow of Mordor, combining open world action with a few original game mechanics in hopes of giving Middle Earth fans the game experience they have always wanted.\n\nSet entirely in the dark land of Mordor and taking place between the events of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, it acts as a much needed bridge between the two. You play as Talion, a ranger from Gondor who's in charge of defending the black gate. He's killed along with his family in a sudden attack lead by the hand of Sauron but instead of dying, his body is possessed by an elven wraith. This wraith grants him power over death bestowing him with a plethora of different abilities to use, like the ability to fire magical arrows, lightning speed, and increased resilience among others.\n\nThe world is a typical sandbox design, feeling very similar to games like Assassin's Creed. There's a relatively small map to wander around in, along with towers that help to reveal the immediate vicinity as well as acting as checkpoints and fast travel stations. These towers are pretty much identical to those you'd find in an Ubisoft game.\n\nDespite having a strong and interesting narrative, there aren't many story quests and there isn't as much content as you’d expect from a game of this genre. It doesn’t take very long to walk from one end of the map to the other, featuring a miniscule sized world compared to Grand Theft Auto V or Assassin’s Creed Black Flag. There are optional missions and challenges to be found though which can provide you with new runes and abilities, however these don’t add much to the gameplay experience.\n\nThe saving grace of Shadow of Mordor and the main thing that sets it apart from being just a generic mediocre sandbox game is the nemesis system. This one feature is innovative, addictive and extremely well executed. It single handedly makes the game worth playing. The basis of it is whenever Talion is killed by one of the many Uruk Hai orcs, that orc becomes your rival and is promoted in Sauron’s army. They'll gain access to new weapons and abilities making them all the more formidable when you run into them a second time. Even specific dialogue will play out between Talion and the orc as they will recognize him from last time. If you're killed by just the average orc, he will immediately be promoted to captain and can have a posse of followers the next time you see him. If you're killed by a captain, they will continue to rise in strength and influence as they'll use Talion’s death as a stepping stone on their path to warchief. Each of your nemeses will have their own unique personality along with strengths and weaknesses which can be revealed by interrogating other orcs. For example, a captain could be immune to ranged attacks or become significantly stronger if you kill one of his friends. On the other hand, he could have certain weaknesses such as being afraid of fire or certain beasts. This allows for elements of strategy and planning prior to hunting down one of Talion’s nemeses.\n\nEvents will also happen without your intervention, orcs will fight amongst themselves, often killing one another, leaving openings in the army. They will also seek to raise their strength and standing with various trials. The warchiefs can be particularly difficult to hunt since they will often have multiple captains defending them, and sometimes it’ll be better to pick them off one at a time prior. I had so much fun with the nemesis system that I found myself dying on purpose on more than one occasion just to watch an orc rise to power.\n\nThe combat in Shadow of Mordor is similar to games like Assassin's Creed and most particularly the Batman Arkham titles. It favors countering your assailants while maintaining a high hit chain with the odd special move thrown in. It's not overly challenging and the game can be completed rather easily with only the odd nemesis being difficult based on the combination of passive abilities he possesses.\n\nThe bosses aren't noteworthy, being fairly easy, with the conclusion of the game coming about rather abruptly. Shadow of Mordor could have really benefited from another ten or so hours of content. The DLC from the season pass seems to promise more but I would have definitely preferred if this was included from the get-go.\n\nThe game does have RPG elements however they're not really in-depth. There's no Bioware or Witcher style dialogue either if you were hoping for that. The game shouldn't be advertised as an RPG and should have just been marketed as a sandbox game. It has a fairly straight forward talent tree that doesn't add much of anything significant aside from passive bonuses while each of the abilities are usually unlocked as a result of completing a mission. There’s also a rune system where runes can be added to each of Talion’s weapons. These runes give different buffs and are obtained primarily from killing your nemeses, the higher their level, the better the rune generally.\n\nThe visuals are well done but I noticed some inconsistencies in the textures and between the orcs. Some orcs are highly detailed, while others appear to be ripped right out of the original xbox title; Call of Cthulhu. I also experienced quite a few bugs, primarily Talion getting stuck somewhere with fast-travel being the only option to rectify the issue. The voice acting is noteworthy with fan favorite Troy Baker voicing Talion among a host of other industry veterans for the supporting cast. The soundtrack is solid and fits the theme but it isn’t nearly as memorable as Howard Shore’s score from the motion pictures.\n\nUltimately Shadow of Mordor would feel like just another typical sandbox game if not for the nemesis system. This one feature is the game’s saving grace and along with the story are the main reasons to play it. The Nemesis system is most likely a sign of things to come for what we expect games of the future to have. It adds elements of re-playability and does wonders on holding one’s attention and creating an immersive environment. I’m sure it will be improved upon in future releases and that Shadow of Mordor will be remembered as its progenitor.\n\nTLDR?

Together they  take on the army of Sauron to exact vengeance while discovering the identity of the wraith himself and to break the curse.\n\nThe voice acting is done with care to  the characters to bring them to  life in this game. From Talion and the  Wraith along with all  other characters that will is met during the quest to the various evils whom roam the land which includes orcs and creatures alike all have voices that represented them really well as if one was watching them from a lotr movie. The  effects and the ambience sounds bring immersion to the game. Weapons, and sound effects were  all done skillfully well to the point where you cannot get bored with hearing the sound of clashing swords and orc heads chopped off. The music playing the whole game is expected from this type of game with an epic war feeling to it along with some really adrenaline pumping pieces composed.\n\nThe graphics in this gamel looks incredible and absolutely gorgeous. The background aesthetic, the armors and weapons,  characters, orcs, and everything else including the mucky grounds itself was very detailed and done really craftully to show an immersive battlefield environment which truly breathes life into the game. There will be ruins, orc buildings and cages throughout the map which takes place in Mordor to give it that very morbid environment. There are also interactable objects in the environment such as explosive pots, explodable campfires, breakable walls, hives,  and hanging baits.\n\nThe map of the game is decently sized with in two locations. Udun and the Sea of nurnen both  full lof orcs of all types of other evils. Ghouls that roam the land when a body is gathers, and rideable caradors and graugs. The maps shows icons in a very organize legend  packed with  main missions, side missions along with Missions ranging from human rescue missions, kill missions, power struggles,   hunting captains,  accomplishing timed tasks, Vendetta against captains to avenge other players who died in their game and finding hidden mirian  points and bonus items. It was fun when it started thenll feels repetitive after a while and lacking variety.\n\nThe game play battle system is similar to the game Arkham and has a nostalgic Ac feel to it. The controls' option menu includes the ability for players to also key bind. Players will be taught how to attack, block, jump, dodge and stealth to dispatch enemies as the basic. As the game progresses Talion will be able to invest in abilities making him stronger. Players will need to master all these down to fight against variety of evil on the battlefield. Some of the skills becomes ridiculously overpowered later.\n\nAs Talion levels up he is able to invest point's abilities and acquire a plethora of skills that will aid him such as faster finishes, flurry attacks, dashes, and more all revolving around three weapons, which are the bow, daggers, and sword. There is a total of forty  abilities he can invest in. Most of them can only be unlocked by leveling, doing the main quest, or power struggle quests.\n\nThe Attributes menu requires mirian points, which had to be invested in order to upgrade health, weapons and rune slots for them. They are divided into resources and weapon's branch, which totals up to 30 total abilities of upgrades.  Talion is able to place  a divergence of runes into the weapons to upgrade their stats to improve thier function ranging from stronger hits vs certain units in percentage value based on its level for more attack hits, and regenerative functions. There are also epic rated runes. Each weapon can only take a total of five runes once they are upgraded, and runes can range in levels. If extra runes are acquired, they can be destroyed and converted to Mirian's points.\n\nThe real meat of the game lies in the nemesis systems in hunting of enemy captains. Enemy captain's fight is a very dynamic system in the game and really adds an interesting fresh mechanic to the game. When meeting a captain, players is greeted by a dialogue if the captain knew Talion or heard of him, including having fought him before. He'll spout all kinds of verbal attacks on Talion some, which are great and other times creepy.  They are usually specially ranked orc units in the game that are uncovered when Talion interrogates and kills grunts in the battlefields which can be scouted out to be  marked and observed for weaknesses which can aid him in dispatching them quicker or used to call out the war chiefs which is the toughest of the hierarchy.\n\nThere are also sub ranks such as veteran, elite, and legendary ranked. They are much harder to kill and usually reside all over the battlefield, including strongholds where the enemies are concentrated. Once they are killed the chain of captains is switched about, and orcs falls around in ranking. The enemies themselves battle each other in a power struggle and rank around by themselves so as time goes along during gameplay or if manually forced they will become harder and level up in power. IF Talion is killed himself, the chain of command is also dynamically changed causing them to get even stronger.\n\nThe orcs themselves are dynamic and can be dealt with in a variety of ways, usually when killing one, players can choose to drain them for power or interrogate them to find the captains. By doing so players can work their way up to the chain from hunting down grunts to captains and then to war chiefs, which are the most powerful. Players are also able to kill an orc to use him to scout other orcs in the heiarchy, threaten them so that he increases thier levels, or even take control of them through branding in which he is able to pull out any ranked orcs to the field and there is no way they can counter it therefore breaking orcs difficulty.\n\nThe grunts themselves are  very dynamic in the field with the dialogue, looks and spout  among each other showing  interaction on the battlefield. Orcs Ai also can fear the player when low on health or show anger depending on what type of  weakness is exposed. In dialogues when players clashes with ranked orcs they will always spout previous encounters and different phrases depending on the events that gives players the immersive feeling the orcs knows them.\nHealing is only regenerative in this game through rune skills, leveling up and herbs. Some of the other features such as qte are also unique. The only times you'll see them is when you try to jump on mounts,  on the verge of death, or finishing off certain enemies where it'll require certain  mouse movements along with button presses which sometimes breaks immersion.\nMultiplayer available so far is only avenging players from other games who dies to orc captains and a trial game play and leadership board ranking. No other mode seen thus far. Loses replaybility because offers not much else.\n\nPros\n+ superb graphic\n+ Adrenaline pumping music scores\n+ Dynamic nemesis system gameplay and battlefield giving orcs variety\n+ Variety of pleasing  skills\n+ Incredible  voice acting\n+ Ai Interaction on battlefield\n+ Solid Stealthplay\n\nCons -\n- Only multiplayer is the trial gameplay where players are scored on a timed based event.\n- Battlegrounds is decently sized over 2 maps, feels like many things missing.\n- Last boss qte?

This is a game I had actual had on pre order, but have only just got round to playing. I will put it right out there....why on earth did I wait this long to play?\n\nThe movement mechanics are very much similar to that of Assassins Creed, the free running and parkour style jumps are done to perfection, and you won't find another game that does them any better. The combat system is again, similar to another game series, Batman Arkham, again, there is nothing wrong with that, because the Arkham combat is one of the best, if not the best style of combat system around. Simple to grasp controls and easy enough to master.\n\nSome of the graphics on show here are some of the best I have seen, I can see why the game is 42GB, as the textures you can push out of this are sublime, I was able to get some absolutely gorgeous screenshots that you could quite easily think were real (except maybe the ones with Sauron in the background).\n\nThis is essentially an open world RPG game, you roam around middle-earth carrying out the main story, finding collectables, completing side quests, and boosting your starts and abilities. This is my favourite genre of game, and all of the features on show are all done to perfection. SoM offers a new game mechanic in the form of the Nemesis system, this allows you to form rivalries with orc leaders and warchiefs, if they kill you, they will gain power and possibly a higher rank, which really sucks you into the immersiveness of the game because after you have been killed a few times by one of the leaders, you REALLY want to take him out as his remarks get sassier and sassier each time you fight him.\n\nShadow of Mordor is actually quite a challenging game, I found myself to be on the receiving end of quite a few beatings at times, some missions, even the early ones, required a lot of thought and consideration into I would complete them, especially the stealth objectives. Of course the swarms and swarms of orcs can sometimes become overwhelming at times, but being realistic, it probably would do if that were to actually happen...\n\nI have put about 24 hours into this game over the course of a few days, I have completed the main story, and almost all of the side missions, collectibles and rewards, to me that is a lot of content on offer, almost looking at £1 an hour, which to me, is a fair price.\n\nConsidering how graphically and resource demanding this game is, I had no technical issues what so ever, and at times I was even playing with upwards of about 90 FPS, which is amazing.\n\nFor me, this is the best game I have played this year, and if I had played it when it was released, it would of easily of been my Game of the Year. I cannot recommend Shadow of Mordor enough, you should all pick it up and play through it regardless of whether you like Lord of the Rings or not. This will go down as one of the classics of our generation.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I find myself coming back to this game every few weeks since I bought it almost a year ago. It's the best hack & slash game I've got and I've got a few. Very satisfying and the game mechanics couldn't be better. If they could do this with Battman and the Assassin's Creed series......well.....your social life would be ruined and you wouldn't give a damn. The gameplay is so smooth you realy feel like you're in the middle of things. It's realy amazing and it runs fine on older pc's. If other gaming companies would implement this type of fighting in their games.....every gamer's wet dream. The mechanics would be great for a lot of Marvell Super heroes games. I'm wondering why they're not out there. I would play each and every one of them and I know for sure that all you serious gamers out there would be dying to join in.\n\nShadow of Mordor's fighting mechanics should be a standard for these kind of games today.

I played for nearly 20 hours, and it certainly didn't feel like 20 hours, but I'm not sure whether that's because I was having so much fun, or because there's not actually that much to do before you find yourself rinsing, repeating, and killing killing killing your way to the end.\n\nThere's really 2 halves to the game - the half where you grasp the controls and prance around a rocky, muddy wasteland slaying anything that moves and indulging 2 or 3 types of missions; and the half where you prance around a rocky, verdant meadow slaying or brainwashing anything that moves and indulging 2 or 3 different types of missions.\n\nTo be fair, I did enjoy myself for a large part. But it was upon staring slackjawed at the screen as the woefully anticlimactic final boss fight came and went in about 15 seconds (no, I am not exaggerating) that I realised that this game introduced one interesting game mechanic, rehashed a number of established mechanics (albeit well enough to make them functional and fun) and then offered nothing else other than a sandbox with which to exercise these abilities for as long as it took you to turn yourself to the main story. Which would be FINE if the story had a satisfying conclusion, or the sandbox didn't feel so much like a literal pit within which the developers had simply thrown some enemies leaving a lot of empty space with little else filling the gaps.\n\nI sound confused because I am. Monolith make well-designed and fun games, and Shadow of Mordor is both those things. But given that the review that convinced me to buy it stated that 'no-one could feel short-changed with the amount of content on offer', I felt remarkably short-changed. The Nemesis system is fantastic, there is no denying that, and it offers some of the most genuinely intelligent and dynamic enemies in gaming history. It truly is a gaming milestone. However, nearly everything else about the game comes from somewhere else - the parkour was better used in Assassin's Creed, the combat is straight from the Arkham series, the mission structures are ripped from nearly every open-world game in existence, the skill trees are old, the XP system is old, and on top of all that the enemies are practically deaf and blind...And it's this lack of true depth that left me feeling like the purchase wasn't worth my money. By the time I had finished playing, I felt like I had explored everything this game had to offer, and there was no reason for me to return. I didn't DISLIKE my time, but I didn't feel compelled to play again.\n\nI suppose I have been spoiled, because I bought Alien: Isolation at around the same time, and that's a game that left me feeling like I could play again and have an entirely different experience a second time around. I paid almost the same amount of money for this as I did that, and I don't think I'll go back again, which feels like a waste - like buying an $80 meal to find that you've eaten it before elsewhere, and cheaper.\n\nTo make a comparison, I feel that Shadow of Mordor is like the first Assassin's Creed, in that it introduces a fantastic concept (in this case, the Nemesis system), but the game itself exists only as a framework for that concept, and offers little else that the player can't get elsewhere. To make another comparison, the issues I have are the same as with Infamous: Second Son, for those of you that have played: The MEAT, the things that you are actually given to do, all fall within 2 or 3 different categories, and all those categories involve killing a bunch of enemies that are fundamentally the same, and as such the environment becomes little more than a set of boundaries within which you can kill these nameless creatures, and your character becomes little more than a tool with which to kill.\n\nThere are open-world games, and there are open world games. Games like GTA IV keep me coming back because every time I play I can turn a corner and find something new. The beauty of the first two Arkham games was that the city itself had such personality that there was always something to see for those who cared to look. Unfortunately, I feel that Shadow of Mordor falls into an increasingly large pile of games that have a lot of style and little substance. Which is a shame because there is so much right about the game - the characters are great, the animations are wonderful, the voice acting is excellent, the action is gory and adult, the Nemesis system is truly a step forward, and the LOTR lore is explored in a really engaging way. However, after a short time the game feels repetitious, the environments feel big and empty, and the story ends as if the writer fell off a cliff mid-sentence and someone had to smash together what they thought the ending was supposed to be.\n\nI'd love to recommend this game, especially as it is evident a lot of money and hard work went into its creation, and for a cheaper price I absolutely would. But for the good of the consumer, I can't recommend it for full price - if this game were a bag of chips, the product would be delicious, but the bag would be mostly air.","November 10, 2014","false","16.7"," 583 of 844 people (69%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","69","583","844","19","24"

Fluid animations and appropriately responsive controls ensure that these basic mechanics do their job effectively, but they're just the glue holding together a much more interesting whole. This game is all about the Nemesis System. It's about the rivalries you form with Captains and Warchiefs as you fight them, exploit their weaknesses, defeat them, and/or get killed by them. It's about grooming and getting to know the Orcs you've brainwashed as they rise through the ranks of Sauron's army. It's about the wonderful amount of freedom as you toy and experiment with the system, ruining Sauron's day one dead/terrified/enslaved Orc at a time.\n\nI beat the story dozens of hours ago, and yet I've kept coming back. With over 300 hours logged, I still find things that keep me interested. Whether it's deliberately allowing a weak Captain to seize power, finding new ways to torment my enemies, or meticulously building up my own army of Orc sleeper agents, I've always found something to do.\n\nTo provide an example of what sets this game apart, let me tell you the story of a Hunter Captain by the name of Makû the Wicked.\n\nOne day, I was casually sneaking and murdering my way through the Nûrnen Fishery. I scouted out a couple of Captains in the area, among which was Makû. From the intel I gathered earlier, Makû could be damaged by stealth attacks, but wouldn't necessarily die instantly from one. Among his other traits were Fear of Burning and Throat Grab. At this point I had learned that Uruks apparently can't swim, as knocking them off of a cliff or dock into the water would kill them instantly. When planning out how to kill Makû, I remembered that stealth-killing an Uruk from a ledge involves stabbing him in the gut, then pulling him over the edge. I reasoned that, if I hit Makû with a stealth attack from a ledge hanging over the water, I would be able to finish him off by pulling him into the abyss.\n\nI chose to kill Makû from a ledge of an octagonal platform near the northernmost point of the fishery. I carefully combined my Attract ability with well-timed ledge kills to clear out the nearby soldiers who might witness the murder. Then I proceeded to do the same to Makû. Once he got close enough to the edge, I reached up and sunk my dagger into his belly. Just when I thought I was about to pull him into his watery grave, he did something I never anticipated. With my dagger still embedded in his gut, he reached down with one hand and lifted me up by my throat so that my head was level with his. For about a second or two, I found myself struggling against his grasp, before he theatrically dropped me into the sea below. It was at this moment that I learned that I was just as water-soluble as the Uruks. And so, with a single motion, Makû killed me and rose in the ranks.\n\nIt just so happened that my opportunity for revenge came in the form of a feast that he was holding with his followers, presumably to celebrate my defeat and his promotion. Upon arriving at the feast, I made haste in finding and poisoning a barrel of Grog, just barely avoiding detection. From the cover of a nearby bush, I watched in sadistic glee as Makû and his lackeys gathered and took hearty swigs of the stuff I had laced. Makû was the first to feel the effects, as he and others began violently regurgitating. The poison harmed him, but he was left alive to engage in the brawl that ensued as the Uruks blamed each other for my trick. Not wanting my kill to be stolen, I shot an arrow at the poisoned grog, alighting Makû and his troops in the resulting explosion. Thanks to his fear of being burned alive, Makû immediately fled in terror, cutting through the camp of confused Uruks. Unfortunately for him, he mistakenly ran next to one of the campfires, which I happily detonated to slow him down. The effort was not enough, as Makû continued to flee and jumped down a nearby ledge, right next to yet another campfire for me to ignite him with. I did so, and was finally able to catch my prey. I decided to seize the opportunity to use Makû to gain intel on one of the other captains that had shown up while I was busy being dead, so I dominated Makû, learned what I wanted, and chose to kill him.\n\nHowever, that is not the end. At the time, I didn't yet have the Brand ability, and choosing to kill a dominated Captain doesn't make his head burst as it does with a soldier. So, despite having been stabbed, poisoned, set on fire three consecutive times, and undergone having his mind forcefully opened with Wraith magic, Makû still managed to survive. Not long after the incident at the feast, I was out and about, casually fighting some Uruks when one of my attacks was suddenly and unexpectedly blocked by Makû's spear. His once dark gray skin had now turned a pale, splotchy gray-and-white. He greeted me by hissing about how his burns still hurt, and hinting at his anticipation of living up to his title, "the Wicked". Sadly, this story now came to a close, as the brief scuffle that followed ended with Makû's head rolling in the mud.\n\nThat's  what this game is about.","July 30, 2015","true","349.4"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","62","68","13","4"

High atop the tower, the group of 6  Uruk below me was hardly a challenge, my blade was fresh with the blood of 4 captains and dozens of Uruk who fell with them. Still, the group was enticing, I knew more must lay in wait. In my eyes to the right I see a large three clawed symbol. A graug? No, a Dire Caragor.\n\nThis would be it.\n\nI raised my hand high to instantly slaughter the dozen branded Uruk near me hiding in wait. This would be my party and mine alone. I aim my bow and flash a hundred meters to mount the Caragor instantly. I swiftly killed his hunting partners and stomped towards the camp. Just as I swung my sword into the skull of my first victim, I see a small figure shrink back as he runs off into the distance. Quickly I check his face. Kaka Troll-Born. He’s a sniveling little thing. I quickly grab an Uruk out of the 30 that are now around me and ask about his captain.\n\nWeaknesses: Fear of Caragors, Vulnerable to Ranged, Vulnerable to Combat Finishers, Vulnerable to Stealth, Clumsy, Fear of Burning.\n\nStrengths: Humiliator, Hate of Ghuls, Vault Breaker.\n\nHis puny skills and weaknesses would make this easy. I took aim at his head, a fully charged shot would make quick work of this. My focus was draining as I held trained on his head. I couldn’t do it. It felt wrong. I shot his foot, sticking him in the ground, and quickly drained the souls of the Uruks around me. I walked over to the sniveling wimp before me, ready to brand him and learn about the warchief above him. No. This would be special. He was tiny, had but a few spears, and inspired almost no emotion whatsoever. He would be my work of art.\n\nI left him, and with time his power level raised to 4 for surviving the slaughter I left behind him. With a little more confidence, he challenged another Captain above him. Ukbûk. Power level 11. It would be an execution, I had to stop this. I rode to the site of the battle. Just in time, it was underway. As Ukbûk raised his sword, I let fly an arrow straight to his head.\n\n“Invulnerable to Ranged”\n\n♥♥♥♥.\n\nNo matter, this would be tough, but it was worth it if it saved Kaka’s life. I fought long and hard, strategically blowing Kaka away so I wouldn’t so much as draw blood from him. That there was the true challenge, but with time I had taken out every other Uruk, only Kaka stood, his new power level of 5 seemingly bolstering his resolve. I let him strike me down, but twice he refused to kill me. Why was he playing these games? Killing me would surely help his reputation, and I had the feeling he could use it. Finally, he throws a spear and kills me. Power level up. Excellent.\n\nThe next day he tries to prove his worth by challenging a caragor. He immediately runs screaming. Why was he doing his? Was he trying to overcome his weaknesses? Perhaps. Two arrows and the caragor was dead, and his standing rose. Time and time again, Kaka fought and tooth and nail to be taken seriously by his brethren, and time and time again I was there to help him, and be killed by him soon after him. His power level was nearing 20 now, and the sight of him happy with his followers drinking put a smile on my face. But we weren’t done. It took a constant flow of dead Uruk, but eventually, my child had made it to warchief. Funny how easy it is to get promoted when no one else is alive. I branded 5 of the toughest Uruk and put them around Kaka. My son would be safe with them, until the end was to come.\n\nAnd come it did.\n\nI walked into the blue circle. Kaka Troll-Born. Warchief. This would be it. I killed the snipers around the camp and watched my progeny walk onto his turf to defend his honor. I could kill him with one arrow to the head. But that wouldn’t be right. I fought hard, the bodyguards I had posted were tough as nails, none had particularly exploitable weaknesses and had powerful strengths. All 5 kills were massive challenges unto themselves, but I did it. With the camp cleared and his bodyguards, it was only me and Kaka. He goaded me, asked me if I thought this would be any different than the previous times. I took a moment to breathe. I would do it. I steeled myself and fought. I wouldn’t exploit any of his weaknesses. This would be done with honor. Counter, slash, dodge, counter. A wild swing every 5 hits to avoid killing him with a finisher. I would do this right. Finally, Kaka stood before me, health green, on one knee. “Get it over with, Shrakh” he said. I wept a single tear, that my young Uruk had come so far. That my child was the most powerful warchief there was, albeit the only one.\n\nAnd he knew about nothing. None of my help, not the hours I put into his success. He was the favor of the Black Hand certainly. But it was time for it to end. I plunged the sword into his chest, feeling pain in my own chest as I watched him double over in pain. With a quick swing, his head was removed, and an epic rune was there in his place. I stood alone over his body, dead Uruk everywhere around me. But his was the only one that mattered. In my catalog of Sauron’s Army, I saw Kaka’s head there upon the pike. Warchief Kaka lived a long successful life, but he was dead now.\n\nI haven’t played the game since.","April 21","true","54.3"," 71 of 82 people (87%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","87","71","82","46","8"

Talion and his family are killed by Sauron's Orcs, but instead of dying, Talion joins with the spirit of an ancient Elf, gains magical powers, and swears revenge.\n\nThe combat system is fantastic, and its very similar to the Batman Arkham series. You have normal sword attacks, counters, stuns and ground finishers, and when you get a hit streak you can perform an instant kill melee execution or a radial magic attack. You also have a bow that can instant kill with a headshot (it can be used effectively at close range because time slows down while you aim). The bow also allows you to teleport to the enemy's location instead of firing an arrow. The action is fast and fluid, and when you get into a good rhythm, chaining together all these moves feels badass. Its easily as good as, perhaps even better than, the Batman combat.\n\nThere's also a pretty good stealth system. The level design allows plenty of opportunities to sneak up close and kill with the dagger, or climb up tall buildings and use the bow. There are usually a few ways to use the environment to your advantage, such as using your bow to shoot an exploding barrel, free a Caragor (an animal similar to a Warg) from its cage to attack nearby Orcs, or drop a hornet's nest to make them swarm the Orcs. You can ride Caragors into battle, and in the second half of the game you gain the ability to "brand" Orcs which forces them to fight for you against other Orcs.\n\nThe other key gameplay mechanic is the nemesis system. There are dozens of Orc captains spread around the map, and each time you encounter them they have a couple of lines of dialogue before you fight. They'll taunt you if they killed you before, or they might call you a coward if you've used alot of stealth or ranged attacks, which gives these captains alot of personality.\n\nAs you would expect, they're tougher to kill in direct combat than regular Orcs, but if you interrogate a minion first you can learn a captain's strengths and weaknesses, which will then allow you to plan how to fight them. I especially enjoyed taking advantage of any opportunity for an instant kill. Sneaking into an Orc stronghold, locating the captain and positioning myself for a backstab or a headshot, all while remaining unseen, made me feel more like a master assassin than I ever did in Assassins Creed.\n\nThe player has alot of freedom to devise their own plans. For example - how to kill a top level warchief. These Orcs usually have one or two captains as their bodyguards. If you want, you could fight them all together. Its tough, but doable. Alternatively, you could kill the bodyguards first, then fight the warchief on his own. Or, you could brand a bodyguard and order him to attack the warchief for you. This game doesn't force you to follow a script. It gives you an objective, a range of abilities, and lets you find your own solution.\n\nThe story is okay, but I always find prequels to be less exciting, because I already know what happens next. Having said that, there are some interesting characters and very good voice acting. It took me 22 hours to finish the main storyline and all the interesting side quests, so value for money is excellent.\n\nThe graphics are great and my framerate was very smooth even with lots of enemies on screen. My PC has an i7 2600k @ 3.4Ghz, 8GB Ram and a GTX 770 with 4GB VRam, and I was able to run most settings at high in 1080p. I did have an issue with screen tearing even when Vsync was on, and the solution I found from the forums was to disable Vsync and run in borderless windowed mode. After making that change I had no problems whatsoever. I used my Xbox 360 gamepad because of the similarity to Batman/AC, and this worked perfectly.\n\nShadow of Mordor is one of the best games I've played in 2014 and I definitely recommend it as a full price purchase. The gameplay is so good that I don't think you need to be a fan of LOTR to enjoy it.","December 15, 2014","true","42.2"," 76 of 91 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","76","91","0","3"

To make the review easier to read I have separated the good and bad points of the game.\n\nThe good\n1. The graphics very realistic (mine are on the highest setting) and the atmosphere is perfect for the game\n2. Dying isn't a big deal, but you will restart at the nearest tower, same with quitting missions\n3. The gameplay and map is open, giving you freedom to play how you like\n4. The upgrade system is good, giving you chance to upgrade what you want depending on your playing style. I highly recommend health at first.\n5. Gaining intel (explained in the game) is very handy for learning about your enemies.\n6. Poison is very handy at times, best of all your enemies blame each other!\n7. You can use enemies as a shield, great if you are being attacked by multiple enemies.\n8. The check points during the missions are very handy, if you fail a section then you can restart that section. If you leave the game you need to start from the beginning of the mission.\n9. The story line is great with lots of detail. I have never read lord of the rings or watched the films so I don't know how the game ties in.\n10. Fast travel is very handy.\n11. The wraiths abilities are awesome and essential to the game.\n12. You can customise the skins / appearance of the character, most are gained from dlcs\n13. There are lots of missions, collectables and side quests to keep you busy. In addition all the dlc.\n\nThe bad\n1. The game is very stealth orientated, which is negative for me as it's not my natural playing style. I have learned pretty quickly as it's the only way to stay alive but it's not my preferred approach. This is a game similar to assassins creed, thief and the batman games.\n2. Killing enemies, even chiefs etc doesn't make a difference to the game. There are always more and more to kill. The only ones which seem to make a difference are the war-chiefs.\n3. Enemies are every spawning and like to mob you.\n4. Kills with the bow aren't counted as stealth kills.\n5. Health is gained from herbs, there are lots of the map but you can't take them with you. If your health is low during a fight your only option is to run (if you don't have upgrades and ruins to give you health).\n6. No game difficulty setting, some people find it too easy, others too hard. Others are lucky and find it just right.\n7. Protection missions are extremely difficult as if your ally takes one hit he is dead and you have to restart.\n8. There is only one choice of female skin / appearance. However, you still have the same male voice.\n9. The mouth movements are really weird when your character is talking to someone.\n10. The only character to appear in the cut scenes is the default character.\n\nWould I recommend?\nShort answer, yes. BUT only if you enjoy stealth games and aren't bothered that your actions and kills basically amount to nothing in the game.\nI got the game and all the dlc for £20 which was a great deal but I wished I had waited. The game is good but there are better games out there.\n\nOn a side note, this game is unlikely to run on a laptop. It needs around 40GB of space. If you manage to get it to open then there is a high possibility you will be running the game on a low graphics and it'll be chuggy","May 20, 2015","true","18.3"," 130 of 173 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","130","173","9","13"

The same doesn't take place with the captain as he finds himself banished from the very existence of death. Greeted by an unknown wraith like, the memories of his wife and boy dying in front of him rush into him. Spirited with revenge, the thought of killing the Uruks who happen to be a higher strata in the class of orcs add to his ethos.\n\nTalion, the ranger, jumps off a forge tower. Mutiple events taking place around him, the Uruks enslaving humans, caragors feasting on Uruks, graugs smashing caragors, captains getting promoted, and suddenly he finds a group of Uruks to test his sword on. Approaching them, he finds his blade swings quite well until he discovers an Uruk trying to flee. Using his ability to shadow strike, he travels half a mile to the Uruk as the second hand moves by an unit. Delivering some slashes, Talion thinks of doing something new. Using his ability to brand, he dominates the Uruk to fight alongside with him against its own kind. This is Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. A worthy addition to open-world action games.\n\nWhat Shadow of Mordor does very good :\nAn agape world potraying the rawness of Udun and the beauty of Sea of Lithurin.\nNemesis system flawlessy built which makes prioritizes every victory equally as it does to death.\nSide missions while being fun, add to the strength of the protagonist.\nThe tone of the story stays true to its fiction.\nA bunch of easter eggs which give you a delight on its relation with LoTR and the Hobbit.\nMemorable soundtracks which add to the esque.\nA 25-30 hour experience which leaves you with a great lasting appeal.\nWhat Shadow of Mordor doesn't do very good :\nLacks autheticity as it borrows various gameplay elements from its fellow action games.\nHardly will you find strong moments in the main story, making it occasionally interesting.\nThe real vigour of the combat system is unlocked in the later part of the story.\nBoss fights are often archaic, sundering the game to anticlimax.\nMiddle Earth: Shadow of Mordor delivers an excellent gameplay, a ravishing open world while gets inadequate in its ingenuity. It is not by far a bad game but it isn't one of the best games either. Shadow of Mordor is something which you must play but after doing so, it does leave you with a lasting appeal of enjoyment and fun but falls short in delivering something that'll stay close to your heart.\n\nMy Rating - "Very good"\nTraditional Rating - 8 on 10.","October 16, 2014","true","35.0"," 102 of 131 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","102","131","0","9"

I have my reasons for it.\n\nThis is my first review ever. Please read and rate it as a review.\n\n\n\n26 hours and 8 minutes, 100% playthrough. 51/51 achievements.\n\nFor such a great game, that is too short playtime for 100%. I don't like the idea of games being unfinished when published. Game itself costs 50€ (bought it for half the price) and the rest is unlocked by buying a season pass or buying all the DLCs separatedly.\n\nThe game basically has unlimited amount of "boss fights" with the nemesis system. Once you face an enemy captain with a great set of strengths, you're going to be screwed. Cutting casually through hordes of normal enemies is enjoyable up to some point. Facing a boss enemy who can actually kill you with one strike if you mess up gives me the vibes.\n\nThe good:\n+ Nemesis system.\n+ Gameplay is awesomesauce\n+ Music\n+ Nemesis system.\n+ Graphics\n+ Worked great with mouse and keyboard while I hated to play Assassin's Creeds without a gamepad.\n+ Nemesis system.\n\nThe bad:\n- Story\n- Short main questline (though I wouldn't see that as that bad thing when the story was mediocre)\n- Clearly unfinished in my opinion\n- The additional stuff starts repeating itself, bonus objectives counter that a little (I think I failed one bonus objective during the whole game)\n- Out of lore monsters. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy battling graugs. I'm not 100% sure about this since I've only read the three LotR books and The Hobbit, but I don't think caragors, ghûls and graugs are part of the LotR lore. I had this feeling in the back of my head for the whole duration of the game.\n- The final boss fight. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING:\nHit spacebar twice, click Sauron's knee once. Watch cutscene. See credits. LITERALLY.\nWere they even trying?\n\nI enjoyed the game. I wouldn't have played it for 26 hours if I didn't. I just wouldn't recommend it (especially for that full price) when the game feels unfinished. This is the first time ever I'm feeling like complaining about DLCs. I've bought Borderlands 2 season pass gladly, I've had premium for BF3 and BF4. Those felt like complete games when I played them. From my point of view DLCs should be supposed to add additional content to the game. Not to finish it or fix it.\n\nIn short: Great game, definitely worth playing. Just don't buy it for full price. It's not worth the money.","October 20, 2014","false","27.4"," 1,188 of 1,783 people (67%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","67","188","1","18","85"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamtots/recommended/241930/","jamtots","Jamtots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamtots/","459 products in account","Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor follows a ranger named Talion stationed at the Black Gate, which soon becomes overrun with orcs as Sauron makes his return. Talion dies in the conflict, but due to a blood ritual is unable to pass on and instead merges with a wraith named Celebrimbor. This "brings him back to life", so to speak, and sets him on a path of vengeance to kill The Black Hand of Sauron for reasons I won't spoil. (It happens right at the beginning, but still!)\n\nThe story is not the game's strong point. In fact, Tolkien purists will be mostly upset with it, especially with any events relating to the Second Age, due to the developers taking some ridiculous dramatic liberties with the source material. Gollum is also randomly squeezed in and plays a surprisingly sizeable part in the story. Even Saruman is briefly up to no good with yet another possession of a monarch, though he does not ever appear directly. Both of these sort of scream 'fan service' to me, but whatever, I rolled with it. It's still an enjoyable story, just not as much as it could be.\n\nThis is fine, however. Not every game needs a good story if it has the game mechanics to back it up, and Shadow of Mordor has those in spades.\n\nFirst of all: the Nemesis system. Never have I seen something quite like the Nemesis system in a game of this genre. It is absolutely fantastically designed. It is a dynamic AI system that populates the world with a hierarchy of orc war chiefs and captains who freely roam around the map taking part in their own missions to gain power, and in the case of captains, move further up the hierarchy. Each of them comes with a long list of strengths and weaknesses that change how you fight them completely every single time. One might be resistant to all forms of attack, but has a fear of mounted beasts. So, you mount up atop a caragor beast, which you can find trapped within cages or freely roaming the wilds, and chase that cowardly orc captain down as he runs from you in abject terror. Others require that you kill them with stealth takedowns or combat finishers or any other of the dozen or so options due to most of them having immunities and strengths to counter you.\n\nAs you progress further in the game and unlock more abilities, you will find more and more ways to fight your enemy and mess with the system, such as branding war chiefs and captains, commanding them to betray each other or aid you in the assassination of other captains, or instead you can send them death threats which will dramatically increase their power ratings, reducing their weaknesses and increasing their strengths for the chance of better loot. This is almost essential as war chiefs recruit captains to be their personal bodyguards, which will often turn a one on one fight into a one on five, unless you use the Nemesis system to your advantage. You can even brand captains mid-combat to turn them against their war chiefs right in the thick of it, which is something that can quickly turn the tide of a battle that is proving overwhelming (and many of them will).\n\nThe war chiefs and captains are captivating. They are ALL fully voiced with their own personalities, names and unique appearances. There is an endless supply of them due to the random generation, but it is so well designed. Every time you run into one, a small cutscene plays as they howl some insult at you or personal challenge in their grotesque yet strangely loveable accents. They also react to and remember past events. If you beat one to near death and he escapes, he will remember the next time you meet and angrily comment on it or any facial scars you gave him.\n\nAnother cool feature is the way death is handled. Because you’re a wraith, you can’t truly die, you just revive at a nearby tower. However, if an orc kills you, he will be promoted. This includes the lowly grunts, who will receive promotions to captain if they succeed at finishing you off. This means that with every death, your enemy gets stronger. If you run into a captain or war chief who is too difficult for you, he is just going to keep getting stronger and stronger. This can also turn certain orcs into your nemesis (can also happen if you beat a captain and they survive their injuries), which will power them up even further. They will also actively hunt you down while you’re minding your own business and attempt to kill you. This can be used to your advantage however, as the more power an enemy has, the better and higher level the loot they drop will be.\n\nThe combat. It is an identical system to what the Arkham games have, BUT I found it to be an even more satisfying and seamless experience when going from move to move (mostly thanks to being able to cancel any animation at any time), and also better animated, if you can believe that. There are a variety of executions and takedowns that, though I saw them repeating often, I never tired of. Some of these are things of gory beauty. Orc heads flinging all over the place as you blink around with Shadow Strike (a move that allows you to aim your bow and teleport next to your target) executing enemy after enemy, with most of them running in horror before your terrifying wraith powers, becomes a very common and satisfying sight. You are equipped with a sword, a bow and another sword, but with a broken blade which Talion uses as a dagger for stealth kills, and each of them can be upgraded with runes, which provide decent and varied buffs to your attacks. You eventually also unlock throwing knives, which can be used to keep an attack chain going, but are also surprisingly deadly at times. Outside of weapons, there are a surprising number of ways to distract your enemies. You can drop fly nests on top of them which will send them fleeing, explode campfires or barrels, poison containers of grog to kill them or fight amongst themselves, free caragor beasts (wargs) to wreak havoc (and even brand and mount them), stealthily brand enemies and then order them to turn on the others, and more. All of this combined with the fact that there are often dozens upon dozens of enemies on screen at once, with the chance of other wild animals jumping into the action at any time, results in dynamic, chaotic and thrilling battles.\n\nThere are a decent number of missions here. The ones related to the story are interesting, but nothing special and the side missions are more like challenges than anything else. However, they all mix in with the Nemesis system in some way or another, which is enough to keep them exciting and worth doing. There are also missions called Power Struggles, which involve orc captains attempting to increase their own power and get promoted, whether it be challenging other captains to duels, finding new recruits for themselves, holding a feast in celebration of their accomplishments or a variety of other things. You have the choice of helping them succeed, to make them more powerful or to help an orc under your control gain a promotion, or intervene to prevent them from becoming a powerful enemy.\n\nOverall, I’d say the game will last you roughly 15 – 20 hours or maybe even 30 hours if you do everything and mess around with the Nemesis system. If you just rush the story and consider yourself done, then it’ll only last 6-10 hours, but I don’t recommend this.\n\nEven without the Nemesis system this would be a great game of mashed up ideas from other franchises, but with it, it becomes something special. Everything is built around this AI system and tied together so well and it provides a near endless cycle of content. Expect to see something similar to it popping up in future titles. It is without a doubt an innovative idea.\n\nFor the time being, Shadow of Mordor is my favourite game of the year. I was very sceptical of it at first, but I’m so glad I bought it. It was a crazy ride.\n\nScore: 9/10","October 2, 2014","true","21.0"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","64","74","0","6"

Is it like Batman Arkham and Assassins Creed? Yes, but those are not bad things at all and the game still manages to keep its identity.\n\nYou play as Talion, a ranger of the black gate guarding Mordor, when your wife and child are tragically murderd (not a spoiler, since its the very first thing that happens in the game). Talion is left for dead but is strangely revived and bonded to a powerful wraith spirit. The two try to find out the past memory of the wraith (who has lost it) and gain revenge on those who killed thier familes and denied them death. The story (which I havent finished yet) is very very good so far. Its not a Bioschock or Last of Us story, but it will definitly keep your attention.\n\nMy favorite part of the game, however, is the combat. At first its actually very difficult to fully grasp, but in about 2-3 hours of play you will have it down. The combat is like Batman, but much more bloody and violent (which I love) The Uruks (or Orcs) are all procedurally generated, meaning each one has a name, a personality and a list of strengths and weaknesses. Think Watch Dogs and the citizens in that game. The cool part however is the nemesis system which is something I've never really seen before.\n\nOK, imagine you are in battle and you begin to lose the fight, and you are killed by a random NPC. In most games nothing would happen, but in this that random NPC will now level up and become a captain. When you are revived you can try to exact revenge, but if you are killed again, then he rises in the ranks again and so on and so forth. You will eventually find yourself building personal vendetta's and rivalies with different Uruks. The Uruks will even remember you the last time and with sometimes have scars that you gave them in a past encouter. This system is unique, fun and challeging and will certainly get you addicted to killing Uruks fast.\n\nThe Open world is not the biggest, but you wont really mind all that much. The game is split up into two seperate maps, one being the "ugly" dead looking part of Mordor. And the other being the much greener and brighter side of Mordor. The graphics are absolutly stunning and the architecture of the Uruk strongholds is really something to marvel at.\n\nI havent even really scratched the surface of this game and I could tell you much more, but I'm currently suffering withdrawls from not playing the game right now, so I must go. But seriously, buy this game now, like RIGHT NOW, im not kidding.\n\n9.4/10","October 5, 2014","true","57.1"," 82 of 103 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","82","103","0","9"

I still have not done all of the legendary weapon missions, and have barely collected any trophies. Furthermore I have not yet touched the Trials mode. So in my opinion, this game has still tons of content that you can explore.\n\nI'll do an overview of all positive and negative aspects first for those who do not like to read too much:\n\n+ Great story\n+ Challenging, fun & varied combat\n+ Mounted combat\n+ Brilliant animation quality\n+ Lots of skills, runes, passives to unlock\n+ Many side missions\n+ Nemesis system is awesome\n+ Great character & orc detail(lots of variety)\n+ Awesome music & sound effects\n+ Awesome dialog & voice overs\n+ Gollum\n+ Runs very smoothly @ 70+ fps, 1080p\n+ Very bugfree\n+ Tons of replayability\n+ Awesome climbing, works better than Assassins Creed Black Flag's climbing... :P\n+ Good graphics & immersive world\n+ The Game is actually quite difficult(except the ending)\n\n- Endboss is a quick time event spam fest...(though the story ending is nice!)\n- Side missions become repetitive after a while\n- Textures could be better\n- Lousy AI at times\n- Lack of difficulty slider\n- The big battle before you kill the endboss is way too easy, my orc minions killed all units within minutes, all without my help...\n\nOverall score: 9.0/10\n\n* Story(Mostly Spoilerfree):\nThe core idea of the wraith is genious. It basicly gives Talion an extra layer of complexity and mistery that you unveil piece by piece during your adventure. What I found to be very well done is how non generic Talion is . I sympathized a lot with him when he lost everything he cared about. Till now the characters have proven to be interesting, well animated and full of expression.\nCharacters I realy liked where Ratbag the Orc and Trovin the Dwarf.\nI have to mention the orcs aswell. Their detail is incredible and all of them have tons of dialog, fully voiced.\n\n* Combat:\nThis is where Shadow of Mordor shines very brightly. It manages to combine awesome and brutal action combat, packed with skills and combos with the quiet stealth gameplay of a Splinter Cell.\nYou have a bow, a sword and a dagger at your disposal and have to fight your way through hundreds of orc types and other creatures, like trolls for example. The combat stays varied and you always find new and exciting ways to slaughter your next enemy.\n\n* Replayability:\nThe nemesis system makes this game nearly infinitely playable. What it does is create unique orc chiefs that you can hunt. Win against them and be rewared with new runes, etc. Lose and they rank up and start challenging other orc chiefs . The best part is if you meet any chief again that you lost against the previous time, they recognize you and say something new and interesting before a though fight beginns.\nYou can aswell make orcs fight for you wich opens so much different intrigue scenarios, were you tell your orc chief to ambush or challenge another to a duel.\nThe game also comes with tons of side missions and you can collect a currency like thing to get powerfull spells and so forth.\nThen there is the trials mode which I have not touched yet but I'll update this review over time.\n\n* How does it run?:\nWell, unfortunately, I was plagued by a farely large amount of crashes until I found out that I had to turn of tessalation, which fixed it for me. Since then the game has been running super smooth. I'm always above 70 fps at max settings with my GTX 780. The game looks awesome, you realy get the feeling that you are alone in mordor, surrounded by orcs.","September 30, 2014","true","27.2"," 98 of 128 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","98","128","0","6"

Finished the story, I'd say the Bright Lord DLC is also a part of the story, a bit of a prelude to the Shadow of Mordor. Certainly one you wouldn't want to miss.\n-\n\nIf you're familiar with Assassin's Creed or Batman, you won't even have to get used to the controls, with a few slight differences, it's practically the same. This game's also free roam with missions. Which is nice.\n\nSo you can basically start off the game doing anything; start off with the main quest line, or just walk around a bit, find some sidequests, fight some uruks, do that roaming around thing.\n\nLevelling up seems to depend on power to get new skills, and killing chiefs to get weapon runes. Also has a type of "currency" for passive skills; you can either destroy weapon runes for this, or just do sidequests and missions.\nIt's rather interesting that enemy chiefs can increase their power over time just the same, so you could search for a powerful chief, but you could also help them a bit with their rise to power, before striking them down. More than 1 way to get more power and better runes. Since you're immortal anyway, you could even just let them win for a while, time will pass when you're defeated, but the hero returns. Which is an interesting added mechanic.\n\nThe looks of the game are grand, for a 40GB game, it better be. But that's not all; the animations are impressive too, everything flows quite nicely. From combat to cutscenes to the landscapes and creatures, it all looks quite grand and detailed.\n\nThe story... well, c'mon now, this is Middle Earthen stuff, y'know, Lord of the Rings, there's a whole series of books on the story, what more is there to tell?\nIn this game the story seems to revolve around finding out Celebrimbor's past, fighting the black hand, and of course figuring out how to end Talion's curse. Some interesting twists here and there.\nAnyway, if you enjoy Lord of the Rings, you might just love the fact you actually cán simply walk around in Mordor...\n\nThings I found particularly amusing was the "Nemesis system"; having 'unique' chiefs as enemies, and the way the enemy chiefs introduce/announce themselves when they find you.\nThey also remember any previous encounters and change the way they "greet" you on later encounters. It's quite amusing.\n\nOh, Sméagul and Gollum are in the game too. And have a surprisingly important role.","April 27, 2015","true","39.6"," 59 of 68 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","59","68","2","3"

I pre-ordered it on the day before its release. Which btw, is something I normally don't do, but I had a few beers and thought it was a good idea at the time, and it really turned out to be.\n\nSome Pros:\n\nReally Dynamic, and feels organic. Things simple like Uruk's chasing after runaway slaves, to impressive events like Uruk Captains remembering me, saying something relevant to the situation (e.g, Me shooting the cage door on a Caragor cage, and it getting loose. Then I attack the captain and him saying "Trying to cause a distraction eh? Nothing will distract my blade from your throat"), and even some Captains having scars caused by wounds I gave them the previous time we fought. You might be thinking, "hmm, he faced an Uruk and didn't kill it right away," well this is why. Which leads me into another huge pro. The Uruk Captains and Warchiefs can be hard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to kill. Each having a unique combination of traits: strengths and weaknesses. These traits are actually fairly specific and force you into adopting a specific strategy almost for each Captain or Warchief. So to explain injuring one and not finishing the job: I was battling a Captain in an Uruk stronghold and the alarm went off, resulting in many Uruks coming in on my position, so I fled, to survive and try again later. Now I wasn't the only one to survive. That captain, being as close to death as he was, actually gained experience from dealing with me before, which increases his power making him tougher to kill the next time i fight him. Now that is really really awesome. I have a screenshot of the captain the second time i fought him, showing off fresh scars on his face from our last encounter.\n\nCombat is also controlled very well, easy to get used to, and smooth.  Story is pretty decent, fits in with the LOTR lore pretty well (wouldn't say I'm a fanboy, but I definitely liked the LOTR books and movies). Also since there is a season pass out, i would definitely say just the fact that there will be DLC for this game is a pro. And of course the obvious pro, the graphics are gorgeous.\n\nSome Cons\n\nIt does get somewhat repetitive after a while, but only after a while of playing it. Also there are some quick-time-event boss battles, yuuuuuuuuck. Last few boss battles were really quite disappointing. left me thinking "uh, thats it?" Which leads me to saying, yeah, the game could be a lot harder be honest, (there is no difficulty setting) I mean like i said above, some Captains and Warcheifs are challenging, but after a while you get to know exactly what to do to take each type down. There are ways to make the game more challenging, I've noticed a few Steam Guides for the game that tell you how you can make it more difficult, but I really hope there's some kind of free update for the game that adds a "Nightmare Mode" or something that makes it much more difficult.\n\nOverall I think the game is great. Really great. I definitely recommend getting it and i'm looking forward to future DLC. 8.5/10","October 5, 2014","true","41.0"," 59 of 69 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","59","69","0","0"

I spent many hours sneaking by the Orcs and stabbing them, battling the archenemies spawned by nemesis system. The story isn't that good, but gameplay and everything else is excellent.\n\nAs I've mentioned, the game gives you the ability to create your own Nemesis, tailored by the encounters on the battlefield. To tell you the truth, I was worried that nemesis system would be bad, but it turned out that it was the highlight of this game and the one thing I really enjoyed.\n\nIf I would compare  Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor to some other games, than my choice would be Batman Arkham (fighting style) and Assassins Creed (stealth) series. What's more, Shadow of Mordor improves on their fighting and stealth formula: decapitating the enemies is certainly better than punching them (Batman Arkham series). Sneaking and passing the enemies is enjoyable too, and sometimes you immerse yourself in hacking and slashing, sneaking and dodging, that you totally forget why did you come to that area of the map and what the hell do you need to do to solve your quest. Yeah, killing Orcs was never more fun!\n\nSo, what is the weak point of this game?\n\nThe story.\n\nIt lacks the narrative, the thing that will hook you on, the depth you need to feel from a story presented in Lord of the Rings universe. Because of it, at least for me, the game isn't worth a second playthrough.\n\nBut, all in all, it is a great sandbox third person action game with RPG elements I would recommend to everyone.","March 6","true","30.8"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","48","52","2","0"

When Steam asks the reviewer to give a thumbs up/thumbs down to a game, the question isn't "Did you enjoy this game or not?" It's "Do you recommend that other people buy this game or not?" There's a huge difference between these two things. I enjoyed the game, but I do not recommend it, for a number of admittedly nitpicky reasons, but ones that I think will prevent most gamers from enjoying it as much as I did.\n\nYou're welcome ti disagree with that, but I felt like I needed to clarify what the "thumbs down" really means in this case.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI have nearly 50 hours on record and have 100%ed this game. Obviously, I enjoyed it enough while I was playing it to get everything done.\n\nSo why the thumbs down? It all has to do with the context in which I enjoyed it, and the game's design choices. Stay with me and I'll explain what I mean.\n\nTL:DR VERSION: Inessential stealth-based open world game that adds nothing to the genre except the Nemesis system, which is actually implemented rather poorly.\n\nLONG VERSION\n\nMost of this game is OK but not great. It has good-to-great graphics and runs very well on most cards. The ground and foliage sometimes look so-so, but the character models (both in cutscenes and in the game engine) might be the best in any game to date. The core combat, stealth, and missions are about halfway between the Assassin's Creed model and the Arkham Asylum systems - better than the former but not as good as the latter. There's a decent variety of activities but nothing that you haven't done before in other games. Combat and stealth are both pretty easy and there's no option to increase the difficulty. Keep this in mind, we'll come back to it.\n\nThe one thing the game does very well is the Nemesis system and manipulating the Orc army with the Brand ability. Here's how it works if you're not familiar: You have an in-menu diagram showing the strengths and weaknesses of the Captains and Warchiefs of Sauron's army, who are essentially the game's bosses. It also shows you their various rivalries and loyalties.\n\nIf an Orc kills you, he can be promoted to captain and gain power, skill, and influence, or if he's already a captain, he'll be given more responsibility. He then becomes your Nemesis and will track you down and try to kill you again. Also, you can influence the evolution of the Orc hierarchy to your advantage, both through the elimination of certain captains and through the use of the Brand ability. This ability, which you gain about halfway through the main story, allows you to force an Orc (and his followers, if he's a captain) to do your bidding and you can instigate factional warfare within the Orc army. This can help you progress in the story more easily because you can fight battles by proxy rather than directly.\n\nOverall, the loyalty system and the Nemesis system are very cool ideas and an impressive display of AI programming. They bode well for the future of AI and story development in other games.\n\nBut here's where the big problem lies: The game never pushes you to really take advantage of the Nemesis system. The development of the Nemesis system relies on you dying a lot, but the basic combat is so easy this doesn't happen. Without a decent number of deaths, the system just doesn't develop the way the game's makers intended it.\n\nAlso, because the combat is easy, you never really need to actually take advantage of the faction warfare to progress through the game. There's no reason to go out of your way to create a showdown between two captains when it's so easy to kill them on your own.\n\nIf the developers had made the combat more difficult, the player would have more reason to use the Nemesis system and the development of the game world would be much more interesting. If you died a lot and it caused the world to progress in unexpected ways, the game would be more like Dark Souls, a game that uses the consequences of dying in a very interesting way. Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system has the potential to have the same thing happen, but the ease of combat prevents the emergent gameplay from really occurring as much as it could.\n\nFor the player, this means that the majority of the time you spend in Shadow of Mordor you are just doing the same old open world activities and third-person brawling that you've already done dozens of times in Arkham and AC games. This alone isn't particularly compelling if you're an experienced gamer. You have to actually intentionally die and intentionally avoid winnable fights to make the Nemesis system work the way it should, and that's not much fun.\n\nI played SoM before I played any AC or Arkham games and so I still enjoyed it quite a bit, but I've played about 20 games since then, including games from both of those series, and I can see how the core of SoM is just a rehash of those games.\n\nSo, overall I think most experienced gamers will find that SoM is mostly just another familiar open world game that's probably not worth their time. The Nemesis system is cool, yes, but it can't make the game great on its own - it needs challenging combat to complement it. Since Shadow of Mordor lacks that combat challenge, the Nemesis system, and by extension the whole game, falls flat.","May 20, 2015","false","47.1"," 314 of 482 people (65%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","65","314","482","19","28"

I very much enjoyed the game  and think it's a very awesome game.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics in this game are very good especially if you get the HD texture DLC which is available for  free from the Steam store. Don't mind the warning telling you to have 6gb of vram as it even ran buttery  smooth on my 2gb vram card. The setting itself is very interesting and full of gorgeous views and nice  terrain. The map is not very big but again it's big enough for a game like this. There's 2 different maps  one which you start in and later in the game there's a new much greener and better looking map in the  later part of the game. Game's performance was also very nice even on my weak system i was getting 60 FPS  on high settings.\n\nSound:\n\nI think this game has one of the best voice acting in a game, ever. Voice acting was superb and music was  very nice as well. Every time you get to fight a captain or Warchief the name chanting music of that enemy  is also a pretty nice feature.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis game plays very much like a combination of Assassin's creed and Batman. Think parkour movement like  Assassin's creed and the combat like Batman. Though the combat is much much forgiving in this game  compared to the Batman games. You get a nice set of upgrades on skills and weapons. Similar to Batman :  Arkham City and the games after it, You can virtually climb any building and that makes the game much  interesting and stealth becomes a very important and reliable feature. The whole nemesis system was  pretty neat aswell. It's fun watching what happens after say, you killed a captain. Captains/warchiefs  are very fun to challenge and finding out their weaknesses to kill them quicker made it even better.\n\nThe story was very nice and kept me glued to the game till i finished it. Took me around 14 hours to  complete the story missions and i haven't done majority of the side missions or "busy work" missions i  call them. Just enough of them to unlock all the upgrade ranks. The side missions in my opinion do get  boring after a while. Side missions include Bow challenges, blade challenges, freeing the prisoners etc.  The game is very forgiving and too easy in my opinion. One of the easiest final boss battles in the  entire world. QTE's for a final boss, seriously? That was the only dissapointing part in my opinion.\n\nTalion has sword and can stealth kill Uruks, as well as Celebrimbor's bow comes in handy quite a lot.  Unlike most games with bows this one actually uses it pretty well and i loved headshotting Uruks from   far, combine those with the brutal kill finishers makes for some very nice looking kills in slow-mo.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is very fun to play. If you like Assassin's creed series, batman series, even Mad Max then you  should get this game. You can easily spend 20+ hours in this game. Story's great,  graphics are great, sound is great and the combat is fun as hell. I got the GOTY version (which includes all the DLC) on sale and i think it's worth every penny.","March 21","true","24.5"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","40","44","3","4"

This is a slow process I know but that’s how I've been playing most of my gaming life on most games such as this one.\n\nBut I took it back after playing the game for about 5 to 10 hours. The game strongly took me out from my comfort zone and encouraged me to play on almost any styles in the game other than stealth and that’s a great thing to me.\n\nWhat’s new? The Nemesis system you say???\n\nWell yeah I believe that its the highlight of this game and personally its an original feature that gave me something new to the table.\n\nHow dose the nemesis system work?\n\nImagine this one scenario where you accidentally got killed by an Uruk with no ranks & eventually made his place as a new captain. If he succeeds overtime be it some power struggles he may possibly make his way up to become one of the bodyguards of a War chief. If and if I successfully kill his leader he will have the possibility to become the next War chief and as each encounter you have with him he will remark the last encounter you had with him before engaging a fight. Although by ranking up means he will develop features and weaknesses will become more limited and much harder to take him down. Yes so that is how the nemesis system works in a way. They will get stronger and much harder to kill if you fail to either brand or kill them.\n\nAs far as my experience goes, at the last mission I encountered many War chiefs and one of them was the Uruk who killed me for the first time when he was just a captain! Yes to me it got really personal and he was at the top level with epic rune drop, by that time I realize that this system is actually original and fun. I mean, it’s not a cake walk to brand all Uruks because of their different features and limited weaknesses so practicing patience is the key.\n\nHow dose branding work?\n\nWell when you go a bit further to the game you will get an ability to “brand” Uruks & other mounted animals in the game. When branded, the Uruks will be under your command regardless if they’re from the lowest to the top ranks. One of the most interesting commands  I found was sending death threats to other enemy Uruks which can lead to rank themselves up to give more chance of of “Epic” rune drops after killing them despite of them being aware of your attempt. Yes they will be more cautious and alert but the drops will be worth the effort and patience if you will.\n\nBranded top ranked (war chiefs) Uruks will be useful in the future but that’s just a giveaway tip from my end.\n\nSo both systems are actually fun and will make you busy if especially if you want to perfect your run.\n\nBut here are the pros and cons about the games as I explain each point as follows:\n\nPros:\nThe nemesis system: it’s original and with the assistance of the branding system it will make you busy throughout the game\nGraphically amazing: with all the bloody animations in the game on every finishing execution made. Good thing we’re seeing Uruk’s blood and not humans.\nSolid Combat & stealth mechanics: even though their styles are strongly familiar to known games it was mastered almost perfectly.\nInteresting Collectibles: Some will unlock important information not just the game’s world but also about the LOTR lore.\nVersatility: indeed that the game has encouraged me to become more adaptable to all styles and actually I’m usually not comfortable of not using my boring stealthy and slow approach. But on this game wasn't the case really and I’m very glad to use all of them here\nMeh:\nStoryline: it’s not really strong and lengthy but it gave some more info about the LOTR lore.\nApart from the new Nemesis system, most of the elements aren't new\nThe storyline’s not really big\nMap is big but not: well I thought that it was bigger but it turned out be okay Cons:\nOccasional glitchy angles: this isn't a new issue when in fact it happens to all third person view games I have played in many years so its still personally understandable.\nObstacles can sometimes get in the way: Yes this is an irritating burden especially when doing stealth missions. I am a type of person who likes to use the wraith vision (like the detective vision on Batman Arkham series) a lot because I play stealth most of the time on this game but when things eventually prevents me to go towards my destination I end up off balanced or lose my motive and that sometimes lose my cover and start over again. Conclusion:\n\nSo in the end, I can say that the game is for those who would like to get to know of the nemesis and branding system and also if they’re a fan of the LOTR lore. Other than that most of the mechanics of the game already done by previous well-known games but that’s not bad. If and when an IP like this successfully delivered a genre that has been around from previous IPs then it is a sign that they have a new competent contender and they need to come up with a new system to beat like the nemesis system.\n\nTo me, this game isn't worth the full price. Some can wait for it till it goes on sale but I still recommend to everyone for the experience. Its fun, bloody, strategic and well executed at the most.","October 15, 2014","true","81.9"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","48","57","0","8"

Big name properties like Batman and Lord of the Rings or Xmen or Star Wars etc etc have often times had horrible cash-in/no merit games released in their names. From the side scrolling Batman games in the 16bit era to the complete abominations that were Lotr games on 360 and Ps3 the licesensed game market is a mixed bag mostly full of  budget bin cast-aways. The way, for me at least, to judge these types of titles is to ask "if I take away the license is it still a good game?". In the case of Shadow of Mordor not only would it still be a good game it would be a great one.\n\nShadow of Mordor excels in every aspect. The visuals are pleasing and the art style is spot on for Middle Earth. The combat is brutal, easy to get a grasp on but deep enough to take some time to master. The cllimbing and character movement in general is smooth and enjoyable. The story made me care about how it ended and the orcs made me hate them to the point where my slaughtering of them became a bit of an addiction. The much heralded 'nemesis system' did not dissapoint and succeeded greatly in putting a new flavor of icing on a cake we've all had a few times before. SoM takes a lot of inspiration gameplay wise from the Arkham series and the Assasin's Creed games but manages not to feel at all like a cookie cutter experience or a blatant rip off. Instead we are given the best parts of both of those popular franchises mixed together in a Tolkien setting. Add in the aforementioned nemesis to freshen things up and give us all something we have never seen before and we have the  One Game to Rule Them All  that Tolkien fans have been dying for ever since WB got hold of the property over a decade ago.\n\n","January 3, 2015","true","54.3"," 49 of 61 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","49","61","6","1"

From the characters, to the aesthetic of the wraith mode to the landscape of Mordor it's all very familiar if you've watched those movies. In this regard it's a very familiar game to look at, and it's also a very graphically pretty game.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the game plays very similarly to Assassins Creed and Batman Arkham Asylum. The biggest thing that anyone talks about when it comes to this game is the Nemesis system. In Shadow of Mordor every Orc/Uruk captain has a name, a backstory, a different fighting style and addresses the player differently depending on whether you met them or not. For instance, if you die to a particular captain they not only increase in rank but they point it out if you meet them again. This makes the story seem much more gameplay driven than you're normally used to in sandbox titles. They also have their own political interplay between each other regardless of what the player does to try and influence it. The world feels much less static than the vast majority of sandbox games as a result.\n\nIndeed all of this stuff is great. However my biggest problem with the game is it feels trapped trying to mimic other popular games. The general control scheme is near identical to something like Batman Arkham City, and the wide open sandbox and laundry list style sidequests are very in-line with Assassin's Creed. However it feels very stripped down and streamlined compared to those two, and the general gameplay itself while familiar is very restrained. All you do in this game is kill orcs. And while that is a great idea for a game in-of itself I felt myself wishing it could've been about more.\n\nThe storyline is also very derivative and I found myself enjoying the characterization of the Orcs/Uruks far more than the protagonists and human characters. Compared to the protagonists, the orcs go through arcs and have personalities that feel very interesting to influence. Indeed the generic storytelling feels like a victim of the Nemesis system. As you spend the vast majority of the game ignoring it to kill more orcs.\n\nThe game's not bad, make no mistake. It's a very polished, streamlined and innovative title, and for the majority of players what I'm talking about won't seem like flaws at all. I just find myself wishing the game tried to innovate as much in the storytelling and general sandbox gameplay as it did with it's Nemesis system. Since it really does play it safe in those two areas.","August 2, 2015","true","8.7"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","50","63","5","3"

This makes that you are not the only character in the game that is evolving and becomming stronger. This combined with beautifull graphics and combat that feels like the batman games and parkour skills of assassins creed, I can see why so many people recommend this game. And I feel like i should as well.\n\nBUT,\nI was honestly dissapointed. I was bored, very soon. The combat, although satisfying at start, quickly becomes dull. When you learn how to counter attacks, you can fight 2 Orc commanders and an army of 20 orcs around you all simultaniously while drinking coffee. And on itself, I could forgive that. But there is no variation. You will always be the same character with the same swords and quickly flash your bow to shoot a quick arrow. There are a couple skills when you level up, but there is honestly no real character development, you just become more powerfull and combat becomes even easier as you continue. I want to play as an dwarf or an elf, I want to use an axe, a spear or a shield. But none of that is possible.\n\nI understand that in a scripted game with a lot of story focus, like in batman. you limit the players choices. But the story in this game is really not worth it. Except for one little funny orc, the characters lack charisma and personality. A linear journey of revenge, without heroism or morality.I feel like they didn't want to spend time on the story after creating this big beautifull open world, which is obviously enough too sell a game when people watch gameplay.\n\nSo yeah: you like batman and assassins creed, you will have fun with it. But don't buy this game if you want a good Lord of the Rings story or create your own unique hero, because this is something this game doesn't have.","April 30, 2015","false","13.4"," 517 of 826 people (63%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","63","517","826","30","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rogermorse/recommended/241930/","rogermorse","rogermorse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rogermorse/","431 products in account","Ok this game began very well but it became extremely boring and repetitive after a very short while. I really don't get how it was praised by the public in such a way....\n\nGraphics may look nice but to be precise the scenery has a very low poly geometry (flat surface, no parallax, very edgy stones). Characters and combat have excellent animations.\n\nCombat is as good as batman but very repetitive and well, you do that for the whole game so the skill tree and new powers don't make it any more interesting. The nemesis system was interesting at first, but after a while it becomes just as repetitive, with missions to grind on it nothing more.\n\nSide missions are horrible. You see the first, you have seen them all, they are basically challenges with one completion requisite and one bonus objective to gain more xp. Free the slaves, infiltrate the camp, kill the orcs and so on.\n\nThe main story is quite short and it repeats itself as well. You do the same things and the poor design of the locations doesn't help doing the same things over and over.\n\nI am very sad about this game, I expected it to be a great game. It is not that bad, but it's just not interesting enough. How the batman games managed the game map, main story, side story and challenges is absolutely on another level. This is just some weird LOTR action game without any real sauce in it.\n\nI wished steam allowed to put ratings (or stars....). I am forced to choose between 'recommend' and 'not recommend'. Well, I will have to 'not recommend' this one although it is not a very true statement.","June 13, 2015","false","15.2"," 203 of 318 people (64%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","64","203","318","13","17"

Shadow of Mordor is the choice.\n\nThe storyline doesn't matter much here, being very generic and trivial. It tells you about Talion, a Ranger of Gondor who got his family killed by Sauron's henchmen. During the attack, Talion is saved by an unknown Elven wraith with no memory of his past. As the Ranger learns about his unwanted immortality, he shares his body with the wraith to seek revenge. That's exactly what those 20 main missions are about.\n\nThe best part, though, lies beyond the main story, for the sandbox offers you much more. Your adventures will inevitably lead you to one of the enemy generals, introducing you to Nemesis. This system builds a distinct dynamic hierarchy in Sauron's army that allows the in-game world to live its own life. There's always a bunch of Uruk commanders roaming around, and each of them has their own name, rank, unique appearance, personal features, motivation, and power level. You can try to bring one of them down at any time, but it's not always necessary considering their eagerness to randomly fight each other in order to prove their authority. These actions generate side missions of certain types that you can start or ignore. Either way, killing any general requires some intel on his behaviour, as the way you shall approach and act in the combat totally depends on it.\n\nThe combat mechanics aren't too different from what we've seen in Assassin's Creed or Batman: Arkham series. LMB to attack, RMB for a counter move. The combo meter gets red after a set number of strikes, allowing you to perform special moves that can be learned for gaining experience points and are mostly the same as in Batman. That's pretty much it, but it still feels great thanks to the Nemesis system, so be sure you won't get bored after a few hours.\n\nApart from everything above, there's also a lot of collectibles all over the place with tiny pieces of local history. Despite the game being uncanonical, it's an exciting chance for the LotR fans to explore the most uncertain period of the universe. Perhaps some might find it even more interesting than actually making progress in the story.\n\nTo sum up, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is definitely a game worth playing. It looks modern, feels fresh enough to stay for at least 15-20 hours - and it brings a somewhat new experience. Even though I'd rather not see Nemesis combined with old mechanics, it's still sufficient as it is.","October 8, 2014","true","18.9"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","38","46","3","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dantesbooty/recommended/241930/","dantesbooty","Ducky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dantesbooty/","286 products in account","One of the best games released in 2014 (in my humble opinion), I'd give this game a 8.5/10. If you like brutal action games, please do yourself a favor and get this game.\n\nSummary:\n+ Excellent, fluid combat\n+ Nemesis system keeps you engaged for hours and makes killing enemies a lot more personal\n+ Beautiful soundtrack\n+ Free DLC gives you a couple of more hours of fun\n\n- I didn't personally relate to the characters\n- It would've been awesome if the game had done more with the monster hunter ability\n- Final boss fight will literally disappoint every single gamer on the planet (seriously, how did that get approved?)\n\nI won't go much into the story since I am not a Lord of the Rings fan, so a lot of what happened in the game either didn't interest me or confused me. But if you're like me and you like a game with good, brutal combat, this is your game. It's similar to games like the Batman Arkham games or the AC series, but this game spices it up with brutal executions and other skills. In fact, I thought the gameplay was so much fun that I would just spend hours off-mission killing random enemies.\n\nIn fact, the gameplay alone is why I'd recommend this game. I suspect LOTR fans love the whole mythology around the story, but I just wanted a solid action game and that's exactly what I got.\n\nThe only thing I'm disappointed about is that I didn't really relate to the characters all that much. The story is one about revenge, which is as we all know the most original concept ever thought of. The only memorable scene I can remember is one near the end with Lithariel, where Talion finally gets an opportunity to show some emotion.\n\nSOM's biggest asset is definitely its nemesis system. Every player gets a different nemesis, and I got two different ones when I played it on PS4 and PC. I like how they call you out on dying that one time, or running away, this makes killing them much more satisfying. Plus, they have strengths and weaknesses to consider (weaknesses slowly fading if you fail to kill them during an attack) so it is not always wise to storm the castle, so to speak. Strategic planning by interrogating captains, for instance, is a much more sensible option.\n\nI played this game on PS4 first, then purchased it again on PC and I have to say I prefer playing it on PS4. But I won't go into details about that since I don't have a high-end PC, I just have a laptop and a mouse that was pretty much donated to me. It's probably due to that, that the graphics don't look as good and I have difficulties properly aiming while using the bow. Other than that, this game plays perfectly fine with a keyboard + mouse (though I still prefer to hook up my 360 controller).\n\nOh, and a final note I want to add is that while in combat, the game seems to be a random button masher. An icon appears over an enemy's head when you can parry their attacks, which makes the combat feel easier. Once you're familiar with the game, I suggest you turn that off.","November 21, 2014","true","64.1"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","41","51","0","5"

It takes the melee combat from Batman and mixes it with an open-world structure of Assassin’s Creed. Two large areas are populated with hilarious Orcs that are satisfying to kill and fight. The Nemesis system presents you with random Orc captains that have varied appearances and weaknesses. Gaining intel on these captains allows you to plan ahead and engage at your own choosing. You can even assume control over captains and help them ascend to the rank of Warchief, or just watch them fight amongst each other. Fighting dozens of Orcs in a stronghold is just as exciting as sneaking through ruins under the moonlight. The breadth and execution of mechanics ensures Mordor stands out from similar games and remains entertaining for dozens of hours.","November 1, 2014","true","27.1"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","40","50","0","4"

A story about revenge from a man denied death.\n\nShadow of Mordor takes the combat mechanics from the Batman Arkham series and turns them lethal. You can climb real good as well. This game is pretty strait forward. You are a dude and you kill orcs or Uruk-hai for the lore folk out there because they are bad and they killed your family because they are bad.\n\nThe game features a rather robust enemy ranking system known as the Nemesis system. Which is a fairly intricate hierarchy of Orcs; and just like proper Orc mentality there are plenty of power struggles within. So many that I actually lost track of who I was going after. Which brings me to my biggest complaint, being somewhat of a completionist I tried doing all the 'side missions' before starting up the main campaign missions as most of the time those missions lose their strength or potency after the main antagonist is dealt with. I did so many that I actually stopped playing the game completely and took a long hiatus. Only recently did I come back to finish it all up. The power struggles never actually cease.\n\nWhen I went on my hiatus from playing this game I had not even reached the section of the game that enabled you to brand Orcs, which as it turns out is a fairly essential element of playing the game. So if you are like me and try to do all the 'side missions' first just note that killing a leader just makes the inevitability of another Orc coming to take its place that much sooner; and this just repeats even up into the Warchief section.\n\nYou earn ability points and runes which are applied to your weapons to varying effects and I had so many at the time I had stopped I had already pretty much maxed out the character. Essentially I am warning you to stay on the path and do your objectives, there are some weapon challenges that are okay but anything dealing with power struggles that are not something you directly want to deal with don't bother. One nice thing it does is if you fail to kill a leader they remember you and so say upon meeting them again. This is very effective at stirring up your emotions. As well as having the occasional Orc leader that killed someone on your friendslist and gives you a chance for revenge.\n\nThere are a plethora of other things you can do before hunting down your prey like gathering intel from lower orcs and issuing death threats to the higher ups or even branding lower orcs and ordering them to become a bodyguard of a higher orc so that you may have them turn against their charge against their will. Just keep in mind there is always another Orc so its best to keep the ones you have branded alive and in power. Which is the aspect I missed in my first foray.\n\nTHE GIST\nMechanically sound action game, though tedious in spots, monotonous in others. Tautologies willing. With a story line that is not uninteresting set in what is a likely a familiar place to most. Killing Orcs doesn't ever really get boring but trying to play Orc politics sure does. An altogether decent product through to the end.","January 19","true","22.9"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","33","39","10","1"

And that's what you'll be doing for most of the time.\n\nThe meat of the game lies in the nemesis system. I spent more time hunting down orcs that killed me than I did doing the main quests. There's nothing more satisfying than getting revenge on an orc that has killed you countless times while you were in the middle of a mission. That organic style of storytelling is far more intriguing than the actual campaign story. This made Shadow of Mordor feel more innovative than any game in recent memory.\n\nThe graphics are also decently pretty. Textures and lighting look good. The character models for Talion and the orcs also look great. The geometry and level design leave something to be desired however. For a setting as interesting as Mordor, there's not a lot going on. There are no landmarks or setpieces. Just ruins scattered around a relatively featureless map. It still manages to be a fun arena for hunting orcs.\n\nI took several high resolution screenshots of this game.

The highlight of the game is the rather unique Nemesis system, a system that tracks the rankings of every Orc captain and sets up many possibilities for organic storytelling. Furthermore, in large part due to the excellent audio quality (great voice acting, music & combat sounds) the game does a solid job at feeling like a Middle-earth game. The one downside is the repetitive nature of the game, due to the lacking difficulty and unvaried environmental design, but if you are looking for an excellent action game that's all about massacring Orcs and toying around with their political status... then Shadow of Mordor isn't one to miss.\n\nFull review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FGlQKIot8A","October 23, 2014","true","24.6"," 41 of 55 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","41","55","0","0"

I'll cover the good things first, then the bad things, then provide a 'should you buy' in my opinion.\n\nThe good things:\n\n+ The game allows you to create some hella mad unscripted sequences entirely of your own initiative and decisions outside of your missions. I won't give an example for the sake of leaving it to your own experience if you do play Shadow of Mordor but it is simply excellent.\n\n+ The 'nemesis' system and all the intrigue, tracking, killing, backstabbing, setups and everything else within was amazing. Defiantly an element I'd love to see more that Shadow of Mordor executed really well. Two things about this especially was how Captains and Warchiefs would get stronger every time they killed you and could, if you weren't careful with how you went about things, become nigh-on-invincible wrecking machines that you're smarter to avoid born entirely of your own fault, and I love it; another thing is how, if a random Uruk NPC kills you, they get named and are promoted to Captain where they can become an antagonist within the nemesis system.\n\n+ The game, 9 times out of 10, found something to do with the loading sequences. One of my favorite things percisely was how, during the loading screen to enter the game from the main menu, there would be dialogue on backstory.\n\n+ Mordor has simply stunning visuals. Although I had to drop my graphics to lowest in the end for my good'ish computer, what I experienced of even low was great and what I've seen of the higher-end settings are astounding. The animations are also excellent - I looked at the sword drawing and sheating animations in slow motion during pop-up bits in the game and they had such a great attention to detail and modeling; something they defiantly looked into in real life.\n\nThe bad things:\n\n- The story felt rather short. I logged 16 hours on Steam before completing the game and, for what the game is, I was expecting at least 22-24. Although I wasn't being by any extent of the word a perfectionist with my completion I was being very thorough with the Captains and Warchiefs. To put it into another prespective, three of the upgrades required 2.5K points each and I figured I'd get at least half way to the second one whilst saving for them but I only got about 1K away from the first at the very most. For yet another perspective, I predicted that the ending would be a bit of a 'false ending' where the story would continue on as it felt far too soon and not led up to, however it was, indeed, the ending.\n\n- The last two boss fights are incredibly undercooked; I mean Halo 4 Didact boss fight undercooked except arguably a bit worse due to the setting and higher tension; I mean, just... terrible, just astoundingly terrible. The first major boss fight was very well done with the perfect difficulty for the point in the game and kept me on my toes and the second with the 'creature' was excellent; the standard dropped so much come the third and fourth and it's just.. morbidly dissapointing. They also fall on their own sword a bit here as they get you so psyched up to fight the last two bosses with grand battles beforehand and then just... that.\n\n- Although the story was good it was still a bit of a let down. I would have loved to and, quite frankly, expected much more character development and fleshing from the story. More intraparty conflict, a bit more than hints and implications towards a love interest, backstory on the Black Captains, etc etc. On this note, one thing that ticked me off especially was the relationship between the two main protagonists. It felt really unorganic - they were just kinda thrown together with a minimalistic and severely unfleshed approach to the relationship between the two of them and the development of it.\n\n- Come later in the game you have the ability to put Captains and Warchiefs into your own 'Army' as covered in the previews for the game. Using this to control the Uruks from the inside and playing some hella mad intrigue was excellent but, once you got control of it all, there was nothing unscripted that you could do with your Army. Why couldn't I call my men to arms and march on some Captain or something like that, let alone something larger scale for the last two boss fights like in the final flashback cutscenes? That would've been hella rad.\n\nShould you play Shadow of Mordor?\n\nNo, not for the price it's at now. Clear out a weekend, buy excesses of unhealthy food, go hire it from your local video rental shop and lock yourself in your house for a weekend. Between the lack fo multiplayer, high price for a mediocre-to-good experience and short story, you'd probably feel much better doing it that way.\nThe most I would pay for Shadow of Mordor is 40 dollars.","October 4, 2014","false","16.1"," 243 of 400 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","243","400","2","17"

It looked like a shameless copycat of all major titles that sold well.\nOn a second impression that is no bad thing at all. Take the best elements of "Asassin's Creed", "FarCry" or "Watch_Dogs" combined with lots of achievements, challenges, sidemissions, a nice fighting-system and mash them all together.\n\nThe good Beautiful graphics, enough options to tweak performance to your machine. It even supports Ultra-HD-Textures that need at least 6gb VRAM\nBorderless windowed-mode\nExcellent soundtrack and excellent SFX.\nMUCH variety in Uruks. Even after countless slain Chiefs, I still hear new phrases to insult me\nA living, breathing open world. You can't move a meter without anything living there. Uruks blabber of how great they are, how they'd kill you blindfolded, tell each other if they heard the player killed <insert name of story-boss here> and stuff like that.\nEven though there is not much variety in side-missions, they still manage to stay entertaining.\nFighting feels fun and can be challenging depending on your enemies\nCollecting money to pay for skills, finding runes to pimp your weapons and simply killing to level up another set of skills does not get boring fast. And unlocking every skill sure takes some time and commitment.\nIf you at least try to get most of the skills, the playtime is rather long. I'm at 30hrs and i've not even touched the DLCs or finished the mainstory\nGood UI, helpful tutorials without being annoying, lots of lore to discover\nThe bad Sometimes it's damn annoying you have no real "free" movement. In hectic moments it's often hard to do what exactly you plan to do.\nMain story can be considered quite short. So if you rush through the game you'll be dissapointed.\nWith all skills unlocked the game becomes pretty easy. Add the right set of epic runes and you're quite the god. But it's still fun mowing through hordes of Uruks.\nConclusion\nVery much recommended if you enjoyed "Assasin's Creed" or "FarCry X" or "Watch_Dogs" or any Stealth-RPG (you don't HAVE to use stealth though) like "Deus EX HR" or even (a dumbed down version of) "Thief". Or just if you love "Lord of the Rings" (i'm not even a fan and i like it)\n\nBeing a (very good) console-port often shows in clumsy movement, but the game overall makes up for it.\n\nSneaking through an Uruk-Fortress, gathering Intel on a Captain's weak spots to quickly get rid of him to be able to face his Bosss is quite awesome.\nOr even let the chief get away (no loot) but therefore issue a death-treat to another chief to raise his power and chance for an epic rune-drop?\nOr poison the grog-barrels and wait for Uruks to die of their grog, accusing each other of that and then kill each other?\nOr brand (charm=they're your friend and enemies won't notice until you issue the final turn-ally-now-order) key-figures like archers and some nasty fighters and then use an army against an army?\nWhatever floats your boat.","March 15, 2015","true","37.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","6"

Okay no, I'm just yanking your chain. It turns out that Talion and his family were sacrificed to bring back a wraith to the waking world. A wraith that was probably enjoying it's nap before some jerk who looks like my heroin dealer killed a few shmucks to try and... I don't know, catch him in a bottle or something.\n\nThe wraith, having been reading JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and playing Persona games on his down time, thought it would be super cool to roleplay as his favorite Stand by possessing one of the dead people and refusing them the embrace of death. And so begins the journey of Troyion and Spookyface as they exact their revenge on the orcs of Mordor.\n\nBut these aren't your typical orcs, no sir. These are the Senior year High School Rugby Team equivalent  of orcs. Uruks are supposed to be larger, angrier, and all around ruder than their rank and file counterparts, though you probably wouldn't be able to tell considering how easily Tony tears them to pieces. And since the average Uruk goes down the same way I go down for 20 dollars whenever Terry is in their view, it's kind of hard to imagine that these guys will someday lead Sauron's black army through the gates of Mordor.\n\nWell that's where the big thing that was advertised comes into play. Basically the game randomly generates some named officer Uruk's that serve as mini-bosses for Terrance to fight, such as Otrek the brain-damaged or Twerky the Goblin. Each one of these mooks has a set power level and abilities that make them differ from your average Uruk, they also have this novelty where they remember who Tron 2.0 is and what he did to them if they manage to survive an encounter with him. Though the novelty wears off after a few hours, especially later on when you're bottle necked into fighting them a certain way considering they have more abilities the higher their power level is (Or at least that's what I figured.).\n\nOkay now I'm going to say some bad things about this game.\n\nAs overplayed as J.R.R. Tolkien's works are in modern times, Middle-earth itself is a very magical place (No, not that kind of magic, stupid, the other kind). Through the books, yes I can read, the movies, and even other video games, Middle-earth always felt like a real place, with it's own history and people and cultures. It's a place that, even with all it's dangers, you would want to explore and visit, see it's people and locations.\n\nThat magic just isn't there for Shadow of Mordor. I know it's based in the one place in Middle-earth that looks like my bathroom, and it's supposed to be much more grim than it's counter parts, but it almost feels like a cop out, like it cheated and just slapped on the Middle-earth name for brand recognition. It doesn't feel like a game set in Middle-earth, it's far too isolated and lonely for me to care about the settings and characters of the story.\n\nI can't say much about the combat, I mean, it worked for me in the Batman games, and the saving grace for it here is just how vicious Talion uses his weapons on his enemies. It's like somebody killed his family or something.\n\nBut should you play Central-hearth: House of Trogdor?\n\nI say get it on the cheap. If you can ignore all of it's story and play it like some sort of heavy metal inspired fan fiction, then you'll probably get a few hyucks out of it. I would like to see the nemesis system make it's return in another game, though, it seems cool enough for people to do neat things with it.\n\nIntermediate-ground: darkness of Lamb of God gets 16 Troy Baker grunts out of 3 wizards talking about omens.\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n\nAlso, don't forget to visit my Patreon: I don't actually have a Patreon.","September 9, 2015","true","25.9"," 37 of 50 people (74%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","74","37","50","37","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/241930/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The works of JRR Tolkien have seen numerous adaptations across multiple mediums over the years, but none more so than games and more often than not, these have been a blundering Unexpected Journey, rather than a triumphal Return of the King. Monolith’s first adventure in Middle-earth, Guardians of Middle-earth, was less than stellar, but the developer has rediscovered its mojo. Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game, one worthy of standing alongside such classics as Shogo, Alien vs Predator 2, and the No One Lives Forever series.\n\nShadow of Mordor is set between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The game opens with the death of protagonist Talion, a Gondorian Ranger stationed at the Black Gate. After being attacked by Sauron’s forces and bearing witness to the ritual sacrifice of his family, Talion's soul is joined with the spirit of an elvish wraith who grants him extraordinary powers, and apparent immortality. Driven by a desire for revenge, and by a coupling to his mysterious incorporeal companion, Talion ventures in to Mordor.\n\nThe fairly basic set-up is elevated immensely by some superb performances. Talion’s mission for revenge never feels forced, and the slow revelation of his elven companion's identity and past is genuinely engaging. Even the addition of Gollum fits neatly within the narrative, and gives Shadow of Mordor a solid link to the film adaptations without forcing it and smacking players like they were a fish on a rock.\n\nVoice acting across the board is impressive. Orc and uruk captains throughout the game get noteworthy attention. Each feels unique and has his own distinct personality, and considering the huge number of them that’s an impressive feat.\n\nTolkien purists will no doubt take issue with the lore portrayed in the game but it works well and fits in perfectly with Peter Jackson’s interpretation of Tolkien’s works.\n\nMuch has been made of the lineage of the combat and navigation mechanics used in Shadow of Mordor, and Talion did at first appear to be Assassin's Creed's Ezio. Free running and climbing is clearly inspired by Assassin's Creed, but it feels tighter and has more weight and momentum. The addition of some superhuman wraith abilities also mixes things up, and helps the navigation system to be distinguishable from others. Similarly, the combat emulates the core of what makes the Arkham games so fun, but it adds more depth, responsiveness and visceral flair.\n\nExploring the land of Mordor is where the game really shows its quality, and is highly recommended. Collectables, upgrades, side quests, weapon upgrade quests, artefacts, and hunting missions are littered throughout the world. They're a completionist's dream, adding more flavour and some interesting rewards.\n\nTalion has multiple upgrade paths available to him. Not only can he upgrade his martial skills, and his ranged and stealth based wraith abilities, he also can modify each of three weapons with runes, which alter their effects when used.\n\nEverything in Shadow of Mordor is in orbit around its central mechanic, the Nemesis system. As orcs and uruk increase in power they can be promoted to captains. Captains are unique minibosses that can be found throughout the world, and each has his own agenda. They will fight among themselves to gain power, or bribe and bully other orcs into paying them fealty. All of this can be tracked in game using the Sauron’s Army screen, which shows all known captains and warchiefs, their conflicts, levels, and any intel Talion may have gathered about them in-game.\n\nWhere the system really shines is how these captains interact with Talion. A grunt will automatically be promoted to captain status should he defeat Talion in combat. This will allow him to gain new skills and strengths. He will also remember Talion when they meet again. Each defeat at the hand of a captain increases their power.\n\nEvery captain will remember and remark on their previous encounters with Talion, be it victory, defeat, or if they fled. All of it adds another dimension to their personality and further individualises them. What's truly remarkable is how organic it all feels. Each and every encounter seems fresh and completely unique. With Nemesis, Monolith has what might fairly be considered the best emergent videogame system ever made.\n\nThe core story in Shadow of Mordor could feasibly be hurried through in a dozen or so hours, but the constantly evolving and escalating conflict within the Nemesis system and the huge number of side quests can easily double or triple that. In any case, the joy in Shadow of Mordor is not measured in hours played, but in the accumulated swords of defeated orc captains. Shadow of Mordor is a triumph, and even a slightly flat ending and some repetition cannot diminish the overall quality of the game.","October 9, 2014","true","143.3"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsilence/recommended/241930/","mrsilence","Silence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsilence/","394 products in account","Where to start with this game? There are a lot of things I like about it.\n\nThe open world aspect is really great. There is always a place to go and something to do, mainly kill everything in your path though after I got the brand ability, I just ended up branding half of Mordor instead of killing them. Seeing half of Udun or the Sea of Nurnen having more blue markers than red ones made my day, especially when I either a.) made them all attack the other bad guys or b.) killed them all with a button press. The scenery was also beautiful even though I had most of my textures on low (this game made me realize that my once beastly PC needs an upgrade). Its a pretty intensive game, so you'd need some decent/good hardware to run this at maximum settings.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good, its easy to pick up and its not convoluted either. Its like Assassain's Creed, but, imo, better and not so annoying since you are, basically, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off warrior who is out to slaughter everything for VENGENCE. Killing everything and almost everyone you meet is a very fun/good option. Fighting captains and warchiefs was pretty cool, but I really liked how I could make an ordinary orc into a warchief by simply dying to them and then directly (or indirectly) helping them in their challeges and freeing up spots in the the Uruk ranks, making them the strongest baddie in all of Mordor and then getting them promoted to warchief. You don't even need to brand them to do this, they can still be an enemy and there is some sick satisfaction with making them the top dog then breaking them.\n\nI also liked the Nemesis system and how some orcs would come back from being "dead" just to fight me. Although this was more prominent at the begining of the game (mainly due to the skills I acquired later on that, I guess, made it impossible for this to happen) but it was awesome. There were a few orcs that followed me in an attempt to avenge their disgrace, but the one I remember vividly was Duraga the Poet. This one orc was pretty much following me around and attacking me at every chance it had. I fought this orc about 15 or so times before I finally beheaded the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it never bothered me again (I guess having no head kinda kills the aspiration for vengence). But it was cool because it made the game more interesting. Yeah, you can expect some orc captains to hunt you down, but these ones came out of nowhere and ambushed you at the worst of times. I was in a city and the alarm was sounded when Duraga attacked me once and it was a nightmare trying to escape and fight him at the same time, lol.\n\nWith all the good things to say about the game, I do have my complaints:\n\n1.) There needs to be a difficulty setting for the game. At first, it wasn't as easy just starting out, but it became far too easy to kill and wreck everything by the end of the game due to the abilities you can unlock. Stealth was just easy mode and, aside from captains/warchiefs who were immune to it, stealth attacks are basically a one shot kill for everything or do a significant amount of damage. While it is nice to reward the player for not going in swords blazing, I also think that I should have a challenge outside of the warchiefs by the end of the game. I would like to see more aggressive AI in regards to this so that it keeps things more interesting as I could easily get into an area and NOBODY was hunting me down or trying to find me. I just went to them and killed everyone.\n\n2.) More content. You mainly go into two big areas throughout the game. The main quest is really short and also necessary to unlock certain abilities. By the time you have unlocked all quest abilities, you are pretty much 75% through with the game. Most of my time in this game was spent killing things and causing havoc. If I had went for the main quests first and not bothered with the optional quests (there are a lot more optional quests), I would have been really disappointed in the game. There just needs to be more content added to this game, more areas, more missions, maybe even more bad guys with different abilities that kept me from being so stealthy and such.\n\n3.) Nemesis sytem needs to keep up with the player. Above I had stated I was getting harassed by orcs that came back from the dead and some orcs would also come after me/try to find me in order to kill me. But that pretty much stopped not very long after I unlocked a few abilities. I want more Duraga the Poets coming back ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at me because I humiliated them so much. I would also like to see them come back stronger as well.\n\n4.) More aggressive AI behavior. In point 1, I stated this, but I really think that the AI should be trying to seek me out as well. In the beginning, sure, you aren't well known and you are just this silly "Tark" to the orcs. However, by the end of the game, these guys are practically telling stories about you, yet there are no hunting parties of orcs looking for you and no captains trying to claim you head for fame and fortune. Why is that? Shouldn't they be at least trying if you are that amazing? I guess I'm too scary to find by the end game to actually come after...\n\nAside from those complaints, I feel this game is still great and very deserving of the praise it has gotten so far. This game is basically one of the fabled "good" games that spring up every so often and actually keeps you entertained. If you liked Assassains Creed, enjoyed the Lord of the Rings books/movies,  or like open world game where you kill things, you'll most likely enjoy this game.","October 26, 2014","true","58.7"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","28","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/241930/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","Having bought Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor on the strength of reviews comparing its gameplay to that of the Batman series (games which I've all enjoyed and recommend, even Batman: Origins), I can definitely say that although not on such level of quality, this game does produce enough enjoyable mechanics on its own so as to justify purchase.\n\nYou should recognize most of the traditional Batman combat features: hit streaks, counter prompts, vault over an opponent to evade, beatdown attacks and Executions instead of Batman's instant takedowns. What's new is the addition of a bow. You whip your bow out, use Focus to slow the game down, do a headshot and that's an instant kill. So why bother with fighting orcs in the first place? Because midway throughout the game, the focus becomes less about killing orcs than it is about using orcs to achieve various goals; whether it's replenishing your stock of arrows and Focus, gathering information, sending out Death Threats or even to dominate them.\n\nInstead of the strategic approach to combat developed in the Batman series (disable guns and gunboxes, batarangs to temporarily reduce number of opponents, comedy smokebomb in dense room of foes), Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, treats enemies as a means to an end, even if that end is to kill more enemies. Strategic fighting comes from hunting the various orc Captains and Warchiefs, who have their own hidden information sheets listing strengths, weaknesses and special attacks to discover. Thinking up a plan of attack is where the funs at, and taking advantage of the orc's weaknesses is a necessary part of getting higher level weapon runes, which are special bonuses for your weapons. This game rewards proper planning, at the cost of treating random encounters as pest-clearing chores.\n\nSadly, a slew of randomly generated orc chieftans is no substitute for a true end-level boss. The writing is the weakest aspect as you're aimlessly wandering about an open map with a whole bunch of mission icons strewn everywhere. You're Talion; your family is dead, you're somehow undead but looking fleshy, you have an amnesiac ghost elf haunting you and you're wandering around Mordor trying to figure things out and making orcs pay. Meanwhile this game is well-padded with weapon missions, human rescue missions, sigil and artifact collection and even the odd fantasy wildlife hunt with your new found dwarven friend! It's the Assassin's Creed world map device right down to the guard tower/quick travel unlocks, but with even less story structure.\n\nNot having level structures means you're as likely to get bum-rushed by the same 20 orcs early on as you would later but without any of the tools to help dispose of 'em properly. If the Batman series can be chided for too much hand-holding, what with Batman constantly telling you what and how to do everything, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor undeniably has too little. I didn't learn about interrogations until searching for it on the internet. The grab options, similar story. Which missions to prioritize? Hell, if an encounter was too hard I just did something else.\n\nSometimes you uncover some neat synergy. Brutalize is a stealth takedown variant in which you deliver five fatal blows upon an unlucky victim instead of one. Five is the magic number that unlocks special moves (at least midgame), so you can shoot a special flaming arrow into a fire for a huge explosion kill. Killed five? Use another special move: crowd stun, combat brand, takedowns on fallen foes... your pick! Talion has access to a lot of end game goodies: chain executions, twenty seconds of invisibility, multiple arrow-based teleport-executions! Ride a giant troll-like monster and assault an orc fort Godzilla style! Turn high-level orc bodyguards against their master in the middle of combat! Suffer through the early parts and you'll have no end of fun terrorizing orc chieftains!\n\nJust because a game isn't as good as Batman doesn't mean it's bad, even if it does borrow a ton of mechanics from the Batman series. I bought this on Humble Bundle, maybe got overcharged but no regrets. Play the game, start by doing a bunch of non-essential non-story white missions and if you have any questions about anything, check the internet! You should be having fun about two to three hours in.","December 20, 2014","true","69.0"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","32","43","0","0"

The graphics are lush and beautiful and I didn't see any glitches throughout my entire playthrough. The fighting is fun and you can switch things up on the fly and kill an entire fort's worth of never ending spawning orcs once you get the hang of utilizing all of your moves, and there are a bunch of moves. I love the super powered talent for each tree (3 total) of fighting styles. 15 seconds of mayhem once you have killed enough orcs using the style you are charging the bar for (3 seperate bars), and the bar stays charged until you use it.\nWithin those 15 seconds you have unlimited:\n- normal and fire arrows (once you unlock the fire arrow talent) and focus, which slows time down to a crawl\n- dispatch (execution), combat drain/brand, wraith flash, and wraith stun\n- stealth with non detectable invisibility with ability to dispatch and drain.\nThe nemesis system is deep enough to keep you working on it to figure out what killing a captain will due versus using him to send a death threat, versus using him to become a bodyguard to a warchief, versus using him to try to kill that warchief and possibly losing him and his men if he is killed. There is enough story to keep you wanting to play and complete each type of side quest, with the slave quests culminating in a nice coup d'état against the orcs. The more slaves you rescue from enslavement, the more are willing to help you fight in an area where you rescued others previously.\nThey and your branded orc do tend to get in the way of your strikes seldomly, but it is easy enough to overlook a few hits to your allies while fighting off a captain or warchief or band of roving orcs. I really like the two mounts you can use, carragor (a dog like lion that can kill you pretty dang fast) and the two types of graugs (a 30 foot tall cave beast that can stomp and swipe and pick orcs up and eat them for health). I strongly advise unlocking the ability to use shadow strike to insta-mount them instead of doing the quick time event to mount them. You can use shadow strike from pretty dang far away. The only way to unlock that though is to go through almost all of the Hunter quest line with the dwarf.\nThe animation for the CG movies are impessive and well done, drawing and fleshing out the characters with enough talent to make you feel a connection with them. I would have prefered a little more to the last fight, something along the lines of the Fate/Zero anime to really give the struggle to reach the end game and the act of besting the generals of Sauron a little more emotion and impact.\nI feel like if I was to show this game to a 16 year old me, I would probably think the future is amazing and I would have my mind blown. Even against todays best titles, this is one to cherish and share.

Thankfully, there's 3 more campaigns that come with the DLC.\n\nThe gameplay has ups and downs. Combat is incredibly satisfying and really makes you feel like a badass. The wall climbing gets really annoying. You'll find yourself constantly climbing on crap you never meant to or jumping off walls and alerting a whole camp of Uruk. At first I was upset with the map size, then I learned there's 2 maps, both of which are very well made.\n\nDon't let the beginning grind turn you off, this is necessary to learn the game since things can get pretty complicated, especially when you start messing with the politics of Sauron's army.

The final battle is against 2 of the most powerful forces in Mordor and they're fricken QTE events. It's anti-climatic and very dissapointing.\n\nStill, the game is so much fun and I can't wait to weild the One Ring and fight Sauron in the DLC.","May 3","true","24.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","2"

It is mostly inspired by Assasins' Creed movement and Batman series fights. But its a good thing because it takes what's best from those games. The main thing about game which is special is new Nemezis system. It creates orcs with randomly generated skins, bodies, faces and equipment. Each of them got goals and motivations. Some want apreciation of warchiefs and become their loyal bodyguards. Others feel lust for power and by killing other captains go up in orc hierarchy. There are many kinds of mission like feasts, ambushes, recruitments or hunts. Player can intervene in them or just be a simple spectator.\n\nThe world looks great and it feels really alive. Some orcs go on patrols, others feed at campfires, hunt monsters, etc. Game got day and night system, so its possible to sneak around orcish stronghold when Tallion becomes less visible. There are plenty of options to play stealthy game, so players who like silent hunting will be satisfied. Locations are nicely done, and aren't repetitive so every stronghold will look different.\n\nThis game is excellent for people who like making their own story. There is nothing better then got enemy with whom you got a long history of encounters. Even killed orcs captains can get back to game if you didn't decapitated him so some of them could irritate players because of their immortality. But I like this feature, and whole rune, upgrades, ability tree.\n\nIf you like fighting in different styles (open combat and stealth), sandbox games it will surely give you many hours of satisfying play. Maybe it lacks few things in history and some people may criticize Middle-earth game for not being too much depth in fabular way, but I'm very fond of this title.","October 2, 2014","true","14.8"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","1"

Shadow of Mordor is no exception. It boasts an impressive map (divided in two zones), filled with details and areas to explore. The size of the map may not be as large as other open-world video games, but the excellent combat system which can be sprinkled with stealth sections, totally makes up for it. This is not a game that gets boring after the first few hours and I'm sure that along with it's DLC, it is worth buying it. Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor manages to fill the gap between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, while providing a fun game even for new Tolkien fans, as it features plenty of lore of it's own and a natural difficulty scale. It goes without saying that it is a gorgeous game at maxed-out detailling, though you will need a powerful system and 6GBs of VRAM for the best textures. It fully deserves the Game of the Year awards it has received from several publications.","May 31","true","3.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Just about to tuck into the DLC.\n\nBest LOTR game out there by a country mile. Authentic music and sounds like they're straight out of the movies. The voice acting and dialogue is a particular treat. Its quite 'grown up' compared to the movies... Some of the cutscenes surprisingly more brutal than I expected.\n\nSimilar combat mechanics as the Batman games, hit, counter, dodge, quick throw but much more forgiving as most moves can be interupted after you have commited to them and there is even a combat upgrade to allow to get hit once and not break your combo, which saddend me a little, as I pride on not being hit at all in combat games like this but in the end it doesn't really matter...\n\nOnce you get a few of the combat upgrades anyway you are pretty much an unstoppable Uruk head popping / cutting machine. Even on the hardest difficulty the game becomes noticeably very easy, but chopping up orcs somehow never seems to get old.\n\nStealth is odd, all the Uruks should have gone to Specsavers as they can't see you a few feet away and even then you can stealth run up to them and take them out quietly (or not) and there is a bit of AssCred climbing you can do too to position yourself above your foes so you can jump on them and literally traumatise everyone around them.\n\nTo be honest you really end up not using stealth at all because any enemy within radius will be dead in a matter of seconds once you arrive. Stealth is forced on a few of the missions though.\n\nThere are some really nice unique game mechanics when it comes to the mini-bosses like the Uruk captains and warlords that I'm not going to bore you with explaining but it makes this game stand out even more.\n\nHighly recommended experience.\n\n\n\n","April 18","true","32.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

I love games that have great fighting systems (notably Batman Arkham series) where you can rack up huge combo's based on your technique and attention to hits coming at you. Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor has taken the crown for fighting! Not only is it impressive, the gore is outrageously entertaining. The main character is a complete badass and has clear intentions of ripping through his enemies in seek of retribution. You only need proof through looking at the hundreds of screenshots I took during Shadow of Mordor - which brings me onto the next point - the camera.\n\nThroughout any point in the game (including in-game cutscenes) you are able to freeze time and take pictures. Through a variation of angles, distance, styles and effects, Shadow of Mordor provides countless moments of pure entertainment in capturing "The best kill" / "The best environment" / "The best death" and so on. Its an incredible feature within the game, something which I have loved through games such as Fifa and Pro Evolution Soccer, being able to freeze time and take memorable images. Does the HUD annoy you being in every picture? A simple toggle button to turn it off when taking a screenshot prevents distraction. It really, really is fun.\n\nAnother really strong focal point to the game is its enemy ranking system. You will always get the weaker orcs, wildly flapping around Mordor being frightened of near everything within earshot - but they always have the opportunity to strengthen and rank up. This depends entirely on their ability to kill you. Without giving anything away story-related,  your character will respawn & respawn & respawn, each time getting stronger per death. As you fall to an Orc, it gains power. Through power comes strength, and that measely Orc that is scared of everything and pushes its body weight around Mordor waiting to be killed - changes. His armor changes, his attitude changes, he isn't scared anymore. He now has bodyguards and roams around Mordor feeling tougher then the Dark Lord himself. This is a common situation within the game, and outlines the quality of enemy progression. Orcs have their own unique personalities & traits, what they are bad at and what they excel at.. you will find this out for yourself through scouting. But no matter what traits they have - Orcs are deadly in numbers. No matter what level you get to or how good you think you are - they can still kill you. Using a combination of tactics & skills will maintain your capability to overhaul the b*$t@!*s and take victory!\n\nThere is so much more to go into but I will leave it down to you to find that out through your own gameplay. Its an absolute diamond of a game and I would recommend every single person to play - think of a combination of Hitman/Assassins Creed/Batman Arkham Series, then cover that combination with buckets of gore. I am loving this game.","February 16, 2015","true","110.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","17","20","4","2"

Even though the world of Middle-Earth is large and rich in detail, its lore is also incredibly fragile, and bringing certain parts of this world to life can be both challenging and daring. Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ gently takes and respects what fans of Tolkien's work love and puts it in a higly enjoyable action-adventure game that will certainly satisfy fans of the genre and give Middle-Earth fans a more than what they could ever ask for in this jaw-droppingly epic experience.\n\nTHE PROS:\n· The combat is very fluid and satisfyingly brutal. Seperating an Uruk's head from his shoulders and seeing his black blood gush out of his every wound is both entertaining to behold and amusing to perform.\n· Stealth mechanics work surprisingly well. You won't find anything incredibly deep or revolutionairy here, but attempting to take out a Warchief without letting anyone know you're there can be equally satisfying as slashing your way through the hordes of orcs. If you're in to stealth, it's definately worth investigating!\n· I had my doubts about the Nemesis System at first, but honestly, it more than delivers. Any Uruk, any enemy AI you come across, can move their way up through the system in various ways. They can kill other Warchiefs, take the place of fallen Warchiefs, startt recruiting lesser orcs etc. To me this really felt authentic and right in its place in Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ as it beautifully brings the vast world of Middle-Earth come to life, where even the smallest nobody can become Mordor's biggest threat.\n· There is always something to do in Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™, partially thanks to the Nemesis System. Warchiefs will always be causing trouble you can interfere with, but there are also a variety of collectibles and entertaining side missions and challenges to do. I found myself unable to go from point A to point B without being attracted to one of the events or optional quests around me.\n· The story is good, but it's not a game seller. In short: you're a dead man banished from death who is now bound to a Wraith, and their only option is to find out why they are bound together and do something about it. Sounds dull and cliché, but the story will take quite a lot of twists and turns accompanied with epic and gorgeous cutscenes to keep you entertained.\n\nTHE CONS:\n· The combat can sometimes get repetetive and your weapon's runes won't ever really change the way you'll engage fight. Just like in Batman: Arkham City or Arkham Origins you'll try to get high combos and perform brutal and cool finishing moves. It's by no means bad - hell no, it's awesome - but when you're just running through Mordor and decide to battle large groups of orcs, you'll pretty much be able to see it all before the last severed head hits the ground.\n· While the climbing and running mechanics work great, they often conflict each other. Sometimes you'll accidentally climb a wall because you were sprinting close to it, or sometimes, while climbing, you can't get Talion to go where you want him to go. It can be a bit frustrating, but those moments are few and far between.\n\nTHE VISUALS:\n· Although it's a demanding game, Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is absolutely gorgeous. The world of Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is a lively and detailed one, and its visuals do a fantastic job in enforcing this feeling. Definately one of the prettiest games you will play in late 2014.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n· If you're a fan of the Middle-Earth lore, open-world action, enjoyable combat and/or fantasy epics, this one is a must. This is by far the best Middle-Earth game I have ever played, and it definately scratches that itch all of us Lord of the Rings-fans who have been waiting for a good Middle-Earth game. Overal Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is a great open-world action experience that allows for hours upon hours of endless fun. 9,5/10","October 1, 2014","true","26.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

I don't believe I touched any of the DLC content. I played it exclusively with a gamepad.\n\nShadow Of Mordor is a game that starts very strong and slowly wanes in quality. On PC it's a technical accomplishment, the game looks gorgeous and runs like a dream on my high end PC, thanks to a broad selection of graphical settings.\n\nHave you played an Arkham game? Then you've played Shadow Of Mordor. The gameplay is a mixture of open combat and stealth takedowns, both of which are almost entirely cloned from the Rocksteady Batman games. The only differences are minor improvements: SoM allows you to run while crouched, to perform brutalisation attacks which terrify nearby enemies, and to drain health and energy from vulnerable enemies. It also lets you to include archery in your combos without losing your hit streak, which makes for a much more lenient hitstreak system than Arkham Knight.\n\nEarly on, Shadow Of Mordor is a lot of fun. You're free to roam around the flat, desolate plains of the black lands and hunt enemy captains, who can be spotted from a long distance using this game's version of Detective Mode. The combat mostly consists of mashing X towards your chosen target, and then pressing A to hop over them when they try to guard or attack, but this becomes difficult over time. Each hit landed on you drains your energy, and if you don't manage to kill your target you're left to either flee (which often means catching a crossbow bolt in the spine) or to die in the attempt, which means your target gets a promotion and will be harder to kill next time.\n\nAs intended, the Nemesis system encourages you to develop a personal rivalry with these randomly generated Uruks. Some of these fights were surprisingly challenging and required me to think strategically before I attacked, often interrogating orcs for information on my target and then baiting them to places where I could exploit their weaknesses. That aspect of the game is what people in other reviews have praised, and it deserves applause. It's a good first implementation of a very promising idea.\n\nSadly it all becomes rather pointless once you start gaining XP and unlocking abilities. The Shadow of Mordor skill tree has the opposite problem of the Arkham Knight skill tree: instead of having 100 useless upgrades, it has roughly 20 game-breakingly useful ones. I think I can narrow down the problem to three really bad options: the ability to take a hit without losing your hit streak, the ability to stun enemies by jumping over them, and the ability to spend your hitstreak multiple times.\n\nWith these I could jump into a group of powerful Uruks, leap over one, quickly kill him and then spend that killstreak to effortlessly kill two more. After you unlock these abilities, there's no more tension, no more strategy, no more use for intelligence and planning, no more investment in your nemesis. Everyone and everything becomes laughably pathetic compared to your skillset. It's disgustingly easy and, after the initial fun of being overpowered wears off, dreadfully boring.\n\nYou'd hope the game would ramp up the difficulty to keep up with your new skills, but it never does. You remain overpowered for the rest of the campaign. The introduction of "Branding" as a late game ability only exacerbates the problem. What was once a fun adventure, suddenly becomes a repetitive slog through dirt brown levels. The game has 4 boss fights, and each of them showcase the limitations of Arkham-style combat as you repeat your most effective combo against endless goons and wait for the QTE button prompt that hurts the boss. It's horribly disappointing.\n\nThe story has received a fair bit of praise, and I'm not sure why. In spite of paying attention to the dialogue and doing a lot of side missions, I honestly have no idea what happened in the end. My characters motivation was never clear: as a "gravewalker" he talks a lot about ending his curse and being "at rest" with his murdered family, but his existence doesn't seem particularly torturous, and he enjoys using his new undead abilities to pursue bloody revenge. Ostensibly the villain of the story is The Black Hand, but what exactly that is never gets clarified. In the last act of the story this problem reaches a fever pitch, where I found myself doing things without any context as to why they were being done and exactly what they symbolised. It's a frantic, hurried mess.\n\nThis game has no difficulty settings, nor any potential for modding that might make it more difficult. Some people might recommend that you play with self-imposed restrictions, and I imagine that it might be fun to play the entire game without spending upgrade points, but I don't feel tempted to replay Shadow Of Mordor just to find out, nor I do want to play any of the DLC I got as part of the GOTY package. The lack of challenge is a huge problem, and no amount of graphical fidelity can make up for it.\n\nI bought this game for £10 during a sale, and it's currently available for £30. I'm going to recommend it based on the fun I had in the first 12 hours, but I'd discourage people from purchasing it at full price unless they absolutely love the Arkham games and don't have a problem with games that fail to challenge them. I think this game is sadly over-rated, I bought it based on the hype and while I agree that the Nemesis system is a great idea it only remains compelling for as long as the game is difficult, which isn't long at all.","May 15","true","24.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DurtiiDeemun/recommended/241930/","DurtiiDeemun","Shit Stain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DurtiiDeemun/","356 products in account","Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor is one of the biggest surprises of the year as it provides a very lore filled experience to any Lord of the Rings fan coupled with great gameplay and setting.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is where SoM shines with its combo based action. The combat is all about timing and someone who reacts to prompts faster will survive a lot longer. There are a few QTE scenarios but they aren't overplayed to the point where it gets annoying. You can go full stealth or go in and rampage as you slice and dice and chop the heads off of those orcs. It is extremely satisfying with its exection system and the upgrades and skill trees provide a nice buff to your abilities without making you completely overpowered. Travelling across the game isn't hard as there are mounts as well as fast travel.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics of this game are pretty good. It isn't anything that'll blow your socks off but the landscape are nice enough. The characters are extremely high in resolution compared to the rest of the game world but that is ok as fast travel load speeds (for me) were always less than 2 seconds.\n\nSound/Music\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. Many times when music was playing I was reminded of the music in the LORT movies. The voice acting is superb from the humans and especially the orcs, their voice actors definitely did a good job portraying the voices. The sounds of executions as your blade carves the head off an orc to the sounds of animals are all really well done.\n\nContent\nThere is enough content in this game to keep you going even to 100% (which is what I'm striving for). The content is all there, simple but challenging enough to make you want to finish the game. The main story isn't as long as I thought it would be as some have said they've finished it in 15 hours but I finished mine in around 10, but regardless of the story, the game's content with the nemesis system will keep you going for a ways to come.\n\nSummary\nMiddle-earth Shadow of Mordor is definitely a game you should be looking to get this year as it's one of the biggest surprises of the year providing me with more fun than I've had in the last few months. It is one of the best LOTR games and is a definite must buy for any LOTR fan.\n\n9/10","October 5, 2014","true","14.4"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","24","35","0","2"

Now bonded with a mysterious wraith, the two undead set off to hunt hundreds of Orcs (or "Uruks") in their endeavor to bring down the dark lord Sauron before the same evil influence that cost Talion his life and family brings ruin to all of Middle-earth.\n\nWelcome to the shadow of Mordor.\n\nIn this game, your fights and upgrades will work like the brawling system does in Arkham, but to my delight this game feels much harder--Uruks are sturdy foes, and Talion can't just strike and evade his enemies one at a time like I all too often did in that series.  Foes will commonly rush you all at once, such that one of the first things you must learn is how to counter multiple attacks at the same time.  The numerous ruined "strongholds" within the game's open world are large, and they have plenty of spaces to climb around and hide in.  The game map itself is not really all that small when one considers that these buildings make for some excellent *vertical* level design instead of leading to endless flat space.  Fans of yanking people off of high places in the Splinter Cell games will be right at home.\n\nThe game's centerpiece feature is its Nemesis system.  Every Uruk you fight can potentially have a name and his own set of strengths, weaknesses, and even fears.  Basic enemies can usually be defeated traditionally but can also end up dealing amounts of damage that would make Dark Souls proud, especially in the early game when you have few health upgrades.  Mordor has a power hierarchy similar to the "Deck of 52" arrangement of VIP targets from an older game called Mercenaries.  In this game, however, it's not a scripted arrangement.  If you kill an established Captain in this hierarchy, another will eventually take his place.  If an enemy 'kills' you, you don't get a game-over screen, since you're technically already dead.  Time passes, more Captains fill vacant ranks or try to attack one another for power and influence, and you resurrect at one of a few locations around the map.  These also serve as fast-travel points, keeping you from having to run everywhere while also keeping the world large since you can't just warp to any given location in an instant.\n\nThis is not a game that opens with a bang and spends the rest of its story desperately trying to match its starting level of greatness.  Most of Shadow of Mordor's best features don't come until the later hours of the game, but without wanting to say too much, you can eventually gain more and more influence over Mordor's central power structure and reach the point where the game feels like a simple simulator.  Want to take over the mind of a Captain (or possibly his Captain--an elite known as a Warchief) and have him attack someone else?  You can eventually learn to do that, and you sort of end up creating your own missions, for which the game doesn't usually have hard-and-fast failure states.  Want to pit one Orc against another and then decide you want the second one's help and the first one's head?  Speaking of heads, the game puts its gore to an actual use, since several means of restoring your health revolve around making your enemies' heads explode.  As with the excellent system in The Darkness II, this game doesn't let you recover from all of your mistakes simply by hiding, but you also don't have to worry about where to regain health, which you can regain from your enemies.  Mordor also has a variety of plant life, which can be used for restoration and is given enough paragraphs of lore to feel like it fits in the setting.  Yes, there is pipe-weed.\n\nCaptains add a strong variety of challenge that Arkham and Assassin's Creed really could have used more of.  Some of these are immune to stealth attacks or your arrows--or can be killed instantly by them--and some even shrug off your sword altogether.  You can find all this out using the game's version of Detective Mode, provided you've gathered enough "intel" (from items or from interrogating certain enemies) to learn this information.  Going back to the level design, it's fantastic--the strongholds give you a very wide variety of options for how to take control of a situation.  Want to shoot an arrow at a campfire and detonate it like a bomb?  Why not shoot a bag of predator bait and unleash wild beasts upon your Orc foes?  Or jump on the back of one of these beasts and ride it?  Or cause a swarm of angry flies to terrorize them?  Or silently dominate the minds of the archers and turn them against their new foes?  Likewise, the game knows how to keep you on your own toes--if you simply want to brawl, take care that certain enemies don't run off and activate a stronghold's alarm contraptions.  Otherwise, THIS happens -- http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=328629152 -- and you end up with a few dozen enemies, their bosses, and THEIR boss angrily calling for your head.\n\nYou'll notice that the Captains each have their own one-liners before engaging (or after defeating) you, making them feel even more like actual characters even though their appearances usually aren't pre-determined.  Over the course of the entire game, I think I heard the same line maybe twice.  Unless you're very good at stealth, enemies are often smart enough to react to you no matter what you're doing.  If you grab enemies, for example, their fellows will shout a warning to keep out of your reach.  The voice acting for nearly everyone in the game is absolutely fantastic, and considering I've been "inverse-spoiled" by games like Mortal Kombat 9 and Mass Effect 3, I'd almost forgotten what excellent acting really sounds like.  When they're not fighting you, the Orcs have their own conversations, which can repeat but are still extremely well done.  They complain.  They insult each other.  They talk, in a sort of reverence, about your actions around Mordor.  They even have their own drinking songs, which are hilarious (and you can learn to poison their drink).\n\nThe game also has other things to do, most of which involve finding special items that, as with the plants, have their own paragraphs of lore and do a great job of developing some of the characters.  The "challenge maps" take place within the larger environment, but their borders are clearly marked on your map so you know where not to go if you don't want these special missions to reset.  If you want to feel like a real hero, you can also run around freeing slaves, and if you ever played Morrowind and thought, "I wish I could actually join the Twin Lamps and be an abolitionist of death," this may be something for you to notice.  The slave missions actually have their own subplot and are given in an order, such that their ending is arguably more epic and satisfying than the nonetheless fine conclusion the main quest has.  The main plot, of just the right length, isn't hugely necessary to The Lord of the Rings, and if you want to ignore it and just run around killing Orcs, feel free.\n\nI saw a commenter on Polygon complain about not seeing enough women in one of the trailers, so to relieve that all-important worry, they are in the game, they're interesting, only one of them gets a damsel-in-distress mission, and she's so strong even during that point that she almost doesn't need the help.  At one point, Talion reunites another man with his own wife, who is safe and sound, and Talion doesn't need to say, "I miss Ioreth."  It's written plainly on his face, and the game as a whole does a wonderful job of this less-is-more presentation.\n\nI'm out of room.  This game is an absolute treat, it feels downright special, and I hope it proves widely influential in the years to come.","November 6, 2014","true","64.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

You spend your time wandering the lands of others and inflicting misery upon them either directly showing up to ruin other people's fun or getting something else to do it for you.\n\nThere is considerable diversity in the options available to you to help in this goal, and as a whole it is quite fun and well-designed. You can be sneaky, learn more about your targets, and then exploit that knowledge by capitalizing upon the weaknesses of others. Or you can just go in swinging and planning to cause as much mayhem as possible, though this can sometimes prove dangerous as you are in a land hostile to your intentions and there is always a danger of being overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Both methods are great fun, and of course random occurances in an open world can allow for some quite amusing and unplanned encounters.\n\nIn short, you spend your time in this game spreading misery to others for the sake of your own pleasure and amusement. I suppose you could follow what passes as the story, but ultimately you will likely find yourself distracted as you come up with new and interesting ways to cause mayhem and chaos.\n\nI think I'm gonna play this for a while.

However, I don't know if I can recommend it. Its kind of boring and a bit monotone. The Nemesis system seriously doesn't do anything, at least in my game's playthrough because the game was so mindnumbingly easy. I rarely EVER failed to kill an NPC that I wanted to kill so I never really see it being a big issue. (Note: I literally killed the warchief and all of his bodyguards without the whole backstabbing/dominating/etc. In fact, I killed ALL the warchiefs without even having to dominate a single person.)\n\nThe good:\nThe game is very well polished and it shows. The combat is excellent. Its very much like the Batman series. Counters, combos, etc. Its very smooth and fluid and is a pleasure to play. You feel epic and powerful when you do the things correctly. The characters are well sketched out, predominately the orcs that you play against and the voice acting is literally some of the best work I've heard in a long, long time.\n\nThe cape is nice?\n\nThe meh:\nThe Nemesis System isn't that impressive. I get what they were trying to do and it is a good foundation, but it is not nearly where it should be or what people think it is.\n- Let me get to the point. The nemesis system is the selling point for this game and it doesn't sell very well. It is hardly memorable. The problem lies I guess with the game's core/fundamental failure which I will get to in a  moment.\nThe graphics are good, but they're not spectular. Honestly, its sort of like Batman or Sleeping Dogs with HD Texture packs.\nNothing groundbreaking from a high-end gaming PC perspective.\n\nThe bad:\nThe biggest failure of this game is the game is too bloody easy. Literally. On a scale of 1-10 with ten being the most difficult game and 1 being easy, I rank this at a solid 3. I plowed through this game with minimal effort. The game has no harder difficulty setting that I could find.\nI mean I guess I could intentionally die and power-up the orc chiefs/captains/warchiefs to get stronger, but I feel like that's a cop-out. Really, I should be rewarded with playing well, but the game gets way too easy. I died maybe 3 times the ENTIRE game and that was because I was being stupid and running around blowing up barrels to see what I can do in the middle of a fortress with the ENTIRE fortress coming down on me.\nThe fact that you can buy the last level powerups (the sword, bow, and dagger, unlimited executions without a skill tree requirement or prerequisite) basically meant that all I had to do was save up for that single powerup and then the game went into mind-numbing easy  mode.\nThe music was also very bland and forgetable.\n\nAlso, the storyline is simply forgetable. (I am aware it was intentional so that people who have no exposure to LOTR may play the game and like it and LOTR fans will like it also because of the nodding of the head at various plot points.) However, the game's script and pacing is just boring and awful. Eventually, I felt like I was just plodding through the game just to finish. I could care less about the ending or what happened. The voice acting may be top-notch, but literally the writing is god-awful. Sleeping Dogs had a MUCH better script and storyline, in my opinion.\nI forgot to mention, I think I know why the game's story was so boring. Basically I thought about it today after work and came to the realization that the majority of the major storyline is basically GIGANTIC tutorials. They simply are tutorials on how to use a skill. Case in point a lot of your skills are locked until you progress through the story/mission and all of them can be named as such: (1) How to tame a gaugr; (2) How to Poison Grog barrels; (3) How to Brand an Orc; (4) How to Dominate an Orc; (5) How to Make an Orc a bodyguard; etc. There is no real emotional development or plot/story development, which results in you not caring because in the player's mind its "Oh another tutorial, time to zone out and follow directions/instructions and just do what the button queues tell me to do."\n\nThat is hardly a good way for you to make the player engaged in the story when you train them to think that the storyline is basically a tutorial.\n\nAll in all, the game is well done and well polished. I think its an excellent entry/new IP but honestly, its only about 60-70% of the way there.\n\nI give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.\n\nUpdates for comments/clarification:\nI am not saying the game isn't fun or it isn't a good game. I'm saying for what the game producers and makers goals and what they were going for it isn't simply there yet. It is sort of like the very first Assassin's Creed vs. Black Flag (which I believe is arguably the best title in their series). Black Flag or AC Brotherhood was a much better polished, developed, and I guess more matured/well defined game. This game is an excellent IP don't get me wrong, but the bar it tries to reach wasn't reached in this game.\n\nI think its worth a buy (but honestly not at its full price at the moment). I got it on sale because of a screw up at $29.99. So yes. I think its still worth a play but not at the full price at the moment.\n\nFinally, I am not a 15 year gamer. I'm just a veteran gamer? So basically, a game should have a good curve of fun/difficulty and I should feel like I got value out of the money that I spent on the game. Currently, I feel that the fun/difficulty curve is too shallow and the value I got out of the game is moderate to mediocre at best. The fact that the game doesn't have a difficulty setting that can be adjusted makes me kind of cringe. Yes you could manually try to make the game harder, but I don't see the point in intentionally dying. (I already have the HUD turned off...)\n\nFinal Update:\nI played this game to 100% completion (I.E. All survival missions, all hunting missions, all outcast missions, fully upgraded, etc.) I would recommend this game if it was on sale. Its a good game and overall I would recommend people to play it but not at the current full price. There's way too many things that make this game a good game and not a great one. Granted, its probably the best currently in this new generation of games, but I would say its simply a good game and not a great game and stand by my review at 3.5 out of 5.\n\nThe TL;DR version to clarify on why so many people might be upset that I played this game throughly and still wouldn't recommend it at the moment.\n\nThe game is fun and is good, but there is a serious problem with the game overall.\nThe game's primary selling point is the Nemesis System. The game's reward curve and overall lack of control/customization on the difficulty level of the game, results in an over-abundance in rewards and a lack of challenges. This results in the game no longer being challenging, which causes the player never/rarely to die, which in turn causes the game's PRIMARY SALES POINT (the Nemesis system) to be a secondary characteristic.\n\nBasic questions I asked.\nWhy did I buy this game? Nemesis system and how it looks.\nIs the game fun? Yes.\nShould you play it? Probably.\nIs it worth the hype and the money for the Nemesis System? No.\nIs the Nemesis great or impressive? Don't know, the game's difficulty level (or lack thereof) made it pretty much a non-existent factor in my playthrough.","September 30, 2014","false","47.5"," 765 of 1,398 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","765","1","0","85"

In some ways it’s a shame, because while Mordor does invent a refreshing spin on the open-world genre, it also does a lot of the small things right to create an overall polished and enjoyable experience.  Mordor is an open-world game developed by Monolith Productions, a long-time -- but rarely noteworthy -- developer from the Pacific NW.  This time Monolith has created an outstanding Lord of the Rings action game which hits all the right notes.\n\nAfter a brief and well-executed tutorial, the player is quickly thrust into the land of Mordor; the evil wasteland wherein the main villain of Lord of the Rings, Sauron, makes his home.  Besides Sauron, there’s also orcs -- a lot of orcs.  You have a sword, dagger, and bow at your disposal, and the majority of the game is spent fighting through swaths of Sauron's brutish pawns.  Combat in Mordor is pretty much a straight copy from the Rocksteady Batman games.  It’s an excellent system that works well in this environment, and Monolith did a great job of nailing the aspects of what makes that system work; animations are fluid for practically every scenario, timing feels precise, and you always feel in control.  What’s more, combat kills in Mordor are executed with a bone-crunching, heads-flying brutality you won’t find in the Batman games, and it’s really satisfying.  Even after 30 hours of slaying orcs, a slow-motion zoom in shot of me lopping off an orc’s head never got old.\n\nStealth is actually done pretty well too, and the bow mechanics feel tight.  Mordor never feels like it’s getting in your way; they make some smart tradeoffs with character movement and climbing, making them easy and quick in lieu of realism.  As the game progresses, you’ll unlock ways to make your character more powerful and more dynamic.  By the end, there are tons of approaches to every situation, and even more impressive is that I was actually *using* the large variety of skills available to me. The different methods of combat and infiltration are so accessible and easy that it encourages experimentation until the very end of the game.  I did feel as though the late game abilities were so powerful that it made the last few hours of the game too easy, but in some ways it was fun just to shred through hundreds of orcs in dynamite fashion.\n\nMy exposure to Lord of the Rings is admittedly mostly based on the movies; I’ve read the hobbit and parts of the trilogy, but it was clear even to me that much of the story is structured to disturb as small of the lore as possible.  The story is bland and uninspired and the small cast of characters feel pretty one-note.  But the story here is not the main attraction, and in fact, the real fun comes from the narrative that you frequently will spin yourself using the Nemesis system.\n\nThe Nemesis system is an inventive mechanic wherein strong and noteworthy orcs are added to a constantly rotating pool of captains.  Each captain is given a name, VO, personal strengths and weaknesses, and a ranking in the pecking order, which creates a depth to each individual orc.  Orcs who manage to kill you are rewarded with greater power, and you can be sure that they’ll taunt you the next time they see you.  The result is that you end up creating your own narrative with the orcs from your story, which is often more entertaining than the ones the writers create for you.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the Nemesis system makes Shadow of Mordor stick out from the open-world masses, but it deserves a lot of credit for being an all-around outstanding game.  It’s true that it wouldn’t be as remarkable without it, but Mordor still impresses with a very tight combat system which is great fun and does an impressive job of encouraging experimentation.  The beauty of this fusion of polished, inspired mechanics with it’s own unique ideas is that Shadow of Mordor feels bigger and better than the games which inspired it.  I highly recommend it.","November 4, 2014","true","28.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Branding them and make them fight each other!\nShadow of Mordor is an action-adventure game that mixes Assassin's Creed movement with Batman's combat and your goal is to ..... kill uruks all day long because there is nothing else to do\n\nEven though the gameplay is fun, there are a few things that ruined the game for me ... at the start.\n\nStory and the protagonist\n\nYour family got killed ... you are also dead... but then you got ressurected by a Wraith and now you seek vengeance. And while you see vengeance you are working together with some NPCs to fight Sauron. Most of characters are so bland and forgetable that you may end up not paying much attention to them. At least they manage to make two quite fun characters in this grim and dark game : Ratbag, a cowardly uruk who wants to become a warchief. and Torvin, dwarf-hunter that wants to kill every living beast in Mordor... or send the said beasts against the uruks. Hell, even a lot of uruk captains got more personality in there taunts than the protagonist!\nStory seems to serve as tutorial.. why else some of the cool skills like branding uruks or taming monsters will be locked behind it? And the overall goal in your revenge is to : kill the chieftains on first map and brand them on 2nd map(and then the same happens in DLCs) .\n\nDifficulty\n\nNow this truly depends on the player. If you are familiar with the gameplay you may start looking at ways to handicap yourself if you want to have a challenging time. Oh, and lets not forget the rune's DLCs that gives you handy epic runes... that make killing captains for runes quite pointless ...\n\nStale World\n\nYou can quite easily run out of uruk captains to kills unless you : 1. Die a lot 2. Manually advance the time.\nIf you complete the game and get back to urun slaughter you prolly gonna need to Advance the time quite a lot. You may kill all uruks on one of the maps, then go on the 2nd and kill them there, come back to 1st map and notice only 1-2 new captains while everybody else is dead. Now if there was a little time advancing after every event you take part in then it would be better.\n\nEnough about the things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.. lets see the good stuff now\n\nGameplay\nMoving and Combat\n\nBoth are fluent.. at least for me.\nAs said game got the Assassin's Creed movement(or pick any other game that got the same stuff) : You can run,sprint, move silent,hide in bushes, climb on almost everything(if you face it in the right way) and you can jump from heights without dying. Sadly uruks arent athletic as you are so you can run away from them with climbing with an ease.\nAnd combat is Batman(insert any other video game title with same stuff)like : attack,block,counter,dodge and special moves. And the special moves are thanks to the wraith because Talion is a mere human.\n\nUpgrades\n\nAs every big game nowadays, there are upgrades in here. The design is well made but sooner or later you will unlock everything. For special attacks you need to do missions for XP and kill captains for Battle points. XP gives you points to unlock, Battle points unlocks higher tier skills.\nIf this isnt enough then there is also attributes which increase your HP,Arrow count, Focus(for when using bow) and unlocking rune slots on your weapons and later on the active skill on your weapons.\nLast but not least, Runes. You can get runes by killing captains.. or by buying(or both) the GOTY edition... Sadly some of DLC runes are pure cheat(allows you to use your weapon skill right away? dafuq) . Runes got levels, high level = better stats. The level of the dropped rune depends on the power rating of the target. Max rune level is 25(though you can also get 26 but its no different than 25 in terms of bonuses) . There are also epic runes which are rare and got no levels. Runes offer you some kind of a playstyle but their variety is low.\n\nUruk hunting\nNow this is trully the fun part.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel is good to be obtained before you engage a captain. It reveals you his strength and weaknesses (Weak to stealth? Jump from high,1 shot stealth kill, collect the run and hit the road while Uruks wonder what dafuq just happened).\nFor more challenging you can do it and without intel but then you will get lower level rune. If bored some weakness can add quite a lot of fun, like setting the captain on fire.\n\nEvents\n\nYou can find captains either in free roam or in an event they planned. In free-roam you play hide and seek with the Uruks but during event you can either make them success so they can raise in power or just kill them. There are only a handful of events but still adds a bit to the game.\n\nWarchiefs and Strongholds\n\nIf you want to aim high.. aim for the warchiefs.. which you can find in their stronghold ... and appear only if you annoy them enough by killing their supporters or destroy stuff... and when they appear you better be fast on your feets.\nStrongholds can be alarmed if you let the uruks reach the alarm ... when they do you will end up with endless stream of uruks to kill (jolly good!) . Then you have warchief that appear with his guards(if you didnt kill them before that).\nWarchiefs + Alarmed Stronghold = Intense action. You can eithe run or kill the warchief... and then run :D or kill slaughter everything until you get tired.\n\nBranding\n\nAs said earlier, its  funnier to make ppl uruk fights each other than killing them all by yourself. So later in the story you will learn to brand enemies aka corrupting them aka they will follow your order which is , kill everything not branded.\nYou can brand anything in the game. If you brand a captain you can send death threats to other captains, or you can brand a captain and make it a bodyguard to a warchief.. do it 2-3 times.. face the warchief and turn his BGs against him\n(one time one of the captains just 1shoted the warchief!).\nOr you can send warchieves to fight each other.\n\nOverall\nIts a fun game but trying to find something else in it might be hard at times. I envy you if you can spend more than 4-5 hours at once without getting bored.","June 23, 2015","true","26.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Yes, nemesis.  Usually I just sit back and grind through a batman style game with a bit of ho-hum and my feet up on a chair.  It's a cinematic enjoyment.  I don't get too deep into it.  Sort of like how my 6 year old girl binge watches My Little Pony, it's hard to stop watching even if it gets kinda cheesy.  Often, I need some enticement to get into these type of games. Maybe a bit of craft beer - which paraphrasing a facebook post I saw is just an excuse to call my drinking problem a neat hobby.  Again, I have to reiterate that word - nemesis.\n\nWhat happened?  I died...and to my shock an Orc...what looks like a level 7 archer...has leveled up on me.  Over me to be exact.  That was wholly unexpected.\n\nAnd it happens again and again.  This is nemesis.  You don't just get to start over, there are consequences.  Revenges.  And some tedious S.O.B's who not only level up, but level up SEVERAL TIMES on me with no open attack option whatsoever until you get some intel on them or happen upon their weakness by accident.  This is what makes  Shadow of Mordor great.  There is a love to this grind.  And now, I honestly doubt I can play another batman game without it.\n\nBeyond that, there is a good - and I am no Tolkien scholar here - storyline of  a fellow by the name of Talion who is vulcan mind melded into a Elf-Human-Not-Quite-Dead captain that goes on a quest to take down the armies of Mordor single handedly ( although with a twist ).  We also get a few cameo quests with Gollum and a few bosses.  Yep, you heard that right.  A FEW bosses.  And not really tough bosses at that, yet I love this game nonetheless.  There are also giant thundercat-sidekick looking animals called caragors and some Rancor monster wannabes called graugs that after some questing are available for both riding and mayhem pleasures.  Plus, a great character named Torvin who is a dwarf of what sounds like Scottish decent and a crack up orc named Ratbag who makes a potty joke.\n\nThe storyline can be completed linearly if you like, or not at all which is the way I played.  After only 3-4 quests I just starting taking on every single side quest for...um...10 hrs before I went back to the story.  It was that much fun killing orcs.  Except when I lost. Then all my hard work disappeared in a flash as the entire orc army I had decimated filled up the ranks all over again. Yet, by the time I was halfway through the story quests I had max health and 3-4 runes on my sword, dagger, and bow.  Good fun all in all.\n\nLater in the game you have the option of sabotaging the ranks by brain washing...ahem *branding*.. and that is a happy happy joy joy time if I have ever had one.  I think I preferred sneaking around and branding orcs more than killing them. If done well enough, victories were very fast too.\n\nAnd then you have to take over the whole army.  Sneaky style with the branding of the captains.  This can be easy or hard, depending on how you wish to do it.  I did a mix of both.  And in the end, messed up as I branded so many orcs that the last warchief I was supposed to brand got killed in battle and I had lost all the branded captains in the process.  No quest completion! I had to brand a new captain, promote him through the ranks, and prove himself in battle to fellow orcs.  And yet I did not complain.  Well.....whined a little, but no complaints.\n\nSo, it's a great game.  Is it perfect? Absolutely not.  The last two story quests are super easy and there are not enough bosses.  Yet, this game is probably the way I want to play a batman style game for the rest of my life. I still have the season pass DLC to finish, and the Bright Lord story is playing great so far, but still working on it.  Will save that for a different review.

You play as Talion, a Ranger of Gondor, who, along with his family, were slain by the Black Hand of Sauron. But Talion is banished from death thanks to the elven spirt of Celebrimbor, whose actually pretty important to the story of the Middle Earth franchise. United by their goal to kill the Black Hand, Talion and Celebrimbor ascend upon the land of Mordor and annihilate the Orc armies of Sauron. The story has a typical revenge scheme premise, and the occurence of events is just as predictable. Though I'm sure any Lord of the Rings fan will find it interesting, it's definitely not what you'll remember about playing this game.\n\nWhat you'll remember about Shadow of Mordor is the amazing combat system. It's a mix of the free-flow system of Arkham and the sword-play of Assassin's Creed but it's better than both. Sweeping through hordes of Orcs will never, ever get tiring or dissatisfying. Through some of the combo abilities you're able to pull off, you can brand orcs to help you, drain their health, or flat out swing your sword into their neck. The addition of gore and decapitation physics is just the icing on the cake.\n\nAs astounding as the combat system is, it's made even better by the Nemisis System, probably one of the most original ideas in any recent video game. It's basically an active hierarchy of orcs that will level up and be promoted as they complete quests of their own within Mordor. You can choose to intervene on some of those quests, and if not, you risk that Orc being promoted. The higher up an Orc gets, the harder he is to kill, though that doesn't mean he won't have a weakness. Every Orc in the nemesis system is for the most part, unique, and will even remember you if you died in combat to them. It adds an unexpected monivation to not die or pursue certain targets, because if you're not careful about which orcs are promoted you are going to regret it.\n\nEverything else in the game is pretty good. Stealth is as good as you can expect, beast-riding is superfun, bow and arrow combat works well, and the open world is filled with a good variety of content without being overwhelmingly filled with things to do. Overall, Shadow of Mordor is an awesome orc-slaying simulator that's worth playing not for the story, but for the pile of bodies you're going to produce once you're done.\n\n8.5/10 - Not quite full price, but definitely worth it any discount.","March 1, 2015","true","36.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","3"

NO SPOILERS HERE. :)\n\nPros:\n+Story is great with some great characters.\n+17 hours to complete the main story, all major side objectives, and find all the collectibles.\n+Stealth is so much fun and the game gives you so many ways to approach objectives.\n+Combat is Solid and the hitstreak abilities are super awesome.\n+Wraith abilities are SO cool!\n+Nemesis system is amazing. This is how you incorporate procedural generation in games properly. More games need to follow Shadow of Mordor's lead on this.\n+The collectibles have purpose (bonus M currency which allows you to unlock certain upgrades and bonus backstory/lore tidbits).\n+Branding orcs and having them fight for you is the coolest thing in any game ever. Killing a warchief with his own bodyguards! HA!\n\nCons:\n-Some of the collectibles that give voice acted dialogue backstory force you to stay in the menu if you want to hear it. No walking around with it playing in the background.\n-Final boss is a quick time event, but there were 2 big battles and a stealth boss fight just before it though so this isn't a huge issue really. I was just a little disappointed by it.\n-If you rush through the main missions and ignore everything else you're gonna have a hard time.

It's the ultimate Tolkien game experience so far. And there is the Nemesis System, which is amazing and is a pretty good new mechanic to gaming. The combat is acrobatic, gory and cool, there is a good satisfaction in ripping off a orc head. There is parkour too. The tooks 30 hour to complete 100%.

I really enjoyed War in the North and was expecting something similar, instead I have what can best be described as assassins creed in mordor.  It takes a little getting use to but once you've got the hang of attack and run you can slaughter your way across the map with impunity. Ride those caragors into battle for extra firepower and stealth kill with wild abandon.\n\nIn its own way its a fun game, and some of the missions can be tricky, but as you grow in strength and abilities they get easier. Fire pits that explode and of course the nicely stacked barrels all make for good diversions and equally good killing zones. Swordplay is simply and effective, with the animation of the attacks initially quite entertaining.\n\nIts a good game in its own right and i'm having fun with it, but somehow its not quite as compelling as War in the North. Admittedly you have a more open environment and you can scale walls with ease and jump from ridiculous heights but part of the magic is the story line and although there is one, it just doesn't catch me the same way.\n\nWill play to completion, but to be honest unlikely to pick it up again afterwards, certainly wouldn't play it through again multiple times..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/241930/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","This game is FUN. If Monolith was going to hit a homerun with any one aspect of the game, they certainly did with the combat along with the touted nemesis system. I never got bored of killing orcs, even after finishing off the map objectives and the various achievements. I find this was partially due to the progression of combat upgrades as you go through the game. It is immediately obvious how every new ability or rune is going to help the player in an engagement. By the end of the game previously dangerous multi-captain encounters become a lot more viable to survive through, and the number of risks the player can take dramatically increases. The level of difficulty decreases significantly, but I feel that the game never got easy enough to be boring. Especially true if you change your mindset to “can I survive this battle” to “how stylishly can I win this battle?” That all said, once fully powered with all of the upgrades, there isn’t much the game can throw at the player to really pose much challenge.\n\nThe addictive combat carries the game through the bland story missions of the game. The voice acting and cutscene animation feel like wasted efforts on this game which really doesn’t seem to want to know what it wants to tell in terms of a plot. The missions just feel like excuses to kill orcs, which for the most part is all I really needed from them, I suppose. Most of the time you’re just given an npc to follow and a general objective to do x of y things while killing orcs. It would have been nice to have a little more variety and a stronger finish to the plot. The game certainly ends on less than a whimper. The ending is so quiet and abrupt that it’s hard to even be mad. But still certainly something that should be much improved in a future entry. The side missions suffer from a similar problem, but I feel that the limited scope of those tasks was generally more acceptable. Specifically, the slight difference in focus of the sword, bow, and dagger side objectives were interesting enough to make me want to complete all of them without it ever really feeling like a chore. The slave-rescue missions did, however, get a little long in the tooth and I found myself counting down how many more I had to do to finish out the bar. Never a good sign. The colored plant collecting also seemed like an undercooked concept. By late game all the plants were just a health restore and the color and type hardly ever mattered.\n\nThe size of the maps in the game are also limited, but I didn’t really feel that the scope of the maps was strictly an issue. They were compact enough to not be tedious to cross or explore, but more damning was that they were lacking in interesting landmarks and came across as a somewhat bland. The general aesthetic of the areas were good and some of the vistas in the second map especially were really quite beautiful. It just feels like a waste to pepper the land with same-y looking ruined buildings and strongholds that felt like they could have been randomly generated. It felt like they started with a blank plot of land and took too few passes adding and subtracting from the template.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the orcs found within the nemesis system were highly varied and interesting. Not only that, but the emergent personal storytelling between the various players and their nemeses help to supplement the weakly written story of the game itself. The sharing of unique experiences among the various players is proof enough that the nemesis system, to some extent, provides a more interesting narrative (or at least collection of stories) than what is explicitly written. In fact, I feel like the greatest ‘story missions’ of the game were ones that simply let the player have full control and allowed any method to complete an open-ended goal involving the warchiefs. The game also does a great job in transitioning the player from participant within the nemesis system to director of the orc armies throughout the course of the game. Moving from simply experiencing being hunted by a specific orc or some such and going to manipulating the system through branding was really neat, and I only wish that branding opened up sooner. The late unlock of this ability didn’t really bother me, but I also saved a lot of the side-objectives for the very end of the game and likely didn’t have to wait as long as players that began completing those sorts of things much earlier than I did.\n\nTruly a game that is narrowly focused on its primary gameplay mechanics. The tertiary components are, as a whole, somewhat lacking. Depending on how much you value the aspects of storytelling and world building, that could significantly affect how you take to the game as a complete product. Even the music seemed a bit like an afterthought. The extent to which one enjoys the game's central combat and orc army manipulation systems will determine the extent that they forgive the other shortcomings.","October 5, 2014","true","29.9"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

On the contrary, the game doesn't really try to break any new grounds regarding gameplay but is inclusive about different styles of play within it's approach. I feel like Assassins Creed and Batman Arkham games were slapped really hard together.\n\nThere is to me what feels two modes to the gameplay, the exploring/sneaking scenario and the attacking/under attack scenario. The exploring stage the player is allowed to choose their own mission (which many are available throughout). One can continue the storyline, explore side stories about the wraith for example, go on missions to slay captains and weaken Sauron's army, or missions to build up RPG elements of your character. A neat feature is going after orc captains. As you kill captains you gain power, but as captains kill you they gain recognition for their efforts. There is a pause menu that gives information about these individuals. The other menus consistent of runes that power up your sword, bow, or dagger are also easy to navigate. To add a cherry on top, the player has the ability to improve their skills in certain areas, such as being able to run faster or do certain attack combinations. There is a lot to do, but when it comes down to doing it I find the game play can be a lot of pressing x followed by countering with y. The fight system is good, just lacking I feel at times. The scenes where the player kills the opponent are nice schematics to watch, but can feel repetitive over time.\n\nThe graphics are spectacular as the environment immerses you in the game. Guards that watch over slaves are heard interacting with them or even chasing them. These graphics can demand quite the work from your graphics card.\n\nThe game is good and would recommend purchase on sale. As stated before, it is a good game and offers some neat elements, however it's failure to go over and above sort of limits it's rating. What saves it's rating in some aspects is that it did slap multiple game-styles together.\n\nRating 7.9/10","April 7, 2015","true","12.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCaptainPrice/recommended/241930/","RealCaptainPrice","Captain Price","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCaptainPrice/","109 products in account","NOTE: Long Review. Sorry.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the great Batman Arkham titles, you will love this one. The functionality is very nice, and one of the cleanest I’ve seen in a while. The main combat is a lot like Batman, so if you’re a retired Batman Veteran like myself, you will have no problem switching  to this game.\n\nThe open world is also very neat. It gives a Mordor feel, as if you’re right outside Mordor in the   Haradrim area.  For the most part, I feel like most of the map is the same, but it doesn’t bother me too much.\n\nThis game also has a handful of difficult creatures that you can hunt for and defeat. The trolls are extremely hard to kill at first, due to your skills not being upgraded enough to defeat it. It also has some other creatures that can be a challenge at first.\n\nThe leveling up in this game is also very fun. You can get xp to level up your character’s moves, battle attacks, health and weapons. You will find that your character is really weak to begin with, but will be invincible at the end.\n\nNow I’d like to point this out. Coming from someone who has read the Lord of the Rings books, this does not follow the books. It’s a Lord of the Rings influenced story, with Lord of the Rings Characters, in a Lord of the Rings game. It does but it doesn’t feel like Lord of the Rings. But I feel like I can say that for almost every Lord of the Rings game. No one, has been able to pull off an image that Petter Jackson designed after making the Trilogy movies, you just can’t beat them. However, it does follow Tolkien's ideas, in fact I own a LOTR book which has a bio on everything in Middle Earth, and the story of Celebrimbor is true, and follow's accurately.\n\nThe campaign was enjoyable. I’ve always wanted to know more about Sauron which this game explained more. The game wasn’t as campaign influenced like the Batman games. They’re more like quests that build off another to build a story. After playing some hours, I recommend playing more than one campaign quest at a time, so that it feel more like a whole story. Instead of one here and there.\n\n\nAlso, this game goes on sale almost every major Steam sale there is. It’s been as low as $12.49, on more than one sale. And, that it’s the GOTY edition, meaning all DLC, which gives more to the game and more replay ability. I highly recommend this game, it’s been one of the better games I’ve played in a while. I’d also like to mention this. There are lots of people saying its optimized bad. It isn’t. People also say its GPU demanding. It isn’t. You just need decent gaming specs. My specs are listed below and I was getting 40fps-60fps on medium render resolution.  Hope you liked this review, and again, sorry it was a little long. It was just too hard to say everything I wanted to in a short review. As for this game deserves a good review. Thanks for reading and I hope you’ll like the game!

It's not, not even close.\nIt's an interesting system that I can't wait to see expanded even more in future (eventual?) titles.\n\nOf course, it has its limitations and in the long run you'll start noticing some repetition, but it's still noteworthy. Uruk's dynamic hierarchy, an *enormous* amount of aesthetic differentiation and their ability to memorize their previous interactions with you (in a simplified way, of course, but it works) all contribute together to make mooks feel like real characters who play a part in your story. Sometimes even a memorable one.\n\nBefore I familiarized with the system enough to learn how to exploit every single weakness the game even manage to give me my actual nemesis.\nThis ♥♥♥♥er of a hunter captain started as immune to melee attacks (which were at first the only subsystem I was somewhat familiar with) and opened his way into becoming a virtually un-killable beast just kicking me on my teeth every single time.\nHe wasn't just hard to kill, he also dealt a ♥♥♥♥-ton of damage with his poisonous spear, and he turned constantly out of nowhere even when I was facing other commanders.\nHe became my nightmare until I had a chance to exploit his only actual weakness, which was fire and explosive stuff.\nAnd of course he never stopped remembering me how many times he already kicked my ♥♥♥ or forced me to retreat.\nWhen I finally got how to deal with him and managed to kill the sucker I cheered, then I had to stop for a moment to realize "Goddammit, how cool was that?".\n\nNow, for the bad parts. What I liked the least about the game (beside the dull plot and the long-term sense of repetition, which to be fair is almost inevitable) was the Assassin's Creed-inspired collect-a-thon garbage.\nI get it's optional stuff, but Jesus Christ, when you are designing a world and your idea to fill the map is "We should totally put in dozens and dozens of shiny spots that reward you with 50 exp each one", you need to stop and reconsider what you are doing.\nComing just out of Dragon Age: Inquisition forced me to think how much this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to design content is becoming popular for some inexplicable reasons.\nThe worst part: not a single one of these boring activities lead to any climax with a final reward. They are literally there just to be there.\n\nHere's my suggestion, dear game designers: the next time you feel like you need to hide "treasures" in the game map, don't bother with hundreds. Put in ten-twenty of them at most, but be sure that finding them is a bit more challenging/interesting and the reward a bit more exciting (alternate weapons?, unique upgrades? alternate outfits, maybe even with their unique bonus/malus? etc).\nYou'll be surprised by how much more "filled with cool stuff" the world will actually feel, even if there is factually more empty space.\n\nAnyway, I'm overall pleased with the purchase and I would recommend the game.\n\nP.S. In case you are on the fence because of the similarities, it'w worth noting that I can't stand Assassin's Creed games and I still enjoyed this a lot.","December 30, 2014","true","100.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Each Ork will remember each encounter you've had with them.\n\nThis game is worth getting just for this mechanic alone. Also it's combat mechanic is based on the FreeFlow combat of the Arkham series. So it's a combat system that's easy to learn but hard to master.\n\nTalion has many different means of attacks to dispatch the Ork menace:\n\nLike getting into the thick of things then you can build up your combo and instantly kill orks with some flashy kills.\n\nStealth kills your thing, then you can hide in some bushes and wait for an unassuming Ork to come across your path giving you the perfect oppurtunity to slit their throat.\n\nDon't like been touched or have issues with personal space then you're in luck you can fire a rain of arrows upon thine enemy at a safe distance. Or just attract some caragors to rend Ork flesh from bone.\n\nToo lazy to lift a finger? Then you can dominate your foe's to have them fight for you. How efficient is that!\n\nThere's also a story in there about a dead man and a dead elf joining forces to take down the Dark Lord Sauron's Black Hand.","March 15","true","101.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Extremely polished combat system that is just ripped right off from the Batman Arkham games, but then slightly improved for maximum smoothness and fluidity. It's entirely possible to fight a group as big as the game can handle rendering, and if you're on the ball it'll look easy. Really enjoyable gameplay elements, not too obnoxious on the collectables, and some RPG elements as many games of this sort now have to give you a sense of reward for time spent and a sense of progression.\n\nDefinitely recommend it on a sale, might even be worth full price if it were still the month it came out :)","April 25","true","29.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As hack and slash as this is, you can really take your time and enjoy it! The A.I, density of NPC placement, and excellent side missions combined with cut-scenes and cinematics make for plenty to do and it's quite fun to side track into just playing with the Orc A.I and seeing what they will do to try and catch you when you don't have long to play.\n\nThe Stealth is excellent and swordplay deep enough to warrant more hours than required to complete the actual story. To compliment this, the dark army and warchief system allows for limitless hours as you hunt down and eliminate the various ranks posted within the Shadow of Mordor. The only complaint that I have seen is that things get repetitive after some time, but I found that is more of player perspective as I found countless ways to experiment in sneaking, killing, maiming, ganking, and exploding my enemies. I still haven\'t even finished the story. The last thing I will mention is the outstanding in game camera that provides excellent screenshotting fun as well. My friends and I have a ton of fun sharing them with each other.\n\nThis was another excellent job by FERAL and they are to be commended for their support.\nI had no issues to speak of running this game on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

This game does a good job of explaining the story line too so you don't get lost at any point.\n\nThe visual quality of this game is fantastic and all the models and textures of characters, creatures and other wild life are great.\nThe game is split into two maps which are both very large and open to exploration/free roaming. There are some side missions/challenges that are fun to do. You can also create your own missions by targeting certain Uruk captains or warchiefs and killing them off.\nThe combat style of this game really impressed me, some compare it to assassins creed and I can see why. However, it is much broader than that as you have loads of extra abilities to unlock and you can use surroundings and distractions to your advantage. There is a great stealth and tactical element to the game and you can, most of the time, stealth your way to anywhere you want if you play it right. The game will tell you how to use these distractions but its up to you how well you use them. You are also able to ride certain beasts which is always fun!\nThe "sauron's army" section is really cool too as it shows you how an Uruk army might work, there is lots to do thre as well once you are able to "brand" or "dominate" uruk captains and warchiefs.\nI haven't encountered any sorts of lag AT ALL while playing this game which i was very happy with.\nMy PC has 8GB of RAM, 4GB 770 GTX Windforce GPU and a i-3575k CPU just to put the "no lag" into perspective.\n\nPlaying about 24 hours of this game I have encountered 1 map glitch and another very minor glitch during one "legend of Urfael" (side)mission. Both were easy to solve as one was falling inside a wall, all i had to do was teleport back to the wraith tower and the other one is more complex to explain but it involved me having to distance myself from "branded" uruks in order to allow me to kill other "branded" uruks lol.\n\nLastly, I have tried two of the DLCs so far and again the storylines of those are great and they delve deeper into Middle Earth Lore as I expected. There is actually quite a lot of extra content as they provide you with lots of extra missions. However, they don't bring any new map locations to the game, but that isn't disappointing really as i didn't expect new locations.\n\nOverall the game quality is amazing and the missions are very varied in objective, i recommend this game to everyone who enjoys free-roaming and also loads of combat stealth or not.

I absolutely adored my gameplay experience - to the point that I gave SoM the #1 spot in my Top 5 games of 2014.\n\nThe aesthetics are beautiful - the amount of detail in the characters and game world are very well-done. When it rains for the first time, you will be in for a nice treat - the raindrops flicking off of your feet and body have a nice effect. The blood and gore come in copious amounts, enough to satisfy anyone who enjoys mutilation and flying body parts (in slow-motion too). The sounds, music, and voice acting are superb and add to the immersion into the ME universe. The story is satisfactory - your typical quest for ultimate vengeance - but there definitely is a lot of lore to be found within (especially in the numerous side missions).\n\nThe controls are not too difficult to familiarize yourself with, especially if you've played any games in the Assassin's Creed/Batman Arkham franchises. The keyboard and mouse combo work perfectly, but I personally prefer the controller. There is a helpful tutorial that will show you the beginning mechanics you need to know, and more are provided whenever a new element is introduced to the game. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with open-world action RPGs. I would recommend anyone with experience to play on the hardest difficulty to increase immersion - I found that mid/late-game the game took a big dive in difficulty. The game has a certain way intended for you to play - interrogating enemies to find the weaknesses of stronger chiefs - however, I found that after ~10 or so hours of playing, I could just blitz through and go straight for the orc chiefs (brute-forcing them even if I was using an ineffective strategy). From what I've seen in the online community, many people will actually let themselves die to force enemy leaders to level up (even then it wasn't too challenging). I will admit, the journey to achieving a god-like character is fun and gruelling - in my first few hours, I would run away if I ever encountered 2 or more leaders simultaneously, now, I will purposely run into as many level 15+ (20 is the max) chieftains as possible (and still barely break a sweat).\n\nGameplay consists of you doing a variety of different missions throughout the kingdom of Mordor. There are  two main map locations you will be frequenting, the second typically providing higher level enemies. Like most open-world RPGs, there are a large variety of side quests available, each having a bit of text flavor explaining something to do with your player character (ex: how he snuck into an encampment and assassinated everyone; the flavor for a stealth-oriented mission). If you are familiar with any of the Assassin's Creed/Batman Arkham games, then gameplay will feel very similar. You can usually choose to use violence or stealth when traversing through areas/missions, but be aware that you will face a sea of enemies should the alarm be raised. To avoid this, a good strategy is to move toward the alarm and kill anyone attempting to raise it (even hitting them will stop the alarm process).\n\nCombat is very, very fluid and looks fantastic. You have a heavy and quick attack, counter, dodge, and can use a bow and arrow. Later, you will be able to unlock new abilities when you gain enough experience to level up. Abilities include throwing a set of daggers, phase rushing (can upgrade to phase insta-kills that you can chain), and mounting special creatures. Combat while mounted is also a lot of fun. Stronger enemies will drop item runes that you can use to augment your equipment.\n\nOne of the nicest, unique features in this game is the Nemesis system. The orc armies have a hierarchy, and each individual will make different plays to try to climb the ranks. If a normal orc kills you, they will immediately be promoted into the hierarchy (orcs already in the hierarchy will become promoted). If you continue to die to the same orc, they will gain strength and levels - they will also make comments whenever you reappear to fight them, ranging from confident taunts to sheer horror at you refusing to stay dead. Sometimes, an orc leader you kill will come back after being defeated (yes, even from getting their head cut off). They will usually have a battle scar related to the injuries you gave them (scratches, bandages, etc) and will make a comment. Personally, the Nemesis system seemed a bit lacking for me because I very rarely gained a nemesis - even when I purposely died to enemies. Perhaps I was just killing everyone too quickly, I am not sure. The most times I've seen the same orc leader come back (from death, not just from retreating) was twice.\n\nAs you progress in the story, you will unlock the ability to "brand" enemies. Branding orcs will cause them to fight for you when you activate them, causing them to go hostile to any nearby unbranded individuals. You can even brand orc leaders, and this is typically a very popular way to farm top tier runes. For example, you interrogate a normal orc and identify an orc leader with a weakness that is very easy to exploit (like weakness to fire). You then brand this orc and get him to rise all the way to orc warlord (highest rank) and help him with missions until he is level 20. After summoning him, you can insta-kill him by grabbing him or activating his suicide mode, most likely causing him to drop a top-tier equipment rune. Personally, I just liked finding the coolest looking orcs and making them my warchiefs. They will even have different ways of speaking - my absolute favorite orcs do not even talk, they just laugh, or breath menacingly. Orcs will also vary in appearance, attack preference (heavy shield, ranged, poison, etc), strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nThe highest-ranked orc leaders will generally have other orcs in the hierarchy as officers - these individuals will appear alongside the leader should he be summoned. To make confrontations easier, it is advised that you either kill or brand all of a leaders' officers first. Regarding the difficulty, I eventually would just go straight for leaders without touching their officers to make the battle more challenging. After a time (like when you die or the next day arrives), orcs will move in and replace empty spots in the hierarchy. If you are quick enough, it is very possible to (temporarily) eliminate the entire hierarchy.\n\nOrcs will conduct missions against one another, which can you can interrupt by activating the respective mission waypoint. An example of a mission is a duel between two orcs - the winner gaining power and the loser usually dying (unless they retreat). If you wish, you can help one side, or just kill both combatants. Be advised, an orc that successfully retreats will increase in power. When you have a branded orc, you can interrogate it to learn weaknesses of hierarchy members (the warlords require interrogation of ranked orcs), or order it to conduct a mission against another orc. You can even command warlords to fight other members of the hierarchy - and they will bring along any of their officers.\n\nThe missions you play also have an effect on Mordor. For example, liberating captive humans will slowly cause overall resistance to increase. As a result, humans will be more likely to help you fight the enemy.\n\nOverall, the game plays very smoothly and does not demand an unreasonable amount of skill or concentration to be enjoyable.\n\nABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]\n","May 26, 2015","true","35.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvaBeatrice/recommended/241930/","EvaBeatrice","eva is addicted to ogrewatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvaBeatrice/","351 products in account","In all honesty, this game should be renamed to Orc Slaying Simulator or something similar.\nShadow of Mordor is a very interesting take on the events that occur between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, and I enjoy how the story fits in with Tolkien's world. However, the story itself was somewhat short for my liking, maybe only taking 10 hours or so of my total gameplay; the rest as I before mentioned, orc slaying. The story follows, Talion, a ranger living with his family and others in Mordor, who are overrun by Sauron's forces, leaving Talion on a quest to fight back against Sauron. The story then follows Talion and a Wraith who he is paired with as they quest across mordor in seek of answers and salvation. Like I said, an interesting story, yet a little short for my liking.\nThe gameplay is excellent, and there are many things to do in the game: kill Orcs, ride beasts, kill Orcs, find collectables, kill Orcs, etc. And even though I keep talking about the game simple being about Orc slaying, it's still very enjoyable in the many ways you can kill Orcs, and even use Orcs to kill other Orcs. My only issue was I found the controls a bit clunky (I use a keyboard and mouse), but when playing with a controller that problem was removed; therefore, if you have a controller, use it.\nThere are only two other issues I have with the game, one being that it's too easy (in my opinion anyway), and the other being that the fact you can choose your character somewhat ruins the game. The hardest part of the game I have to say is taking on high power orc warchiefs who are immune to ranged and stealth attacks, making fighting them in the field the only way to kill them, however even then, I can simply manipulate all the other Orcs into fighting him, and basically get all them to do the work instead. This may be a bit picky of me, as you could say I could just not use the other Orcs, and yes that would certainly make it harder, but even in the strongholds, I can easily escape a fight without dying. I'd just like to see the game being a bit more challenging that's all.\nThe other problem is the character selector the game has, in which I can choose to play as one of the female characters who appears in the late game, which just sort of breaks the game when you're doing missions with her, as there are two of her then. It also sort of ruins the cutscenes, as you're Talion in the cutscenes but then this girl in the game. Maybe again I'm being too picky, but it just seems like a completly unecessary feature.\nAnyhow, I certainly enjoy the main game, and I'm looking forward to the DLC. I recommend all of you RPG, Stealth, Slasher, and Tolkien fans out there buy this game up.\nPeace.","January 4, 2015","true","22.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rogue_arbiter10/recommended/241930/","rogue_arbiter10","Kieger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rogue_arbiter10/","402 products in account","As many have before me, I cannot reiterate how Shadow of Mordor combines the best of two great fanchises, Assassin's Creed and Batman's Arkham series. Stunning graphics, fun gameplay, great controls, the fact it's open world, and the new nemesis system all make this game fantastic. This game is far from perfect however, as the gameplay can get repetetive after a while, and the lack of a difficulty setting makes the game harder to replay.\n\nThe nemesis system works great on paper, but in practice, it is rarely utilized. I remember when I was first starting out, I managed to die to a random no name Uruk while trying to bush assassinate him, promoting him to captain and making him far stronger than any foe I had previously faced. While great and all, I finally was able to kill him after realizing he died instantly from stealth finishers... The problem however, is that it is fairly hard to die. The only real reason I actually died to my former nemesis in the first place was because I was new to the game and didn't fully understand the last chance system where when brought to fatal health, you are given what seems to be at least 3 or 4 seconds to move your mouse into a circle and press the shown button. First of all, there is a rune (modification for your weapon) that gives you a second last chance, and second of all, you are given way to much time to execute this action, and once completed you regenerate around maybe half your health? Usually in these situations, I would simply run away and collect an herb (health kit basically) to regenerate to full.\n\nThe game also goes from being a challenge to being fairly easy midway through the story which isn't too bad. That brings up the main story, which to me, seems a bit short (around 16 hours to complete for me) based on the nature of this game. Of course the length really depends on how much exploration or side quests (which there are plenty of) you do. However, this opinion may be somewhat biased as I am currently playing through Arkham Origins and Skyrim. This is not that bad however, as the DLC included in the GOTY edition adds much more unique content (I am guilty of not actually playing this content, so I can't fully review it). By the end of the main story, I still had at least 8 or so abilities not yet leveled and many upgrades not yet purchased. The many side quests ultimately are not necessary for completing the main story.\n\nThe story itself however, was very interesting to me (a semi avid Lord of the Rings fan). This game in fact, taught me the difference between skipping cutscenes and not. The voice acting, sound effects and AI overall are just amazing.\n\nAfter all those negative remarks you may be doubting this purchase. That however is not what I meant to convey. Though not perfect (as no game is) this game was a blast and is definitely worth your while. One of the best games I have played so far, and I would definitely reccomend this game to others. There are definitely things the game could have improved upon, but overall, I would rate this game 8.5/10\n\nTo put this in perspective, if a harder difficulty were introduced, this would probably be a 9.5/10","December 6, 2015","true","21.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

As for other gameplay aspects i really enjoyed the jumping, climbing and combat which took me back several years when i enjoyed the Assasin's Creed Series. Stealth killing orcs from ledges, awesome combat with cool combat finishers really made the game cool.\n\nI started a 2nd save with more of a serious gameplay where i wanted to collect everything, and now after playing trough the whole game, i have around 17 hours on my save two, where i now have 100%, just collecting, roaming trough and killing orcs, doing side-missions, unlock abilities and upgrades just made the game complete. Exept the final boss-fight, i really enjoyed the game, and i would recommend it to others, buy it. It's worth its money.\n\n9/10","October 20, 2014","true","27.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I had played previous LOTR games and was mildly amused by them. Buying this game, I expected the same mild amusement.... until I played it.\n\nThis game turned out to be far more amazing then I expected it to be. The fighting in the game is easy to just hack and slash your way around, but difficult to truly master - with effective and rewarding bonuses when you master your timing. Many of the negative views I've read complain about how easy the fighting is, but those folks apparently didn't take the time to try to master it, or invest in the bonuses. It was extremely fun.\n\nWhat makes this game truly great is how it adds to the story line. I am one of the sad, unfortunate souls who has never taken the time to read all the Tolkein books - I've only seen the extended releases of all the LOTR and Hobbit movies multiple times because I enjoy them so much. This game adds to those stories, by giving you insight into the great war, the black gate, and other known points of interest in the movies.\n\nThe mission system is easy to use and understand, the various 'generals' in the orc amies and all the various collectiables give you lots of variety - there is always something to do. The missions also employ different play styles. You can be ranged DPS with your bow, mele dps with your sword, or stealth with your bow and dagger - with great bonuses for all styles that you could invest your experience into.\n\nI read another negative review complaining that the black gate area was too small, but it should be noted that there are 2 other 'lands' that you get to progress to. So, if you get board in the first area (the black gate area), do the gold missions, and progress the story to visit the new lands. The story is quite good and progressing it gives you access to new, exceptionally fun powers (mind control anyone?) as well as new missions and mission types.\n\n10/10 for a job extremely well done.

On top of the gameplay being fun and fresh, everything feels perfectly polished.\n\nIt plays a lot like the recent Batman games with a mix of stealth and melee combos. Over time you gain super powers which allow you to scrap with large hordes of enemies. Moment-to-moment the game is fun whether you’re sneaking, fighting, or running to your next objective of choice. The side quests sometimes feel grindy, but a for the most part fun challenges that can get you to try out a different play style.\n\nThe innovative system that constructs unique bosses that build a history with the player is a Holy Grail that game designers have been chasing for decades and now it’s finally working! In the coming years you’re going to see this idea stolen all over the place. Between the randomized strengths/weaknesses, shuffled cosmetics, and huge array of vocal responses they become personal and interesting enemies.\n\nI’m not usually a fan of cut scenes, but these are quick, well written, and beautiful. I don’t know the historic difference between the words ‘orc’ and ‘uruk’, but I know that uruk is annoying to say and not recognized by spellchecker. The writing and acting in the chatter/barks has a great sense of humor. You can still hear a little of old Monolith’s No One Live’s Forever in the dialog.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that the many systems and upgrade paths feel overly complex at first. I wish they were introduced one at a time, but eventually it comes together and makes sense. The arc of the story feel like it falls short of being epic, but I’m not huge on Tolkien so most of the backstory is lost on me. Or maybe it will get bigger in the upcoming DLCs.

Too easy? Don't get any health upgrades and turn combat indicators off. The innovative Nemesis System crafts  foes worth killing, some Uruk Captains surviving your battles with scars, some ending up as heads on pikes, some growing in power and deadliness after killing you (you are reborn with a thirst for revenge each time you die) and some secretly serving you, waiting for your signal to stab their War Chief in the back as you shoot out their eye with a ghostly arrow from the front.

I played Return of the King on PS2 and that was really fun at the time, and War in the North was an ok game but certainly lacking in many areas. So being the best LotR game isn't exactly a hard thing to do, though Shadow of Mordor is actually a very good game.\n\nA lot of people have compared this to Assassin's Creed but I'd say this is much closer to Batman Arkham games, though all these games do share a lot of similarities but still are very unique and do what they do really well.\nWhat SoM does extremely well is the Arkham style sneaking and combat, and at parts even better thanks to nemesis system and how it changes the game. You counter with Y(played on controller) like in Arkham, and you also can do instant takedowns once hit streak is high enough. Talion also has a cool bow that later on gets the ability to teleport to the target and kill the orc instantly, this is really fun to do. Stealth also works like in AC, you can climb stuff, take down enemies etc.\n\nNemesis system is the innovative part of the game. Orcs have kind of this hierarchy with chiefs at the top. Later on when you get all the powers at your disposal, you can really start taking down this hierarchy and through branding, taking over enemy orcs, you can infiltrate the enemy and build your own army. This is really interesting as every encounter is different, I was genuinely surprised how much variation there is, as in no repetition at all as every orc I encountered was different, had different skills and the way to approach them was different. You can also buff the enemies up by issuing death threat through one of the orcs, the orc you death threat powers up significantly but also gives chance to drop a epic rune that you can fit in your bow, sword and dagger to power them up with different perks.\n\nThere is a lot more to the nemesis system and how it works, it's really something that has to be experienced as it's different from anything else, some true innovation and something other devs most likely will be taking note of, at least I hope so.\n\nSoM is solid game and I do recommend playing it just for the nemesis system and combat/stealth elements. But the story, world, characters etc. just left me disappointed, I didn't really care for anything happening and the interactions between characters were awkward and not well build. I wanted so much more from this as this is set in Lord of the Rings universe. There was so much more they could've done and made something much bigger, but I just feel like they played it way too safely.","October 18, 2014","true","29.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/241930/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Shadow of Mordor is what you get when you cross Batman Arkham with Assassin's Creed and wrap it up in the Lord of the Rings universe.  While lore purists may scoff at the prospect, the game actually does a very good job incorporating existing lore while paving its own way forward.  You play as a wraith-posessed ranger out to take revenge on the Black Hand while learning about the wraith's past.  It's a bit of an odd situation but it adds a lot of gameplay variety.\n\nThe game takes place on 2 reasonably-sized maps which you have free reign of.  There is never any shortage or orcs to kill since they respawn extremely quickly, sometimes visibly on your minimap before an area is out of range.  Even considering this, the map rarely feels cluttered but there is still plenty to do with a wide range of missions, side missions, collectibles, and challenges.\n\nShadow of Mordor uses a freeflow combat system very similar to the Batman Arkham games and pulls it off quite well.  While it does not have quite as much variety due to a lack of combat gadgets, the combat feels great especially thanks to some impressive animation work and responsive controls.  Overall the combat is pretty easy especially after obtaining a few upgrades, though the game makes it quite difficult to defend against ranged attacks due to only vague indicators of the attack.  Controls are very responsive except for the dodge, which will not interrupt attacks like countering does making enemies with uncounterable attacks difficult to deal with.  Orc captains, however, can be very dangerous especially with ranged attacks.\n\nThe main strength of the game is the Nemesis system, which surprised me since going in I was expecting it to be one of the weaker aspects of the game.  This system procedurally generates the leadership of the orc army giving each captain and warchief a name, strengths, weaknesses, and dynamic conflicts between them that you can interfere with as missions.  Any orc who kills you will also receive a name and be promoted to a captain.  While I was expecting this system to quickly become repetitive, it actually produces a lot of variety.  Each named orc will taunt or boast at you when you encounter them and I did not have a single line repeated through the entire game.  While the conflict missions themselves are fairly limited, they are mostly optional.\n\nGraphically, Shdaow of Mordor is a bit of a mixed bag.  While the animation work is very impressive and there is a large variety of orc appearances that removes the common "hey I've seen that enemy before" feeling that most games have, texture quality is not very good and it requires 3 GB of VRAM to run on high textures.  There is also an ultra texture pack that requires 6 GB but it apparently hardly changes anything.  Thankfully the game runs extremely smoothly and performs quite well.  The only other open world-type game I can remember running this smoothly is Tomb Raider.\n\nThe only big problem I had with the game is the mouse support.  Mouse control is very inconsistent with some mouse smoothing applied and the mouse sensitivity varying wildly in different situations.  Thankfully this is not a shooter so it doesn't interfere with gameplay much.  The one place where this really would interfere is when you are aiming with the bow, though the mouse seems to behave itself there.\n\nI highly recommend Shadow of Mordor.  It is definitely one of the best games to come out in 2014 and probably the best Lord of the Rings game to date even though WB is trying to separate it from canon by not using "Lord of the Rings" in its name.  Now, back to killing orcs.","October 9, 2014","true","38.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Shadow of Mordor is a continued story based on where the Lord of the Rings finnished off.\n\nThe story is really good and being a fan of the Lord of the Rings, Shadow of Mordor really made sense stroy wise and I really enjoyed the new characters that were introduced and how they refer back to old characters from Lord of the Rings. Overall 10/10 for the story line.\n\nThe action and combat system is unreal and I felt at home just after a little while playing. The combos are insane and you can really rank your abilities to draw one mean ♥♥♥ combo that will destroy an entire Uruk army!\n\nThe ranking system is broken into two sections which require different tasks to rank them up and unlock new abilities. How to unlock new abilities is really straight forward to understand and really fun to do.\n\nThe side quests are really enjoyable and take some time to complete which in my book is great because if you want to take a slight break from the story then you can try out some challenging side quests before carrying on with the main stroy. Some of the side quests are hard so prepare yourself and hold on to your paitence levels.\n\nThe maps are great and there is a lot of exploring to do and the layout allows you to use the enviroment to your advantage during combat which I really liked a lot. The creatures that dwell around are amazing too and really add a great impact to the general map feel.\n\nOverall the game felt like a 10/10 for me and I am really looking forward to the follow up on the Shadow of Mordor in the Future.","December 27, 2015","true","62.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ricmadeira/recommended/241930/","ricmadeira","ricmadeira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ricmadeira/","2452 products in account","Shadow of Mordor (SoM) is, hands-down, my game of 2014 so far; I loved every minute of it!\n\nSoM is a sandbox game of combat & stealth, infiltration, manipulation and assassination, set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth. It's been described as Assassin's Creed with the combat of the Batman series, but it has some original and innovative features. It's an AAA game so the graphics are as good as you'd expect and they don't seem to have forgotten about the PC; we have enough video options to push our most powerful graphical cards to the brink.\n\n\nMy favourite aspects:True Sandbox: finally, a sandbox game that actually really lets you do your own thing all the time! The missions are instanced but even the scripted storyline missions never try to rein you in; you're always allowed to do it your way! As a bonus, instead of having entire missions dedicated to force you to learn how to use this or that minor new trick, those types of things are usually set as occasional (and fully optional) secondary objectives that you can achieve without deviating much from the approach you really feel like taking.\n\nDifficulty, part 1: SoM hits my sweet spot. A single enemy mook is easy to kill, sure, but an entire crowd can quickly become overwhelming. Some enemies are easier to fight than others so things stay pretty challenging because there's always a mix of opponents around. Unlike other games, SoM doesn't "cheat" by magically levelling-up the enemies at the same time you do, so you actually feel like you're getting more and more powerful. Things do become easier bit by bit as you get more practice at playing and gain more powers and options to take down your enemies, but death can still come quickly and swiftly if you don't stay on your toes.\n\nDifficulty, part 2: Dying is fun in this game! You still won't like getting killed, sure, but you'll have fun! For one, you won't feel like you're being punished for making a mistake: you won't lose progress, XP or equipment or anything; in fact you'll get a small experience reward for coming back from the dead. What happens when you die is the enemy captains and warchiefs will grow stronger; interestingly, this is all fully transparent to you: you get to watch the results as several individuals rise violently through the ranks of Sauron's army and accumulate more power and experience. The guy who did you in will of course get a big boost to his reputation and career, and it will feel personal to you that he did so at your expense! The game doesn't let you forget it either, so it's even more satisfying when you finally manage to lop his head off the next time around.\n\nDynamic Campaign: the ranks of Sauron's army shift and evolve over time and you have a big hand in shaping this process. Enemy rivals face each other off, ambush or imprison each other, or try to progress by raising their reputation through several means, and you can interfere as you wish, from simply ruining their plans to actually culling them off the face of Middle-Earth to turning them over to your side. You can even to go as far as helping them along the way only to make their fall bigger (and the rewards more juicy). These Captains and Warchiefs are created randomly and have different names, personalities, strengths, weaknesses and, just as important, very different looks. This makes the opposition feel very dynamic and very much alive, even if part of that is just illusion (mechanically speaking there's only so much variety possible between fighting different dudes). Unfortunately, not many other games out there can claim the same.\n\nRecon & Intel: the game brings home the value of doing recon and getting good intel on the Captains and Warchiefs you're facing. Some of their strengths can really ruin your day while their weaknesses can turn a very difficult assassination into a simple job. And you want to check if they're nearby least you end up surprised when one (or worse, a few) of them joins the fray you just started. Mechanically speaking, you also get slightly better rewards if you have intel on a Captain/Warchief before you kill them. This seems very well balanced, intel doesn't simply pop out of thin air, but it's also not hard or boring to chase after. As appropriate for a game placing so much importance on stealth it is easy to tell where enemies are, but not so easy that you don't even have to take your eyes off the mini-map to waltz past them.\n\nMiddle-Earth: there's a reason the setting is so enduringly popular, and it's very well used here; Tolkien Estate wouldn't let it happen otherwise. The two different regions of Mordor available are not very big and there isn't much variety in each of the settings, but they feel just right for a tighter, more focused experience than in your usual sprawling sandbox game. You won't have to get bored out of your skull traversing several kilometres to reach the next mission or hunting hundreds of collectibles the designers placed all over just so you'd have an excuse to actually see all those thousands of square kilometres of map they created presumably for you to chase hundreds of collectibles across.\n\nMultiplayer "aware": this is a single-player game, so I was surprised when one of the dynamic mission that popped up asked me to avenge the recent death of one of my steam comrades. This game sure likes to make it personal! Don't worry, Roberto, I got Latbag the Corrupt nice and good for you already!\n\nMinor Annoyances:The control scheme for keyboard and mouse feels awkward, at least at first. There's many different keys and combinations of keys to press if you want to trigger different powers; my fingers weren't used to having to do so much gymnastics to trigger different combos/powers, especially in the middle of fights when you're already trying your best to move and dodge and strike. It took some getting used to it, but I'm liking it more now; it adds some complexity and challenge to the mix. My only complain is really about those rare times when the character seems to get stuck for precious seconds against some piece of scenery, or when you wish he'd just let go of the damn ledge and jump down to the ground instead of only descending the cliff/wall one tiny step a time.\n\nAfter the promising short intro with Galadriel's chilling voice, the story starts off like an 80s revenge flick: our hero has his wife and son killed in cold blood right in front of his eyes and is left for dead by the enemy only to now come back seeking vengeance. It's the kind of stuff you used to love when you were a rebellious teenager of limited taste set to give the world a lesson. At least the revenge plot is thematically very consistent with the mechanics of the game so that's a bonus. Also, the story soon distracts you with much more interesting things, like figuring out who's that elf wraith who gives you power and denies you from true death, and all that yummy Middle-Earth background starts pouring in, so... yay!","October 5, 2014","true","44.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

Some aspects are similar, but with better feature like Nemesis system.\n\n1. Gameplay, action rpg. Slash, stab, thrust. You can counter enemy attacks with RMB and evade unblockable attacks with Space. If you have played Sleeping Dogs or Batman Arkham series, you will get used to it in no time, similar but not same. There is skill system that you get when lv up, cool skills like riding a caragour or maybe warg, execution skill (very brutal and AWESOME). Skills has 5 tiers which you can unlcok by gaining power point, finish side missions or kill captains or warchiefs to get power point. Each map has a tower you need to forge to reveal the surrounding things (Far Cry), and there are survival challenge and hunting challenge, reminds me of Red Dead Redemption. Survival challenge is gathering herbs scattered around Middle Earth, while hunting is killing pests, bugs and aviary (spiders, rats, bats). You get money for completing those, sorry I forgot what the local currency called. Collectibles you has runes and artifacts.\n\n2. Story, still about Sauron and the Uruks & co. I dont really care for the story actually, the gameplay is awesome. I spend most of the game messing with the uruks, its much more fun than the story. Besides story mission, you also has side missions such as weapon missions, local warfare missions such as duel, recruitment, ambush, etc. The uruks are at war each other.\n\n3. Nemesis system, this is an interesting system. Since you character cant exactly die (why?play the game. say no to spoiler), the uruk who killed you will be promoted to a higher rank, captain, liutenant (maybe), sergeant (perhaps) and the last warchief. And when you got killed by an uruk, he will mock you, go find him and he will boast, and if he kill you again, you know the rest. Imagine got killed by the same uruk 3-4 times, I did (i am suck), I hunted this son of a frog and when I finally killed him, damn that was good feeling. Every warchief or captain has a weakness, you can find an intel by finding certain uruk symbolized by a green square thingy on the map, interrogate him and pick any captain or warchief you want to find out what his weaknesses are.\n\nCons:\nI cant find any, but I know there are some cons, but I dont find any.","November 17, 2015","true","68.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

But, that being said, the graphics overall are very well done, with nothing jarring sticking out. But it's certainly no Crysis.    Gameplay  9  This game almost shines flawlessly. You can spend countless hours killing orcs, and every moment is satisfying. The only downfall of the gamplay is the lack of mission diversity, and the fact that eventually, if you want to get an orc promoted, you're going to just have to stand there and do nothing. Because frankly you get a bit too powerful, and captains/warchiefs really pose no threat to you anymore, even in groups. Other than that, you will not find a better, more fluid combat game out there. The diversity of skills and abilities is fantastic, allowing you to fight the way you want to fight.    Story  5  This game has a pretty mediocre story. It's not terrible, but it really isn't good. It's just...there. It takes a backseat to all the killing and joy you will find in the game. Shadow of Mordor attempts to bridge the gap between the events of "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings." It seems like a silly grab-all, but Shadow of Mordor makes it work. The Lore in the game that you can gather is more interesting, in my opinion.    Replayability  8.5  As fun as it is, you can only kill so many orcs, and again the game's rating is hit by a lack of mission diversity, and things to do other than kill orcs. But that being said, you will spend a LOT of time controlling, murdering, shooting and crushing orcs.     Overall  8/10  Overall, Shadow of Mordor is a must buy for any gamer, anywhere. With extremely satisfying combat, darn good graphics, and fluid gameplay, the only drawback is the lack of solid story. But you will find few other games that will suck your time away so joyfully, and reward you for every minute of it.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","October 19, 2014","true","22.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

In terms of my play time I did a very hefty portion of the side missions/challenges, I wouldn't be surprised if you could beat this game in 5/10 hours if not less but hey the batman games have been the same even skyrim's main quest line so i guess this isn't too out of the norm.  The combat in my opinion surpasses the batman games in smoothness and obviously brutality which is a nice switch up from the fist fighting batarang wielding hero i've loved for the past three games.  The brutality of this game is probs one of my favorite things it had to offer. The lord of the rings movies have always been violent but this game takes it to a whole new level i've always wanted to see. Another great feature that I didn't really expect was the ability to mount the monsters in the game and unleash chaos on your enemies, graugs destroy everything and I love picking up a brave orc commander and biting his head off.... good stuff. One thing that did get me (and i was expecting to see this the whole game) is that none of the orcs manage to mount these beasts especially the caragor which is kinda weird because on more than a few occasions I thought i heard them talking/boasting about mounting these things, guess none of them actually have the balls that our boy talion does.\n\nWhat this game really lacks, something that they should have taken from the batman games, is a line up of real bosses. Yes the nemesis system is cool as well as the lineup of orc commanders but in my opinion most of these guys are like mini bosses at best, unless three or more of these commanders jump you at once they don't really pose that much of a threat especially if you go the extra mile and get the intel on them or mind control a few of his boys. You get one of these commanders in a one on one situation and no matter how strong they are you can take them down with a little planning and common sense (yes this is a rare situation but it happened to me more than a few times in my play through).  The games actual bosses go really south after the first of the black hand you face in mordor, even him I beat on the first try, but the other guy and then sauron are just complete jokes....This game had some alright characters and a good story but the moment you fight the second boss of the black hand I feel like the story goes south and is abit rushed to the conclusion. The game does offer two areas to explore and while they are different in layout I can't help but feel the second area is a grassy reskin of alot of the areas in Mordor, especially how everything is setup in the same plato layout.\n\nPros\n\n-runs real smooth (I had no issues with graphic setup or game crashing)\n-amazing combat system\n-lots of brutality\n-solid graphics\n-runes/upgrade system (abit too easy to get ability points and such but still a good system)\n-pretty good characters (especially tallion)\n-caragors and graugs!\n-good story (until the end)\n-smooth stealth/climbing\n-warchiefs /nemesis (even if they are abit too easy I thought this was a very innovative idea)\n\nCons\n-too easy/lacks difficulty settings\n-abit too short\n-lack of "real" bosses\n-story is "rushed" near the end (in my opinion)\n-first area and second area feel very similar\n-some characters are really underdeveloped (again my opnion)\n-once you gain the abilities to cause fear in orcs through your brutality moves (as cool as they may be) the game becomes drastically easier\n-lots of quick time events ( I personally dont mind them and rarely found any challenging but I know most people dont care for them)\n\nMy verdict 8/10\n\nAll in all I think this games a fun experience and worth playing, I don't really know about the 50$ price tag for 20 hours I got out of it so I would recommend waiting for a sale but its still a great game worth playing through.","January 16, 2015","true","23.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The portrayal of women in this game is beyond terrible.  It is, across the board, the worst representation of women in games I have ever seen.  Developers need to do so much better than this.\n\nNow, that aside, this is the best action game I have ever played.\n\nThe dynamic enemy hierarchies are brilliant, as are their randomly generated strengths, weaknesses, and personalities.  The first time an Uruk I thought I had killed came back with an appropriately changed visual and a burning desire for revenge was amazing.  I think the ability to manipulate the enemies came too late in the game, but it definitely changed how I played the game.\n\nThe combat system is the best fluid-combo system I have ever seen.  Finally a system where countering takes precedence over everything else, so you aren't constantly getting cheap-shotted in the middle of an animation.  This system is clever, builds well upon itself, and is a tremendous joy to use.  I never got tired of the many various ways I had to murder orcs, and all the ways to use the environment in support of your battle was very good.\n\nStory-wise, asides from the portrayal of women, I found the game to be very solid.  I enjoyed the story, I found it interesting and I genuinely wanted to learn more about what was happening.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and it is the metric by which I will be comparing all future action games.","December 6, 2014","true","37.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you're a LotR's fan, it'll definitely draw you in a lot more. It's essentially an Orc genocide simulator... you kill orcs, then kill some more orcs... and kill orcs who think they're tougher than the other orcs... all the while finding collectible artifacts and pruning and eating flowers and mushrooms.\n\nIt's very much a hybrid of those Batman Arkham games + Assassin's Creed style game play. Half the game is stealthing around the other half is brutally long combat sequences that require you to plan and strategize the final kills. The game isn't as simple as kill everything... There's a gimmick of holding an orc and draining their mind for intel on other orc chiefs so you can exploit their weaknesses and make the fights easier.\n\nIt's a very repetitive game but incredibly simple over all. The game has a scaling difficulty, so the further you get in to the story, the harder it becomes. However, your arsenal of special moves becomes much wider so it balances itself out... If you start to feel underpowered, then it's time to start grinding out XP on side missions and unlocking some more of the advanced special moves. By the end of the game, you're just an orc killing machine and nothing can really stop you unless you make mistakes in the fights.\n\nThe animations are incredibly fluent and I've never really felt the impact of killing something like I have in this game... There's just something great about rolling over the back of an orc only to slice their head off in one swift motion. :)\n\nThe game looks really good as well (playing on Ultra) and I haven't experienced any frame drops, so the optimization is really well executed for higher end machines. I'm running a GTX 970, i7 @950 if that gives you an idication of what you need to make the game run smooth.\n\nIf you're tired of Batman games or Assassin's Creed, I'd steer clear of this game because that's essentially all it is. only more refined and a lot more casual...\n\nThe climbing system is incredibly easy which makes stealth kills easy to execute as well... I'd say about 90% of the walls in this game are scalable... just hold A and press forward and chances are, you will just start climbing stuff automatically... no thought involved, which was nice. :)\n\nAs with most WB games, it's a very cinematic experience, high production values, low substance and not very challenging but still interesting enough to justify playing.\n\nI'd rate this a 7.5 / 10... it's a decent experience, nothing you haven't seen or played before, but it's fun.\n\nI would try to get it on sale, anywhere  in the 20 to 30 dollar range, no more... try to get all the DLC as well as it adds more game play modes to the over all experience.\n\nFor achievement hunters: There aren't any missible achievements either, so just enjoy the experience and play... You'll eventually get all the really convoluted achievements just playing through the main story line. Don't go out of your way for anything that sounds ridiculous until you're finished the story line.","March 21","true","16.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

The soundtrack is great and the cutscenes are very well done to the point where at times it is almost passable as a movie on it's own. I own a controller and have tried playing with both keymaps (You can switch interchangeably with a button press of either the keyboard or controller, Bonus points!) and I prefer the keyboard controls but can fluidly play with either one.\n\nSo far the combat system seems a little repetitive and slightly easy at times where I have ran into a group of around eight uruks and picked them off one by one. Definitely not regretting buying this game and can highly recommend to anyone looking for a great single player RPG experience.\n\nEdit: The combat system has definitely gotten harder as the game progressed, so my statement about it being easy was taken off.\n\nRating: 9/10\nTLDR: Great game with interesting characters, awesome combat system, amazing visuals, and hasn't gotten boring yet. Definitely worth buying or renting even if you have to resort to console peasantry\nEdit: Have died many times now and it doesn't seem to matter how many captains I kill, they keep getting promoted. Currently stuck trying to kill the #$%^ing gul matron because it keeps killing me every time. Probably the most agitating side quest I've done so far in this game.\n\nEdit 2: 12.5 hours into the game, killed all the warchiefs except Ratbag and killed the Black Hammer, and am now in the second part of the map that is set near the sea of Nurnen and it looks breathtaking. I'm on medium graphics and am stunned at how good this game looks. Hopefully these quests I have left will be as fun as the first.\n\nEdit 3: Just beat the game earlier today and am working towards getting the rest of the collectibles and finishing the side quests. The story mode was fairly short and the ending "Time to forge a new ring" just paves the way for DLC.

Its a great experience. The gameplay is lots of fun, really exciting, and it doesnt get boring. On the outside it may seem repetetive, but it never feels that way. Every fight you get into, and just any action in general always feels like you are fighting for something. Its like you have a greater purpose and every ork you kill or brand or interrogate is all going towards your cause to liberate Mordor. The story isn't very complex, its simple. This is good though, because its just simple enough to still be very interesting and engaging without taking away from the rest of the game. I just played Assassin's Creed Unity and I found its story to be very lacking, making it hard to enjoy the game because the whoe time I didn't know what was going on. This is not the case in Mordor. On that same note, this has been accused of being an Assassin's Creed clone, it is not in any way. It may look similar due to the parkour and assassination style missions, but after playing ACU and every single other Assassin's Creed I can confidently say these games are all diverse and different.\nBottom Line: This game is worth your money and your time, it is a fun, interesting, and fresh experience. I loved every moment of it.","November 23, 2014","true","39.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There are lots of objectives you can do in addition to the main missions. You can hunt animals and sneak kill some uruks in stealth missions, for example. So the gameplay is pretty good in this game.\n\nIt can be irritating to fight some bosses when there are many other bosses nearby. I tried to encounter one captain and suddenly there were 2-3 other captains and enormous horde of minions all around me. That can be a good thing if you are looking for challenge (like me).\n\nThe plot in this one left a lot to be desired. I wasn't impressed by the first cutscene and did pretty much skip the rest. And the main missions' objectives were not that interesting.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game because the lack of top notch storyline isn't that much of a problem when you have many hours of very enjoyable gameplay ahead of you.\n","January 5, 2015","true","19.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

From one hand we have unlimited potential of Lord of the Rings excellent universe. From another, this potential remained unrealized.\n\nI should say the plot is more emotional in comparison to the last Hobbit movie. And by the way this story is interesting. The gameplay process just like in Batman franchise from Rocksteady. A player exploring two regions of Mordor and solving every issue through slaying uruks.\n\nSo it isn't difficult, you can beat this without any upgrade to your weapons or personal abilities. But gameplay process with these upgrades is more funny.\n\nThe Nemesis system, a fresh blood in industry looks fine. An overage uruk becomes a captain after killing a player. And can be promoted to warchief by himself or with your interference. And it's the best part of this system. You can brand captains, build your own army of uruks, give them orders, and use the situation in Sauron's army to your personal purposes.\n\nBut this system is great only in plot because out of it, it has no meaning due to unlimited spawn of uruks and lack of interesting events. You will get tired of spawning uruks with the same names, abilities, vulberabilities and phrases.\n\nAnd it's very very very annoying. Because you can't skip this useless boring annoying speech which lasts from five to eight seconds. Those who completed Ring and Wild trials will understand me.\n\nAnd few words about seaon pass. This season pass is very strange. You probably won't need these runes, maybe except flaming rune. Because runes from original game are enough to kill a lot of uruks without any problem. And it's really doubt that you will want to try trials. So the only reason to buy it in beating the game on 100%\n\nThe Lord of the Hunt is funny enough, right before you will try the test of wild trial. It's strangely hard in comparison to the whole game. I don't know who the author of this idea, but it's obviously that he is very very sick person.\nBut in this DLC you can ride the graug which can puke on everything around, and ride a flaming caragath. It's really funny for the first-second hour.\n\nThe Bright Lord was strange due to Tolkien legacy. A player will play as Celebrimbor, his abilities oriented on branding uruks, but he is not so strenght as Thalion, and can stuck in textures by the way :(\nA player should brand his army and try to defeat Sauron using the One ring abilities (unlimited punishments, slow motion, invisibility).\n\nBut this DLC has some rude mistakes: The Black Gates were build after defeating Sauron. Ingame movies show us the massive battlefield between uruks and elves, but it's not what you see in this DLC (You will fight in southern stronghold). These inaccuracies are very dissapointing. The first region of Mordor looks absolutely the same in the second (Bright Lord) and in third (Thalion's campaign) epochs.\n\nThe Laziness in working on Lord of the Rings universe is not forgiven, Monolith. Especially on such price.\n\nIf you like Batman from Rocksteady and Lord of the Rings universe, you will enjoy this game. But don't try to beat 100% achievements, otherwise you will regret it.\n\nAs for me, I don't think I will buy next game from Monolith.","March 4, 2015","true","60.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And I mean that in the BEST KIND OF WAY POSSIBLE. The developers (Monolith) shamelessly borrowed successful mechanics from other high-profile video games, and combined them into some kind of amazing all-star supergame. In this case, they took: The exploration and movement system of Assassin's Creed; the combat of Batman; and the enemy design of Warhammer 40K: Space Marine. Brew that all together, add in a pinch of Sleeping Dogs and Far Cry 3, and you have one of the most ridiculously good open-world action games ever made. Ridiculously fun.

Left impressed, but not satisfied."\n\nShadow of Mordor shares a common thread with the entire AC series of games. Coming into this I was concerned about how much would be borrowed and how much would be unique to the title. I can say this after the first playthrough; Shadow of Mordor is it's own game. Indeed it borrows from the stealth / simplistic action of AC, however it spins it up with a host of combos, skills and abilities that make the playstyle suit each individual player.\n\nStealth is accurate, though a little over powered at times. The ability to choose between using your stealth to get around or rather simply to just terrify your foes (Brutalize) makes for some fun, on-your-feet choices. Do you want to sneak around and kill off your foes one by one? Or how about simply sneaking into the mosh of the group, tearing one open in front of them and having a good portion of the orcs friends run in fear!\n\nThe combat itself is rather easy, to be honest. They try to shake it up on occasion with varied units, however, you'll find that (especially at higher levels) that means little to your wraith-filled badassery. The occasional giant lizard-thing will try to kill you, but it's eaisy to avoid and dispatch of. The true core of the game comes from it's Commander system,\n\nThe game is littered with unique orcs that will challenge you on the map. They are introduced in a mini-cutscene during combat and often prove (early on) to be somewhat of a good fight. What really won me over is that the commanders are persistant. They will challenge their own to gain ranks and levels. This in of itself proves troublesome because if you leave them to their own devices they will become stronger.\n\nSpeaking of becoming stronger, the commanders can and will kill you. When they do they will actually rank up, promote themselves and remember the fight! Everything is remembered here. I recall one time I charged in on a commander mounted, he ran away. Later I encountered him and he taunted me for not bringing the mount with me again. Other times if I wound a commander and don't finish him right he will come back, wounded, and ready for revenge.\n\nThis system is great, the open world feel and graphics are great (and run great for PC!). My complaints lie within the story as well as the character interactions. To be honest, they are lame at best. I'm a HUGE Lord of The Rings fan-boy, for sure. However I have an objective eye and don't forgive if you mess up. In this instance they failed. The story is boring, light and short lived. Even the wraith you are paired with seems to fall into this "Meh" catagory for me. He's not quite unique enough, the interaction is not truly solid.\n\nThat being said I still did all the quests and enjoyed them, they just don't change direction or process and the pacing is poor. My other complains lie in the leveling up system. IT SUCKS. It's linear, you level up too quick and the skills themselves make you a death machine of epic proportions, ruining any and all challenge in the game. Most commanders are laughing stocks. You'll go into fights and end them in two min's flat, even against Legendary classed baddies.\n\nAt the level I'm at, I can run into entire cities of Orcs and literally kill them, no problem, all the while turning half the city against itself. This is cool, but it pulls me off the ground, it puts me so far above the awesome commander system that I don't even have to think about it. The commanders that were once really scary and cool became chumps and meat-blockades that I just work around.\n\nMy other complaint (Be ready, this is big!) is that there's NO LOOT SYSTEM AT ALL. You don't get trophies or bad ♥♥♥ new weapons or armor, ever. This is a huge, huge issue with me because I believe that progression should be seen on the character. I'd love to get cooler swords, perhaps runes with elemental properties on them! Something, anything! Your equipment layout stays the same the entier game. Same sword, same bow, same armor. This. Pisses. Me. Off.\n\nIn ending,\n\nJust as a spoiler guys, I feel I should warn you. The ending is awful. I will not reveal anything, but it's bad. Like, really, really, really bad.\n\nAll this said, I really look forward to what they do with the series! If they can follow a more free-form, open world, deeper level up and balanced combat system, it'll be more amazing than it already is. They already shook it up with the commander system. Keep going!\n\n","October 19, 2014","true","23.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is set before the events of Lord of the Rings but after the events of the Hobbit.\n\nYou play as a Ranger who was killed by Sauron's Black Hand, but was denied death. Your body is also host to a Wraith as you go looking for revenge.\n\nWhat I like the most is the nemesis system the game uses, which allows non-playable characters to remember the death of the game's protagonist and react accordingly. There's nothing quite like an Uruk captain or war chief taunting you about how he's going to kill you yet again. And Uruks that kill you get more powerful for having done so. And killing the war chiefs doesn't mean the enemy runs out of them, others will get promoted in the killed war chief's place. You can also set the Uruks up against eachother, issue death threats against them or poison their grog barrels and watch them turn on one another.\n\nThe main story consists of 20 or so missions, but there are also tons of side missions. If you have all the DLC you get side missions with Gollum, finding out about the past and the forging of the rings. You get to ride magnificent beasts and stealth kill or simply mass-murder Orcs and Uruks. There are also side missions to build the legends of your sword, knife and bow. Some of those missions are easy, others are tremendously difficult. I also had fun helping a sniveling coward Orc named Ratbag become war chief (he did not survive in the end).\n\nDon't get frustrated if you get killed a lot early in the game. Build up your Ranger and Wraith skills and you will be fine in the end. I don't always play 100% of the main and side missions in every game, but in this one I did, and that says it all. This game is great, get it if you can. I got it on discount from a well known and legal Bundle site, including all its DLC. But even at its full price I would consider it worth it.\n\n10/10 will manipulate Uruks into killing eachother again","October 1, 2015","true","50.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","3"

Over time the game throws more advanced enemies in your path giving your a feeling of power as well as challenge.\n\nThe nemesis system is rather clever - letting you play Vendettas and Klingon politics among the ranks of orcs.\n\nThe progression system is good enough for a game like this. I've not found it tedious to hunt down the artifacts and experience points to unlock pretty much everything.\n\nThe only gripes I have with the game are the controls which sometimes glitch out. I've found it very difficult to use bite attacks on any mount and my attempts to block an attack often put me into ranged mode instead. A handful of times I had my character get stuck on some ledge or something and once I was unable to finish a mission. Finally I found the story a bit hard to follow since there's often much time between snippets of story and the format of disjointed flashbacks doesn't help either.\n\nBut over all I'm still very much glad I played this game.

It it also known as a mix of the Arkham Series and Assassin's Creed. Many people call this a ripoff, but it is in many ways better than both of these games, but it still has it's own small problems. The Story is quite good and has a few twists and turns. It has many references to the Lord of the Rings series and it's lore is very accurate. The game plays and looks amazing. The combat is hard when you start off,  but further down the line you will only lose fights in unbeatable odds. It has a lot more variety than the Arkham series, but it is quite easy when you get some of the higher tier powers. The stealth system is nothing unusual, but it is not emphasised enough on. You crouch and take your opponents out. With the Arkham games you have many different foes and you have the ability to approach nearly every situation in your own way, but Shadow of Mordor dosen't have that, and it is not a bad thing. It is it's own game, and it does what it does well. It is better than Assassin's Creed though because it actually has a crouch button. The climbing is exactly like Assassin's Creed but it is much faster and you can climb up almost anything in a few grabs. The game also offers many side quests and the amazing nemesis system. I have literally not seen anything like it before. It is unique and it feels like what the orcs would be trying to accomplish with their power struggles. It has a high risk reward system with the runes that can make you overpowered as hell. The mounts in the game, while limited, offer a nice form of travel compared to simple fast travelling and can be used to kill orcs as well. However, there is one thing this game did not execute well; The ending. The first battle brought back your worst nemesis and it was awesome. Then the next battle was a easy stealth section where you had to stealth attack your opponent 3 times, then hold a button to finish him off. Then it picks up with a fast pace battle near the Black Gate. You charge through with a Caragor and kill 5 captains with the help of your branded orcs. Then the final part is a 5 button QTE. This was just lazy and I expected a lot more. However, the rest of the game is amazing. I am looking forward to the content in the Season Pass and I hope Monolith do not do that to the ending of a game again.

A perfect blend of some of the best fighting elements borrowed from recent Batman games flavoured with a decent amount of Assasin’s Creed parkour. Slashing, bashing and trashing, its all there in a perfect Uruk discrimination package filled with disemboweling, cutting off limbs, bone crushing and of course tons and tons of whatever stuff runs though orc veines. Need some tutoring on how many ways there are to kill an orc? Look no further. This game will provide you with more than enough insight on that particular topic. The combat is generally very responsive, it feels right no matter what type of controls you are using, gamepad or mouse/keyboard combo. Whatever you do, combat will probably never be the reason for any of the problems you might experience in the game.\n\nIngame cinematics. Oh boy… Some of the cinematics made for this game are pretty much movie theater material, going on par with LotR movies themselves. They are also the main source of the game’s narrative so it would be pretty unwise to skip them unless you are only after some orc blood.\n\nThe bad…\nIf you are after some decent story from the expanded LotR universe you will probably be heavily disappointed. Yes there are some interesting plot twists which fit nicely with the original LotR lore but the buildup and the anticlimactic conclusion leave much to desire. There is also a huge amount of pointless story missions which pretty much only serve to add some effective game time and bore the player to death in the process. Poisoning Uruks with grog and destroying Mordor’s cultural heritage as main storyline quests!? Cmon! Give me a break.\n\n“Though you shall have no meaningful UI” was probably what the publisher said prior to releasing this game for PC. Having to leave the game and open up the main menu every time there is need to adjust weapon runes or simply pick up an orc target in the Uruk hierarchy is pretty time consuming and frustrating.\n\nEnvironmental interaction. As much as the controls themselves are fine, for both gamepads and keyboard/mouse combos, interaction with the environment can be often pretty frustrating. Picking up a perfect path to reach a fleeing boos often ends in a total disaster just because the main character likes to stick to every damn thing that comes even remotely close to his path. This effectively means that instead of jumping off from a high vantage point in order to pin down a boss to the ground you will find yourself suddenly hanging from a wooden beam which just happened to be near the jump path halfway through the jump. There are also some problems with the controls which change their behavior depending on the situation. The best example would probably be “drop down” which is usually reserved for “E”, however if you are on a ledge or a line of rope it suddenly changes to down (“S”) which can often lead to situations where players don’t actually know which “down” they should use.\n\nThe skill progression system. Its not that skill progression is bad. Its simply that some of the most interesting skills are unlocked almost at the very end of the main story line. Branding, chained mass executions, caragorn mounting… Those are all skills that greatly add to the experience but require access to top skill tiers which on the other hand require a lot of side mission grinding. Players will probably feel unnecessarily locked out of stuff that they should have been able to use from a more reasonable moment in the game.\n\nThe ugly…\nThe graphics. It would probably be unfair to call the game ugly but its surprisingly shocking to see how little effort was put into creating imaginative levels which even remotely represent the quality we got used to from other LotR games or even movies. The map feels bland with repetitive sections which feel like a simple copy/paste from the terrain seen just a minute before. It doesn’t help that it got divided into two distinctive parts because the second part also feels like the first one just with added vegetation. There is simply no diversity and no “wow” effect we got used to for anything LotR related. In all honesty I haven’t been able to test any of the graphics modes which require more than 2GB VRAM but I highly doubt that any texture pack could resolve the problem of bad level design and lack of imagination while creating the map for this game.\n\nThe overall lack of gameplay diversity. Aside from the main story, a couple of types of challenge missions and some collectables there is actually nothing to do in the game. Challenge missions are picked from a poll of three or four mission types which seem to repeat endlessly. Simply put, if hacking and slashing orcs for hours isn’t something you get easily entertained with then chances are you will get bored to death in Shadow of Mordor.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes I would. But its important to make a note about the target audience which will enjoy it. Players which expect some deep meaningful LotR experience with huge amount of RPG elements will be disappointed. On the other hand players that don’t mind killing orcs for hours in a GTA mission style oriented game will probably enjoy it.\n\nIf there wasn’t for an interesting combat system the lack of any meaningful story and bad level design would have probably made me rate this game 6/10. However, short-term enjoyment of the combat system earns this game a 8/10 from me.\n","October 4, 2014","true","25.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Oh i know the guy with a ranged weapon then sneak up to others and gain so much XP even in their fortresses its so fun to release animals free to see them tear them all apart but aside all this slaughtering i say the campaign was a little disappointing because some of them were a bit too easy and some boss fights reminds me of captain fight but in the end the bosses in the game was easier than any captains or warchiefs it could have been a bit more faces so it could be a bit more scarier so to me its a bit weird but i guess that how it is. It was kinda lacking some customization choices that came with 1 free DLC i didn't like it that much but i really hope this game comes with a ton of DLC packs that allowing players to custom their characther even allowing new weapon choices maybe allowing orcs be a little more savage.\n\n\nPros:\nNice combo system.\nPlayable after campaign after.\nLots of fun killing orcs even when raising them in ranks.\nWatching the best orc rise in power or fall.\nSolid gameplay without question.\n\nCons:\nEasy predictable fights even campaign bosses.\nneeded a bit more work around captains and warchiefs.\nBranding enemies to vicory unless its a captain.\nCould use more weapon choices and customization.\nExpensive DLC packs.\n\n\nWell that actually my insight of the game and i probably would give the game 8.4/10 in rating.\n\n\n","October 25, 2014","true","57.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

After being desecrated by an army of Ents Orcs and Nazgûls I rage-unistalled the game and looked for a differant LOTR game. I found this, after downloading 40 ♥♥♥♥ING GIGABYTES worth of game I started to play.\n\nThe whole game is a hack and slash Orc holocaust simulator. The Orcs might aswell be nazis with no redeemable qualities: All the chatter you hear from them include "I really like killing things" and "Living things better watch out becasue I might kill them!" It actually makes the Orcs seem really insecure with every silence being filled in with thier own version of small talk.\n\nNow onto combat the whole combat system was probably ctrl+c ctrl+v from Batman to Shadow of Mordor with the standard counter attack stun combo system, However that isn't a bad thing: I personally think its better that a game has a working, established and old combat system. Rather than trying to create its own which will most likely end up feeling like darksouls with polio. *NOTE* They cleverly renamed batmans gadgets to wraith powers.\n\nSize, The map is small-ish. It  never really feels vast but it also never feels small. I think considering what the player has in terms of travel and what the game offers the map is an ideal size.\n\nStory, I honestly found it hard to care for the protagonist or the problems he faces, but I don't think the game was made with story as a high priority.\n\nConclusion, If you like any of the following: LOTR, Batman, Mindless slaughter, Mud, People Talking about axes and killing then I'd recommend looking into this game, its a really fun mindless hack and slash. 8 Orc WarLords/10","December 27, 2014","true","8.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibnalhazred/recommended/241930/","ibnalhazred","Alhazred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibnalhazred/","323 products in account","I played this game through doing all the main game quest, meaning all of the main quest, Outcast rescues, Ithildin collection and artifact collection. I also did all the survival challenges and nearly every hunting challenge. I used some time to grind a few specific achievements. All of this took me about 26 hours.\n\nThe game seems pretty well optimised, with the FPS staying confidently at and over 60 on my GTX 960 and high settings (if I remember right). The game looks great and the animations are smooth and they vary enough to instill gasps of delight even after many hours of playing. At least with me the game didn't crash at any point and I did not encounter any bugs or glitches whatsoever.\n\nEven though I am somewhat sceptical about open world games these days (open world seems to be an excuse to put soulless collection-/busywork-ish sidequests without any other real thought process what makes open world interesting) I think it worked out pretty well with Shadow of Mordor. The world (= the two main quest areas) are large enough so that you don't have to look at the same valleys and mountains all the time, but it's small enough so that empty travel does not take too much time. Eventually when you unlock all the necessary skills the world is full of exciting stuff to sink your time in. You can stalk orcs, listen to their jammering, then drop a fly nest on their heads and go gut the lot. You can interfere in the internal politics via simple automatically generated quests that show you the everyday life of an evil guy warhost commander. These mechanics also play a big part in the actual main quest, which I find was executed pretty nicely. In a way it might seem at times unnecessarily grindy and repetitive, but more often than not it is interesting to raise an interesting and cool orc captain. Help him rise through the ranks to eventually become a warchief, then arrange a fight to the death with this thing that is practically your own child by now. In the long run the system starts to shift in to the dull side. The training of captains isn't really necessary for other things besides your own enjoyment and the main quest (you also get more powerful runes if you kill high level captains, but at least I found the runes to be nice and helpful bonuses, but not something that need to be farmed in order to get through the game).\n\nOrc captain/warchief system is adequately large enough so that you probably won't encounter two similar boss-orcs during one play through. The somewhat-emergent gameplay system helps you to form a kind of personal connection with the enemies and they actually seem to have a personality every now and then. All the different names and outfits the orcs wear are not probably too canon, but they make for a good game.\n\nThe story in Shadow of Mordor is a let down. It is a basic vengeance quest with the protagonist avenging the death of his family and trying to save the world in the meantime. Whereas the orcs you encounter might occasionally have an interesting personality, the supporting friendly characters are pretty soulless and uninteresting, the only possible exception being a certain hunter dwarf. Boss fights seem a bit forced and are too simple considering how fun and engaging the captain system is. Especially the main boss was a let down in many senses, ranging from the story to the execution.\n\nThere is no question that Shadow of Mordor is a wonderful game with unique gameplay systems, awesome visuals and enough gameplay to keep you engaged but not too much that one would get bored. In the long run the nemesis system starts to lose its edge and might become a chore, but you will probably finish the game before that happens. Only real downside is the lackluster story, which fortunately is not too large a focus. It seems that in many ways this game has managed to dodge several pitfalls: you can see that the potential of crappiness is there, but it has been artfully averted with right design decisions and systems that far outweigh the downfalls.","September 12, 2015","true","26.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"

The combat is "Arkham-esque" in a good way. The feeling of being powerful is a lot of fun. The nemesis system has to be experienced to be appreciated but it adds a interesting element of love/hate to the enemies who would be otherwise nameless grunts being mowed down under your sword. If you don't already know the nemesis system is the hierarchy of the Uruks (orcs) and as you defeat a higher ranking soldier, or if they defeat you, they will rise in the ranks of the army gaining power. Later in the game you obtain the ability to brand Uruks and they will join you in your fight and you will protect them as they go through challenges to become more powerfull.\n\nI do have some criticism to the game. It is an open world game but the world feels mostly empty of everything but enemies and an occasional NPC. There was a fair amount of button prompt kills which are overplayed. The story is interesting but without giving anything away....I felt the ending was somewhat hollow. The graphics are wonderful, but the color pallate is somehat bland. Enemy AI is acceptable, if a little lackluster and although I still had fun with the sneak kills, it was perhaps overly generous with stealth detection.\n\nAll that being said, I had a lot of fun and I would certainly recomend it if you like the fast over the top combat of Arkham Asylum but with swords, gory executions, and orcs.","December 1, 2014","true","31.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

During this review  I will be addressing the games elements which include: Gameplay, Graphics, Sound/Music, Story, along with the things that make it unique. I will also along give my thoughts and feelings on the game. Be warned there are VERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nGameplay: 9/10 When I started this game the first two games I thought of (and many others agree) were Assassin's Creed and the recent Batman Arkham games. The game takes the parkour and stealth system of Assassin's Creed and combines it with the timed button pressing combat of Batman. While many will say this is a complete rip-off of the two, it simply is far from it. It takes the elements from these games tosses them into a polisher to polish the mechanics and refines them so that it can flow almost seamlessly. Each mission uses different elements of these mechanics by utilizing different challenges in each mission such as getting stealth kills, executions, and others which give you bonus points for abilities and so on.\n\nThe reason why I did not give this a 10 was due to the slight lag in the counter system. It was not as fluid as Arkhams system but it is damn close to it!\n\nGraphics: 8/10 I can’t really say much about the graphics as I only played it on PC. They are nice enough to get you immersed into the game. However where it really shines is on the 4k resolution. Sadly you need at least a 4GB card for this to happen. From what I have seen from the PS4/Xbox One versions they barely push the systems to their limits. I will update this section when I know more about the PS3/360 versions. Sorry Wii U fans no version for you unfortunately. I will say that the ambient effect are nice like getting soaked in water or mud and the wind mechanics and adds more realism to the games. There isn’t really anything EYEPOPPING here at the moment.\n\n\nSound/Music 10/10: I CAN PERSONALLY SAY THAT ONE THING OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE MUSIC! Though there aren’t any tracks recognizable from the Lord of The Rings/Hobbit Movies. The musical score is fantastic and very well done in my opinion. The sounds of swords clanking off metal armor, shields cracking, and the voice acting is fantastic. I can't praise it any more.\n\nStory 6/10: The story is pretty simple. Your character and the games protagonist Talion is killed, along with his wife and son, by servants of Sauron called the Black Hand. You are then possessed by a wraith who is also seeking revenge on the Armies of Mordor which makes you become an undying Ranger to claim your revenge. And that's all that's all that is explained to you to start. I won't spoil any more. Though the story has some weak points the interaction between the characters is enough to keep you wondering what’s next even though the story is rather one dimensional when it comes to the main subject of it (Revenge!)\n\nUnique Elements 8/10: One thing I can say about the game is that it has quite a few unique features that have kept other players and myself engaged. The leveling system is slightly different from others where as you gain XP, you learn new abilities to make your character better at combat, stealth and bow attacks. You can also learn new finishing moves, and combos which will help you in battle. There are also side missions that can be done to acquire a currency which is then spent on upgrading your total health, ammo, and slow motion focus time.\n\nThe most engaging part of the game is the "Nemesis System." As you play through the game, various Uruks, captains, and chiefs in Sauron's Army willA look at the nemesis systemA look at the nemesis system by battling each other for power within the army. Most of the time can be to your advantage but can also be your downfall. One instance can be they will be dueling each other for positions of power while moving about in the ranks on their own. However, let's say you attempt to kill off one of these Captains. If you defeat him, his position will be left over in the army for a new enemy to fill the space. If you are slain in battle, the enemy who killed you will gain reputation, called power, and be promoted to Captain, gaining special abilities and weaknesses. The game does not hold your hand as it punishes failure, which is something we haven't seen in a lot in recent games at all which also makes it more rewarding.\n\n\nIn conclusion, that Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a great game to pick up; even if you aren't a fan of Lord of the Rings it has a lot to offer a gamer who is looking for something new. I think that is part of the reason why the decided to not use the Lord of the Rings trademark name. They wanted to make this game a game that anyone could pick up and enjoy without knowing the lore if they wanted to. However for fans of the lore there are plenty of references to the books and films within the achievements/trophies, (Like "Fly, you fools” which is obtained by making 20 Uruks flee by dropping Morgai fly nest on them). Should you play this game. YES! YES YOU SHOULD!\n\nOverall: 8/10","November 10, 2014","true","27.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It uses a fork of the engine.\n\nDo you like Assassin's Creed games?  It has some of that feel without the stupid sci-fi memory crap.\n\nIf your answers are yes, you'll like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.  Stealthing, parkouring, slashy-stabby Orc goodness.  Enjoy it as far as your budget allows (buy now/sale later/etc).\n\nAll signs point to competent with this game, but now that I've reached 100% completion the nit-picky problems are obvious:\n\n- Aside from the very hard working artists that slaved creating the proverbial bucket of Lord of the Rings paint to pour all over this Batman Arkham Mordor clone, what has been innovated?\n\n- The story is one part meandering, one part clipped, and one part rushed, with a result that feels wholly incomplete, and I highly suspect it is (buy the Season Pass for more! -Publisher)\n\n- The story missions are decent but they still seem to be in tutorial mode almost to the end.  You only get Brand and Dominate at Missions 16 and 17 out of 20!  These are essential tools for "tinkering" with the greatly-advertised Nemesis system, and yet they are doled out in the very late game.\n\n-The Outcast side missions are fun as far as you find the gameplay itself is fun, but carry little substance of their own.  Find Outcast intel, go to Outcast mission, do what it takes to cut Outcasts off their wooden posts.  Rinse, repeat.\n\n- The Weapon Legend missions are more entertaining and much better side missions because they dictate some restrictions to the usual affair in how you complete your mission.  Enjoyable!  I just wish achieving those 5th and 10th Legend missions actually *meant* something besides shiny weapon texture changes.  More rune slots?  Special bonuses beyond rune slots?  Something?\n\n- Some of the answers to my concerns regarding innovation will be the Nemesis system.  It is certainly the game feature that stands apart from the game's (Arkham) origins.  Having played 25 hours and reached 100% completion, do I feel like the Nemesis system stands on its own?  Is it innovative enough that I want to play some more Shadow of Mordor purely for the joy of playing Puppetmaster with the Orc Meritocracy?\n\nThe honest answer is no.  While the Nemesis system is neat, it is a clumsy first try.  The orcs are semi-randomly generated and move through the ranks predictably and with only a few repeatable Power Struggle missions.  There aren't many reasons to become emotionally attached and there isn't much of an end goal to the process that you won't already witness playing the short campaign.  Hell, I went to the Sea of Nurnen and came back 3 hours later and Ratbag had simply disappeared!  I was hoping to foster that little guy.\n\nThe developers innovate as if the very whips of their masters were behind them!\n\nI'm cautiously optimistic about potential sequels, but be wary of the Dark Publisher's wiles.  He is the Master of Lies!  A sequel set in Rohan would be gold, and the base engine they now have already supports it.","October 12, 2014","true","25.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joscco/recommended/241930/","joscco","Joscco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joscco/","443 products in account","This is an excellent open world action adventure game with a smooth and responsive combat system.\n\nThe visuals in this game are very solid, but the Uruk are what really stand out, and they did an outstanding job with all of the detail, especially in the facial animations. The world feels slightly barren at times, and there isn't a whole lot to look at in amazement, but then again it is a war-torn world which they did a good job at creating. There are two zones in the game, with the first being more barren and gloomy than the second zone you enter, which actually has a lot more plants, grass, and of course more Caragors.\n\nThe one thing that stands out the most in this game, is obviously the combat. It's basically a hybrid between the Batman: Arkham series, and Assassin's Creed. It's very responsive, and you have a few abilities that you're able to use. You have a main attack, a stun, a dodge and you can also slow down time while using your bow to pull off a couple easy headshots which can thin out the Uruk's. You can also counter-attack, which is extremely important while fighting large groups and helps significantly. There are also times when you can use your dagger to silently take out enemies from behind, or you can sneak behind them and brutalize them which can scare off 1-2 Uruk's which is always funny.\n\nThe rune system is also a great addition. Being able to add specific benefits to your sword, bow and dagger can give you offensive, defensive and just overall improvements to your character which you'll definitely need when fighting more powerful enemies. You also get a type of currency that's earned when completing side missions which you can use to upgrade characters health, how many arrows you can carry etc.\n\nThere's also a system called Power, that you can earn by doing the missions where you're sent to kill a specific Uruk, usually a captain. After getting enough Power, you can choose an ability to unlock, which is basically like a talent tree system that unlocks new abilities as you get further down the tier which give you some of the most powerful abilities in the game. Since you'll be killing massive amounts of Uruk's, you should have no shortage of Power. Also, expect to die, at least earlier on in the game. If you get overwhelmed, and there's a captain, or sometimes 3 in the mix, things can get bad very quickly. Also rage inducing, but still funny when you're killed and get taunted by said Uruk, and then seeing him get promoted just makes you want revenge all that much more. However, branding Uruk's, which allows you to basically control them allows you to cause a lot of mischief and cause infighting which is always a great advantage to have.\n\nThe story in this game is fairly good. I wasn't blown away by it, but it kept my interest. If you find all the collectibles in the game, they add more lore to check out. The main characters are pretty decent, but I though they could've been fleshed out a little more. I did find the only Dwarf character Torvin to be funny though, but it seems like they always are in most games.\n\nOverall, if you're into this style of game I highly recommend it. It incorporates straight up combat, mixed with stealth elements very well.","January 5, 2015","true","27.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The free-roaming and combat of Arkham City and the parkour of Assassin's Creed are both perfect, in fact, they do the parkour better  than Assassin's Creed and the only reason the combat isn't an improvement on Arkham City is you can't improve on Arkham City. So yeah, it's borrowing, but it's borrowing with great talent, and spiced up with the Nemesis System of randomly generated orc enemies and a hierarchy for them to climb, which gives assassination's a structure and joy Ubisoft only wishes it'd thought of with Assassin's Creed. It's also a pretty generously long game.\n\nThe story however, is dumb and unimportant, the emergent gameplay is way better, and the hero is a typical brooding white guy whose family got killed to motivate him, which has sort of been done to death. But the game is so fun that the dull story doesn't really matter.","November 13, 2014","true","43.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's bonuses given for freeflowing moves (there's only one attack button for melee) but this means simply not getting hit and stunning your enemies to keep the combo meter counting. As you unlock abilities, you get to spend points on abilities that allow you to perform special moves every time you get 8 uninterrupted hits (5 with an upgrade). The combat is just hard enough to keep you on your toes, but not so hard that you want to quit. Every now and then you get hit with a QTE that takes you by surprise, but there's nothing crazy (like God of War or Casltevania Lords of Shadow).\n\nThe ability system is two-fold, and veterans to any series that puts RPG elements with hack-n-slash knows that the primary system for becoming stronger is to spend some sort of currency. In this game, there's both. A currency system is used to buy health and focus upgrades, carry more arrows, add slots to your weapons for runes, etc. While an XP system is used to unlock various abilities. The abilities will generally unlock over the course of the game, but there's also incentive to go off and maul orcs on your own... the higher tiers are unlocked as you earn Power. Power is earned by killing orc captains and warchiefs, settling power struggles, or even avenging the death of your friends. As you complete these missions you will gain access to stronger abilities that don't outright OP your character, but make battles where you are clearly outnumbered a little easier.\n\nThe ranking system for Sauron's army is a little tedious and repetetive, but it's so in a very pleasing way. As you progress, you will gain access to "intel" which allows you to get information about the captains in Sauron's army, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Killing captains will affect the state of the army and allow you access to some of the more powerful warchiefs, each which drop their own special prizes. As you progress, you can even command your own orcs and have them battle each other. When an orc kills you, he gets promoted and is identified in the army so you can exact your revenge. The possibilities are endless... literall, as the army can never be fully wiped out.\n\nThere's much more to say, and I've said a lot already, so you should just go play the game already!","November 1, 2014","true","27.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You will fight, slash, stab, shoot, throw. Sometimes you will devour while mounted on a beast. Other times you will mind control. Some other times again you will mind control a captain to kill another captain.  The game ultimately ends up as a sandbox experience, an uruk-manipulation-simulator where you have tons of fun trying to come up with new ways to mess with and kill these silly not very smart, yet tough creatures.\n\nBest part of the game is the personal touch it gets when an orc kills you and mocks you afterwards. He gets a name, a promotion, a mental and physical personality, and you can seek him out for revenge. If you don’t succeed, you will be farther mocked an insulted, which feels great!\n\nThe game succeeds in letting you feel as an ultimate bad-♥♥♥, especially as your skills grow during the game. You end up so insanely overpowered after a while, that only a few enemies remain a challenge. But at this point the game is still very fun to play, as you will be toying around with the above mentioned uruk-manipulation. The fighting looks and feels really great (played with a controller), and the amount of graphic detail is outstanding.\n\nThe open world offers lots of content, and I especially enjoyed collecting all the artifacts as they provided smaller stories, related to the lore of Lord of The Rings itself. I even liked collecting all the mushrooms and flowers. Cozy.\nIt amazes me however that the main story of this game is so shallow, when everything else is pretty great. The cinematics of the game are top notch and really fun to watch. The voice acting is superb. Certain smaller sub-quests aren’t that bad either, while the main story simply isn’t very interesting and appears unengaging and below average. It’s strange, when the game otherwise shines, developers obviously knew what they were doing regarding everything else in the game.\n\nDespite the unmotivating main story, I still highly recommend this game for its great action and the orc manipulation system.

This is effectively Batman, Arkham Asylum set in the Lord of the Rings 'verse.\n\nThis isn't something bad. This is, to be honest, quite fantastic as the combat mechanics from the Batman games (Barring the latest one) is fantastic. The combat may not be perfect (there are peices of the terrain that will abruptly stop you from moving when the majority of other structures makes you parkour around like a man on speed and crack.\n\nFor those of you who are mechanically gifted, as in you can keep all your keys in your head and not get confused with what buttons do what, you near literally can not be stopped. The captains are a nice mechanic to fight and them being able to level up is a fascinating mechanic that is fun to fight against. even if you fail and they finish you off, they come back stronger, giving you more rewards if you kill them. Leading to an interesting dynamic of letting them kill you to make yourself more powerful. If they kill people from your friends list, you can even avenge their deaths. Everything about them gears you up to becoming more powerful and dangerous.\n\nThe last stand mechanic, letting you recover yourself even if you ♥♥♥♥ up or miss-press a button, is nicely difficult without being overly stressful and damaging your enjoyment of the game over soemthing cheap seeming. This game continuously aims to reward you if you can pull yourself out of a bad situation.\n\nCoupled with an excellent feat/abililty system that empowers you without giving you an 'I win button', instead making you stronger while expecting you to still use skill or finesse.\n\nI again seriously can't recommend this game enough.","October 4, 2014","true","36.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The overall theme in this game is just awesome, Reminds me abit of Dishonored.\n\nGreat Storyline, Combat is fully up to the player to decide,\nYou can go in as noisy as you want or as quiet as you want or maybe you just want to attack them from range... This game has it all and does a good job at it, The weapon runes seem to balance the game & combat out quite nicely on all grounds.\n\nThere are a few bugs, Mainly climbing and getting stuck inside walls.

(Dynamic orc captains with varied modifiers.)\n- Nice dialogs. Never heard anyone repeat the same line twice, which is quite the feat.\n- Nice achievements, fun to pursue, all doable in reasonable time. None of those usual "kill a gazillion zombies" kind of mindless grind achievements.\n- Really nice polish and attention to details. The developers know what they are doing.\n\n\nCONS\n\n- Only about 30 hours, including 100% completion and getting all achievements (and quite a bit of fooling around), in fact you can probably beat this in under 15 hours if you are not a collector and just beeline the story mode.\n- The is a time / score race mode that can get you a few hours on top of that. But seeing as people are posting 500 000 scores while the max i was able to do is about 10 000, I conclude there is cheating involved so you can't really play it competitively, only see how you're doing compared to your friends.\n\n\nREVIEW\n\nWell, to me this is a mix of assassin creed, batman, Risen (the first, not the abomination that followed it), and dare I say it, skyrim. In fact this could have been a worthy successor to skyrim if it wasn't so short... I felt like they did a good job creating the overall gameplay, world, settings, creature and enemy diversity, and so on, they just need to have bigger areas and more content for this game to truly shine and create a "must play" IP.\n\nValue wise, it is a bit overpriced for it's length. I feel like 30$ or so would have been more reasonable, seeing as it is a lot shorter than games in the genre (their fault for claiming being an sandbox RPG, games in this genre go for hundreds of hours) and they seem to plan for DLCs which probably should have been included in the game to give it that much needed longevity.\n\nHighly recommended to grab this in a sale, but paying full price is not a horrible idea if you can't wait. I'd aim for the game + season pass for 50$, that would be a decent price for what you are getting.","October 4, 2014","true","45.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The scenery looks amazing, the music is nice, and the story keeps you interested...\nHowever that said, the story is very, very short... and then when finished, it does feel like you have only played about half of the game, DLC from the season pass should come out soon, but it does still leave you wanting more.\nSo after i finished the game after about 6 hours, i decided i would try and get the achievements, which are your standard, collect so many of this and kill so many of that, with the odd tricky one thrown in, freeing slaves is boring after the first island, as it is literally just going in and doing the same thing over and over again.\nThe nemesis system is all very well, and yes it is cool that if you are killed by an orc they become a captain and can then become a war chief, and still remember you and insult you like everyone else in the game, but the novelty soon wears off, and can be a bit of a pain if wanting a specific captain to go to a certain position, which you need to do on more than one occasion.\nI do think that it is a very good game, if short, and DLC should extend the fun, it's just the landscape is all a bit samey, and it can seem a bit repetitive after a while.","October 14, 2014","true","28.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Put simply, its less forgiving that AC games.\n\nThe game also manages to cater for different play styles, you can charge in with your sword, fight enemies from range with the bow, take the stealthy approach, picking them off 1 by 1 or combine all 3! If slicing, stabbing and shooting isnt enough for you, you can use the environment as well! Mounting beasts, releasing animals from cages, poisoning barrels of booze.... the list goes on!\n\nThe map is also fairly big which makes exploring fun, which is good because the game looks awesome!

I've bought several of them for PC.  With each one, I'll play for a few moments, get completely tired of the movement and non-responsiveness of controls, and quit.  I've got like 20 minutes max in each AC game.\n\nThis game is not that.  The controls are exceptionally responsive.  The Nemesis system is going to change a LOT of games in the future.  The gameplay is fluid.  There's not much of a story, but there doesn't have to be.  You're dropped into an open-world arena full of orcs, basically, and you're expected to kill them.

The story was not this game's strongest point, but it was still very good and kept me entertained until the game's conclusion.\n\nYou've probably heard of the Nemesis system if you have done any research on this game, and it deserves the hype. It genuinely adds to the gameplay experience, and offers fun and interesting twists to the gameplay. Captains who kill you in battle will grow in strength, gain followers, lose weaknesses, and get promoted. Fighting them but letting them escape will make their actual battle wounds prevalent in your next encounter, as well as unique contextualized dialogue between you and the captain. Sometimes, just like Talion (main character), a captain that you have killed will come hunt you down and challenge you to a "rematch."\n\nThe most amazing thing about the nemesis system is how it creates real digital enemies who you will grow to hate (or admire if you dominate them). Very early into my play through, I was fighting 3 or 4 captains at once. Having few special abilities, low health, focus, and elf-shot, I was barely managing the captains and horde of normal uruks. However, just before I was killed for the final time (I had a rune that let me go down 2 times before I was killed for good) I killed a captain, restoring my health to full. I then whittled away at the uruks as some ran away, and was down to the last captain. Unfortunately, he caught me off guard, and then a random spear thrower got me with a lucky shot and killed me while I was down. That seemingly unimportant level 1 character leveled up ~10 times just for killing me once. He became my nemesis, and after growing in power even more, I tracked him down and decapitated him after a long battle. That has been my favorite moment of this game so far, and it happens all the time with the nemesis system.\n\nNot only are the graphics fantastic in this game, but it also runs incredibly well. I am running a GXT 970 and an FX-6350, and while my GPU may be pretty solid, it is not quite the top of the line, and my CPU definitely has room for improvement. However, I am able to pretty much max out this game at 1080P and always get over 60FPS. I can't have the Ultra textures enabled because NVIDIA lied and the 970 only has 3.5GB of VRAM that is useful to games, but turning down textures a little bit to fit your VRAM needs will make sure that this game runs without a hitch, while some crappy console ports run terribly on my system even on the absolute lowest settings.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAwesome game, tons of fun, long campaign and potentially "infinite" replayability via the Nemesis System, fantastic graphics and performance. 9.5/10, I am 27 hours in and plan to spend many, many more.\n\n","February 3, 2015","true","33.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sneakablez/recommended/241930/","sneakablez","Sneakablez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sneakablez/","1725 products in account","Surprisingly very cool and very good game. If you love Batman, Assassins Creed, Witcher and Assassins Creed Games then this will surely fit your taste. Well if you played those game too much and you are already very tired of this kind of gameplay then this will just add to your boring gaming life.\n\nThis game is very well optimized even for low end system like mine. I'm just using 14" laptop Core i72670QM with 2GB 540M GPU @ 720p resolution. And even on auto-set low graphics settings the game does not look very bad at all and it rans very smooth. It can take medium actually but it's only around 25-30fps so the best optimal settings w/ quality is low with vegetation enabled. I think the minimum is a gpu with 96 core shader gpu and below it I dunno anymore what it looks like.\n("Well if you're hardcore gamer and hardware enthusiast that used to Hight/Ultra detailed setting you will not be able to appreciate it but surely for those casual gamer who just using laptop wanna play it their current old system this is a very good news for them.)\n\nMain Story: As for the game itself, the story good but not great and it's somehow short. If you just go straight directly to the storyline without bothering about the sidequest and mechanics you can speedrun it on less than 10 hrs. But where's the fun there? If you do that, you're better off watching the complete youtube cinematics videos. This way you can save money if thats only what you wanna do. :)\nSo with the gameplay, side quest and mechanics of the game if you go through it you might hit 50 hours or even more before completing the main campaign.\n\nLord of The Hunt Story: To be honest I was already bored completing the main story that I decided tos skip this for few months. Well after few months I played this campaign dlc. To be honest there isn't much about this dlc when it comes to a good story, but you gain extra abilities on this campaign plus a whole different look/skin. The other cons it's that you get to play on the same map again! Very short 4hrs tops unless you go hunting playing with Orcs and it's wildlife before jumping into main missions. But if you like this game much this should bring more twist to your play style.\n\nYes it's easy and simple they say, well that's only at first where you can even close your eyes and keep hitting attack and auto-block key that works with cheap band of thugs. But it wont work later on when there're already shielded uruks, captains and warchief that bands togerther. It gets more trickier when there're so many surrounding you where sometimes you just have to escape rather be trying hard to be badass or just die trying. Even with all abilities acquired there are still moments that you just have to die or run looking ways to to restore health.\n\nIt maybe become repetitive but it's a very challenging in every way to dominate many warchief and captains and explore more on the nemesis system. There's so much replay value here considering also there're still incoming two major dlc.\n\nIf I only have all the time in the day to play this game I will surely do but my job hinders me from keep on playing for long. Will surely love to play and play this when I have free time.\n\nHighly Recommended Game of the Year for me.","October 3, 2014","true","56.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You'll spend a lot of time searching orc packs just to fight them for fun. Planning attacks/betrayals/initiations is interesting and rewarding. Nemesis system is what makes this game stand out so much from the rest, it works well but it can be improved (and hopefully it will) a lot. It made me really angry at specific Uruks and killing them was really enjoyable. I'd give this game a 9/10, but after beating it and seeing that ending, I will give it a 7.5/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/recommended/241930/","femboyancy","♥Princess Vaxi♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/","510 products in account","Hello everyone. Time for me to go into another review!\n\n(This part might hold some minor beginning story spoilers.)Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an open world RPG style game in which you play as the Gondorian Ranger Talion, one of the only remaining soldiers to guard the Black Gate. The beginning story is a little sharded and fragmented as the game needs to hold true to canon, but hey that's what you get for having a game with an already pre-determined lore, right?\nAnyway, the Black Hand of Sauron sacrifices Talion and his entire family as a sort of curse for reasons I don't really understand...I mean he sacrificed you and your family to become one with the wraith himself but instead it went inside you, and now you have all of the skills that this king had in life. Why exactly did it go to you and not him? That's not explained, but whatever, the rest of the story's still good.\nYour job now is to, as an undying super soldier of Gondor, hunt down Uruk and Orc captains/warchiefs and use some super magic mind reader magic to find out what they know about other captains and warchiefs and the Black Hand, so you can find him and make him undo the curse so you can find rest.\n\n\nNow how's the controls and gameplay in the game? Honestly, I want to say good, but I feel they could've used A LOT of work! The controls are choppy and hard to manage, and require quite a bit of controller finesse in order to get you through a simple doorway. Considering how fast paced and merciless this game's combat is, I'd like to have some very polished, crisp controls to at least not make my controller be a handicap. That'd be great!\nSometimes your character will also decide to just do his own thing; Lets say an enemy Orc is to your right on the screen, and there's another to the left. Let's say you want to attack the one on the right first. So you push the control stick to the right and push X. 8/10 the character will go for the right...But 2/10 he'll go up down or left...Now that might not be such a big deal, but when the aforementioned enemy on the right is charging up for an attack with you having only enough HP for 1 more hit, and your character doesn't stop him? That has made me throw my controller on occassion. It's a death,  which shouldn't have happened. Hardware should never be a wall between you and game progress.\n\nYour character also seems very fond of walls...There's a sneak feature(Really cool btw, I LOVE the Stealth in this game), which lets you slink around corners and stuff, and pull off some pretty impressive "Neener nee you didn't see me! *Sticks tongue out!*" moments, but sometimes you get a little ahead of yourself and you need to pull a super fast U turn and get back to your corner in the darkness to avoid being spotted by a guard. Well, chances are your characters' irresistable love for hugging walls gets in the way. If you're even an in-game foot or so off and end up running a little into the wall before getting around the corner, your character will hug it, and it's A LOT easier to get 'into' the corner hugging thing, than it is to get back out.\nThis 'auto wall hug' feature has ruined several, otherwise flawless stealth runs in a stronghold, and has also led to some Controller abuse.\n\nThe quest system can be a bit repetitive, the same objectives in different locations etc. However, as poor as I may think the repetitive quest system is? The execution of the missions, aka going from start to finish in them, can be insanely fun! You can choose to be all sneaky with a bow and be all Legolas like and strive for nothing but headshots etc, or you can go in stealth like with a dagger, or berserker style with a large sword. Sadly there's not really any magic in this game, no mage stuff for you *Sadface*\n\nBe that as it may, though. The game has a fantastic difficulty system lined up. There is no real 'easy, medium, hard' cookie cutter selection to choose at the start of the game. Instead of that, they seriously upped the bar of standards with the idea of giving the AI skills and abilities just like you! Some I can remember off the top of my head are:\n\nFears(Such as fear of Carabors, or Ghuls, etc. The Uruk will pretty much flee at the sight of the specific unit in question. Alternatively, fears have a corresponding strength version)\nHate(Such as hate of Carabors, or Ghuls, etc. This is the polar opposite of Fears. Instead of fleeing like a frightened cat, the sight of the specific unit will enrage them, making them harder to kill)\nWeakness/Critical Weakness(Such as to Stealth, ranged, melee, mounted attacks etc. If an Uruk has a weakness to something, it means they can take damage from it, however, if its a critical weakness, they can be one hit killed by the type in question. Say a Captain has a critical weakness to stealth, as well as a regular weakness to ranged. He can be regularly damaged by ranged, but a Stealth attack? Will instantly kill him. Very useful!)\nImmunities(Polar opposite to weaknesses. Immunities will make it impossible for you to ever damage them with this type. An uruk with immunity to Stealth attacks cannot ever by caught off guard. They are impossible to quietly kill.)\n\nThe list goes on with Poison weapons, small or large warbands of supporters, bodyguards, stealth awareness, etc. etc. etc. The list is impressively long.\n\nThese lists of attributes however, and here's the fun part: They're INVISIBLE TO YOU! You don't know exactly what strengths or weaknesses a captain or warchief might have, making it hard to plan a good assault! Of course there's a way to discover these attributes! remember when I mentioned the magic mind meld ability you can use to read their minds? Well it comes in handy here! You can use it on 2 kinds of enemies: uruk Captains, or 'worms'. Uruk captains need no explanation, but Worms are lesser Uruk with more knowledge than they should have. Sort of a 'messenger' if you will. If you can catch them off guard and read their minds, you get to choose an Uruk captain, and instantly learn his weaknesses and/or strengths! If it is an unknown Captain(An enemy you havn't faced yet), you can discover their identity, location, and weaknesses etc. rather than having to do it yourself. Intelligence and information are incredibly important in this game.\n\nThe graphics are outstanding, the voice acting is par none, I mean this voice acting is some Grade A Epic Stuff, seriously. The people in charge of sound and ambience and voice acting etc. seriously needs a medal or something, cause it was believable, and it made the RP in the RPG seriously easier to agree with. Sadly you don't get dialogues though, so I guess it is more Action/Adventure, and less RPG, but eh, there aren't that many differences between the 2(3).\n\nSo, how will I rate this game?\n\nStory:\n★ ★ ★ ★ ✰\nRoom for improvement, and some fragmented bits here and there, but overall the story is solid, and merges well with the  pre-existing canon!\n\nGameplay:\n★ ★ ★ ✰ ✰\nMore room for improvement. Some aspects are cool and fun, but it just doesn't quite make up for how poor the controls are. Very frustrating, choppy character control, difficult to maneuver accurately.\n\nSound:\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\nPerfection incarnate. The sound in this game, and the voice acting, is simply perfection.\n\nGraphics:\n★ ★ ★ ★ ✰\nI'd give the graphics 5/5, but it gets 4 cause your average every day gaming computer will not be able to handle more than low settings across the board. It takes a high end machine to run it at high or ultra.\n\nOverall Score:\n★ ★ ★ ★ ✰\nA fantastic game with a few drawbacks and the occassional annoying glitch, but eventually fixed glitches aside, the game is worth it if you're a fan of Lord of the Rings and have some cash to spend.\nDo I recommend this game? Yes I do.","October 2, 2014","true","29.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not many single player games can pull me in. The other day I sat down, turned on this game, and for 6 hours I could not exit. I didn't want to get off. I figured I should sleep so I did. I don't play it every day, but when I do I can't put it down. The Arkham series was my all time favorite single player game, but this one has taken that over. I am crappy at reviews but here ya go:\n\nFirst off, I heard the last boss fight sucks, that its to easy. I haven't got that far yet as of typing up this review. But honestly,  I don't really care. The game is extremely enjoyable, the amount of content for a single player game is awesome. The story seems to be fairly short as there is only 20 missions in it, but if you do all the side stuff, its very lengthy. Would I recommend this game to someone that only wants to do the main story and none of the side stuff? I would say No. This game really feeds off doing side missions, messing with the nemesis system  and whatnot. Building up your weapons, purchasing abilities, etc.. Its just all around a great game to get lost in.\n\nSpeaking of purchasing abilities, the system is good and all, but almost 14 hours in I think and I almost have all the abilities purchased that is available. The only reason I bring this up, is because I think that its bad. It reduces customization options. What I mean is, it don't really matter where you put the points cause you will end up having them all anyway. Know what I mean? At this point I just slap a point in, see what I got and go on my way. I just love deep customization, but that won't knock points off from me.\n\nAll around its an amazing game. Would I change anything? Honestly no. I do hate stealth and am TERRIBLE at it (terrible hardly explains it) but in this game its rather easy so far. It may get more difficult, I don't know, but its not a hard system in this game. Its very simple and straight forward. At this point, the Arkham series had harder stealth areas than this game does and I managed that one fine.\n\nOk ending this here. Hope it helps out some, probably not :D","January 4, 2015","true","23.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I was quite pleasently surprised. Of course it helps, if you really like the world of Middle-earth. The game is basically a playground to mess with orcs. Seriously, I spent quite a lot of time just messing with the captains and orcs, instead of doing quests.\n\nIt's not perfect though. While the nemesis system is awesome, it sort of falls apart when you get most of the skills and powers, because you become to powerfull and all the orcs just die or you brand them. At the beginning of the game, there was one captain I encountered and defeated 4 times (actually, he was a psycho and kept following me) and each time he had more of his face bandaged, was more furious. It was funny and awesome at the same time. SPOILER: Plus he became on of the bosses at the end, which was like a high school reunion. Hey, you're that guy I kept shoving in the locker. Good times!! END SPOILER.\n\nI think that if you enjoy the LOTR movies, you'll also enjoy this.\n\nEdit: Ok, update on the difficulty of the game. Play the Bright Lord dlc, the game gets hard. Sure it's lowered if you use the One ring power, but when it's gone. And all those berserkers and defenders. I really suck at dodging..... Ugh.

I'm not a Lord of the Rings fan at all, but just bought this game on a whim. It was the hype game of the month and i said why the hell not, and took a leap of faith, and it paid off ten-fold. I love it when i by a masterpiece on accident.\n\nThe game's story isn't really what keeps me engaged, but it is compelling enough not to want to skip. The voice acting by Talion is spot on. The game plays like Batman Arkham City meets Assassin's Creed, and builds on both formulas both in traversing the environment and combat. Like in the batman arkham games, the combat is extremely simple with some extremely complex mechanics buried within it, that makes for an intriguing and addicting thing to get into. I know there are story missions, but there's just something about simply killing hundreds of uruks all day and all night that just loses me.\n\nThe game runs beautifully too, this is by far one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played. It makes Tomb Raider look like an old Xbox 360 game.\n\nMy only minor gripe is with Warner Bros and their blocking of posting content published by them on YouTube, but if you don't mess with that kind of thing, then that doesn't even cocern you. This isn't the most innovative game in the world, but it feels like it's own game. Despite it borrowing mechanics from other games, it borrows them the right way, taking what made them fun, and throwing some middle-earth spice in the pot.\n\nThis hands down one of my top games of this year, based on my first few hours of playing the game alone. You know this game is a masterpiece within the first hour of play.\n\nFor a game that i never even remotely considered buying until it showed up in my queue a few days ago, I'd say this was the most satisfying blind purchase of $70 (with the season pass) I've ever spent. Buy this game now. Saving up for another game? Who cares. Buy this anyways. There's a 75% chance this game will end up being better than whatever it is your saving up for. The best part is, you can tell this game wasn't intended to be as good as it is. It's ironic that we live in a world where overhyped games are just that, overhyped, while the ones that fly under the radar turn out to be some of the greatest games you'll ever play.","October 3, 2014","true","15.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is great, the story is good, for the most part.\n\nShameless Plug I have a let's Play of this over on my youtube channel if you are still on the fence and want to see some gameplay. Check it out here. (watch somewhere around ep 20 for spoiler free Uruk slaying)\n\nThe Good:\nGameplay, is enjoyable more often than not, and slaying Uruks with gory death moves, is satisfying every single time. The animations are perfect and varied enough to where you will see new moves constantly, even 10 hours in. (or it appears that way)\n\nGraphics - The game looks fantastic, and runs remarkably well with the level of detail and the amount of stuff going on, on screen.\n\nThe Not so good:\nI've gone with "not so good" because these little gripes don't kill the game for me, just makes it a little frustrating at times.\n\nThe Nemesis System - The way you kill leaders / captains within the game is an amazing concept, which I just wish they forced you into a little more. They should have made it a point where you HAVE to manage them, creating rivalries etc. As it stands, you could completely ignore this aspect, saving one mission in the game. It would not stop you getting to the end, or even make it more challenging.\n\nThe controls - I played with keyboard and mouse exclusively. (that's probably my mistake) At times, when reaching certain areas assassin creed style, the controls are just outright unresponsive. Talion gets stuck places, or just hurls himself off a ledge making his grand entrance into a camp of Uruks, while you are trying a stealth mission. (grumble) Where the combat animation is fluid and intuitive, the movement animations can be clunky and misleading. Correcting what you think is a step in the wrong direction usually results in an unwanted ledge jump, or getting stuck where you'd expect him to be fine.\n\nStory - So yeah, the story. It's in both the good, and not so good parts. Thats because whilst part of the game is nice, others feel very rushed. You're not given enough time in my opinion to care about parts that are meant to clearly be "for the feels" and then other parts just seem tacked on, for the sake of future DLC opportunities.\n\n\nVerdict:\nSolid game overall - Reaps Recommended!\n\nflaws and blatant set up for DLC (which I usually detest) aside, I really enjoyed the experience it provided. It ticks all the right boxes for me personally that I look for in this style of game. Thoroughly enjoyed it and as I said. Went and grabbed the DLC immediately.

Made four attempts (three reinstalls) to play it over more than a year to finally finish the game, with the first three attempts not making much progress from the beginning of the game.\n\nThe trailers and reviews misled me to different expections of this game. I wanted it to be the epic console action game I thought it would be, but it never lived up to the reviews.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=433522104\nReview: Beautiful graphics and cutscenes aside, the game has progressive missions/objectives that tell the compelling prequel story to Lord of the Rings, specifically the forging of the rings of power and the one ring.\n\nThe game is entirely combat based, and the combat is fluid and entertaining as long as it's paced out, and this was the key to my finally finishing the game.\n\nI went into this game wanting to be Aragon or Legolas, cleaving my way through every mission. While that worked initially, fights became tedious quickly when I came across areas marked as Strongholds. Alarms can be raised in strongholds which results in seemingly endless waves of orcs. A simple single objective mission with the goal right in front of you can end up with you fighting orcs until your thumbs become sore. And the same combat which had been fun would become a chore and turn off.\n\nThat's when I readjusted my expectations. Until one unlocks most of the powerful abilities, the game is for most part a stealth game. Sneak around, go to the objective and kill a few orcs. I actually like stealth games, and this game has a system where you can exploit the weaknesses of orc captains so stealth play is not all that dull or one dimensional.\n\nFinal Words: The DLCs merely extend gameplay, with nothing new story wise, but the main game easily provides 20-30hrs of content with a story worth playing for fans of the LOTR movies.","February 11","true","49.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The DLCs for it add a nice amount of content, too. I didn't like the Bright Lord DLC as much as I enjoyed the Lord of the Hunt DLC. Mainly because the Bright Lord sort of limited my abilities in combat, so it was less varied. I imagine it was done to keep in line with the fact that you were playing as newly powered up Celebrimbor and not his man-shadow creature hybrid he became years later in the main game, but after experiencing the thrill of freedom that the Lord of the Hunt showed me (seriously-check that DLC out. the combat, the enemies, the missions, the new area-I loved ALL of it) kind of spoiled me and made me sort of resent the limitations imposed by the Bright Lord. Still, all around a fantastic game!\nThe nemesis system is my favorite part. Not even the combat (reminds me of a murderous Batman combat system) compares to how much I love the nemesis system. Fighting leaders in the enemy armies and enslaving their minds or just gathering information from them and killing them so that one of my mind slaves ranked lower than my fresh victim can take his place-it's amazing. If you get into a scuffle and have to retreat, they'll remember you and be less scared in the future. Get murdered by some random shmoe? Well, now he's a Captain and is more powerful. Each time that someone kills you they get stronger and less scared of you. Some of the stronger leaders require a strict tactical approach to defeat. Mid-late game it becomes incredibly difficult to take out some of the top tiered bosses. They usually have bodyguards who are a rank or 2 lower than them and also leaders with special abilities. Killing or converting the bodyguards before taking on the main guy becomes a must, because there's no way you want to take all of them on at once in their stronghold surrounded by an enormous amount of reinforcements. The nemesis system alone adds a ton of replayability to the game and I'd like see it used in games in the future somehow.\nTo sum it all up, even if you're not a fan of the Lord of the Rings (in any of its many forms or variations), this is a great game with the combat and nemesis system alone making it worth checking out.","March 21","true","75.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

You will not need to finish animations to get in that counter or dive out of the way of danger. It is a blast to play, countlessly beheading your enemies. While busting headfirst into the fray can be fun, you can quickly become overrun by a ton of Orcs, which could lead to death. But do not worry after a few levels you will be extremely powerful and rarely see death. So the best way to take care of your enemies is to pick em off via your bow from a distance or to stealth kill them. Stealth is extremely easy to accomplish, as you can  pretty much pass right in front of enemies from a short distance away without too much detection. This could be intentional due to Orcs being pretty dimwitted though by the developer.\n\nThe highlight of the game is its Nemesis system., where foes that kill you will rise in power and level up to captains in Sauron's army. These captains will also taunt you every time they meet you recalling past moments of your battles in quick one liners.  There hasn't been a moment in gaming in a while that I was so satisfied to have killed a captain that had been endlessly harrassing me for ages. With a ton of enemy captains out there in the army with random strengths and weaknesses you could just spend hours hunting just them down. they even eventually will get replaced by new ones for your endless slaughtering fun.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the game there was just a few minor issues I had. One was the quicktime event where you have to position the left stick into a circle and press a button. I seemed to fail about 50% of these due to the fact that it seemed the icon moved to slow and by the time I got there I had no time to react. Upping the aiming sensitivity  seemed to help a bit, but still missed quite a few. And lastly the final two mission were extreme let downs, as they were nothing more then easy beat downs and quicktime events.\n\nVerdict: While the game has a few short comings, it is a blast to play and easly worth a purchase. The season pass is still debatable at this point if it will be worth it","October 7, 2014","true","19.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Imagine for a moment a combination between Batman Arkham City and Assassin's Creed, combining the absolute best elements of both games, set in a delightfully unexplored period of Middle-Earth's Third Age, and with a persistent system of enemy progression and rivalry on top of everything.\n\nThat's this game. It looks amazing, it plays beautifully and fluidly, it will grab and hold you and keep you playing and make you curse that one snivelling orcish shrakh that keeps killing you and getting promoted. The music is terriffic and the whole thing makes great use of its lore and mythology.\n\nThat's my favourite part by far. If you haven't read the Lord of the Rings books, or even if you HAVE but didn't bother with the extensive Appendices (or the amazing Silmarillion), this is probably the first time you will hear of Celebrimbor, Annatar, Fëanor or Gondor's unapologetic use of slave labor. This is probably how you will learn who Morgoth was (as in "The Balrog of ...") and what the hell happened in Númenor, or how the Rings of Power were created. This game takes people who only know the movie events, and helps them delve deeper into Arda's extensive history and setting. It is invaluable in that regard, because so little popular media explores these aspects.\n\n10/10","October 2, 2014","true","46.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Optimization - my GT 755m 2GB GDDR5, I7 4700MQ, & 8GB memory can run it on tweaked ultra with 20fps, or 30+ on medium/tweaked high 1600 X 900 resolution. For a middle class laptop that's pretty AWESOME!\n\n2. Graphics - Even on low this game looks AMAZING, however I highly recomend NOT trying out ultra textures on a 2GB VRAM card as you may get slowdowns, freezes, crashes etc. I was lucky when I tried out high textures seems to go fine with my 2GB card.\n\n3. Nemesis System - This literally is the best feature I HAVE EVER SEEN. Unless you beheaded a captain I found many captains coming back for my blood many of which succeeded in getting it. One captain and I went back and forth at least 7 times before finally getting him.\n\n4. Gameplay - Story is very engaging and a lot of fun, you kill lots of Orcs like who doesn't love that, & unnatural powers that allow you to make a mess of Orcs and Mordor.\n\nCons:\nMy only nitpick is this game would be darned near perfect if we could play as an Orc and do political backstabbing and control large bunches of Orcs to do your bidding.\n\nConclusion - If you want to play a fun game based in Lord Of The Rings Lore that is bloody, but yet engaging at the same time pick it up at first oppurtunity.\n\nOverall Rating - 9.5/10","October 5, 2014","true","24.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

So the game is truly wide open in that repsect.  There are tons of things to do and there are always new missions added as the orcs progress through their promotions.

It’s got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of Lord of the Rings lore to find, but what makes it special is what’s going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning.Acrobatically slaughtering Sauron’s ugly minions feels as easy as it appears to be for Legolas in Peter Jackson’s movies :DDD.\n\nMiddle Earth: Shadow Mordor will look familiar to you when you start playing specially if you have an experience with "Assassin Creed" and "Batman Arkham City" that because the game is a nice mix between both of them. • With that great graphics and full of action gameplay I can guarantee a lot of hours enjoyable gameplay !!!!\n\nSword combat feels pretty much just as good here as brawling does in Batman – which is to say it’s amazing. Mordor’s take on building up hit streaks to power up lethal takedowns is a bit more forgiving, in that you’re almost never locked into an animation. If you push the counter button, Talion will drop what he’s doing and counter instantly. It’s extremely responsive. A time-slowing power makes scoring a couple of headshots with the bow easy, whether in stealth or in the heat of battle, though it’s kept in check by ammo constraints and a limited (but upgradable) supply of time-slowing juice. And even though stealth gameplay is pretty basic, it’s great to have the option to thin the herd a bit before they know you’re there ;] !\nAt the end of the day you get an awesome open world game,with intelligent ai and really nice athmosphere,it's LOTR after all ! 10/10 !!!","October 6, 2014","true","77.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I made an apprehensive day one purchase and could not have been more surprised by the quality and fun this game provided.  Shadow of Mordor is a mash up of Assassins Creed stealth approaches to enemies, with a lethal style of Batman combo combat.  One feature that I did not read in many reviews that I really enjoyed was going on revenge missions when an Orc captain killed one of your STEAM friends who were also playing the game.  I always made any orc who killed a fellow Ranger public enemy #1.  Of course as mentioned in every review the Nemesis system was a lot of fun and made my play-thru feel personal and special.

And by no means, just because talion climbs wals and stuff does this make it a clone of a said series.  The game is standalone, breathtaking, filled with action, and so many COOL ways of dispatching your enemies and alowing you to choose your aproach. Are you gonna be all sneaky and silent? Or perhaps you're gonna be a badass who walks right through the gate of an enemy camp and just cleave your way through hordes and hordes of orcs?? Or maybe you like to snipe with a bow, teleport and quickly execute foes, or perhaps you will be the Bright Lord who commands his own army of orcs??? It's up to you really... there are ways to make the game very easy aspecially when you are nearing the maximum of your perks and upgrades, some of the chalenges are actually chalenging and some of the more elite Uruk captains are tough cookies... I actually met one who was imune to melee, ranged and stealth damage altogether, and it took me a few takes to get this MF down :D. the game also looks great and the story as I have said before is really good, Talion is not your average "oh no I must avenge my familly" sissy... no he's a cold hard killer of orcs and beasts, and where he comes short then there is the "Wraith", who is just as scary as the F*ckin Sauron himself... driven by hatred hard to imagine, also there is some history and lore about middle earth which I liked and some people didn't know about ( at least from what I gathered from comments and such :P ) and the best and biggest + in this game is that nobody needs to be save by the F*ckin Eagles!!! ( hate those things!!! so OP :D ) I was kinda dissapointed at the lack of the 9 but honestly the Hammer, Tower and the Hand are kinda F*ucked up in the head as well so no real dissapointment there... Honestly though, the game could have been a little bit harder, some of the skills you can posses are really OP like hell... especially with the right runes ( And no I don't mean the lame ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones you get from the DLC's)\n\n\nall in all... the game is great for any fan of middle earth and it's story... also except for the really nasty one... there are no prissy Elves so thank god for that ( F*ucken tree huggers :P )\n\n\nso for me it's a big Recommend, and also.........

The AssCreed vibes come from the parkour abilities and the stealth part of the game.\n\nThe game isn't really long. I spent 63 hours with it mostly because I kept playing side-missions instead of progressing the story initially and then going around killing orcs and playing in the power feuds part of the game, trying to gain more power to unlock skills, to get runes and to build my own army of orcs. This meant that I spent a big part of the game going around killing and getting killed for no other reason than my own fun, to get revenge for my deaths or the deaths of other players, to ruin the orcs gatherings etc... and I consider that a big plus for the game, since open ended kinda games tend to bore me after a while.\n\nAside from being a fun game, Mordor is also a very good looking game, both in the in-game graphics as well as the cinematic parts. I felt a certain lack of AA though, but I'll say that the... gritty and sharp look of the game was enjoyable more than distracting.\nMusic is another nice aspect of the game as well as the whole audio direction in the game. I loved how the name of a Commander would be chanted once he showed up and the Italian VA for the game was really good, with both nice voices and good acting.\n\nQTEs are mostly the only sore part of the game for me. More than once I died because I was pushing the stick in the wrong direction initially as I miscalculated the point where it would pop up and the QTEs made the last 2 fights feel quite anti-climatic, though everything else more than made up for it.\n\nAll in all a fantastic experience.","October 8, 2014","true","56.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

In Middle Earth Shadow of Modor we play as Talion. One day Talion and his family is killed by the black hand to summon the wraith but gets himself fused with Celebrimbor who is suffering amnesia. So him and Talion try to find out who is Celebrimbor and to avenge the death of Talion's family. So how is this game ? This game is a fantastic game and everyone who needs to play through this game at least once. The game is like Assasins Creed and Batman Arham games fused together to create this. You can freely roam around the map and do what you like. Theres tons of stuff to do and lots of stuff to see. The game also looks really good maxed out. The gameplay is smooth and is really satisfying. Stealth is also really fun. The game is never too easy but never unfair and is a blast to play through. The game's story is fantastic and you get attached to the charecters and you do want to make it to the end which is not good. Yeah the ending to this game was dissapoiting and is sequel/dlc bait. The game also has bugs. Sometimes when jumping and grabbing onto the ledge my charecter wouldnt let go no matter what i did. The game is one of the best games i played in a while and i definetly reccomend getting this game and playing through it once. I give Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor a 9/10","February 28, 2015","true","24.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I just finished it with about 35 hours into the game to get 100% completion.  I literally got lost in the game world for hours on end not doing any quests or missions, just fooling around in the open world Nemesis system.\n\nYou could complete the game much quicker, but you would be missing out on much it has to offer.\n\nThe voicework was top-notch and the soundtrack was very good as well.\n\nCombat is very much like the Batman Arkham games.  Very fluid and smooth.  SImple to pick up but your skills and unlockable abilities give it depth the more you play and the animations are some of the best Ive ever seen!\n\nOverall, the game is not perfect.  The game is a little easy most of the time and others its brutally difficult but this is mostly dependant on the players actions.  The story was a little short and simple, but it works and sets up for a sequel.  Also, there were two instances where I got stuck on an object and had to quick travel to get out of it.  The game ran flawlessly other than that on my modest PC on low/medium settings.  Zero crashes, graphical glitches and I played the game from day one.\n\n9/10  highly recommended, bring on the DLC content now.","October 5, 2014","true","46.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

He bore full metal armor, a metal shield, and wore the head of a Caragor. All of his armor was adorned with the tusks and claws of beasts. We met in a small trench as I was chasing down another captain and was about to kill him. Skakuga came from a nearby stronghold bridge after hearing the screams of a fellow captain. Anytime I tried to jump over his shield, Skakuga countered me, anytime I tried to shoot him with an arrow, it simply deflected off him. Explosions and caragors only angered him. He was fearless, would never retreat. Obviously I met my match in that trench. The captain I was chasing was long forgotten and all that lay in front of was Skakuga, who was towering over me, ready to deliver a final blow with his Caragon-claw trident. But Skakuga did not kill me, he told me, "You are not worth the nicks you left on my blade" and walked off. I stood up, belligered but alive. Skakuga had been promoted for being able to tell me off. I was beyond enraged, I wanted vengeance. I advanced time and finally inflitrated Skakuga's stronghold. I decided to use guerilla warfare. I brought down Mogfly nests, set off explosions, kill archers, released caragors. I made that stronghold a living hell. Skakuga found sanctuary in a decrepit courtyard. From above, I jumped, ready for my revenge. But Skakuga was invunerable to stealth and countered me. He called about twenty orcs to help him and just as before, he told me off and walked away. I could not escaped, a grunt killed me and was raised to captain. My desire for revenge grew yet every time I met with Skakuga (sometimes, completely at random), he would nearly kill me and walk off again. Never I ever felt as motivated and driven to keep playing and killing enemies as I have in SoM. There are real,  real consequences to your death or humiliation. Captains become more powerful, harder to kill, and will remember every encounter. This game is amazing and I highly reccomend you buying it.\n\nP.S. ♥♥♥♥ you, Skakuga","October 2, 2014","true","57.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","1"

I enjoyed this more than both of those games however, mostly due to the excellent fluid sword combat. The Orc hierarchy system, in which Orcs who kill you rise through the ranks becoming increasingly powerful, is also unique and interesting. The world at first felt somewhat sparse, but plenty going on once you start exploring. Be warned, the game has a steep learning curve at times, but you can find a way to progress without too much difficult if you think laterally. For example, whilst I never really got stuck, I did encounter a particular Orc Captain who was practically invincible. Luckily none of the actual War Chiefs were quite so tough, so it didn't prevent me from progressing to the second greener setting in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/241930/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Shadow of Mordor is a 3rd person Action-Adventure game from Monolith Productions, previously known for the excellent F.E.A.R. and the underrated Tron 2.0. In Shadow of Mordor, you play as Talion, a Ranger of Gondor stationed at the Black Gate.\n\nFor those looking for comparable games, one of the easiest comparisons would be the Arkham series also published by WB. The combat sticks closely to that model, using a combination of strikes, parries and dodges to help you get the edge on your enemies. Those that have played all the Arkham games may find the combat to be too easy due to their familiarity, however there is the option to turn off button indicators which can make things a little more difficult. Another close comparison would be the Assassin's Creed games, which the overall map stucture and parkour system borrows heavily from. Shadow of Mordor manages to blend a lot of the good aspects from these two game series to create an enjoyable new adventure.\n\nThe main innovation of Shadow of Mordor, and one we will most definitely be seeing in other game series in the future, is the Nemesis system. The majority of side missions in the game involves attacks on Uruk, and the subsequest consequences on their social structure. Regular Uruk are ruled by captains, who are ruled by chiefs. Every enemy captain you encounter is unique, with their own name, strenghts and weakness. They will remember their encounters with you, will remind you of any times they have defeated you in battle, and may even return from defeat to fight you another time. These can lead to some fun conflicts with Uruks who just can't stop coming back for more, each time showing new scars from previous battles. If a Uruk manages to defeat you, they increase in power and become more difficult to defeat the next time.\n\nThe story is very enjoyable, especially for a licensed game. The developers did themselves a favor by mostly using characters and a time period not explored in previous work. They were free to thell their own story, which they did well. In addition, the events in this game tie in nicely to all of the other Lord of the Rings material. You will get more background on how certain events before the films happened, and you will also see some set up for things that you do witness in the movies and books.\n\nThe graphics in Shadow of Mordor are remarkable. While I began the game with computer hardware that was beginning to show its age, the game scaled well so I could still have a usuable framerate while enjoying some of what the graphics had to offer. Upon upgrading my computer about halfway through my time with the game, I was treated to some amazing visuals and incredibly detailed characters. The landscape of Mordor is a little more varied than I was expecting after reading the books and watching the movies, but I am grateful that it wasn't all desolate wasteland.\n\nThe controls don't stray far from the usual 3rd person action formula. I found them very responsive, and never did I feel like it was difficult to pull off a button combination. This game could use a few less QTEs, but sometimes it is the only way to show off a particular set piece.\n\nThe music and voice acting is top notch. Fantasy voice work can get corny at times, but this game never felt that way.\n\nOverall, I completely recommend Shadow of Mordor, not only for fans of Lord of the Rings, but for everyone. While the gameplay does borrow heavily from the Arkham and Assassin's Creed franchises, it uses the best from each. Shadow of Mordor also adds a new innovation to the genre, the Nemesis system, which is sure to show up in other franchises in the future. The story is enjoyable, the combat is smooth, and the graphics are great.

Basically it is the political system of Uruks killing Uruks (Or killing you) to rise the ranks. If you let a lowly soldier finish you off they will rise in rank and power as the climb to the top.\nGraphics- The game isn't meant to be the prettiest thing you have ever seen but it does look good.\nMusic- Fitting music to the soundscape, never found myself dreading the same theme in over 25+ hours of gameplay.\nGameplay- Alot of hack and slash action coupled with Quicktime based combat. It is fun enough to go out on the map and just kill random Uruks for fun.\nNegatives:\nMissions can become repetitive if you aim to complete them all.\nSome map issues- Got caught in the environment a couple of times and fell through the map once, just minor annoyances.","January 19, 2015","true","42.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dignifiedpeach/recommended/241930/","dignifiedpeach","DignifiedPeach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dignifiedpeach/","159 products in account","Overview\n---\n\nAccording to the game, I'm 12% through the game. This game is filled with Assassin's Creed-like parkour, Batman Arkham Asylum/City/Origins-like combat, and it's more entertaining than ever. It's a hack and slash with amazing elements that you will most likely not find in any other game. Not only is this a Lord of the Rings game, which is a selling point for most fans, but it's combat is fluid and systems in the game is faultless.\n\nI believe that this game will never get boring. The endless nemesis system is awesome, as many new captains come in, kill/hunt with each other, working their way up to legendary captains, which is their ultimate goal. Along the way, not only do orcs get attacked by your character, killing them after their fruitful efforts to reach the top, but also competing orcs. If an orc gets to a high enough power level, he will try to move up in rank...but some of the times that doesn't work, resulting in the loss of their lives and making the winner a target for the player.\n\nYou can get upgrades for your weapons in game, and also upgrades for your character and wraith abilities. You do missions to gather a currency to purchase more health, shots for your bow and arrow, and slots for your weapons. You have three weapons in the game, which all play crucial parts; the sword, the bow, and the broken sword, which functions as a dagger. The sword is for most melee combat, the bow is for taking out ranged troops and grunt ground troops, and the sword is for stealth kills.\n\nAlso, if you have friends who play the game, when you progress through the storyline, you unlock Vendetta waypoints. if you go to one of these, you have a chance to murder your friend's nemesis, which is the 'Uruk' that killed them most. This feature is awesome.\n\nPros and Cons\n---\n\nPros-\n-Great graphics, even on low\n-Fantastic combat, gory and different every time, also challenging depending on your advantage in stealth\n-Brilliant mechanics\n\nCons-\n-The storyline's don't really line up. In the game, it takes place in between the end of the Hobbit book and before the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, the enemies you encounter in the game are called Uruks, short for Uruk-Hai, which is Saruman's creation. This is before Saruman has begun working for Sauron, therein these 'Uruks' shouldn't be in the game.\n\nI hope you appreciated my review, and I hope you buy the game. Add me if you do so I can avenge you from your nemesis! :)\n\nEDIT:\n\nUpon completing the game, I just wanted to warn you. The final battle isn't exactly a battle...You just press buttons to block attacks. But the rest of the game is great, there's two different maps you can travel around, adding to the adventure.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 Beautiful scenery, gore, and orcs.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10 Engaging Combat, Interesting Systems, Disappointing Last Boss Fight.\n\nControls: 9/10 Good Controls, easier with a keyboard and mouse than a controller.

So the universe and the lores behind the movies or the novels mean nothing to me. I have to say, when I bought this game I did not buy it for the story, I just wanted a fun action game with tons of content and very addictive gameplay. I am happy to confirm I got what I wanted and it was more than overdose.\n\nThe first thing I want to address is that this game was made by Monolith Studio who also made the popular WWE series. It is strongly portrayed in the game by the way characters walk, tackle and performing actions which is really cool as it work perfectly well in a game where the world is dominated by the Orcs. When a warchief is making an entrance you get all the lesser orcs chanting out their name making them look badass and you get the sense of satisfaction by cutting off their head at the end and claiming that epic rune.\n\nThe game plays very smooth. It combines features from The Batman and Assassins Creed series but improves on the formula by having a deeper and better combat system, better stealth approach and wide array of interesting skills at your disposal. At certain point of the game I was actually really weak and was unable to defeat even an orc captain and was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about the game. However, as I dig deeper into the combat system and gained a few more levels I was able to finally defeat that nemesis that claimed my head countless of times. Speaking about revenge, the game introduced a very unique system called the 'Nemesis' system in which as player and time passes and evolves, the ranks within the orc army will also change. You soon learn that enemy AI behave extremely smart by roaming from place to place, killing superior orcs to gain power, dominate fellow orcs to earn an army and even ambush you when you were fighting other orcs. There will always be one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that always kill you becoming stronger each time and eventually raise in power to become a warchief. Furthermore, this system makes the AI memorise you so that the next time they meet you they come prepared with bodyguards as well as better equipments.\n\nThe game was also very intense from time to time with some battles lasting way longer than 10mins as waves of orcs swarming in I find my self unable to escape or rather, the manliness inside me tells me to face them head on and after killing near hundres of orcs and gained a few powerful runes it results in a very satisfying warm little fuzzy feeling inside.\n\nAfter 20 or so hours into the game, the epicness is really showing as the world  totally opened up to you and you pretty much gained most of the abilities helping you to dominate the orcs in any situation. You can ride a caragor into battle and you can even ride a Graug to siege an entire orc fortress which was absolutely mind blowing. On top of this the game graphics looks absolutely beautfiful with very detailed graphics options. However, to have the graphics setting set to ultra high you will need a high - end pc to play it.\n\nWhen I was using a Razer blade with GTX 765m I can play on high setting with about 40-50 fps. With a Alienware m18x dual GTX 560m I get about similar results and with my desktop with R9 290X I can play on ultra with 60fps no problem. So it is fair to say that this game is well optimised. To top it all off, the game comes with a photo mode helping you to capture every moments of glory and it has many features that you can play around with to capture some really beautiful eye candy.\n\nFinal verdict 10/10\nI believe that this game is my game of the year 2014, as 2014 hasn't been a great year for gaming I think that shadow of Mordor really do stand out from the rest and it is packed with tons of content as well as delivering a satisfying experience to fans of the series or action game lovers alike.\n\ntl;dr\n+Fun combat mechanics\n+Satisfying orc slaying mayhem\n+interesting set of skills / passives\n+blend stealth with action really well\n+Gorgeous Graphics\n+Tons of content\n+Addictive and challenging\n-skins offer no new voices (Every skin uses Talion's voice)\n-Season pass doesn't offer much content\n\nP.S. I have played about 30hours some were played in offline mode because I had no internet for a few days so the record on steam is wrong. within the 30hrs of game time I completed all the main missions, side quests (except killing all orcs), found all collectibles and learned all the skills as well as the passives.","December 30, 2014","true","17.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Arkham esque. Brutally violent. Every execution could be it's own Slayer album cover.\n\nCombat Cons: After several hours of playing it can become a bit dull and repeatative.\n----\nStory Pros: It's brief and unobtrusive. Often in games that let you choose your playstyle the story parts have your character doing things that you've avoided doing for hours of gameplay. (in farcry 3 I played very stealthy and yet in every cut scene this kid was running around screaming his head off like an idiot)\n\nStory Cons: The story is generic and kind of flat. Which isn't to say it's bad but some people may be expecting a lotro/hobbit epic adventure and it's not really that.\n----\nWhy should I not just wait until this game is $10 on steam sale?: Quite simply, the world they created is stunning. The Nemesis system is by far one of the single most interesting mechanics added to the Assassins Credd/Batman games since they added boats to the Assassins Creed series. I completed the game in just over the minimum completion time which is not a feat by any means but what is impressive is that after I did that I spent the next 5 hours watching how the nemesis system played out. Sometimes I would kill my own guys to create a power vaccum just to see who took over. It's truly fascinating. Sometimes you'll find a weird little Orc that you just have to back in their power play because they're such a weird dude. When one guy kills you it beccomes a personal vendetta. Unlike quick time events I hope the Nemesis gets picked up by every game maker because it just helps give the player a vested interest in the world they occupy.","December 25, 2014","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First, it looks beautiful, the graphics are a joy to behold.  The combat is fun, similar to the Batman games.  As you progress, you pick up enough new abilities, that slicing through a horde of Uruks just never gets old.The Assassin's Creed reference I mentioned is how your character moves though the areas.  There is a lot of climbing and perching above your prey and attacking from above, which, like the combat, never seems to get old.\nBut what really makes this game shine is the Nemesis system.  You really feel like these are real Uruks you are killing, all with different weaknesses and strengths and widely varied appearances.  You can join in on a power struggle between Orc captains and influence who wins.  As the captains and warchiefs gain power, they get promoted and move up in ranking.  Also, if some random orc kills you, he automatically gets promoted to captain, and has a name and gains a little armor to alter his appearance.  You can then kill him for a vendetta.  It is a very engaging system and honestly, I had a great time just trying to kill the captains and wreak havoc among their leadership.  It's great fun!","November 3, 2014","true","50.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Without that layer of personalisation to a players experience with the game, this title would've been completely mediocre and totally lacking in substance. I gotta say, I completely walked away from the story segments of the game just to ♥♥♥♥ around with the Nemesis system and it was alot of fun, the story itself was extremely lacking. By the time I came back to the story missions I'd maxed out my abilities for the most part, only came back to the story to unlock abilities like branding which was a whole new level of fun! In short, it's just fun to play the game, sure the combat may be simple but it's for show and if you combo your abilities like a ♥♥♥♥ing boss, you look like a badass and naturally send Uruks running in all direction. If you really want a challenge, handicap yourself by not taking health upgrades and such, some captains and warchiefs will one shot you, given the right traits. Overall, decent game, but what it brought to the table with the Nemesis system is some serious potential to influence greater AI systems and objectives in future titles.","October 13, 2014","true","33.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a 550 Mirian reward; such challenges really make you push for those 2500 upgrades, which I have one of. You would think that getting those upgrades would make the game too easy, in a way it does, but it makes it so much more epic. Before you were worried about those spear and shield guys, and those dual-wielders right? Not anymore, activate the Sword of Urfael and brand them all instantly and have them turn on the Captain and other orcs (who then get rekt).\nWhile it makes it easier with those upgrades it also gives you a much larger set of options to complete certain tasks and missions. No longer do you have to sneak about and kill EVERY archer before you go in, for fear of getting shot. Go around and brand a few then charge in and brand everyone with the ability, making it a 15v1 on the Captain :P\n\nThis game is amazing, after so few hours I still have a lot to do and cannot wait for the DLC's where you can play as Celebrimbor and the extra missions.","October 5, 2014","true","38.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had the feeling that the nemesis system was going to be a gimmicky mess and I had also heard about the shady marketing deals concerning reviewers and such.\n\nAfter seeing gameplay/reviews of it, I decided to give it a chance after all. It may just have been the best decision I've made this year, because my god is this game great... Shadow of Mordor is going to be on a lot of GOTY/top10lists this year, not because of shady marketing deals with reviewers, but because the game is damn good.\n\nThe things that make this game so damn good:\n-The nemesis system offers a dynamic system and gives the player a unique story besides the main storyline. It also offers a bunch of replayability and one of the things I've seen is people doing Uruk pitfights(pitting one Uruk against the other and watching it play out).\n-The main storyline isn't mindblowingly good, but it does its job well and it weaves in a lot of the other Tolkien stories into it, thus making it really interesting.\n-The collectibles are a bunch of fun to find, since they offer a little more info about not just the items, but about characters in the story.\n-There is nothing like slicing and dicing some Orc scum, the combat is a beatiful marriage between AC series(also this game actually does parkour better than AC?!) , the Arkham series, and the DMC series. It just doesn't get old.\n-The music and voiceacting gives this game a really Tolkienesque feeling and hearing an Orc say 'stop faffing about" and such also never gets old.\n-You will want to stay in this openworld. Why can't hunting beasts and butchering Orcs with the nemesis system be a real job?\n\nBesides all of the positive stuff, it's hard to find anything bad about this game. If I had to nitpick it would be:\n-The game runs really smooth, yet 6gigs of Vram to play on Ultra is a little silly.\n-The openworld is really fun, yet a lot of the sideactivities will only last you so long, although the nemesis system will keep you going if you enjoy the fighting and such.\n-The combat can get a little easy at the end of the line, because of all the OP abilities, though combat remains fun and with the nemesis system you can create your own difficulty.\n\nI'm eagerly awaiting the season pass content.

That is probably the case with this game as well, but I enjoyed this game enough for me to put my 2 cents in.\n\nI didn't think I would like this game. In fact, when I first seen that this game was another LOTR game, I was turned off instantly. I can only think of one other good LOTR game (personal opinion of course) as games that pull from this IP or any movie / book IP always seem to fall short on quality. This game is a huge exception.\n\nWatching the trailer I got excited. It really seemed like a solid mix of Batman / Assassin's Creed, and I love both of those games- at the same time it looked like a rip off. How could this game be mechanically better than either of those games? While not necessarily mechanically better than either, it is different enough from both and what they do offer as far as combat mechanics is satisfying and feels great.\n\nStealth elements are not as fleshed out as assassin's creed, so don't get hyped over stealth mechanics. They are not bad, but the meat of the gameplay comes from the solid combat system which is where this game truly shines. When you enter combat, combos are smooth and flashy, and the system succeeds at making you feel like a true badass.\n\nThat last point is probably where this game really hits the nail on the head for me. No other game lately has made me feel so unstoppable- so powerful and badass. I can go into fighting a hoard of Orcs right in the middle of a stronghold and have a blast just battling waves of enemies. It has yet to get old! The combat is something I enjoy with a passion. That being said, while earlier in the game it can be more difficult than later on, I do wish there were ways to increase the overall difficulty.\n\nThe core of the game revolves around fighting Captains and Warchiefs which have different stats and abilities. The game gives you tools which can make fighting strong captains and warchiefs easier, but most of the time you can do the same combo to take them out. Sometimes they can block your initial stun, but then you just role over them and hit them from behind with your stun and continue your combo. Sometimes they can block your stun and block your roll over them. Then you have to start thinking outside the box, especially if they have the Combat Master buff. The truth is, once you unlock more abilities and skills, combat becomes more of a slaughter than a battle or challenge. I wish that there were stronger Captains / Warchiefs that were so strong that you HAVE to use their fears or other mechanics against them.\n\nOverall I would say that this game (FOR ME) is a no brainer. I would buy it again- in fact, I will probably get the season pass just so I can enjoy the upcoming DLC. There are not many games I go back too- especially in this day and age where I have 100 games to play and only time for a hand full of them. This game however, I will be finding any excuse I can find to play more of it. I have already beat the story mode, and I am now having a blast going through self made scenarios or goals that I make. Do I feel like killing every Captain / Warchief on the map? How about mind controlling all of them? How about I go get revenge on a captain who happened to get a cheap kill on me earlier? The story is really yours to craft, and that's probably one of the biggest highlights of this game. The Shadow of Mordor sandbox has all the tools you need to make your own fun.\n\nMy last point will be regarding what the game calls the Nemesis System. This is probably one of the cooler aspects of the sandbox and truly brings a lot to the table. It adds a lot of personality to the Orcs, and gives every Orc / Captain / Warchief a little uniqueness and personality. Captains will remember you and mention past encounters you may have had. Orcs don't always look different, but there are certainly many varieties of Orc to keep it mostly random, and each have their own quirks that makes them one of a kind. It's something that I really appreciate, and one of the reasons I wish the game was harder. I hardly got a "rival" or an Orc that was too hard for me to beat. I would say there was only one Orc in particular through my entire playthrough that killed me twice, but that was before I knew you could upgrade your max health!\n\nOverall this game was completely worth it. I had a great time playing it, and I recommend it for those of you who enjoy the Lord of the Rings setting, and a good action game. The only true improvements I could think of is adding difficulty options, mod support, and more customization, but what we do have is excellent. I think many would agree.","October 24, 2014","true","41.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Another thing is that, although it is a brilliant game, if you don't like quicktime events don't buy it. As a lot of the main bosses and mini bosses etc. end on a quicktime event. The good things about it though is the fluidness of the non quicktime fights, as the attacks flow without pause and the special abilities that you unlock make the fights even more enjoyable, the graphics are amazing and the overall emersion is great fun.

But, it still isn't the worst.\nLeft click to do a normal attack, right click to block. Throw in a F and a 2 once in a while, and you have some good cinematic camera deaths.\nIt is simple, but still fun. I hit a 200 streak and I felt like I did something..lol\nYou can up the anty, so to speak, if you pull your bow out when you get swarmed. Plus, you throw in some of the later "skills" that you get, and you can come up with some cool maneuvering and fights in general.\nGameplay mechanics in general; I give it 4 Orkish Screams, out of 5.    4/5\n\nSide Quests:\nThere is a few different types to go on. Which I do like. BUT.....They can get repetitive, and after a few, you get to "know" how to handle it with ease. Not that "that" is a bad thing. It just could have had a bit more to it. Like with the "slave" missions; They could have had consequences. Maybe a timer to release them, and if you failed, it would give you some bad reputation. So the next one you take could have the chance that a slave would give you away, or give you some bad info...I dont know, but something seems missing in the side missions.\nI give it 3 Orkish Screams out of 5.     3/5\n\nArtifacts and Runes:\nI really liked the idea of finding atrifacts. And then being able to "hear" the memories in them, was absolutly genius! Not only do you get a bit of some story line info. But, you also get random info from random "people" in the land of Mordor.\nI really iked that about the game. I just cant see why they decided to go the route they did with the runes. If they wanted to have a "boss" drop something, why not a weapon/armor/etc? The icon for a rune drop bugs me as well. I would have rather had to do like the artifacts, and had to go into wraith mode to find them. Plus they could have made them look like a rune, maybe a stone with a rune on it. And, we could have looked back through them, like the artifacts.\nSo, eventhough I do love the artifacts, I dont the runes...\nI give this "system" 3 Orkish Screams out of 5. (only because of the artifacts)   3/5\n\nMain Story Line:\nAdmittingly I found it a bit lacking at first. I couldn't see what made "me" the one that had to be "possessed", and had to stay and fight instead of being with my wife and kid..lol\nBut, as I was getting into finding these artifacts, some opened up more of the "behind the scenes" story that I was missing. It took a while for me to understand what time period we were in. I couldnt figure out if this story was before, during, or after, the trilogy. (I admit I havent read the books. Dont sue me..lol) But, I figured it out..lmao\nI must say that even after I figured it out, I still feel like there could have been more to it. Tie in's to more charactors in the game, and movies for that matter. So it seemed short, I guess is what Im getting at..lol\nI give it 3 Orkish Grunts out of 5.      3/5\n\nSo overall, I would love to see this grow a bit. I did notice that there is a "season pass", but I cant see getting it yet. A "horde mode" isnt going to cut it for me. I can get that in one of the main camps. I will probably wait to see what is released, and decide then whether or not it worth getting. As it is right now, I cant justify a season pass.\n\nMy overall rank:\nI give Shadow of Mordor 3 Orkish Screams out of 5.\nMostly for a lacking of content, for me.\nVery Fun, interesting, and I dont regret the purchase.\nBut, the replayability isn't there for me. (maybe if they add a co-op mode? But I cant say THAT would do it either.)\nI would still recommend to anyone wanting a hack and slash with a "Middle Earth" theme.\n(maybe wait a bit for it to drop down to around 30$. Which I predict will be around December.)\n","October 11, 2014","true","90.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

He has been "Banished from Death" by a mysterious wraith who will help him exact his revenge.\n\nThe game is well acted, with Troy Baker nailing the main character. The story of revenge isn't entirely original but is made interesting with the addition of a wraith in the cast.\n\nThe combat is solid, being a slightly dumb downed version of the Arkham system. The combat is just as unforgiving however and it takes some time to get used to the mechanics. Arkham veterens will, however, not find much diffictuly, but should enjoy the system for what it is.\n\nThe highlight of the game, The Nemesis system, brings your enemies to life with unique foes that evolve based on your actions. They come back for revenge if you take them down and will taunt you endlessly if they take you down. It's a breath of fresh air that could have been a disaster.\n\nThe game is a fantastic value. It took me around 18 hours to finish the main game with a bit of dillydallying.\n\n8/10. Worth the 50 dollar price tag, especially for Lord of the Rings fans. It is one of the best open world games this year and the best Lord of the Rings game of all time.","October 11, 2014","true","50.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I bought this game with really high hopes, hearing how great the combat system, and the nemesis system were, and had a blast for the first few hours or so. About halfway through the game really started to drag on for me. I like to try to do everything before the main quest, so I kept trying to kill all of the chieftains and warlords, and you can't. It's horribly frustrating to keep trying to kill everything off, and then logging off and coming back on just to have everyone be replaced and you no longer have intel on them. And the combat is so easy it's boring. You can just crouch and suddenly you're invisible and can do whatever you want, and if anyone does see you, you just pull out your sword and kill them in a few quick hits. The character just feels too over powered for the world, other than caragors. Caragors were the bane of my existence in this game, and I would rather fight 3 warlords at the same time than deal with a single caragor. Worth it if you can get it cheap, but I wouldn't pay full price.","February 22, 2015","true","21.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let me explain while I find the gameplay fun and engaging others my not, it plays alot like the Assassin's Creed and newer Batman games combat wise, the music is excellent imo as well. The nemesis system is in-depth but not as in-depth as they lead us to believe in trailers and whatnot. Even though it still makes for interesting stories and gameplay, and speaking of stories this has one of the shortest I've seen in awhile. It's a pretty good bet that if you've played Assassin's Creed or Batman games and beaten them, if you just do the storyline and don't go running around like I did you could probably beat this in 8-10 hours. The game says its a large open world but don't believe it. Its two maps divided up into areas that you can freely roam in though you don't get access to the second map untill roughly the half-way point of the game. Overall still a fun game but I'd suggest renting it for console first before buying.\n\nOverall Score- 7/10\nMusic- 8/10\nCombat- 8/10\nStoryline 9/10 (while short is still excellent imo)\n","October 5, 2014","true","29.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let me explain while I find the gameplay fun and engaging others my not, it plays alot like the Assassin's Creed and newer Batman games combat wise, the music is excellent imo as well. The nemesis system is in-depth but not as in-depth as they lead us to believe in trailers and whatnot. Even though it still makes for interesting stories and gameplay, and speaking of stories this has one of the shortest I've seen in awhile. It's a pretty good bet that if you've played Assassin's Creed or Batman games and beaten them, if you just do the storyline and don't go running around like I did you could probably beat this in 8-10 hours. The game says its a large open world but don't believe it. Its two maps divided up into areas that you can freely roam in though you don't get access to the second map untill roughly the half-way point of the game. Overall still a fun game but I'd suggest renting it for console first before buying.\n\nOverall Score- 7/10\nMusic- 8/10\nCombat- 8/10\nStoryline 9/10 (while short is still excellent imo)\n","October 5, 2014","true","29.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Nemesis system adds a welcome twist to the familiar formula, though. Plus there's a little bit of Assassin's Creed thrown in for good measure. You could definitely rip off worse games if you wanted to.\n\nThe story is well-acted but doesn't make a whole lot of sense. There are a few really great characters though and the story was genuniely funny at times. Unfortunately it just sort of ends out of nowhere. I walked away going, "That was it?"\n\nIf you enjoyed Arkham Asylum/City and want to play a similar game set in the Lord of the Rings universe, Shadow of Mordor should satisfy you.

With a 550 Mirian reward; such challenges really make you push for those 2500 upgrades, which I have one of. You would think that getting those upgrades would make the game too easy, in a way it does, but it makes it so much more epic. Before you were worried about those spear and shield guys, and those dual-wielders right? Not anymore, activate the Sword of Urfael and brand them all instantly and have them turn on the Captain and other orcs (who then get rekt).\nWhile it makes it easier with those upgrades it also gives you a much larger set of options to complete certain tasks and missions. No longer do you have to sneak about and kill EVERY archer before you go in, for fear of getting shot. Go around and brand a few then charge in and brand everyone with the ability, making it a 15v1 on the Captain :P\n\nThis game is amazing, after so few hours I still have a lot to do and cannot wait for the DLC's where you can play as Celebrimbor and the extra missions.","October 5, 2014","true","38.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had the feeling that the nemesis system was going to be a gimmicky mess and I had also heard about the shady marketing deals concerning reviewers and such.\n\nAfter seeing gameplay/reviews of it, I decided to give it a chance after all. It may just have been the best decision I've made this year, because my god is this game great... Shadow of Mordor is going to be on a lot of GOTY/top10lists this year, not because of shady marketing deals with reviewers, but because the game is damn good.\n\nThe things that make this game so damn good:\n-The nemesis system offers a dynamic system and gives the player a unique story besides the main storyline. It also offers a bunch of replayability and one of the things I've seen is people doing Uruk pitfights(pitting one Uruk against the other and watching it play out).\n-The main storyline isn't mindblowingly good, but it does its job well and it weaves in a lot of the other Tolkien stories into it, thus making it really interesting.\n-The collectibles are a bunch of fun to find, since they offer a little more info about not just the items, but about characters in the story.\n-There is nothing like slicing and dicing some Orc scum, the combat is a beatiful marriage between AC series(also this game actually does parkour better than AC?!) , the Arkham series, and the DMC series. It just doesn't get old.\n-The music and voiceacting gives this game a really Tolkienesque feeling and hearing an Orc say 'stop faffing about" and such also never gets old.\n-You will want to stay in this openworld. Why can't hunting beasts and butchering Orcs with the nemesis system be a real job?\n\nBesides all of the positive stuff, it's hard to find anything bad about this game. If I had to nitpick it would be:\n-The game runs really smooth, yet 6gigs of Vram to play on Ultra is a little silly.\n-The openworld is really fun, yet a lot of the sideactivities will only last you so long, although the nemesis system will keep you going if you enjoy the fighting and such.\n-The combat can get a little easy at the end of the line, because of all the OP abilities, though combat remains fun and with the nemesis system you can create your own difficulty.\n\nI'm eagerly awaiting the season pass content.

First, it looks beautiful, the graphics are a joy to behold.  The combat is fun, similar to the Batman games.  As you progress, you pick up enough new abilities, that slicing through a horde of Uruks just never gets old.The Assassin's Creed reference I mentioned is how your character moves though the areas.  There is a lot of climbing and perching above your prey and attacking from above, which, like the combat, never seems to get old.\nBut what really makes this game shine is the Nemesis system.  You really feel like these are real Uruks you are killing, all with different weaknesses and strengths and widely varied appearances.  You can join in on a power struggle between Orc captains and influence who wins.  As the captains and warchiefs gain power, they get promoted and move up in ranking.  Also, if some random orc kills you, he automatically gets promoted to captain, and has a name and gains a little armor to alter his appearance.  You can then kill him for a vendetta.  It is a very engaging system and honestly, I had a great time just trying to kill the captains and wreak havoc among their leadership.  It's great fun!","November 3, 2014","true","50.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Without that layer of personalisation to a players experience with the game, this title would've been completely mediocre and totally lacking in substance. I gotta say, I completely walked away from the story segments of the game just to ♥♥♥♥ around with the Nemesis system and it was alot of fun, the story itself was extremely lacking. By the time I came back to the story missions I'd maxed out my abilities for the most part, only came back to the story to unlock abilities like branding which was a whole new level of fun! In short, it's just fun to play the game, sure the combat may be simple but it's for show and if you combo your abilities like a ♥♥♥♥ing boss, you look like a badass and naturally send Uruks running in all direction. If you really want a challenge, handicap yourself by not taking health upgrades and such, some captains and warchiefs will one shot you, given the right traits. Overall, decent game, but what it brought to the table with the Nemesis system is some serious potential to influence greater AI systems and objectives in future titles.","October 13, 2014","true","33.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That is probably the case with this game as well, but I enjoyed this game enough for me to put my 2 cents in.\n\nI didn't think I would like this game. In fact, when I first seen that this game was another LOTR game, I was turned off instantly. I can only think of one other good LOTR game (personal opinion of course) as games that pull from this IP or any movie / book IP always seem to fall short on quality. This game is a huge exception.\n\nWatching the trailer I got excited. It really seemed like a solid mix of Batman / Assassin's Creed, and I love both of those games- at the same time it looked like a rip off. How could this game be mechanically better than either of those games? While not necessarily mechanically better than either, it is different enough from both and what they do offer as far as combat mechanics is satisfying and feels great.\n\nStealth elements are not as fleshed out as assassin's creed, so don't get hyped over stealth mechanics. They are not bad, but the meat of the gameplay comes from the solid combat system which is where this game truly shines. When you enter combat, combos are smooth and flashy, and the system succeeds at making you feel like a true badass.\n\nThat last point is probably where this game really hits the nail on the head for me. No other game lately has made me feel so unstoppable- so powerful and badass. I can go into fighting a hoard of Orcs right in the middle of a stronghold and have a blast just battling waves of enemies. It has yet to get old! The combat is something I enjoy with a passion. That being said, while earlier in the game it can be more difficult than later on, I do wish there were ways to increase the overall difficulty.\n\nThe core of the game revolves around fighting Captains and Warchiefs which have different stats and abilities. The game gives you tools which can make fighting strong captains and warchiefs easier, but most of the time you can do the same combo to take them out. Sometimes they can block your initial stun, but then you just role over them and hit them from behind with your stun and continue your combo. Sometimes they can block your stun and block your roll over them. Then you have to start thinking outside the box, especially if they have the Combat Master buff. The truth is, once you unlock more abilities and skills, combat becomes more of a slaughter than a battle or challenge. I wish that there were stronger Captains / Warchiefs that were so strong that you HAVE to use their fears or other mechanics against them.\n\nOverall I would say that this game (FOR ME) is a no brainer. I would buy it again- in fact, I will probably get the season pass just so I can enjoy the upcoming DLC. There are not many games I go back too- especially in this day and age where I have 100 games to play and only time for a hand full of them. This game however, I will be finding any excuse I can find to play more of it. I have already beat the story mode, and I am now having a blast going through self made scenarios or goals that I make. Do I feel like killing every Captain / Warchief on the map? How about mind controlling all of them? How about I go get revenge on a captain who happened to get a cheap kill on me earlier? The story is really yours to craft, and that's probably one of the biggest highlights of this game. The Shadow of Mordor sandbox has all the tools you need to make your own fun.\n\nMy last point will be regarding what the game calls the Nemesis System. This is probably one of the cooler aspects of the sandbox and truly brings a lot to the table. It adds a lot of personality to the Orcs, and gives every Orc / Captain / Warchief a little uniqueness and personality. Captains will remember you and mention past encounters you may have had. Orcs don't always look different, but there are certainly many varieties of Orc to keep it mostly random, and each have their own quirks that makes them one of a kind. It's something that I really appreciate, and one of the reasons I wish the game was harder. I hardly got a "rival" or an Orc that was too hard for me to beat. I would say there was only one Orc in particular through my entire playthrough that killed me twice, but that was before I knew you could upgrade your max health!\n\nOverall this game was completely worth it. I had a great time playing it, and I recommend it for those of you who enjoy the Lord of the Rings setting, and a good action game. The only true improvements I could think of is adding difficulty options, mod support, and more customization, but what we do have is excellent. I think many would agree.","October 24, 2014","true","41.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

BUT THATS PAST THE POINT.\n\nMiddle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a beautiful game full of immense stories and side missions, absolutely outstanding graphics, (might I add that the game is  THIRTY FOUR GIGABYTES!!!! The nemesis system is my personal favorite feature of the game. It combines frustration with extreme joy whenever you either lose to a really terrible enemy which was by accident or just lost, which is really frustrating, OR whenever an enemy you really despise gets beaten in a duel BY the enemy that you just lost to. You can pretty much climb ANYTHING between a pillar and 100 foot mountain. I have been saved by scaling rocks and such countless times, thats not including the caragor, the caragor makes it so if you're sprinting then well you can climb anything...\n\nWhats really frustrating is that there is no difficulty settings so you are stuck playing on 1 set setting. Hence my forewarning. This makes you either die a lot or makes the game a fun challenge and you die a lot which is a good mixture. With Arkham Origins, its really disappointing since the enemys are so easy to defeat but with the Shadow of Mordor, either you counter right or you die.\n\nI honestly don't see a reason to dislike the Shadow of Mordor.

An absurdly short single-player only campaign lies at the center of this title's glaring flaws, wrapped up in a story that rapes Tolkien's lore harder as it progresses. In spite of numerous "professional" reviewers assuring me that I would die repeatedly and make mortal enemies of many Uruks, I found this game very easy due to its shallow and unbelievably forgiving stealth mechanics and simplistic Assassin's Creed/Arkham style whack-a-mole combat with QTE boss battles. The fact that the game manages to be enjoyable in spite of all of this is truly remarkable. Combat finishers are glorious, violent, and satisfying. The much-touted "Nemesis System" did not disappoint, and it was a ton of fun to play around with. I could mess around with the Uruks for hours just seeing what new characters the game generated for me to murder while keeping around the personalities I liked. The music, voice acting, and environments all contributed to lasting immersion. Ultimately, Shadow of Mordor has one really interesting mechanic that eclipses the rest of its mediocre mechanics, and it sports just enough gloss to transform what would otherwise be a real turd of a game into a satisfying and worthwhile purchase.","November 5, 2014","true","122.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With Shadow of Mordor, the game's core concept wouldn't work in any kind of linear construct. It's the only game I've seen that actually makes positive use of the open-world concept.\n\nThe fighting system is basically the same as any of the Batman: Arkham games. It gets it right, though; stringing together the combos and prioritizing targets is fun and addictive. The combat is entertaining and works just fine with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nThere is a traditional main line of quests, but for the most part these serve as tutorials for doing the real work of the game, which is trying to gain control of the army of Orcs by interfering in their political struggles in ways that benefit your plans. And they really are your plans, not ones the game has fed to you; you have to get control of a captain and set him up for success by helping him cheat at duels, gain prestige by throwing good parties, and so on.\n\nAnother amazing feature of this game that I haven't seen nearly enough about in the gaming press is the facial expression engine. Orcs look angry, confused, and utterly terrified in the most convincing ways. It's a small thing that has an emotional impact that isn't immediately obvious and simple. Bravo for this.\n\nAs for problems, I only really noticed two. First of all the environments are boring. It's all just the same decaying stone buildings, mud, and scraggly plants. I realize it's supposed to be Mordor, but I still feel they could have worked harder at this, maybe by varying the architecture, putting more wildlife that isn't caragors and graugs, adding a swamp, or whatever. There's no real excuse for how identical everything looks.\n\nSecondly, I get stuck a lot on weird little jutting pieces of the wall or tiny rocks I should be able to easily step over. The fact that I can climb a 100-foot tower by walking next to it and pressing spacebar, but get stuck on tiny rocks the size of a baseball is maddening. It is an intermittent problem, but it crops up just enough to be irritating.\n\nIn the end, it's a really fun game about a guy with cool super powers killing a lot of Orcs in fun ways. It has unique gameplay mechanics, a solid enough story, visceral violence, and no god damn crafting system. Buy it and play it. It's worth it.","March 8, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As an undead bent on revenge, his lacking emotion and missing humanity are probably fitting but make it quite difficult for the player to form a relationship.\n\nThe friendly NPCs are either obnoxious or forgettably dull - sometimes both. Characters have one goal, feature one or two emotions at maximum making it impossible for a player to care for them.\n\nThe story needed to take place between The Hobbit™ and The Lord Of The Rings™, being completely overshadowed by both, giving the title an ironical, yet unmeant, twist.\n\nThe game-play is repetitive as approx. 80% of time your are fighting, 16% running around Mordor, with a 3% loading and cut screens.\n\nSo why do I recommend the game?\n\nWell, the fighting is sublime, the combat is satisfying. It looks gorgeous. Decapitating an Orc (or Uruk-hai™ :-p) never gets old in this game. Commands are responsive, as a player you don't feel cheated by the mechanics. Upgrades are meaningful, the collectable runes count as loot and give grinding a purpose.\n\nBut that's not it:\nIt features the best enemies I ever fought in a video-game.\n\nOrc Captains have more personality than most of the friendly NPCs combined, let alone the "schizophrenic" undead protagonist.\nThey have weaknesses, strengths, a motivation and they do what Orcs do best: they like to fight each other as much as they like to fight you. They remember your actions and taunt your for them, they might get stronger, or killed by their competitors if you don't interfere and each of these things can be used to your advantage if you take the right steps.\n\nThe voice acting is state of the art, the cut-scenes are not pre-rendered, still very engaging, giving you an individual touch each game you start and each Captain you butcher on your way to revenge.\n\nSo in conclusion:\nThis game is the best Orc-Butchering Simulator I ever played. If you want to unwind with butchering hordes of Orcs and their commanders this game is the best on the market in my opinion but if you care for anything else than Orc-Butchering you will find the game sadly lacking.","November 23, 2014","true","169.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The storyline to this ganme was really awesome and theres quite a few twist no one could see coming....ok maybe a few people. However, it reminds me of Skyrim. ANyway, theres a lot to do in this game and the Nemisis System is pretty cool. The orc captains and warchiefs remember what  happenend in the last encounter you had and slihtly adapt. Not to mention they havea comment if they meet you in battle again. Theres uprades, mounts for you to ride, the ability ti brand yiour opponents and have them fight for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dignifiedpeach/recommended/241930/","dignifiedpeach","DignifiedPeach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dignifiedpeach/","159 products in account","Overview\n---\n\nAccording to the game, I'm 12% through the game. This game is filled with Assassin's Creed-like parkour, Batman Arkham Asylum/City/Origins-like combat, and it's more entertaining than ever. It's a hack and slash with amazing elements that you will most likely not find in any other game. Not only is this a Lord of the Rings game, which is a selling point for most fans, but it's combat is fluid and systems in the game is faultless.\n\nI believe that this game will never get boring. The endless nemesis system is awesome, as many new captains come in, kill/hunt with each other, working their way up to legendary captains, which is their ultimate goal. Along the way, not only do orcs get attacked by your character, killing them after their fruitful efforts to reach the top, but also competing orcs. If an orc gets to a high enough power level, he will try to move up in rank...but some of the times that doesn't work, resulting in the loss of their lives and making the winner a target for the player.\n\nYou can get upgrades for your weapons in game, and also upgrades for your character and wraith abilities. You do missions to gather a currency to purchase more health, shots for your bow and arrow, and slots for your weapons. You have three weapons in the game, which all play crucial parts; the sword, the bow, and the broken sword, which functions as a dagger. The sword is for most melee combat, the bow is for taking out ranged troops and grunt ground troops, and the sword is for stealth kills.\n\nAlso, if you have friends who play the game, when you progress through the storyline, you unlock Vendetta waypoints. if you go to one of these, you have a chance to murder your friend's nemesis, which is the 'Uruk' that killed them most. This feature is awesome.\n\nPros and Cons\n---\n\nPros-\n-Great graphics, even on low\n-Fantastic combat, gory and different every time, also challenging depending on your advantage in stealth\n-Brilliant mechanics\n\nCons-\n-The storyline's don't really line up. In the game, it takes place in between the end of the Hobbit book and before the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, the enemies you encounter in the game are called Uruks, short for Uruk-Hai, which is Saruman's creation. This is before Saruman has begun working for Sauron, therein these 'Uruks' shouldn't be in the game.\n\nI hope you appreciated my review, and I hope you buy the game. Add me if you do so I can avenge you from your nemesis! :)\n\nEDIT:\n\nUpon completing the game, I just wanted to warn you. The final battle isn't exactly a battle...You just press buttons to block attacks. But the rest of the game is great, there's two different maps you can travel around, adding to the adventure.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 Beautiful scenery, gore, and orcs.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10 Engaging Combat, Interesting Systems, Disappointing Last Boss Fight.\n\nControls: 9/10 Good Controls, easier with a keyboard and mouse than a controller.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1337604938237/recommended/241930/","1337604938237","♂Cisco Engineer♀","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1337604938237/","818 products in account","Killing Orcs Has Never Been So Fun!\nI have to admit I come into this game knowing nothing about the The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit series. So the universe and the lores behind the movies or the novels mean nothing to me. I have to say, when I bought this game I did not buy it for the story, I just wanted a fun action game with tons of content and very addictive gameplay. I am happy to confirm I got what I wanted and it was more than overdose.\n\nThe first thing I want to address is that this game was made by Monolith Studio who also made the popular WWE series. It is strongly portrayed in the game by the way characters walk, tackle and performing actions which is really cool as it work perfectly well in a game where the world is dominated by the Orcs. When a warchief is making an entrance you get all the lesser orcs chanting out their name making them look badass and you get the sense of satisfaction by cutting off their head at the end and claiming that epic rune.\n\nThe game plays very smooth. It combines features from The Batman and Assassins Creed series but improves on the formula by having a deeper and better combat system, better stealth approach and wide array of interesting skills at your disposal. At certain point of the game I was actually really weak and was unable to defeat even an orc captain and was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about the game. However, as I dig deeper into the combat system and gained a few more levels I was able to finally defeat that nemesis that claimed my head countless of times. Speaking about revenge, the game introduced a very unique system called the 'Nemesis' system in which as player and time passes and evolves, the ranks within the orc army will also change. You soon learn that enemy AI behave extremely smart by roaming from place to place, killing superior orcs to gain power, dominate fellow orcs to earn an army and even ambush you when you were fighting other orcs. There will always be one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that always kill you becoming stronger each time and eventually raise in power to become a warchief. Furthermore, this system makes the AI memorise you so that the next time they meet you they come prepared with bodyguards as well as better equipments.\n\nThe game was also very intense from time to time with some battles lasting way longer than 10mins as waves of orcs swarming in I find my self unable to escape or rather, the manliness inside me tells me to face them head on and after killing near hundres of orcs and gained a few powerful runes it results in a very satisfying warm little fuzzy feeling inside.\n\nAfter 20 or so hours into the game, the epicness is really showing as the world  totally opened up to you and you pretty much gained most of the abilities helping you to dominate the orcs in any situation. You can ride a caragor into battle and you can even ride a Graug to siege an entire orc fortress which was absolutely mind blowing. On top of this the game graphics looks absolutely beautfiful with very detailed graphics options. However, to have the graphics setting set to ultra high you will need a high - end pc to play it.\n\nWhen I was using a Razer blade with GTX 765m I can play on high setting with about 40-50 fps. With a Alienware m18x dual GTX 560m I get about similar results and with my desktop with R9 290X I can play on ultra with 60fps no problem. So it is fair to say that this game is well optimised. To top it all off, the game comes with a photo mode helping you to capture every moments of glory and it has many features that you can play around with to capture some really beautiful eye candy.\n\nFinal verdict 10/10\nI believe that this game is my game of the year 2014, as 2014 hasn't been a great year for gaming I think that shadow of Mordor really do stand out from the rest and it is packed with tons of content as well as delivering a satisfying experience to fans of the series or action game lovers alike.\n\ntl;dr\n+Fun combat mechanics\n+Satisfying orc slaying mayhem\n+interesting set of skills / passives\n+blend stealth with action really well\n+Gorgeous Graphics\n+Tons of content\n+Addictive and challenging\n-skins offer no new voices (Every skin uses Talion's voice)\n-Season pass doesn't offer much content\n\nP.S. I have played about 30hours some were played in offline mode because I had no internet for a few days so the record on steam is wrong. within the 30hrs of game time I completed all the main missions, side quests (except killing all orcs), found all collectibles and learned all the skills as well as the passives.","December 30, 2014","true","17.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The plot surrounding the game's central characters, Talion and Celebrimbor, is lackluster and heavily disjointed at best, providing very little incentive to be invested in the narrative. The lack of character development of the protagonists make the story rather boring and predictable, though the voice acting is admissible. Moreover, the game lacks a good representation of races in Middle Earth as very few Dwarves or Elves appear. Your journey through Middle Earth will be filled with Uruks and Men and rather abrubt too, as the main narrative is extremely short.\n\nMost of the playthrough will be spent via the Nemesis system and in combat, slaying Uruks by the thousands (literally). It is here where the game is, in my opinion, somewhat intriguing; that is, at least, at first. The combat is very similar to that of the Batman Arkham games, with some added twists. Overall, the system is very polished, simple, and addicting. However, after mastering the combat, even with the added upgrades via the skill points, the combat became stale, monotonous, and almost tedious to get through. This is confounded by the fact that your enemies, including captains, harder bosses, and hordes of Uruks are trivially easy to beat. (I died a total of 2 times in my 20 hour playthrough!) The absence of challenge was really a disappointment.\n\nUnfortunately, the Nemesis system too stays with the overarching theme of Shadow of Mordor. At first, the system was relatively stimulating, as I would hunt down a captain or bend him to my will. Sadly, the whole goal of the system was missed, since it very clearly lacks depth. Sure, a captain would utter something that I had done to him in the past or would bear a burn mark from our last encounter. However, that's all the Uruk would do. He did not change tactics or present any new challenge, except maybe another dolefully easy body guard. The one sentence muttered at the beginning of our encounter was the extent and end of the interaction. If expanded on further, the system could have been much better and been worthy of praise.\n\nAs for graphical fidelity, the game is very nice looking. There are some rocks and structures that have very bad, ugly looking textures though, but isn't a big deal. The game is very well optimized too. Using a mouse and keyboard, I had very few problems except that the in game camera would turn at different speeds, seemingly at random times (not when I was using the bow) and be in an odd angle during some enclosures. There was the occasional getting stuck on certain objects while moving as well.\n\nOverall, I thought Shadow of Mordor was an OK game, and think others may enjoy it more. In my opinion, I would only recommend buying this game when it is on sale.\n","January 9, 2015","true","21.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The animations for combat is flawless as well, the different types of kill possibilites for not only basic attacks but for executions and dagger kills as well.\nVoice acting + cinematics - really amazing job for every character, the stand outs for me was the guy the does for voice for Talion the main character I thought was absolutely fantastic, beautifully fits the character and also all the orc voices are amazing. Every captain has a different personality which affects how they fight in some cases. Cinematics obviously are gonna be great, I suppose its kind of expected in this time of technology, but Shadow of Mordor has more cutscene cinematics then pretty much all other games that I've played. There is basically one for each step of the main story which includes about 20 parts so. Yea really great job on the voice acting and cutscene cinematics.\nImmersion - So for me one of the greatest things about this game was the immersion, I guess games that come out now are gonna be more and more immersive because the graphics become more and more realistic but this game especially. It really gives you the drive to keep playing and to not only finish the story but complete 100% of the games content as well. The story for me was really quite good, the dialog that the characters had really made sense, it was logical which in some games is hard to find. And what I mean by that is some games have the character make really stupid decisions like not wanted to have help or not completely killing a person and its just to drag on to the story, similar to horror movies when its very dark and there is obviously someone hiding in the dark room with a knife but the idiot walks in anyway and gets mauled to pieces, when in reality, you would probably run out of the ♥♥♥♥ing house drive away get on a plane and ♥♥♥♥ing move to an entirely different location. Another immersive part of the game was the collectables part of the game, usually in games they make you pick up little items to extend the game a little bit. Shadow of Mordor gives you a logical reason and rewards for getting this items, they give you backstory of the item you just picked up or dialog between the Calabrimbor and Talion discussing what they found. There is also a bunch of rescue quests which involve you going to free human slaves from the orcs. Each time you accept the new rescue quest it tells you what the slaves did in order to be tied up and tortured and then that story affects the bonus part of the quest. For example if a bunch of slaves tried to poison the orcs 'grog' which is basically their alcohol, you have the bonus quest of finishing the job and poisoning the grog.\nMy rating + should you buy the game - So my rating for the game is going to be a 10/10, I stayed up for 38 hours and I played the game for 37 of those hours and I enjoyed every minute of it. I was waiting for this game for a long time and it really delivered more then I expected. I think they did an amazing job and I'm really looking forward to what DLC's they're going to bring out.\nNow about buying the game for youself, I highly recommend doing it. It's an open world game with so many possibilites on how you would like to play the game. The captains and warchiefs are all different and you can choose which ones you want to control and which ones you want to kill, you can create your own unique army of orcs which is a really cool idea in my opinion. So definitely go out and get it, seriously one of the best, if not the best game ive ever played.","December 10, 2014","true","42.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do i need to say more?? And it's a ton of fun to blow away the entire head of an uruk and just leave the body behind. Always gives a feeling of everything paying of. But really what makes this game so friggin awesome and fun is basically the nemesis system. A few dozen uruk's just fighting for power within the system and then way more people trying to get higher up in this military hierarcy. So the best tip any player can give to a new player is the easiest tip ever but that might sound dumb and stupid at first but... dont die. Just dont die and it will go just fine.\nAnd did i mention how beatutiful mordor is when you're not slaying dozens and even more dozens of uruk's. If you can run the game on ultra,do. It makes it look so nice and badass.\nand it's a nice break from killing uruk's.\nStill i gotta complain on some few minor things.\nFirst of all is the story. Even though the story is nice and well presented(i do think monolith did a nice job at giving us a good story) it's just,too short. It's only 20 missions. But then there's the nemesis system which makes up for that cause you probably spend way more time on the nemesis system then on the story at first.(nemesis system ftw)\nAnother thing that i just have to say and this one is probably a bit personal but still,the game is way too easy. The captains don't have a lot of variety really so i just found myself doing the same approach on nearly every single captain. Love the game or hate the game. me myself i love it.\nThe duo combat(and by that i mean switching between sword and bow,aka talion's sword urfael and celebrimbor's bow azkar which is very useful in most battles. If you have read this far,picture yourself this scenario. You are in a stronghold(fort) and you got,let's say,40+ uruk's coming right at you. You know you got no chance with sword only. and then u see a grog barrel in the middle of the uruk's. Well what do you do now? I'd say blow the grog barrel up and you probably will only have between 5-15 enemies left.\nConclusion: Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor is the best LotR game to date. Even if i do hope for a sequel,it probably wont come any.\nThe combat is great,the open world is good but could be larger,the story could be longer but it's a nice story for a good game,the rune system is brilliant,the nemesis system is unique and basically AWESOME and at last, the voice acting is friggin awesome. This game gets a solid 10 even tho it lacks on some things but its a good game. Basically one of the many must play games of 2014.","July 4, 2015","true","143.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twist3dlogic/recommended/241930/","twist3dlogic","TwistedLogic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twist3dlogic/","325 products in account","Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is one of those games that looked pretty good on paper, in trailers etc and you wanted to try it out but felt a little iffy because recent releases have all been, for the most part,  basic corporate stamp-o-matic titles with little creativity in them.\n\nSoM almost seems to be like this as well at first; the opening environments are bleak and only broken up by the inevitable valleys, cliffs and assorted rocks of a rather depressing landscape. That said, the gameplay itself is what makes SoM a great game. I won't lie and say it is incredibly varied, as the main focus of the game (and the basic goal for just about every mission in it) is to kill things. Oh, there is variety on HOW, precisely you go about it, but essentially you kill things... lots of things.\n\nLets break this down as I don't seem to be getting very far in explaining why this game is worth getting...\n\n-The movement and combat-\nTalion, the character you play as, moves fairly well but can often stick on the environment's various jagged corners at the worst possible time, sometimes causing him to stop dead when you might prefer him to keep moving away from a large Uruk with a meat cleaver bigger than he is bearing down on you. This is a tiny, petty annoyance, but it has cropped up once or twice (not too often, just enough to be noted) and is one of the few issues I have with either the movement or combat system.\n\nMovement as a whole is very remise of any of the Assassins Creed games, with almost identical parkour movement, jumps and climbing. This is a good thing, as if Assassins Creed did anything well, it was the parkour which allowed players to screw around on buildings as much as they liked. Combine this with Talion's very stabby-stabby nature towards anything orc-ish and you get some very climby-jumpy-stealthy-killy fun moments.\n\nStealth itself is quite well done, though I would suggest that all of the Orcs find another opticians as they all appear to have eyesight that stops somewhere along the 20-yard mark unless they have previously spotted you and you moved further away from them. This aside, the stealth works very well, with various distraction, glomp-of-death and AOE (area of effect = read as "explosions") abilities that can make Talion a one man guerilla unit against the whole of Sauron's Uruk forces... sounds pretty cool eh? :D Inevitably, the brown hits the fan though and you will be forced into open combat.\n\nOpen combat is nicely done as well, in my opinion. The attacks of enemies about to introduce the sharp side of their sword to the soft side of Talions head are spoiled somewhat by the contextual buttons appearing for you to press to counter or dodge... breaks the immersion a little and if I could turn them off, I might try it for a bit. The downside of this is that if you get completely swamped by Orcs at any point, there will be so many green and grey bodies around that you most likely will not have chance to see, nevermind counter, any attacks that are headed Talions way. For this reason, I can forgive the button prompts. They are not bad and I think they actually help to get around having a massive cluster of enemies around all at once and not being able to see anything. What I like about the game is that while stealthing it up is great and much easier at the beginning than taking them head-on, even if you end up in a tight spot, you can still slaughter a whole horde in open combat and feel like a badass. One thing I am iffy on, is the last chances.\n\n-Last chance!-\nThe last chances are basically quick time events (move the cursor into a circle and press the right button before the circle edge is filled) to not die when you have received a mortal blow. These can save your life, which is good. Enemies also get them, which I actually like, despite it being tense when a tough enemy you thought was dead gets one and you have to do one to finish him off XD it makes it seem more fair and not just something Talion has because he 'da gud guy'.\n\n-Game mechanics - Rivals\nI will touch only briefly on the rest of the game so as to avoid spoilers. The rival mechanic (idk if thats what it's called, idc either) is basically the system that controls Talions relationships with the Uruk captains... yes, you read that right. Whenever Talion (or you even) fight a captain, maybe you kill him, maybe he escapes, maybe you chicken out and run. Whatever happens, (yes, even if you think he died..) he may come back later, bearing scars of your previous fight (literally... you burn one, he might be a lil crispy, stab him, he'll have a scar etc - within reason of course) and holding a big grudge. Talion can also get revenge on captains that have previously killed him (best not to ask, it's explained... sort of) or even, now this bit is clever... Talion can even assist specific Uruks, later on can take them over (spoiler alert), rescue them from ambushes from other captains etc to shift the balance of power where he wants it.\n\nOverall, this system is pretty cool. It's not the best thing ever, but it ensures a constant supply of interesting characters to interact with (they are all nicely voice acted, have their own quirks etc) and there seems to be an infinite amount (again within reason, some things will definitely be re-used between captains). You have to scout out a captains weaknesses if he seems tough or even subvert his men to get the upper hand later on.\n\n-Overall-\nSoM is a good game. It is fun, it can be very amusing at times. The characters are quite engaging (I love Ratbag) and the story is interesting. At time of writing, I have not finished SoM, indeed, I am only about 45% through as I like to mess around a lot, but I find it a fun game with few things to quibble about. It feels open world enough and free enough to enjoy the movement and combat and there are more than enough Orcs to sate any bloodlust you might have. You get some tense moments and some hilarious ones and it seems to have come together pretty well, not perfectly, but well enough for a recommendation.\n\nThe most jarring part of the game was later on once you suddenly get the brand ability (spoiler alert). This suddenly shifts the tone and dynamics of the game and it took a bit of getting used to. This could have been better handled in my opinon, but maybe I just got a bit kill happy in the first part of the game :P\n\nI know I have not talked about everything in this game, but I wanted to voice these things and give the upvote as it stands. Hope this helps some peeps! :D","October 14, 2014","true","31.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatDeceiverKid/recommended/241930/","ThatDeceiverKid","That Deceiver Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatDeceiverKid/","124 products in account","*This review will be lengthy, so please, if you want a simple review, scroll to the bottom.*\nThis review will include the following:\n- Open World\n- Graphics\n- Nemesis System\n- Combat\n- Stealth\n- Movement\n- Campaign (No Spoilers)\n- Runes and Upgrades\n- Characters\n\nOpen World: The open world of Shadow of Mordor is very well made and detailed. Stealth spots are easily seen and fit well in the environment. There is a fast travel system to towers you've been to. There are two different areas. One area is near the Black Gate, which is where you start, the other area has a lot of grass and beautiful scenery. Both areas, however, are absolutely beautiful.\n\nGraphics: With my R9 280X, this game was a candy store to my eyes. This GPU is not required, but it runs the game on Ultra at 60 FPS. Even on lower settings, the game is visually stunning. I cannot express my profound love for the scenery and detail that is worked into this game. There are so many different factors that contribute to the graphic fidelity of this game that I can't list them here. Long story short, this game is gorgeous. Period.\n\nNemesis System: Besides my gushing over the graphics of the game, the Nemesis System is my favorite part of this game. This feature basically gives you an almost endless replayability. The main enemy faction, the Uruks, have a heirarchy of captains that increase in rank until they become warchiefs. The lower captains USUALLY are easier to kill and find, and won't drop very good rewards. There are some changes in this statement where the lower captains spawn with REALLY good qualities that counter your fighting style so perfectly, that you have to reevaluate your every attack. Some are immune to range or stealth. Some can't be scared off by a specific creature. It varies greatly from captain to captain, but they all can be quite formidable. When you kill a captain, that's it right? Wrong. Every time you kill a captain, a new one will take it's place, whether it's an already known, lower captain that wants to advance, or if it's a new guy that hasn't been seen before. Captains must be discovered individually, along with warchiefs. Warchiefs aren't necessarily super strong, they just are higher up. I personally had trouble with one captain that was in the second tier, and I killed a warchief in the first five minutes of being in his stronghold. If a captain kills you, or any Uruk for that matter, they will be promoted, or fight for a higher spot in the heirarchy. When you come back, they remember you and will  mostly mock you. Names are random and names depict what their unique personality is like. Some sing, some are slow witted, so on and so forth.\n\nCombat: I wish it was more than what I'm about to say. It honestly isn't very new or innovative. It's, click to attack, click to counter attack, tap f to execute, that type of stuff. Very much like Batman.\n\nStealth: The stealth isn't really challenging. The Uruks are slow to detect, and have a bad case of tunnel vision. Hiding spots can be used to stalk Uruks. Cages with Caragors inside can be broken to release the hounds out. That type of stuff. It is, nonetheless, fun to play stealthily.\n\nMovement: Fast, and very fluent. The animation of clothes and weapons and all of the movable objects around you are so well done. Talion is very fleet, Caragors are VERY fast, and everything is satisfying to say the least.\n\nCampaign: The campaign is a good length, and is an interesting story. It is VERY worth it in my opinion, and it leaves you wanting more.\n\nRunes and Upgrades: The runes and upgrades are in depth, and detailed. They add a very interesting twist to the normal skills of a ranger, besides the wraith thing. All of your weapons could be extremely powerful, and give you bonuses for doing specific actions.\n\nCharacters: All of the characters are well voiced and are well represented. They are interesting and varied, and will spark a fascinating intrest to talk to a character through their mission regularly. You'll soon find yourself playing the missions to talk to the characters. At least I did that.\n\nHere is my overall impression of Shadow of Mordor. The game is fun. Just outright fun to play. The movements and animations are pleasing. The nemesis system is just fantastic, and adds endless replayability and variation in enemies. Combat could have been better, but ended up being pleasurable. The characters and the campaign are both very well done and very engrossing. The open world is stunning and vivid with details and action to partake in. Overall, the game is a must buy. This type of quality with LOTR themed game? Come on, it's a no brainer. Any information I excluded in my summary here, consult the novel above this.","January 9, 2015","true","59.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a really well made game.\n\nIf you don't like Assassin's Creed gameplay you probably won't like it. Like those games, I can't decide if I'm having fun while playing it or if it just does a really good job at letting me tick boxes and check lists (GOT ALL THE COLLECTABLES, AW YEAH). Either way, I 100%ed it so I must have been having some fun.\n\nThe story was an interesting take on Middle Earth and I liked the story it told, but I feel like they may have taken a bit of creative liberty with the Tolkien license...\n\nOne of the main highlights of the game is the Nemesis system, which I'm sure you've already read about if you're interested in this game. It's very well done and leads to some interesting battles. Playing around with it allows you to sort of create monsters/nemesis, and it's very fun. Nothing like encountering a guy early who is immune to range attacks, melee attacks, and stealth attacks, but is only weak to fire. Randomized orc leaders means you have to develop new strategies often, which keeps the gameplay very interesting.\n\nOverall, a good game though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalziel_86/recommended/241930/","dalziel_86","Adrian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalziel_86/","996 products in account","It's a game built almost entirely out of parts from the Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham games, but with one or two parts of its own. It's something slightly less than the sum of its parts, but that's mostly because the new parts it brings to the table are great, but by the time you actually get to use them properly, the game is half to 2/3rds over already.\n\nThe story and characters are garbage that don't go anywhere, the environments are dull and samey, and most of the parts the game steals from Assassin's Creed aren't quite as polished as they are in that series. The combat stuff from the Arkham series is fine, and there's enough of a twist on it to make it something interesting, a feat that Arkham Origins failed to pull off. But the new stuff is where the actual gold is, and it's barely uncovered until far, far too late.\n\nTook me 22 hours to finish, but a lot of that was wasted time. I'd recommend powering through the story missions as fast as possible until you get the branding ability, which I didn't do but wish I had. The trouble is by the time you get that, and especially once you can get branded warchiefs, the game is mostly over, and you barely get a chance to play with these systems and abilities.\n\nI'd definitely recommend playing it, but don't set your expectations too high. Wait for a sale, or at least until you can get it cheap somewhere like that Brazilian online game store, like I did.","October 5, 2014","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First, it looks beautiful, the graphics are a joy to behold.  The combat is fun, similar to the Batman games.  As you progress, you pick up enough new abilities, that slicing through a horde of Uruks just never gets old.The Assassin's Creed reference I mentioned is how your character moves though the areas.  There is a lot of climbing and perching above your prey and attacking from above, which, like the combat, never seems to get old.\nBut what really makes this game shine is the Nemesis system.  You really feel like these are real Uruks you are killing, all with different weaknesses and strengths and widely varied appearances.  You can join in on a power struggle between Orc captains and influence who wins.  As the captains and warchiefs gain power, they get promoted and move up in ranking.  Also, if some random orc kills you, he automatically gets promoted to captain, and has a name and gains a little armor to alter his appearance.  You can then kill him for a vendetta.  It is a very engaging system and honestly, I had a great time just trying to kill the captains and wreak havoc among their leadership.  It's great fun!","November 3, 2014","true","50.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/951Jimbo/recommended/241930/","951Jimbo","951Jimbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/951Jimbo/","395 products in account","Top Tip:\nThis game has an odd learning curve.  Initially it will feel fluid, natural, and simple.  You will quickly become weak and outclassed.  The trick is to do ALL the white missions you possibly can before doing anything else.  Use your points to buy rune slots and health upgrades.  And make sure to learn to block attacks using right click when prompted.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are very good.  There is also an HD texture pack but I couldn't get it to work.\n-Combat is fun, much better than in Assassin's creed.  There is a lot of talent and skill and even strategy that goes into taking out your opponents.\n-Being able to "brand" (hypnotize) Uruks, captains, and war chiefs over to your side is really awesome.\n-PC controls work REALLY well.  I commend the developers for figuring it out.  Your pinky will get a little tired of holding shift but their is no reason to break out a controller for this game.\n-Save system is totally automatic and competent.  Most of the missions won't last longer than 5-20 minutes so their isn't a need to save while in progress.\n\nCons:\n-Music is too heavy to have playing in the background while you are hacking away at Uruks for hours.  Luckily you can easily silence it\n-IMO the story was really boring and I couldn't care less.  I enjoyed the LOTR movies and the Hobbit is one of my favorite books.  However, I'm not a big LOTR good.\n-The DLC that just came out makes you feel like you didn't get a full game.  Especially considering that their is no online play and the game isn't very long.  The story isn't very immersive either, so it doesn't have a ton of re-playability.\n\nOverall this game is fun and that's what really counts.  If you see a future version on sale with DLC included it will be a great value.","February 28, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The stealth/sneak system reminds me of Assassin's Creed/Splinter Cell. Bushes to hid in, can climb any building, silent kills. Combine this with a unique nemesis system to keep it from getting stale too quick and we got a possible Game of the Year. I have dumped 12 hours into the game at this point and have only progressed through 6 or 7 main story missions. I have been having too much fun assassinated captains and chiefs and doing side missions to progress the story. High replayability.

The best Middle-Earth \ Lord of the Rings themed game out there so far.\nNemesis system adds very unique aspect into gameplay. Uruk captains and warchiefs are generated every time you kill them or when they are fighting each other to advance in ranks and take over place of their leaders. Each has his own personality, weakneses, strengths. It adds tons of replayability. Not to mention you can dominate uruk minds and send them to fight each other, thus you can build an army of your own uruks. I branded an uruk captain and made him a bodyguard of a warchief by sending mine to kill his bodyguard in duel, then I sent him to betray warchief. And there is more to Nemesis system, it is but a glimpse of this deeply elaborated system.\nThe combat system is very decent.\nThe story is very fitting and lore-wise, even if it is short, the quality of main missions is very high. There is much to do without story, even after completing it, you can continue to take out uruk captains/warchiefs and explore collecting artifcats, runes.\nThe world map is big enough to explore hours and hours. I believe Monolith will add new regions of Mordor beside Udûn and Sea of Núrnen once a DLC comes out (hoping to visit Plateau of Gorgoroth and Morgul Vale someday).\nAnd there is this feel and immersion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jim_Buffington/recommended/241930/","Jim_Buffington","Jim Buffington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jim_Buffington/","61 products in account","If you enjoy chopping off Cockney orcs' heads after they've given a speech about how they are going to kill you and wear your skin, this is the game for you.\n\nBeing one who loves nearly anything Lord of the Rings, I was biased toward wanting to like this game. When I first saw gameplay for Shadow of Mordor, I was excited and concerned at the same time, both intrigued by the nemesis system and worried it was another copy and paste Assassin's Creed-type that would be too easy and do nothing new or interesting, thankfully I was wrong.\n\nThe fighting system is finely tuned and very similar (not in a bad way) to the Batman Arkham games. There are elements of Assassin's Creed in there as well with the climbing mechanics. However, with those facts in mind the game still feels fresh, not a derivative copy-cat. This is in large part due to the fantastic nemesis system. Your own narrative can play out as you can kill orc captains, leave them to sort out their squabbles themselves or give a gentle nudge (or a not so gentle nudge) to who you want to succeed in any given power struggle. If an orc kills you, he will increase in rank and power and recognise you next time you come in contact, quickly getting over his disbelief to try wear your skin again. It is by far the strongest part of the game, so much fun can be had just going around causing havoc among the orc ranks (which is what I did for hours) and I did not notice any repetition in orc names or voice tracks in my whole playthrough, serious props to the developers there. It is a shame that the system isn't more integral to the story, though it does become more important later in the game.\n\nI have heard some calling the game too easy but this can be improved through player and gameplay choices. You can unlock every power/health/damage upgrade etc., but you don't have to. Things certainly get easier as you unlock more powers but new and more difficult enemy types come along later too, so there's a balance. Combat prompts should be turned off to reduce screen clutter and make things more challenging, forcing you to actually pay attention to what is going on around you and who is attacking you. With some minor tweaks like this, I didn't find the game too easy or too hard, more of a nice in between level and I suspect that many saying the game is too easy still have the combat prompts on.\n\nI enjoyed the story (I won't spoil anything) but it has its weak points, both in character development and pacing as well as some very lackluster and underwhelming boss fights. It does enough to push the game along and there is plenty of "one ring to rule them all", Sauron, despair and evil thrown in there, which are always nice!\n\nI played this game with a wired Xbox 360 controller and I had a great time, I would recommend you do too but it's down to personal preference at the end of the day.\n\nOverall, a technically brilliant game with a few missteps. However, most importantly, it's a lot of fun.\n\nI highly recommend it. 8/10","February 21, 2015","true","68.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The visuals,game play,sstory and mechanics are all fun and rewarding. My only problem with the game is the controls for the PC. The controls would work for a game with slower action,but due to the fact,you need to react fast,combat can be clunky and  difficult to master. Sometimes due to the difference in parkour and fight mechanics,escaping a battle can be damn near impossible if sorrounded by enough enemies. So perhaps a controller for PC is the way to go.

It's a really well made game.\n\nIf you don't like Assassin's Creed gameplay you probably won't like it. Like those games, I can't decide if I'm having fun while playing it or if it just does a really good job at letting me tick boxes and check lists (GOT ALL THE COLLECTABLES, AW YEAH). Either way, I 100%ed it so I must have been having some fun.\n\nThe story was an interesting take on Middle Earth and I liked the story it told, but I feel like they may have taken a bit of creative liberty with the Tolkien license...\n\nOne of the main highlights of the game is the Nemesis system, which I'm sure you've already read about if you're interested in this game. It's very well done and leads to some interesting battles. Playing around with it allows you to sort of create monsters/nemesis, and it's very fun. Nothing like encountering a guy early who is immune to range attacks, melee attacks, and stealth attacks, but is only weak to fire. Randomized orc leaders means you have to develop new strategies often, which keeps the gameplay very interesting.\n\nOverall, a good game though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalziel_86/recommended/241930/","dalziel_86","Adrian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalziel_86/","996 products in account","It's a game built almost entirely out of parts from the Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham games, but with one or two parts of its own. It's something slightly less than the sum of its parts, but that's mostly because the new parts it brings to the table are great, but by the time you actually get to use them properly, the game is half to 2/3rds over already.\n\nThe story and characters are garbage that don't go anywhere, the environments are dull and samey, and most of the parts the game steals from Assassin's Creed aren't quite as polished as they are in that series. The combat stuff from the Arkham series is fine, and there's enough of a twist on it to make it something interesting, a feat that Arkham Origins failed to pull off. But the new stuff is where the actual gold is, and it's barely uncovered until far, far too late.\n\nTook me 22 hours to finish, but a lot of that was wasted time. I'd recommend powering through the story missions as fast as possible until you get the branding ability, which I didn't do but wish I had. The trouble is by the time you get that, and especially once you can get branded warchiefs, the game is mostly over, and you barely get a chance to play with these systems and abilities.\n\nI'd definitely recommend playing it, but don't set your expectations too high. Wait for a sale, or at least until you can get it cheap somewhere like that Brazilian online game store, like I did.","October 5, 2014","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Pretty stock standard combat reminiscent of the Arkham series (by reminiscent I mean blatant copy), but that isn't a bad thing because it is pretty smooth and there is a fair bit of enemy variety. Story is very ordinary and often times nonsensical. Lore ♥♥♥♥ aside it is extremely cliche. The "muh family" ♥♥♥♥ gets old fast. Another thing that irks me is that despite your character essentially being invincible, he gets concerned about dangerous missions in cutscenes. Characters are mediocre. Setting is not bad, but silly from a lore standpoint. Voice acting is okay depending on the character. The flashbacks to the forging of the Rings and Sauron's deception were actually the only good part of the story and make me want a game set during that time.\n\nThe nemesis system is great and works really well. Easily the best part of the game and it was my sale point when I heard about it and how it works. I kind of wish you had customisation options with the ones you control and perhaps some more real time damage to Orcs that manage to survive their injuries. Speaking of that, the game needed more gore. When I bring a two-handed sword down on an Orc's head with the force of a thousand suns I want it to split like a melon. The decapatations were great though and it was good to see enemies get frightened and cry out when you cut of one of their comrades' heads. The Orc facial expressions never get old, especially when you grab one and they silently scream in terror as you possess their minds. It is also fun to roleplay an Orc by getting some chaff Orc to kill you so he get promoted and then possessing him and then helping him work his way up to war chieft, the highest level that Orcs can get to. It is also quite impressive that each Orc captain is unique looking and has a unique name, which is said out loud in the game either by Orcs chanting it or by your wraith bro.\n\nSo yeah, not too bad. Just don't expect GOTYAYEY. I'd probably wait for a 40%+ sale though.","November 1, 2014","true","31.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combat, free running, and open-world setting will closely reminisce with either series, and the story is engaging without jamming itself down your throat (and without suffering from too much linearity). The real gem of this game, though, is the "Nemesis System". In it, basically the entire enemy/boss structure is dynamically/procedurally generated and responsive to decisions you make in-game. You try to sneak-kill a boss but he gets away during combat? Next time you try to kill him, he'll be ready for you AND he'll remember how you tried to kill him before, adapting his playstyle to ensure you can't take him down the same way twice. It's a great system that makes it so that you can't just keep doing the same thing over and over, ensuring your game won't be repetitive or boring. I'd also agree with a published reviewer that, even though the mechanics of the game do little to evolve during the playthrough, the perk system keep you almost continually stocked with new moves/takedowns/specials that you always have something new to learn, to play with, or to master. Highly recommended.","October 12, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a perfect blend of action, story, and stealth.\n\nAlso the Nemisis system is incredible and will be used in future video games for sure.  It's just such a fresh idea, you basically learn about your enemies while you play.  This was implemented somewhat in Batman Arkham City with the interrgoating the riddler goons, but Nemsis is so much more, not only do you learn more about your opponents, but also if an opponent surivies a fight, he will remember you.  Which is pretty incredible.\n\nAll in all I would probably give this game a perfect score, but for now, I won't score since I don't enough time in yet.\n\nBottom line, if you loved the Batman games and Assassin's Creed do yourself a favor and pick this game up, you will not be disappointed.","October 16, 2014","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It must be the cinematic way that you can kill things that draws me in most. Its not easy to master, but its easy to play if you are halfway competent in games.(which thankfully i am at least halfway...)\n\nGraphics are great, the way things die are awesome, find secrets, the orc boss system is pretty fantastic as well. I also like that the bosses progress when they kill you and become your nemesis, which promptly pisses me off and makes me want to go out and get my revenge. My pc is pretty monster but in other games ive has slowdowns where in this game, seemingly no matter whats on screen, it stays pretty fluid, set on mostly high and some ultra settings. (this is also the first game that vsync has helped instead of hurt for me, got rid of screen tearing).\n\nOverall i havent gotten bored yet, my game states 21.2 hrs of gameplay but realisticly its only 10 hrs(left it on overnight by accident) but still have only touched 2 main quest stories(to open up some skills) and levelled to enough power to get the second tier of skills opened(not opened by main questline stories)\n\nI could envision myself running around this game, continually killing and ♥♥♥♥♥ing killed, jumping up buildings and over enemies and blockign and ....well you get the idea.\n\nits sunday 27th of april and i bought this yesterday during a half price sale for 25.49, which included the season pass.\n\nif your reading this before monday, and have even a slight interest in this, i say its a no brainer at 25 bucks.","April 27, 2015","true","69.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do i need to say more?? And it's a ton of fun to blow away the entire head of an uruk and just leave the body behind. Always gives a feeling of everything paying of. But really what makes this game so friggin awesome and fun is basically the nemesis system. A few dozen uruk's just fighting for power within the system and then way more people trying to get higher up in this military hierarcy. So the best tip any player can give to a new player is the easiest tip ever but that might sound dumb and stupid at first but... dont die. Just dont die and it will go just fine.\nAnd did i mention how beatutiful mordor is when you're not slaying dozens and even more dozens of uruk's. If you can run the game on ultra,do. It makes it look so nice and badass.\nand it's a nice break from killing uruk's.\nStill i gotta complain on some few minor things.\nFirst of all is the story. Even though the story is nice and well presented(i do think monolith did a nice job at giving us a good story) it's just,too short. It's only 20 missions. But then there's the nemesis system which makes up for that cause you probably spend way more time on the nemesis system then on the story at first.(nemesis system ftw)\nAnother thing that i just have to say and this one is probably a bit personal but still,the game is way too easy. The captains don't have a lot of variety really so i just found myself doing the same approach on nearly every single captain. Love the game or hate the game. me myself i love it.\nThe duo combat(and by that i mean switching between sword and bow,aka talion's sword urfael and celebrimbor's bow azkar which is very useful in most battles. If you have read this far,picture yourself this scenario. You are in a stronghold(fort) and you got,let's say,40+ uruk's coming right at you. You know you got no chance with sword only. and then u see a grog barrel in the middle of the uruk's. Well what do you do now? I'd say blow the grog barrel up and you probably will only have between 5-15 enemies left.\nConclusion: Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor is the best LotR game to date. Even if i do hope for a sequel,it probably wont come any.\nThe combat is great,the open world is good but could be larger,the story could be longer but it's a nice story for a good game,the rune system is brilliant,the nemesis system is unique and basically AWESOME and at last, the voice acting is friggin awesome. This game gets a solid 10 even tho it lacks on some things but its a good game. Basically one of the many must play games of 2014.","July 4, 2015","true","143.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a reason this game received the GOTY award from multiple reviewers and journalists.\n\nIt brought a couple of unique features to a genre that was sorely needing something fresh.\n1. The unique AI engine that made enemies remember you, power up to battle you again if they lost previously or if they won boast in your face as they attempt to best you again. Each enemy had unique properties and rarely would a direct approach help you much. Especially in the beginning.\n2. The weapons were basic and simplistic, but offered a lot more and had a deeper narrative if you knew where to look.\n3. The environments were lovely with some interesting characteristics and many hints at the books and movies.\n4. The art direction, specifically with the Uruks and their armor, weapons and scowls were just superb. That green skin textures used in game made them look real. I was in awe when I first saw it.\n5. The playstyle, with a unique concequence to death and to leveling up. The stealth mechanic worked nicely, but added some difficulty ot the game as well.\n\nThe storyline is not amazing, or new or unique. But it is a very proper LOTR lore. And they made proper use of the characters. In the end, what more can we ask for?\n\nThe only real negative point comes in the learning curve. If it's your first time playing it, there's a lot of detail going on and a lot of reading to understand everything. However the tips and tutorials are properly documented and are helpful all the way to the end.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game.","March 24","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Here's why:\n\nBatman + Assassins creed? Sorry... No. It's not. (That's not really a compliment).\n\nLet's get straight to what this game really is : Shadow of Mordor is essentially two giant battle arenas. Every single mission is about killing orcs/uruks and captains. The variation on missions is simply to kill orcs/uruks/captains using different power ups you earned. Forget the story, it's nicely presented but its not much more than a background texture. Here's a bit of story to rest your fingers, but NOW GO KILL SOME MORE ORCS!\n\nThe comparissons with AC and Batman are valid in that SoM has borrowed a lot (and I mean A LOT) of gameplay elements to the point it is fairly shameless. If I were a dev on AC I'd be like "Hey bro, get your own ideas. FFS!" But what they took are strong elements that made those games work (like Batman's fighting and AC's character controls).\n\nSo here's the thing, the fighting in SoM is good fun and very satisfying - and it keeps getting more satisfying as you level up. The nemesis system is very good (the uruks look great and have huge variation). In short it's an addictive very well produced fighting game. It doesn't have much soul but it's very good at what it does.\n\nIf your want more than an endless battle fest, and need exploration, varied missions, puzzles, intrigue, places to go to, lots of characters you can relate to, multiple plot and story twists... then AC and Batman are the place to be.","November 6, 2014","true","36.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It depends I suppose.\n\n> Do you like Lord of the Rings? I hadn't touched a book, nor saw a movie. But I liked it ( I do know some lore though )\n> Do you like a lot of side missions to build up to help you in the main story? If yes, this is for you. ( If no, don't have to do them entirely )\n>Do you like hack n slashing, with amazing and brutal kills, sleek killstreaks and wraith powers to dominate in battle? If yes to anyone these, this is for you!\n>Do you like the ability to manipulate the story with your actions, to make it easier or harder? If yes, this is for you!\n>Do you like plot twists, with dramatic music filled with horns and thundering drums? If yes, you guessed it, this is for you!\n>Do you like picking flowers for health, and when you feel a little fruity? Then yes, this is for you.\n\nI find this to be a great game to play, very fun, and fullfilling. However, you do see repetitiveness in some fights, in manner of kill animations, and some are just of one style. However, the equal set of diversity of these moves, and that you can change your style to evoke other animations, make that null for an issue. At least for a while.\n\nAlso, if you've ever played a Batman Arkham game, then familiarity will flow through your fingers. Though the effects will obviously differ, and somethings our protagonist can just do that Batboy cannot, you do have a sense of similarity. It  is actually somewhat easier in this than an Arkham game. But can be much harder as well.\n\nIn the end, I really do believe this is a good game to get. Small amount of main story missions, ( 20 ) but you will be too tempted with so much else that you will only get one or two done between every 30 side missions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theheckareyouhere/recommended/241930/","theheckareyouhere","Not Here for Fortune or Fame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theheckareyouhere/","170 products in account","Shadow of Mordor is a pretty decent stealth/action game. It plays a lot like Assassin's Creed, with a focus on parkour and wall-climbing with QTE-ridden hand-to-hand combat mechanics but the various upgradable skills and runes give it it's own flavour in terms of gameplay.\n\nThe much-toted Nemesis System is pretty solid, too. While it occasionally spits out fairly unremarkable opponents, it's also provided me with some very entertaining rivals. There's something about turning the cannon fodder enemy that happened to snipe you as you were making a clean getaway and turning him into an unstoppable leader that provides a very unique thrill. Unfortunately, I did notice an unfortunate tendency for my rivals to die horrifically shortly after I brainwashed them into joining me (RIP, Dush the Caragor-Slayer, whose post-duel fanfare was cut tragically short by a giant rock monster), and frustratingly while enemy Orcs can respawn under the right conditions there's no such luck for allied ones.\n\nThere's a fairly decent campaign and a large number of optional quests, too, though some are definitely better than others. The slave rebellion missions in particular play out nearly identical to each other, which is very jarring since the "Legend" quests usually have a unique gimmick or two to make them stand out. There's also a few dozen relics to hunt down and elven symbols etched into walls that provide a neat little diversion as well.\n\nI did have some performance issues at times-- I had a recurring crash on launch that required me to restart my computer every few sessions in order to fix it, and the framerate does tank a bit during particularly busy sections. Shadow of Mordor is also fairly buggy at times-- I had several dozen instances where orcs randomly flew into the air, the ziplines had a tendency to make me clip into the scenery (forcing a reset) or fall out of the world entirely, and on two seperate instances the game crashed immediately after a lengthy quest forcing me to redo it.\n\nBut while Shadow of Mordor is definitely rough around the edges at times, there's just something about being able to turn five of a general's bodyguards against him without him suspecting a thing, having them gang up and kill him in his home fortress, then causing all of their heads to explode with a single keystroke so that the sole remaining captain in his regiment, who was also under my control, can take his position in the enemy army. Or the time I let a random enemy kill me, then converted him and made him the most powerful Orc in all the land before luring him into a cave where he was eaten alive by the undead. Or that time where...\n\nAnd really, that's Shadow of Mordor in a nutshell. A fairly entertaining, if flawed, means creating the type of stories you'll share with your fellow gamers around the water-cooler. And then getting weird looks from your other co-workers because you explained, in great detail, how you let a "Slave Taskmaster" get torn apart by tigers.","January 7, 2015","true","35.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a really well made game.\n\nIf you don't like Assassin's Creed gameplay you probably won't like it. Like those games, I can't decide if I'm having fun while playing it or if it just does a really good job at letting me tick boxes and check lists (GOT ALL THE COLLECTABLES, AW YEAH). Either way, I 100%ed it so I must have been having some fun.\n\nThe story was an interesting take on Middle Earth and I liked the story it told, but I feel like they may have taken a bit of creative liberty with the Tolkien license...\n\nOne of the main highlights of the game is the Nemesis system, which I'm sure you've already read about if you're interested in this game. It's very well done and leads to some interesting battles. Playing around with it allows you to sort of create monsters/nemesis, and it's very fun. Nothing like encountering a guy early who is immune to range attacks, melee attacks, and stealth attacks, but is only weak to fire. Randomized orc leaders means you have to develop new strategies often, which keeps the gameplay very interesting.\n\nOverall, a good game though.

It's something slightly less than the sum of its parts, but that's mostly because the new parts it brings to the table are great, but by the time you actually get to use them properly, the game is half to 2/3rds over already.\n\nThe story and characters are garbage that don't go anywhere, the environments are dull and samey, and most of the parts the game steals from Assassin's Creed aren't quite as polished as they are in that series. The combat stuff from the Arkham series is fine, and there's enough of a twist on it to make it something interesting, a feat that Arkham Origins failed to pull off. But the new stuff is where the actual gold is, and it's barely uncovered until far, far too late.\n\nTook me 22 hours to finish, but a lot of that was wasted time. I'd recommend powering through the story missions as fast as possible until you get the branding ability, which I didn't do but wish I had. The trouble is by the time you get that, and especially once you can get branded warchiefs, the game is mostly over, and you barely get a chance to play with these systems and abilities.\n\nI'd definitely recommend playing it, but don't set your expectations too high. Wait for a sale, or at least until you can get it cheap somewhere like that Brazilian online game store, like I did.","October 5, 2014","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monolyth/recommended/241930/","monolyth","Monolyth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monolyth/","382 products in account","Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor chooses its own path outside the regular "Lord of the Rings" move-game chum we've been fed over the years. The main story is interesting, but it failed to unravel as smoothly as the mechanical aspects of the game.\n\nGame mechanics - combat, stealth & movementThe combat, stealth and movement systems are a direct rip from the Batman: Arkham series of games (sans batarang of course). This was a smart move on the developer's part given the focus of the game. The difference being that the team opted for a slightly less stringent stealth implementation. This "nerf" to the Batman level of stealth isn't a bad thing. I found it a great middle ground compared to other more stealth-focused games (Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, etc.). Movement, more specifically parkour movement, was much less fluid and tended to be less forgiving than other games. After I taught myself to be a little more deliberate in my movements this tended to become less of a problem.\n\nSkills, runes & other progression stuffs\nGame mechanics such as skill systems and gear upgrades exist. There is a rune system designed to enhance specific aspects of your weapons. While the runes were fairly diverse, I found that once I had specific types I rarely changed them out and merely chose to upgrade them. This is more than likely a result of my play-style, but I would've liked to have seem even more diversity with runes and/or ways to "upgrade" them myself. As far as skill progression I actually found this aspect quite enjoyable and rather than sticking to "what I knew" I found experimentation with new abilities and skills to be very rewarding. My one wish is that "Nemesis system" skills would not be directly locked to the story missions.\n\n\nNemesis systemThe Nemesis system was a big focus of the game. The system allows you to view and manipulate, in some ways, the Uruk leadership in the two major areas in which the game takes place. While there was much ado about the system, I found it a little sad that I was forced to progress deep into the game to get into the really neat aspects of the Nemesis system. I feel like there could've been considerably more depth to my overall game if I had been able to unlock those skills sooner.\n\nHow does the Nemesis system play?\nIn the beginning and even mid-way through the game it just isn't all that interesting. It wasn't until the end after unlocking key skills that I got to really mess around with it. That being said it is not nearly as expansive as the developer's try to make it out to be. There were a few Uruk's I wound up despising towards the end, but mostly I found my desire for vengeance to be quite satiated with the rivers of Uruk blood that flowed in the wake of my wrath. Monolith take this from me (Monolyth), if you choose to add a sequel to this game you need to greatly expand the Nemesis system and allow greater interaction with it sooner rather than later in the game.\n\n\nStory timeSwitching gears now, lets talk about the story. First of all I would have to say that Tolkien purists may do well to steer clear of the game (as many do the movies). The game takes many liberties with the Tolkien universe that might not be as appreciated. While I was able to follow the story easily enough I found in most cases I could not engage emotionally with the primary protagonist(s). Talion and his (trusty?) wraith sidekick family flashbacks served little more purpose than to push the story a long. I found that I cared more for some of the secondary characters than I did the primary...yeah. Overall the story takes a slightly different approach to the battle against Sauron and his minions than what we are all used to seeing. It is a refreshing viewpoint to see and could set the stage for even more aggressive "based on" Middle-earth lore.\n\nJust one more before bed...\nAnother failing point in the story is its brevity. We are treated to some very cool ideas and concepts that if further explored could've provide some solid content. This wasn't necessarily an overall negative for my experience, I tend to focus heavily on side-quests and other content in the game. My overall game time is probably much higher than someone who wouldn't. Anyone expecting the main story content to take more than 8 hours if you focus on nothing but that will probably be a little bit disappointed.\n\n\nSo what's the verdict?The game played very well for me and while some game mechanics suffered from a lack of options, I found the combat to be fluid and very rewarding. The much touted Nemesis system lacked depth until late in the game. The plight of the progranist(s) was fairly forgettable especially when compared against the much more interesting story elements overall.\n\nTLDR\nIf you like Batman style fighting games, are a completionist (or even like to do a few side quests here & there) and appreciate Middle-earth based stories I think you'll find your money well-spent.","October 4, 2014","true","41.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The story is okay, the real gem of the game are the orcs.\n\nYou see, you can play the game like Assassin's Creed and go after the baddies however you want: or you can find a random orc, help him about to be the strongest of orcs by fighting duels for him and killing his enemies until the point where he is the strongest orc in the land-- then you kill him for a high level upgrade for your weapon. Rinse and Repeat.\n\nI find the orcs much more fun than our protaganist as they each have their own personalities and there is nothing like dying to some nameless orc who now is popular after your death and studying him until you find out he is afraid of bees and then putting a beehive under his bed as the ultimate revenge.\n\nFor $20 expect about 30-40 hours of solid game play, or about $0.50/hour.","March 23","true","26.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a reason this game received the GOTY award from multiple reviewers and journalists.\n\nIt brought a couple of unique features to a genre that was sorely needing something fresh.\n1. The unique AI engine that made enemies remember you, power up to battle you again if they lost previously or if they won boast in your face as they attempt to best you again. Each enemy had unique properties and rarely would a direct approach help you much. Especially in the beginning.\n2. The weapons were basic and simplistic, but offered a lot more and had a deeper narrative if you knew where to look.\n3. The environments were lovely with some interesting characteristics and many hints at the books and movies.\n4. The art direction, specifically with the Uruks and their armor, weapons and scowls were just superb. That green skin textures used in game made them look real. I was in awe when I first saw it.\n5. The playstyle, with a unique concequence to death and to leveling up. The stealth mechanic worked nicely, but added some difficulty ot the game as well.\n\nThe storyline is not amazing, or new or unique. But it is a very proper LOTR lore. And they made proper use of the characters. In the end, what more can we ask for?\n\nThe only real negative point comes in the learning curve. If it's your first time playing it, there's a lot of detail going on and a lot of reading to understand everything. However the tips and tutorials are properly documented and are helpful all the way to the end.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game.","March 24","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Last year I was spoiled with a ton of good new games which included Dragon Age Inquisition, Lords of the Fallen, and The Evil WIthin, but I just keep coming back to Shadows. If you found yourself just roaming around fighting guys in the open world of the Arkham games then this is for you. I have barely even touched the story yet since just roaming around and interacting with the nemesis system is so much fun. There is all kinds of emergent gameplay to be had here and every play session is like a random story creator. The combat is flashy and fun, and has more depth than one would think when starting out. Learning captain's and warchief's strengths and weaknesses adds a neat strategic spin on the brutal fighting. There is nothing quite like knowing a captain is afraid of caragors (awesome potential chaos causers and mounts) and then riding one into battle and seeing his panic. It does seem to borrow from a few other great games, but it adds its own spin to things. You will find yourself fighting crazy amounts of enemies at once which really puts your skills to the test. Walking into a fortified stronghold after upgrading your skills a bit and starting a fight with a giant horde of orcs never gets old. I found myself ignoring the orcs that signal others on purpose and then just seeing how long I could last against 50+ of them. It is great for long or short play sessions. Even when I only have 15 or 20 minutes to spare I can find something fun to do. There are also upgrades to your character's abilities and weapons as well as collectables to be found.

It must be the cinematic way that you can kill things that draws me in most. Its not easy to master, but its easy to play if you are halfway competent in games.(which thankfully i am at least halfway...)\n\nGraphics are great, the way things die are awesome, find secrets, the orc boss system is pretty fantastic as well. I also like that the bosses progress when they kill you and become your nemesis, which promptly pisses me off and makes me want to go out and get my revenge.

It is not a sequel, but it feels like one. Most who play this game will have seen the Lord of the Rings films, or read the books, or played either the Assassin's Creed series or the Batman Arkham series. Shadow of Mordor is greatly influenced by these popular sources. From its gameplay, to its story, to its visual style and soundtrack, this game makes you feel like you're returning to a land that you love. It is, however, this same familiarity that cuts into its longevity.\n\nThe big innovation that Shadow of Mordor brings to the table is its Nemesis system. Much praise has been heaped upon it. In my view, it works very well in an open world game but it is not without its weaknesses. For example, it is enthralling to cross blades with orc captains when each one feels unique from the others. Yet it also seems impossible for a pseudo-randomly generated boss to match that of a static, hand crafted boss like you'd find in other games. The Nemesis system has quantity on its side and is more true to life but tends not to be as memorable or as fun to fight as those bosses you find in games like Dark Souls or Shadow of the Colossus. To its credit, Shadow of Mordor also has a handful of standard boss  fights throughout its main missions. Unfortunately, the final one is a major letdown in the form of a short series of quick time events.\n\nTolkien's Middle-earth is immensely rich in history. Shadow of Mordor's story utilizes that history mostly for the game's setting, and then makes up the actual plot as its own alternative history. As someone who has seen all the movies but never read the books, I was very pleased that the story was both new to me and still connected to the epic tale we all love. With the exceptions of Gollum, Sauron and a couple brief cameos that I won't spoil, the cast is composed of characters not seen in the films. Not until writing this did I look up to see how close the game sticks to lore and it seems the consensus is that it largely doesn't. Yet this doesn't bother me and, if anything, I wish the game had had more story and was less gameplay centric. This was definitely written more for fans of the movies than for scholars of the Silmarillion.\n\nArtistically this game takes most of its cues from the original movie trilogy. Orcs, Elves, Dwarves and Men look and sound as they do in the films. I see that as a good quality. The voice acting is very well done, particularly for video game standards (though those have been rising in recent years). The soundtrack is mostly befitting of the orcs. The heavy percussion, deep horns, cellos and warlike chants can actually become too imposing at times, making me wish for a brief respite.\n\nEnvironmental design I found to be somewhat weak, though it was obviously catered more to gameplay than visual spectacle. Some of that is hard to escape with the first half of the game taking place in the barren, rocky wastes of Udûn. The second half's setting along the Sea of Núrnen is more lush and interesting to look at. Both areas, however, feel relatively small. This is less an artistry complaint and more a wish for greater real estate in which to battle the orcs and beasts of Mordor. The game is never able to imitate the movies' epic, sweeping vistas.\n\nAt around 30 hours for 100% completion of the main game, Shadow of Mordor is not as long as many similar games out there. Yet in the waning hours I still found myself growing bored. Many of the side quests and a few of the primary missions I could have done without. In particular, the 24 Outcast quests are painfully repetitive and have no business being so numerous other than to pad out play time. It doesn't help that, aside from The Bright Lord DLC, I found this game to be considerably easier than I anticipated.\n\nI would list both major DLCs, Lord of the Hunt and The Bright Lord, as disappointing as well. Neither introduces any new areas to explore nor deepens the story in any appreciable way. I will say that the final battle of The Bright Lord is like the end boss we never got in the main campaign. Even still, I wouldn't recommend either outside of the Game of the Year bundle. For some, Shadow of Mordor's familiarity will hurt it sooner than it will for others. For me, it never bred contempt but it did darken an otherwise compelling game.","April 29","true","37.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And it seems, lately, that the publisher contracting developers of these games happens to be Warner Brothers. Shadow of Mordor, the Arkham games, and the recent Mad Max have all proven themselves to be stellar amazing games. And, as some people may notice, there is also a trend across the Arkham games, Shadow of Mordor, and Mad Max, the open world and free flow combat. Some poeple may say the trend is a bit much and is being done over and over again, but as long as the environments and stories and superb, I don't see the problem. In fact, I love open world action adventure games, they're just so much fun to explore.\n\nThat said, here's my take on Shadow of Mordor, which kind of plays around with the Lord of the Rings mythology and the origins of the rings. Amazing. I really loved this game. It wasn't just the plot, which wasn't the most epic, but the idea of a gravewalker, a man who had died but was revived by a wraith. Talion is that man, who, involuntarily, is joined with an elf, Celebrimbor. After watching his family die and being slewn himself, Talion is cursed and stuck in Mordor, and tasks himself of getting revenge against the Black Hand of Sauron. You're start in the valley of Udun, the area north-west of Mount Doom in the very north-west corner of Mordor, where you meet outcasts and former Ranger Hirgorn. Eventually, you learn about the ranking system with the orcs and uruks, meaning you have to kill a number of captains and warchiefs before even attempting to fight The Hammer, one of your targets. The story progresses along rather quickly but you can consume so much time doing various side missions and collecting artifacts.\n\nThen there's the nemesis system, the heart and soul of Shadow of Mordor. The nemesis system is, undoubtedly, the most fun I've had in recent gaming. At some point in the story, you learn how to brand the enemies, even captains and warchiefs, and pit them against each other, let them rise through the ranks, ultimately building your own army. It's pretty great.\n\nGraphics wise, this game is stunning. At points in Udun, it's grim, forboding, dark, and it seems like there's a great evil lurking everywhere. Really, it's just you hiding in the shadows, waiting for the next kill, or going all out with the free flow combat and combat finishers. The executions are glorious as well. In the southern area, the Sea of Nurnen, is lush and gorgeous with flowing green grass and trees. It didn't even really occur to me how big Mordor is until I looked on an actual map to see where the sea is as I'd never really read any of Tolkein's works beyond The Hobbit and the LoTR trilogy. So when I saw where Mount Doom is in relation to the whole of Mordor, I was actually rather shocked. I would have loved to see Mordor in its entirety, which would be a massive task, not to mention how much bigger the open world would be when compared to how small the world in Shadow of Mordor is. If the in game measurement of feet is accurate, then the whole game is about 1 square mile, maybe a bit more. Still, the game probably benefits from the small size compared to Mad Max where everything is so spread out, but at least you have a car taking you to places there.\n\nAnyway, Shadow of Mordor might have messed around with the lore, but it's a great game and a great experience.\n\n9.3/10","November 9, 2015","true","25.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game won me over, when I didn't really expect too much of it. I had heard several different opinions about it, and wasn't sure whether I'd enjoy it.I bought it when it was on sale, and just finished it. And I enjoyed it a LOT.\nLet's go through it:\n\nStory:\nThe story is not very deep, and neither is it Tolkien-level writing. It actually messes with the lore of Sauron, the One Ring, and Celebrimbor quite a lot. But STILL, I did enjoy it. It isn't all that deep, but it's dark, tragic and makes you care about the main protagonists.\nPlease note that I am a big Tolkien-fan, and while I realize that this is a bit lore-breaking, I still enjoyed the game and the story a lot.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks great. The first zone is rather dull, which fits Mordor. The second zone is nicer. And I disagree with those reviewers who said it is wrong, or doesn't look right. This is a zone which had a lake, and that, together with the volcanic ashes of Mt. Doom, made for quite fertile soil. This is actually according to lore.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you like AC and Batman, you'll get a handle of the mechanics quickly. Attacks, jumps, dodging, blocking etc. You have to adjust to different enemies. Sometimes, a tactical retreat to heal and reattack is helpful. I think I did about three times by the hands of an orc, and twice by some creature (Caragor).\nThere are some fun moves you can do, especially the shadow strike, which isn't only a powerful one-shot move, it also helps to get around camps full of orcs.\n\nThe fun REALLY starts once you get the ability to brand orcs so they fight FOR you. You can tactically brand an area full of orcs before you go for a stronger one or start a mission there to improve your chances.\n\nYes, you CAN go for a certain build (stealth, archery, swordfight, mounted fight), BUT the missions will force you to use different playstyles at some point. So even if you don't go for archery too much, the game eventually requires you to use it for a while. Also, with the story quests and all the side-stuff I did, I got to the point where I unlocked almost all abilities in the skill tree anyway, and opened up most rune slots etc, so all play-styles where useable and I had special abilities for each of them.\nAnd finishing those hunting quests with the dwarf in the second zone opened up some abilities and how to use them that felt pretty epic. =)\n\nAt first, you wanna be careful about picking your fights, but eventually, you can handle several big groups.\nThe final boss fight is often critizised, and I agree, it seems a bit underwhelming. Then again, how could you expect to actually hold your own against this enemy for too long? You go through a couple of sub-bosses shortly before this fight, and then you get one shot, and you use it.\n\nNemesis-system:\nThis is the most innovative system of the game. It shines even more if you die a lot and really start to hate certain mobs. I didn't die too often, but if an orc managed to kill me, I really REALLY was out for revenge.\nIt's a VERY cool idea IMO. Not only one of the coolest parts about SoM, but in general, just a great idea, just like the branding.\n\nContent:\nThe story isn't TOO long... I hear you can finish that in about 10 hrs or less. There is a lot of side content which is NOT mandatory. It's the system you have in most open-world games... it CAN be grindy if you do all the rather repetitive side content, but you don't have to. I did the side-missions for a while in order to make my army of orcs stronger and level my orc leaders, but eventually stuck to story missions. I recommend a mix of both... do the story, but if you feel like it, do a bit of the side-content. Dont burn yourself out on doing too much of the side-stuff, but don't ignore it either, otherwise you'll most likely go through the game too quickly.\n\nMusic:\nEven though it occasionally sounds pretty much like some MIDI-library, some of it sounds great, especially tracks with the choir.\n\nOverall:\nI didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. It has its flaws, surely, like the typical "open world with tons of repetitive side content", you mostly fight orcs (which makes sense in Mordor), the story isn't exactly on the level of a Tolkien-novel. Still, I loved the fighting style and special moves, the tactical aspects of infiltrating a fortress and branding orcs (again: Once you get branding, the fun really starts), loved how the main character started to feel more and more powerful (nice development curve there), and when I was done after about 26-28 hours, I really felt entertained. I definitely got my moneys worth (got this during a sale), and enjoyed it MUCH more than similar games, like, say, AC Syndicate.\n\nI really recommend the game if you like AC/Batman style gaming, if you like Tolkien and his books (even though it messes with the lore and isn't that deep), and especially if you can get this while it's on sale!\n\nOverall rating: 8.5/10","January 11","true","32.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The control of the character was more than satisfying (people who play Batman or Assassin's Creed 1-2 will find really easy to get used to controls) and I love that there was a leadership ladder in the Orcs army and you could fight them. And I have to point out that it was the best combat system I have seen so far, you could do amazing things, you can fight plenty of enemies at the same time, but the mistakes cost you a lot. Beautiful story compined with an equal good soundtrack.

Looks beautiful especially with the dynamic weather.  The story is good and the nemesis system works really well.  There is varied gameplay with side missions a plenty and if you feel like it, jut run around killing the Uruk-Hai.  There are skill tree's which you have to earn XP for to unlock to improve your moves and unlock extra ones to make the combat varied when you do get into a struggle against more than one captain.  There are also runes which you can equip on your weapons to improve various different stats.  The game is very well optimised unlike some games which have been released this year and works very well at 1440p with an AMD R9 290 gpu, achieving over 60 fps.  If you enjoy both the batman and assassins creed series of games you should enjoy this game as it mixes different elements of the two together very well.  All in all I would have to award this game as my game of the year for 2014.","December 8, 2014","true","31.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It uses the Arkham games free flow system with the Assassin's Creed open world. Its a perfect mixture of the two that creates such an amazing game. The combat is very fluid and incrediebly responsive. The open world is large with many side missions and collectibles.\n\nThe crown jewel of this game is the Nemesis System. To put it in basic term, every Orc you face will remeber who you are. So if you get killed by an Orc, then when you go back for a rematch they'll remeber that they killed you and they'll remeber details of the battle. Its unbelievable how well this system works. Each Orc looks different and has their own strengths and weakensses that you can expliot by capturing other Orcs and compelling them to tell you about their captain.\n\nThe main story is very good. Troy Baker once again delivers an amazing experience by voicing the main character. Sadly we didn't see much of Nolan North even though he was supposed to be the main baddie. Side missions are fun and challenging. Each has a goal for you to do, like kill 10 Orcs with stealth while not alerting anyone. And each missions has a bonus option that will give you extra XP.\n\nNow there are some bad parts of the game. The game is optimzied but it still has its hicups when fighting large amounts of enemies. Also, the cutscenes, even on Ultra, are very low quality. The boss battles are very easy, which is something that shocked me. The Warchief battles or even a nemesis battle can be pretty hard, but the 3 main boss battles were basic and somewhat boring.\n\nPros:\n1. Amazing open world\n2. Fluid Combat System\n3. Great voice acting and story\n4. The Nemesis System\n\nCons:\n1. Low Quality Cutscenes\n2. Bad Performance in some areas\n3. Simple boss battles\n\nAll in all, this game is hands down one of the best I've seen this year. I cannot wait for the DLC to come out. I really hope this game gets a sequel, cause this is probably my favorite LOTR game ever. 8.5/10\n","October 12, 2014","true","19.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

From combat, to story, to skill mechanics, the game beats out all previous installments.  SoM does a great job putting you in the world of Middle Earth while also keeping you specifically out of the direct story line of the LoTR, breathing into it a fresh perspective on the game.\n\nYou play in 3rd person mode and wade through waves of Orcs as you seek to uncover the past behind your ghostly friend who constantly appears and shows you how to use your newly unlocked powers.  The world is divided into segments that you can fast travel between in order to complete various quests (divided into two types, story and level up).  Each quest unlocks new runes and skill points.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, its graphics are some of the best and the combat mechanics are smooth.  There's very little awkward disconnects in the movement, so you will rarely find yourself looking at fights and wondering how an orc swung his axe 2 feet off from where you are and still hit you.  That being said, the difficulty becomes broken once you're leveled your skills up to a certain point.  Skills like being able to counter by simply tapping the right mouse button when you see the icon means with a little practice you are mostly untouchable.  Add to this some very over powered combos that you can unlock and you're basically the bane of all orcs existence.  This is fun so long as you weren't hoping for a challenge throughout the entire game.  This also can add replay value if you just enjoy wading through enemies and seeing how ridiculous your combo can be.\n\nOverall, the game is engaging and learning how to link together your skills in order to master the art of slaughtering orcs is fun.  If you always wished you could be plopped into the epic battles you see in the LoTR movies, this is as close as you're going to get.  If the developers balanced the skills and added a little more variety into the world, this game would be a shining beacon for all other games in the series to aspire to.  Definitely worth the money!","October 14, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linearskillz/recommended/241930/","linearskillz","Linearskillz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linearskillz/","762 products in account","Shadow of Mordor is a ton of fun. To describe it as part Batman (combat and character upgrades) and part Assassin's Creed (world and mission structure) would be a disservice, as it manages to be better than the sum of its parts. The much-touted nemesis system is an achievement and adds a never before seen dynamic to the open world formula. It's the most dynamic open world game I've played as you can play the with nemesis system seemingly indefinitely, as you fight orc captains and disrupt the military structure of Sauron's army. Halfway through the game you gain the ability to brand enemies which puts them under your control, pitting your orcs against Sauron's. As someone that was skeptical of the marketing that always surrounds games like this, I was pleasantly surprised how well the nemesis actually works.\n\nOrcs that were not killed by decapitation may come back from the dead more powerful seeking revenge (orcs are resilient, if nothing else). Orcs will kill you and level up, becoming captains themselves if they weren't one already. You will likely run into a captain or warchief that continuously bests you and develop a deep desire to get revenge, and when you finally do you will yell at your screen in satisfaction. The orc army will fight amongst itself and generate random events for you to disrupt the balance of power. It's all very, very cool. The amount of work that must've gone into it is staggering.\n\nThe story isn't anything special and mostly serves as a MacGuffin for you to interact with the nemesis system. It's serviceable, with excellent voice acting, but remains a fairly typical revenge story. I have no idea how it fits in with the LOTR canon but I'm sure it takes many liberties.\n\nThe graphics are nice but not groundbreaking. Mordor looks like Mordor and as such is mostly a brown wasteland. It's a pretty wasteland, but a wasteland nonetheless. There is a second map that is much more lush and green and is welcome change from the first map. I think the VRAM requirements they stated were highballed since I'm able to play with a mix of high and ultra settings on my 2GB GTX 670 at 60fps 95% of the time (textures on High, using adaptive vsync). Animations are top notch and make you feel like a total f-ing badass. The combat animations aren't as smooth as Batman since the combat is more forgiving as lets you counter mid-animation. This can cause some quick and unnatural movements that serve the gameplay more than the visuals.\n\nClimbing is similar to Assassin's Creed but quicker and simpler since your character can jump longer distances and move much faster. Traversal is easy but sometimes the camera runs into problems or you will fight with the multi-purpose buttons (drop and stealth brand are bound to the same thing, as are stealth brutalize [a kill move] and distract).\n\nThe music and sound design is excellent especially in combat. The sound FX for executions and certain powers are awesome and make you feel that much more badass.\n\nOverall I think Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game and I hope it does very well for WB and Monolith. I would love to see more games using the nemesis system. I think that from now on any open world game without it will seem stale in comparison.\n\nTL;DR: I would highly recommend playing this game.","October 2, 2014","true","24.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Let me start this review by saying that I am NOT an actual "fan" of LOTR, shocking I know, lmao!  I DO love fantasy and RPG elements though.  With that being said I debated on getting this game for close to a week before I clicked "Add to Cart" and hoped I wasn't disappointed.  MY GOD WAS I NOT!  This game, while not at all groundbreaking, has fantastic elements and in my opinion extremely fluid combat similar, AND BETTER, than the Batman Arkham series.  The story is in some ways original and your typical fantasy style but interesting enough to make you want to continue and see what's beyond the next horizon.  New abilities are given at a fair pace and are fun to see how many ways you can destroy your enemies.  I haven't had any technical issues or performance issues with the game.  I use an Xbox 360 Controller and it works flawlessly with no lag or issues.  The stealth elements aren't new to anybody but the penalty for being caught means you are SWARMED, with literal HORDES at times, for a simple miss step, and it can make for a very pulse pounding experience when you are in an Uruk stronghold trying to avoid an archer seeing you before you take him out so he doesn't sound the alarm and unload a metric f*ckton of Uruks ready to coat their weapons in  a few gallons of human plasma.  I give it an 8/10 as it does get a bit repetitive like most games these days, but I will edit this review after some DLC content comes out and it perhaps expands an already promising continued experience.  To put it in another way, I have been a gamer on Steam for almost 5 years and this is the first game I actuall felt deserved a fair and honest review.  I don't give a flying purple Smurf sh*t what anyone says, this game is more than deserving of a fair shake.

Really impressive gameplay (great mix of Batman combat system and Assassin's Creed free-run). The only dissapointing part was that there was not a big boss battle in the end and some QTE (Quick Time Events) which I think they shouldn't be existing in the game.\nI didn't experience any kind of bug after all that hours, which immediately gives the gamer a +1 for me. The control of the character was more than satisfying (people who play Batman or Assassin's Creed 1-2 will find really easy to get used to controls) and I love that there was a leadership ladder in the Orcs army and you could fight them. And I have to point out that it was the best combat system I have seen so far, you could do amazing things, you can fight plenty of enemies at the same time, but the mistakes cost you a lot. Beautiful story compined with an equal good soundtrack. Moreover it has a great optimization for pc, I runned this game with the HD pack with no fps drops at all and everything maxed out (1080p) +1 for not forgetting the pc gamers and just releasing console game with bad optimization for pc users.\n\n\n8.5/10 with the perspective of just a gamer (I would really love to have a kickass boss battle in the end), 9.5/10 as a LOTR fan. :)","October 7, 2014","true","26.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

And so on.\nMy overall experience was very glitch and bug free, though I did encounter some here and there.\nThe animations are extremely well done and beautiful to watch but after awhile, I had seen them all.\nCombat is fluid and far better than the combat in the Batman games which are known for its wonderful combat.\nThat they are using code and animations from the Assassin's Creed series is blatantly obvious from the moment you start climbing, I even think I noticed some during combat. However, I don't care as the game is very enjoyable.\n\nGraphically, it was quite pleasing to the eye and I am very impressed with how incredible the game looked and ran on my computer. (I played on the highest setting)\n\nNow onto sound, which is more my thing:\nThe voice acting is extremely good, but don't expect actors from the movies to show up with a voice role, which annoyed me for one scene when you get to...familiarize yourself with an Istari, without giving too much away.\nAfter awhile, I swear the same actor did all the Uruks and that annoyed me. I also began to hear the same voice being used for two different Captains amongst the Uruks. Overall though, the VO is top dollah, as they say.\n\nThe sound design work is familiar to the work done on the movies which was a relief. I heard many references that the sound designer did to keep it in the same field as the films which was sounds that you heard for instance during the reforging of the tower, and the wraith world (Frodo puts on the ring and he enters that domain.)\nThe sounds of the Caragor were great and a lot of detail went into making them interesting and overall believable. I think I hear a seal in there for them during their running animations.\nThe combat sound work was a little bit disappointing as there is no power behind the hits of the swords, however, for the executions, there's some great work in both sound design and mixing happening from the engine, to emphasize the brutality of the animation.\nI enjoyed the various sounds for Talion's abilities that made you feel powerful and always in control, which is to me, the most important with good sound work.\n\nMusic:\nThey did not flat out copy or just slap on some Howard Shore and call it a day.

That being said, the main quests were enjoyable in nature. I particularly enjoyed a part of the game where you meet a new character who lost his partner and is out looking for a nasty beast. That part was best due to the chemistry of the actor and that it took away from the awful washed out main story. If I played again, I would just avoid doing all the side stuff except the weapon challenges, though there is some interesting memory audio that plays when you collect the objects, you get nothing else from it other than some coins that you can use to upgrade your skills. I was fairly disappointed at that but I guess being able to upgrade stuff is good. Though I got coins by just killing Uruk, which was a far more enjoyable part.\n\nThe nemesis system is where the game truly shines. I encountered an Uruk I had left for a Caragor to munch on, only to hear him moan about it later and hating me for it. This is a system I hope more games will learn from and use because it was extremely enjoyable to both see and hear the results of what you did to them.\nAnother thing I enjoyed was that the Uruks became more powerful when you died and the political backstabbing they did to each other was hilarious. They rose in power and rank, it was glorious!\nLike I said, I hope other games incorporate the nemesis system because it was the best part of the entire gameplay experience.\n\nThey got some stuff to learn in terms of side-quests but else, I think the gameplay was fun.\n\nStory:\nThe story and the pacing of the story is, imo, horrible.\nWhen you begin, you are thrown into it so quickly, you have no idea why it is happening and it doesn't give you room to breathe which is very important in making a good intro.\nIt is the typical revenge story we have seen so many times over and specially in fantasy. It doesn't try to stand on its own two feet by trying to tell a different kind of story, just rehashing tried and true formulas in story telling which is by now so overly done it smells like grandpa's old socks.\nI did enjoy that the story for the Wraith and figuring out who he was. He is a huge character amongst LOTR fanatics and I think it might be the reason he was picked for this part. He serves it well but keep in mind that it is off-canon.\nVery disappointed by the fact that the main character is a Ranger and that they didn't try to make him something completely different. Also the name Talion is horrid; in fantasy we find names that end with "ion" so often it is by now lazy writing in their part. I cannot write much about the story without giving too much away but the writing will sometimes rehash a lot of what the movie writers wrote. You will hear direct quotes from the films every now and again which is silly when they happen. Of course the obligatory: "Fly, you fool!" is heard, though that is copied directly from the pen ship of Tolkien, which I don't mind as much.\n\nIt is a game  you don't go in for the story, but the background work which Tolkien gave his world. I really enjoyed seeing Morgai flies and hearing about it from the Uruks in their idle chatter.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nGreat combat, sound, graphics and animations. Nemesis system is the best part\nBoring story, main character and side-quest designs.","October 3, 2014","true","26.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But there are also quite some negative points to make about this game. In Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ there is literally no enemy variation. The fighting system is way too easy, so u dont even have a problem to fight aiganst douzens of Orks while u are alone. It is pretty simular to Assassins Creeds fighting system. This game has his main focus on the story and epic looking fights. After all i enjoyed playing  the game but with a harder/better fighting system it would have been better.

As a fan of Tolkien's painstakingly detailed universe, I've been set up for a lot of disappointments—but Shadow of Mordor is not one of them. It is a beautifully rendered, undeniably delightful cross between the exploration and discovery of Assassin's Creed and the well-balanced and fun fighting-style of the Batman: Arkham series, all set in one of Tolkien's most bleak and (attractively) desolate atmospheres: Mordor.\n\nThe creators took as much care as Tolkien himself to build a Mordor that is true to the author's original vision of it. The mountainous peaks are sharp crags, the roads are muddy trenches, the fortresses are ramshackle works of stones and wood, the forest (when you eventually reach it) is green with hills that roll like waves, the creatures are both grotesque and beautiful (and hostile, don't forget hostile), and the amount of history contained in the codex entries the player picks up is astounding without being overwhelming. The entire environment is spot on, from the Sea of Núrnen to the Black Gate itself.\n\nOn top of that, the beings that inhabit Mordor are just as perfectly portrayed. Mordor is filled with orcs and uruks, each one its own ugly, nasty individual with different traits and features. Some of them are afraid of the big, lion-esque mounts called caragors that the player rides. Others are enraged by them and grow stronger when they see one. Some fear fire, some like pain, some hate to be defeated, and some just seem utterly invincible to anything but a stealthy strike from above. Each orc is unique, with its own name and characteristics that change how the player interacts with them during a fight. As the game progresses, players start to remember the names of orcs they've encountered—even building up grudges against orcs that have consistently foiled their attempts to kill them.\n\nAnd that's what makes Shadow of Mordor truly great. After all, the setting of a game isn't what makes it fun: the gameplay is. And in terms of gameplay, Shadow of Mordor is a knockout! On top of the smooth fighting system and the ability to tame the creatures of Mordor for some well-designed mounted combat, Shadow of Mordor features one of the most fantastic systems I've ever encountered in video games: the Nemesis System. That orc that took an opportune chance to stab you in the back while you were being mauled by a rampaging caragor? Now that he's killed you once, he'll remember you after he's promoted to a captain. Next time you see him he'll mock you. And then he'll kill you again. And again. And maybe even again. And then, when you finally get your revenge and kill him, if you don't decapitate him there's a chance he'll come back one more time (or five), just to ruin your day!\n\nAltogether, Shadow of Mordor was a fantastic Middle-earth experience that made me feel like I really was stalking the dusty expanse of Mordor, hunting down not-so-innocent orcs and claiming vengeance on those who have wronged me. Shadow of Mordor's storyline is certainly not the highlight of the game, but it didn't need to be to thrill me and inspire a weekend long binge of quietly stalking orc captains and slaying the dangerous beasts of Mordor's plains. The well-made environment and the entertaining gameplay gave Shadow of Mordor more value than I ever could have imagined out of another Lord of the Rings game.","January 12, 2015","true","35.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Majority of the game play graphic are even look better than the cut scenes. Don't get too scared from the system requirement, i think this game is actually very well optimised. I have a GTX 850M graphic card and INTEL I5 as processor and 4Gb of RAM. It runs on High graphic setting and i set the textures to Ultra . It runs around 55-60 FPS as I capped the FPS to 60 frames per second.\n\nThe combat system in this game aren't that good, as they are pretty much the same as the Batman series which made by WB games. I'm not saying that the combat systems it self is bad, it just seems bit weird on a game that related to the Lord of the Rings. Also the running, stealth, climbing system are looking like Assassin's Creed which is kinda weird as well.\n\nOverall, as a Lord of Rings fan boy, this game just looks awesome to me and i would definitely rate 10/10.\nStrongly recommended to all the Lord of Rings fans.","April 12, 2015","true","18.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","9"

Hearing that the pc copies were withheld from reviewers screamed a terrible recipe for a console port. Well I took a gamble and bought it anyway. Let me say this, within 20 minutes of playing the game I was sold on something I never buy, the "season pass" I bought it straight quick.\n\nThis game screams quality. Finally an amazing LotR game. Its taken years for a game to live up to such a legendary franchise. Monolith has done their homework and pieced together an incredibly enjoyable world and story. The voice acting and characters are excellent, the nemesis system is a brilliant little system that makes your death signifigant and creates rivalry and hatred towards your enemies that kill you, they become more powerful and remember you. Its an excellent system to keep the player driven by revenge which is your main characters primary motive.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent, tight and very responsive. If you like the Batman games from Rocksteady studios you will LOVE THIS GAME. It is the batman fighting style with swords and brutal combat. This game is visceral and beautiful.\n\nIt is honestly seldom a AAA title lives up to its name. This game in every aspect is a win, no bugs, smooth frame rates on Ultra High for my 7700gtx and i74770k and 16 gigs of ram. The game oozes quality in every aspect. I cannot recommend this game highly enough. This game is worth 65 dollars and I would have paid that gladly. It is the best PC "port" since Max Payne 3. To be honest I was wondering if the combat would handle better on a controller or the Pc keyboard and mouse. I prefer it on the mouse and keyboard where as I enjoyed the Batman games more on a controller. The combat is very very responsive and excellent.\n\nIf you like wrecking stuff, brutalizing enemies seeing them run from you in terror this game is for you. Highest recommendation.\n\n10/10 Incredible title. Well done Monolith. Thank you for producing a quality title.","October 3, 2014","true","36.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And so on.\nMy overall experience was very glitch and bug free, though I did encounter some here and there.\nThe animations are extremely well done and beautiful to watch but after awhile, I had seen them all.\nCombat is fluid and far better than the combat in the Batman games which are known for its wonderful combat.\nThat they are using code and animations from the Assassin's Creed series is blatantly obvious from the moment you start climbing, I even think I noticed some during combat. However, I don't care as the game is very enjoyable.\n\nGraphically, it was quite pleasing to the eye and I am very impressed with how incredible the game looked and ran on my computer. (I played on the highest setting)\n\nNow onto sound, which is more my thing:\nThe voice acting is extremely good, but don't expect actors from the movies to show up with a voice role, which annoyed me for one scene when you get to...familiarize yourself with an Istari, without giving too much away.\nAfter awhile, I swear the same actor did all the Uruks and that annoyed me. I also began to hear the same voice being used for two different Captains amongst the Uruks. Overall though, the VO is top dollah, as they say.\n\nThe sound design work is familiar to the work done on the movies which was a relief. I heard many references that the sound designer did to keep it in the same field as the films which was sounds that you heard for instance during the reforging of the tower, and the wraith world (Frodo puts on the ring and he enters that domain.)\nThe sounds of the Caragor were great and a lot of detail went into making them interesting and overall believable. I think I hear a seal in there for them during their running animations.\nThe combat sound work was a little bit disappointing as there is no power behind the hits of the swords, however, for the executions, there's some great work in both sound design and mixing happening from the engine, to emphasize the brutality of the animation.\nI enjoyed the various sounds for Talion's abilities that made you feel powerful and always in control, which is to me, the most important with good sound work.\n\nMusic:\nThey did not flat out copy or just slap on some Howard Shore and call it a day. There are some great original work in here channeling the spirit of Howard Shore but it goes way beyond that. I enjoyed that they combined musical stingers with the combat when you did well. I enjoyed the opening song the most, which I also think was the main theme of the game.\nA chant in black speech saying the oh so familiar phrases: "One ring to rule them -" etc.\nI hope to hear the composer work in other games, because he quickly rose amongst my favorites, just stop and take a listen.\n\nGameplay:\nThough I enjoyed some of the side-missions at first, they become quickly redundant and boring, it is like they never learned to make good side quests from the mistake of others. That being said, the main quests were enjoyable in nature. I particularly enjoyed a part of the game where you meet a new character who lost his partner and is out looking for a nasty beast. That part was best due to the chemistry of the actor and that it took away from the awful washed out main story.

The Lore never gets deep. the story never gets interesting. There is little exploration and no role playing.\n\nThis game could have been so much more, but it is no Witcher 3.\n\nThis is a game to take in short sessions as 'light entertainment' and kill an hour or two and a few hundred  orks or so.

It actually takes alot from the ac series like climbing and parkour, taking parts from batman arkham like the stealth and the bulk of the combat and it even takes from the new tomb raider with the collectables each thing telling its own story. This game was almost perfect and if they added these 5 things it could have been my favorite game of all time its already soo close.\n\n1. give the plants different uses for example the blue one refills the stamina, the green heals you, the yellow makes your weapons deal more damage and red makes you faster. Also adding crafting with scavenged materials would be awesome\n\n2. instead of having graugs and caragors use  different animals from the tolkien universe that are more popular like wargs and cave trolls\n\n3. add dragons yes maybe alot to ask but you cannot deny the badass idea of it, a dragon in each part of the map how badass would that be like the ultimate boss battle\n\n4. have ally camps like three camps per location one for elves, one for dwarves, and one for humans. Each camp would have a blacksmith shop where you could by upgrades for weapons and armor that are not mystical but made from leather and metal these upgrades would change your appearance. Also each camp would have a mission that would help the camp making it upgraded and ready to take mordor.\n\n5. a third location, in this game there are 2 maps one the sea of nurnun and the other is uden but the third location would be really dark there would be volcanoes smoke fire incredbly op enemies a place drowned in evil this would be the last location you head to\n\nthe 5 things I have mentioned where things wanted added but where not needed to make this game great it is well worth the price and in a bit of time when more dlc is released it will be worth buying the premium edition. I give this game a 9/10\n","December 29, 2014","true","67.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But there are also quite some negative points to make about this game. In Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ there is literally no enemy variation. The fighting system is way too easy, so u dont even have a problem to fight aiganst douzens of Orks while u are alone. It is pretty simular to Assassins Creeds fighting system. This game has his main focus on the story and epic looking fights. After all i enjoyed playing  the game but with a harder/better fighting system it would have been better. So if its on sale you sould defenetly buy it but i wouldnt pay 50€ for it.","October 7, 2015","true","17.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

So why would I recommend this game? Because it's a lot of fun.\n\nYes, the combat is a direct copy of Arkham City (Right down to uruks with intel glowing green like Riddler's henchmen), but plays equally fluidly, with some minor directional hiccups with keyboard controls. Hunting down captains and warchiefs is very similar to Assassin's Creed, but the killing blow is especially satisfying with an array of intense and brutal combative attacks to unlock. I do like the Nemesis System's design in allowing enemies in increase in power upon yours or a rival captain's defeat, or from them completing specific missions of their own. It makes for a good challenge and a greater necessity to survive any encounter. The side missions are typical of an open world game, but offer some great easter eggs relating to Tolkein's novels for fans.\n\nExploring Mordor is actually pretty exciting, thanks to the game's graphics. The game looks great, period. Every location is lush and meticulously detailed. Enemy strongholds are twisted and varied for passing through undetected. There are plenty of hidden locations throughout that host hidden collectibles and such, stretching the gameplay a little further.\n\nThe story, is decent, but nothing on par with Tolkein's own works. A typical revenge story with a cliffhanger ending leaving things open for a potential sequel. The cinematics however, are outstanding to watch, especially those related to the Wraith's past. Some familiar characters make appearances, and play small roles in the story, but offer nothing more, really.The voice acting is solid, but feature non of the original cast from Peter Jackson's films. However, Liam OBrien as Gollum was a great match for the character's voice in particular.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Shadow of Mordor much more than I had expected to, even after all the criticism my friends gave it when I initially showed interest. Personally, I think a game related to the LOTR stories being so ultra-violent is gratuitous, but god is it such a guilty pleasure cutting Uruks down one by one.","December 25, 2015","true","40.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Many people compare the combat to the Arkham games and the parkour to the Assassin's Creed games and while I agree with that, neither feel exactly like said games. I never once thought the parkour felt exactly like the Assassin's Creed games or the fighting felt exactly like the Arkham games, only that they are similar. Both elements feel unique to this game which makes it feel "new" rather than "copied".\n\nAs for the story itself I thought it was very interesting, especially as it's set in between the Hobbit and the Lord of The Rings, however if it hadn't been for the nemesis system, side quests and collectibles distracting me, I feel as though the story missions could probably be completed fairly quickly.\n\nThe nemesis system for those of you who don't know is an extremely cool feature in Shadow of Mordor that randomly generates unique enemies within Sauron's Army. Each enemy has their own name, voice, appearance and personality. I've yet to see the same enemy twice. Their position in Sauron's army can be affected by your actions and/or those of other enemies in side missions called “power struggles” that, if left, progress by themselves over time meaning enemies may level up, gain in power or be killed without you even interfering, it’s all done dynamically. This makes the open world feel much more immersive and alive. What's even cooler is the enemies remember previous encounters with you and mention it on your arrival, so for example, if an enemy escapes near death, when you next face them they will mention their loss from the previous encounter. This makes each encounter feel truly unique and add hours of extra gameplay onto the game. I feel that the nemesis system is a truly unique and addicting element to the game and has done the best job I’ve seen in any game at making each enemy sound, look and act differently rather than using the same model, voice and animations for enemies which is what most games seem to do.\n\nIf you like the Arkham combat style, the Assassin’s Creed parkour and Lord of the Rings, I have no doubt that you’ll thoroughly enjoy this game. This game combines those elements together and manages to make it feel unique. While the story itself doesn’t appear to be that long, although very good in my opinion, the nemesis system, numerous side quests and collectibles and upgrades and abilities that can be added to your character and weapons, add hours of gameplay to Shadow of Mordor. At the time of this review I’ve played for around 21 hours and I still have loads of side quests to do, collectibles to find, upgrades to buy and will continue to discover new enemies within the nemesis system. In my opinion, this game is brilliant and is definitely worth the money.\n","October 2, 2014","true","37.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/recommended/241930/","StarSide","Psychedelic Adventurer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/","422 products in account","A "love it or hate it" deal.\n\nFirst of all, anyone who has had the remotest of experiences with Assassins Creed or the Batman Arkham series will know exactly whether they like this game or not. Shadow of Mordor is a unapologetic iterative title.\n\nYou can look at it from two ways however. Either you can condemn itnfor having no originality; In which case you'd be wrong, as the Nemesis system is one of the most interesting and innovative things for a while in gaming.\nOr you'll embrace the similarities and get on with it.\n.....................\n\nSound: 9/10\nSound effects and voice acting is top notch across the board (except for the rather bland voice of the protagonist Talion)\nSwords strikes sounds significantly meaty as you cleave through the latest poor ork to cross your path. Also the soundtrack is pretty great as well. Nothing spectacular, but it's a solid hit none the less.\n\nThe real star of the show is the Orks. Too long have the Orks been relegated merely to second class infantry units which will fall in a few swings at most. Not so anymore.  You'll really believe these creatures are a real race when they talk. All of them are voice acted to a tee. Absolute 10/10 performance.\n\nGraphics: A hard one to review. The specs the devs say you need to max this game out are hugely exaggerated. I managed to Max the game out (including the HD textures) and still easily keeping a solid 60fps. The 6-8gb they ask for 'Ultra' is complete nonsense.\nThat being said, the game looks great. Not mind blowing mind you, but still extremely nice. Backdrops are crisp and the Orks facial animations are all very well made considering the sheer variety.\n\nPlot: Easily the weakest part part of the game. Quite a generic story, but with a few very cool moments. The wraith who bonds with you is a very interesting part of the plot however.\nThe game breaks cannon repeatedly apparently however. Many LOTR fans seem to be roid raging over some retcons that the devs deemed acceptable. One of which is that elves can't be wraiths.\nI for one don't see that as a problem, if they are going to do something with it and make a good story from it.\n\n\nFinal thoughts: If the devs had maybe pushed the boat out a little further and not gone the rout of just copying AC and the Arkyum games, this could have been something truly special. The nemesis system is a revolutionary way of increasing depth to an otherwise shallow plot and throughout the game you'll craft your own with the orks you face.\nNever the less, if you can find this a discounted price, this is a absolute must. I struggle to recommend it at full retail price however, when you could buy dozens of game of years with the money.\n\nFinal score: 8/10","October 4, 2014","true","16.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If it wasn't for a brief mention of it from my brother, I would've never heard of this game, but it didn't have to in order to be the best selling game on Steam, currently!\n\nThis whole "next-gen" deal has been a real bummer for gamers. Next-gen has been  nothing but a parade gimmicks and millions of dollars in marketing and critic bribery just to move some units of terribly dated game designs. Even the graphics most of the time are mudded textures just hidden under saturations of "bloom". Most notable of these gimmicks was Watch_Dogs which gave us false advertising on graphics and a context-sensative action button renamed "hack". I was hoping from it's trailers that Shadow of Mordor (SoM) would be the first TRUE next-gen game. I'm delighted to announce: C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!\n\n....ok but let's get this con out of the way: the story sucks. D'OH! It hurts my heart to say it, but the story is wasted potential of a brilliant idea, and characters are one-dimensional. The only time you hear anything about them is when they are holding your hand and rambling in your ear as they escort you to the next objective. It doesn't happen often, but it feels like very dated game design. You do a few "OMG SAVE MEH!11!" missions with them, then they disappear, and you completely forget about them. I can't recall a single name or face.\n\nThe story opening was a bit confusing, but you play Captain Talion of Gondor. His family dies in what almost comes off as a generic, vigilante cliche, but his situation has more depth and he is a hero as opposed to an anti-hero. Oddly when he dies, he is merely split between the physical world and the spiritual world, and is somehow connected to an elven wraith who suffers the same, cursed fate, along with a little amnesia. By tracking down heirlooms of the wraith's past, Talion recovers the deceased-elf's power and memory to unraveling the mystery. (ending to be seen)\n\nThe voice acting is terrific! Monolith Games did impressive work in brining the familliar sound of the voices from the movies into the game. The punch/kick/slash/stab sounds are almost stomach-turning. The music fits the game, but again is a bit forgettable. It's still a nice ambiance and isn't jaring. (Attentive gamers might notice that the elf wraith that you work with is voiced by the same guy who plays Albert Wesker.)\n\nMany gamers shared their concerns that the game looks identical to Assassin's Creed and the newer Batman games. It's true that SoM takes inspiration and wears it on it's shoulder, but it does more than enough to establish it's own identity. Not only that, but come on: how many ways can you portray a mid-ages, sword weilding assassin in the third person perspective? They'll start getting similar eventually.\n\nThe pride and joy of SoM is the "Nemesis System". A grid of randomly generated orc captains are assigned to a hierarchy. Depending on your actions is how they are promoted, killed, replaced, or otherwise, and almost all of your actions are saved, and the orcs react with literally 1,000's of lines of dialogue for various situations. That's where the game shines. While games like Skyrim and AC aren't ashamed of copy/pasting the EXACT SAME MISSION over a massive and empty map, SoM makes almost EVERY encounter with the orcs play out a slightly different way which better masks the repetition. Yes, the 2 maps you play on are quite small in comparison to other games, but I respect what was done here: QUALITY over QUANTITY. There isn't as many missions, but they opted for better playability and replayability.\n\nWhat really bothers me is there are many reviews out here that compare this game to Skyrim. People: Skyrim's ship has set sail. That game is in the past now, and why is it even being compared? It's 2 COMPLETELY different games. I don't even know why it's praises were sang from every corner of the internet or why it still sells like hotcakes everytime it's on sale on Steam. ESO exposed that game for what it was without the modding community slaving to finish it. It especially bothers me when they just say "The map is like 10% the size of Skyrim. boring game" wtf? (I made this section because I've seen the collective thinking and collective defense of ES games. If one said it, I'm certain they'll all say it.)\n\nAnyway, with the Nemesis System, the next time you go to do a familiar mission, it'll be a different orc that says something different, in a different location. The system adds much pined freshness to a tired and over-worn formula of open world games. While at it's core, yes; what you do is somewhat repeating, the presentation is always changing, making the world feel more organic and alive instead of so robotically scripted. A little on the disappointing side is the game is a bit short. If you really plow through the story, you might finish it in about 6hrs but the quality of what's there is so good, the replayability is off the charts. For maybe the 2nd time ever, I actually "want" to go through a game and get all it's collectibles.\n\nCombat is viceral and brutal. Left clicking does a slow slashing combo that slightly changes depending on the orcs reaction such as smacking it to the floor and hitting it while it's down. You can press SPACEBAR to jump over an enemy's head to avoid attacks and hit tougher enemies in the back, but orc don't just sit there and take it! When they are about to swing back, a prompt will appear over their head telling you to M2 to block it.Another fun idea is the elf bow. Upon drawing it, you deplete a "focus" meter which slows down time, letting you seemlessly switch to ranged attacks mid-fight to pick off more troublesome enemies. But my favorite is the "flurry" attack. Press E to stun an opponent, then left click to rapidly flail at them. As this combo plays out, the attacks go faster and faster, and a "charging up/speed up" sound plays that increases in pitch as the combo goes on. It never got old!\n\nYou have a talent tree and a weapon upgrade/rune mechanic to power up Talion. By killing captains, orcs drop runes you can forge onto your weapons for special effects, like healing yourself after certain attacks or filling up your arrow count from certain kills. The talent tree gives you numerous, awesome abilities that take advantage of the fact that you are a ghost-thing.\n\nI feel sorry for camera in this game; it gets no good feedback from the community, which I find baffling. They complain that it's never in the right spot, but...you have full control over the camera at all times, even during execution animations. Not only does this mean you can see what you want to see, but during the brutal animations, you can spin the camera around however you desire, making a cinematic, goring scene everytime you kill an orc.\n\nThat wraith that accompanies you doesn't just sit there. By grabbing an orc (or a heavily damaged captain), you have an option to terrorize it with the wraith's appearance. From here, you can interrogate them to reveal information of them. Regular peons cough up names and locations, but captains can reveal weaknesses of other captains or even the mighty warchiefs.\n\nThings really take a sweet twist when you learn "brand"; the ability to convert an orc to be your follower. Through this system, you use 5th column tactics against the enemy. You can cause orcs to execute, duel, assassinate each other, or betray their warchief; or enter a random camp, stealth-brand 10 or so orcs, then "activate them" to betray their comrades. There are so many possibilities in this system, it's almost endless, and mostly limited to your imagination.\n\n(part 2 link below)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/upsilonfanclub#announcements/detail/207488076614731110","October 2, 2014","true","26.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

The game starts at the black gate of mordor which at the time is guarded by the rangers of gondor. You control Talion a ranger of gondor whose wife and child lives there too. Soon Saurons armies lead by the mysterious black hand attack and kill all at the black gate including Talion and his family. You the find yourself resurrected by a wraith. Not only are you now bound to the wraith but talion recieves wraith abilites and powers. The wraith has no memory of who he is only that the black hand may be the key to unlocking his memories and so talion and the wraith set forth into mordor on a mission of revenge and discovery. Who ever said that one does not simply walk into mordor? While the story and indeed the game is not canon the developers have made sure that the settings, characters and story align within canon.\n\nMordor itself at this point isn't the barren wasteland as in the lord of the rings films. It has buildings, plant life as well as all manners of creatures and beings living there. The game offers a unique look into mordors landscape yet I remain disappointed with the world design. Yes while its not the barren landscape from the lord of the rings films it's an underwhelming murky brown landscape. There are hints of green here and there as well as rain but the whole thing remains a very depressing sight. Which on some level is fine after all this is mordor but I would have liked to have seen a little wow factor in the landscape. There are two main maps in the game, the first is just boring and brown, the second however is much more green and lush but still not the landscape I sought.\n\nYou only need to play the game for a short time so see the glaringly obvious similarities in gameplay to another Warner brothers title that being Batman Arkham city. Everything from movement to combat is very batman-esc in fact I would go as far as to say that barring a few differences the game is essentially at it's core an arkham game in lord of the rings clothing. However in this case it is not a bad thing, no indeed the free running fluid movement of talion lends vey well to both setting and other aspects of gameplay, after all he is a wraith possessed ranger.\n\nThe open world nature of the game works well in mordor, having the ability to just wander and find bands of orcs to kill rarely gets old. On the main map the world is spilt into sections each of which are dark until you climb the spirit tower to unlock it, I know, I know very Assassins Creed. You can even jump off the towers like ezio, who knows maybe Talion is another ancestor of Desmonds. And no ubisoft that is not licence to make assassins creed even more stupid and ridiculous. To be honest the whole spirit towers thing feels silly and such a rip off I wouldn't even have bothered putting it in. Travelling the world can be done in many forms, you can fast travel to towers, run everywhere or even tame animals to ride like the fearsome caragour.\n\nThe combat in shadow of mordor is very solid. Similar to the Arkham games the combat is based on a combo system. As you attack and counter enemies attacks you'll increase your hit counter at certain points every 5 to 8 hits you'll be able to preform at combat execution which instantly kills an enemy. Should your enemies be knocked to the floor you can preform ground executions at any time regardless of your hit counter. As you progress in the game enemy variety will increase which will require you to switch tactics depending on what enemy your facing. Normal uruks are easy to kill, uruks with speaks are giant shields require a bit more thought.\n\nYou have three weapons at your disposal in combat, a sword, a dagger and a bow. The dagger is used for stealth kills and executions only so you'll be relying on your sword and bow for most of the talking. You only have one attack button for the sword, you can switch targets flawlessly in-between striking so combos are easy to come by. Should you get surrounded you have a counter button which counters most melee attacks bar those who have special attacks.\n\nThe bow on the other hand is an indispensable tool both in and out of close range combat. To use your bow you enter the ranger stance, as you take aim you can use focus to briefly slow down time allowing you gain more precision in your shots. Its very easy to get head-shots from the bow and charging your shot up ensures the target will go down. The bow is also useful for getting out of sticky situations, the environment around you can be used to help you in battle. You can use the bow to shoot a variety of objects in the environment from explosive barrels to the cage doors of hungry beasts.\n\nWhile the combat is fun and fluid it's still not really enough to carry the game. Especially considering its simply an iteration of arkham cities combat. However Shadow of mordor has an ace up its sleeve and for me is the sole reason why the game is worth playing, the nemesis system. The uruks of mordor have a certain hierarchy, powerful war chiefs at the top and under them are the uruk captains. Barring a few set main story characters each war chief and captain is randomly generated with a unique name, personality and appearance. Each captain has strengths and weaknesses in battle so you must adapt your tactics to suit the captain.\n\nOften in your meetings on the battlefield with the captains, they may run or you may need to retreat. Over time, repeated clashes between Talion and an Uruk Captain can become very personal. Uruk Captains can and will remember you from close encounters in battle. Should Talion die, the captian who killed you will gain in rank and power plus the next time you meet he's sure going to mention it. If your killed by a normal uruk they will be promoted to captain and gain all the unique stats that come with that.\n\nI know from experience that a normal uruk can become your worst nightmare. All from a stray spear an uruk then managed to get to captain. After that he continually hunted me down and turned up at the worst possible moments usually when I was fighting other captains. In all he must have killed me around 9 times until I finally got my sweet revenge, there is no better feeling. Sometimes even killing a captain is not enough, Ratanak the prison master was one such foe, I killed him by shooting an arrow through his eye. Later in the game he showed up with half a metal face, yelling that the arrow lost him his eye and he wanted revenge. Instances like this pop up all the time in the game and its very, very cool. The whole system gets you personally involved with these characters, it makes you feel genuine hate at the captain that just plagues your existence. It also gives the impression of a living and changing world, if in a somewhat limited way.\n\nThe main story of the game, while not canon, is pretty good. The voice acting of the entire game is fantastic and all the characters particularly the orcs, wraith and gollum are very believable. It certainly does have a good Lord of the rings atmosphere to the whole affair and while the core mechanics are very similar to batman, it never feels like a cheap clone with a tolkien skin.\n\nIf you enjoyed games like the arkham series and too a lesser extent assassins creed, you'll be right at home with shadow of mordor. It is certainly a must for any LOTR fans as its certainly of the better games of the franchise. A good game with a few great aspects too it certainly not 'revolutionary' as some websites have claimed but all in all, a good outing for the franchise.","October 1, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

It truly captured my feelings about the game and goes into the deep philosophical reasons of why everyone in the world should play this game. I thought I'd share a few thoughts on my experiences completing the game.\n\nOverall, this game remains one of my favorite games I have ever played. The core combat mechanics are very, very good, the graphics are great, and the story is epic!\n\nMy only major complaint would be the final boss fights. Cinematically, they were still AMAZING and worth experiencing, but they were a bit lame as far as the actual gameplay goes. Minor spoiler: The last 2 boss fights were a short orc battle followed by a few quick time events. I was really hoping for a much more challenging fight with the final bosses of the game, but was, alas, disappointed. However, the cinematics were amazing, and I still can't recommend this game enough.\n\nMy only other complaint (and it is a minor one) is that this game was pretty easy once you got the hang of it. But becoming OP just made the game feel much more epic, and there were still some strongholds that kept things fairly difficult if you raised the alarm.\n\nI've seen some complaints that the side-quests in the game were pointless and have little reward once you have completed them. I personally didn't feel this way when I was playing with them; I enjoyed the side-quests for the fun of the quests themselves, not in hopes of any cool new unlockable. I actually kind of liked all the extra lore they included in the game a lot more than I thought I would.\n\nAlso, the music in this game is masterful! Definitely play this with some good headphones. :)","October 24, 2015","true","33.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","5","8","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mountain_Man/recommended/241930/","Mountain_Man","Mountain Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mountain_Man/","162 products in account","SummaryA darn good action game that borrows heavily from the Batman Arkham series but is all the better for it.\n\nReviewYou could be forgiven for calling this game Arkham: Middle Earth.  It has so much in common with Rocksteady's Batman games that you would swear that protagonist Talion is a distant relative of Bruce Wayne.  The combat controls are virtually identical, the map looks suspiciously similiar, orcs that you can interrogate for special information are marked in green like the Riddler's goons, and you can even enter the spirit world to find clues and spot enemies through walls, very much like Batman's "detective vision"!  I don't say this as a criticism but only because the similarities are impossible to ignore.  But you know what?  It works.  This is a fun and compelling game, and it's always a treat to play in J.R.R. Tolkien's universe (although the look and feel of this game is definitely more influenced by the Peter Jackson films than Tolkien's novels, a fact that may bother purists, but would a purist even be playing this game in the first place?).\n\nYou as play Talion, a Ranger captain who lives and works near Mordor's Black Gate at a period set some time between The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, but when his family is killed by Sauron's minions, he somehow finds himself cursed with the inability to die, or rather the inability to stay dead, and so he sets out to seek revenge.  The story is told through a series of rather excellent cutscenes featuring terrific animation and top-notch voice acting.  And even though the story is standard fare for a video game (it's no Tolkien, I'll say that much), I actually found myself drawn to the central protagonist simply because of the high-quality of the cutscenes.  It's a pity that there's no apparent way to rewatch them without playing the whole game from the beginning.\n\nI would describe this as an emergent action game.  It's open-world in the sense that you're free to go wherever you want whenever you want, and you can complete quests in the order of your choosing, but there are really no significant choices to be made, and despite the nice scenery, there's no sense of exploration and discovery, either.  Everything is clearly marked on your map, and highlighting a point of interest gives you a marker that guides you to your destination.  Furthermore, individual locations are fairly generic, and I think you'd be hard-pressed to get around the gameworld on your own without the markers to guide you since one area of the map looks very much like any other area.  Even after 30+ hours of play, I never developed the sense of familiarity with the setting like I did in any of Bethesda's open-world games, or even the Borderland series.  Shadow of Mordor is not the sort of game where you discover secrets or happen across a new vista.\n\nBut that's not to say the game itself is not compelling and fun.  The free-form combat is very smooth and engaging with great animations, although the kill moves are quite brutal (the M rating is well-deserved), and you have a wide variety of maneuvers to help you dispatch your foes.  You can even mount certain wild beasts and fight from their backs.  It can be a lot of fun wandering into a band of twenty orcs and emerging without a scratch, although this does take some practice.  As you complete missions and murder orcs, you will gain skill points that can be used to unlock new abilities for Talion, but it's pretty straightforward, and you'll easily have every skill and special ability available to you by the end of the game.  You can also collect special runes from dispatched orc captains to add to your weapons (a sword, a dagger, and a bow) that introduces a level of customization to your character.  Talion is a nimble fellow, too, and can scale virtually any cliff or wall he encounters, a useful ability when he wishes to remain unseen, and he can use certain parts of the environment to his advantage, like upsetting a nest of morgai flies to scatter his foes and make it easier to reach an objective without raising the alarm.\n\nI think what really sets Shadow of Mordor apart from the crowd is its nemesis system which is almost a game in and of itself.  The world is populated by a couple dozen persistent orc captains and warchiefs who represent your greatest combat challenges.  If one of them kills you, or if he successfully flees from you in combat, he will increase in power and be harder to kill the next time, so you have to consider whether or not engaging a captain is worth the risk since repeated failures could lead to creating a high-level orc who will be very difficult to put down.  Furthermore, if a standard orc kills you, he will be immediately promoted, so the roster of captains is constantly evolving.  To help even the odds, each captain has weaknesses that can be exploited, but you can only learn about these weaknesses by interrogating certain low-level orcs known as "worms" who are identified by a green icon.  Sometimes a captain might be impossible to defeat without knowing his weaknesses, so interrogating worms is often essential for success. And it gets more complicated from there.\n\nThe orc captains have their own internal power struggles, and you will see them rise through the ranks by betraying each other, or hosting feasts and hunts to raise their standing.  These events generally happen "off camera" while you're out on your adventures, but you can also interrupt them by activating procedurally generated mission markers that will give you the opportunity to kill the captains to keep the orcs in turmoil and weaken Sauron's army.  You eventually gain the power to dominate an orc's mind so that he does your bidding, and a major part of the game revolves around turning the orc army against itself and helping your branded captains rise to the level of warchief.\n\nShadow of Mordor's visuals are very attractive with clean textures, realistic weather and time-of-day effects, and superb animations, so I have no complaints there.  Performance in Linux is pretty good, and although benchmarks show that it lags behind Windows in terms of raw speed, I still found it smooth and responsive, so hats off to Feral Interactive for another fine port.\n\nSo bottom line, this is an enjoyable and well-made game that does exactly what the developers set out to do and will give you dozens of hours of entertainment romping through Tolkien's Middle Earth sandbox and murdering orcs.  And I haven't even mentioned the volumes of canonical Middle Earth lore that Monolith managed to cram into this game.","October 30, 2015","true","47.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

First off, I'd like to mention that I'm very into Tolkien. And being so, it does skew my opinion of this game. But I'll make an attempt at an even-handed review.\n\nHere goes...\n\nI'm very on-the-fence about this game.\n\nI've gone through many of the areas of the game, and to be honest, it all starts to look identical. Caragors, Orcs, crumbling tower ruins - all basically the same. I get that this is Mordor, but even with great graphics, animations, and production design - it gets very boring to look at. Even as the map opens up to the next one, it merely replaces the blackened ground with lush grasses, cliffs, and steppes - the ruins feel pretty much the same.\n\nMuch ado was given about the Nemesis System - but so far, all I've really seen is a revolving door of Orcs that, much like the scenery, starts to blur together into a long chain of interchangable Orcishness. I kill a few, they get replaced by others. They kill me, they get promoted. Sometimes they run away, or survive my antics, only to pop up later for the cycle to continue. Not exactly as revolutionary as it was made to sound. Even got to kill a few more than once. Which was a little weird.\n\nThe combat is very reminiscent of the Arkham Batman games, to the point where I found myself using many of the same tactics - and fought enemy types that were also cut-and-pasted from the Arkham series. I eventually started calling Talion "Batmanigorn" because, aside from gliding/grappling around, I sort of felt like a sword-wielding Batman and not a Ranger of the North. I don't mind this type of combat, but after 3 (soon to be 4) Arkham games, I started to feel like playing more Arkham Asylum/City/Origins, rather than Shadows of Mordor.\n\nSome of the Lore-changing/additions are interesting, a few are not actually possible (I'm looking at you Mr. Elf wraith!). And what could've been a great plot-twist concerning the origins of the Wraith Talion is bound to (which I won't reveal), advertising/promotion has largely spoiled.\n\nThat being said, the game looks good, runs well, controls are fairly tight (if you use a controller), it has a good musical score, and excellent voice acting for the Orcs.\n\nDo I like it? Yes.\n\nBut not so much that I think I'm going to be playing it in 6 months.\n\nIn my opinion, there could've been much more story and drama injected into this game's beginnings - but it largely feels lifeless, and a bit uninspired. I don't really have a sense of Talion's pain, nor his Wraith companion's. If I'm rooting for anyone, it's Ratbag. He actually has some kind of personality, direction, and sense of humor. Talion is mopey, bland, and needlessly gruff. The Wraith is an arrogant know-it-all (which is funny for an amnesiac). Why would I want to play these guys? Why would I want them to succeed? And in the grand scheme of things, does it even matter if they do?\n\nAll-in-all, I just don't feel like I'm playing in Middle-earth. It feels a bit more like playing in someone's not-quite-fully-fleshed out fan-fiction.\n\nAnd then there's the lack of content. 2.5 months and the only real additional content are Runes, 2 character swapping costumes, and a few Warband missions that drop piddley-♥♥♥ runes. The Warband missions don't even deviate from the basic hunt-the-orc-chief-down quests and add nothing really to the game. Charging people for this is shameful.\n\nAs of right now: 6/10\n\nGood, but not great. All these professional reviewers squealing in girlish glee over this game are on hallucinogenic drugs. This game isn't anywhere near the stream of 9+/10s I've been seeing.\n\nThe graphics, music, art direction, and Orc voice acting elevate what is otherwise a game that borrows extremely heavily from other sources.","October 2, 2014","false","32.6"," 155 of 303 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","155","303","0","11"

As long as you can pull a decent frame rate of at least 30fps, it should be more than competent.\n\nI would 100% currently recommend this after 2 hours of play. Those that enjoy Assassins Creed, Batman Arkham Asylum, and Tomb Raider could find some great appeal here. Have fun.\n\nEDIT* 7-8 Hours play time.\nStill thoroughly enjoying playing this. I am having a blast playing with the Nemesis system (I think that's what it's called) Having tracker Uruks hunt me down and being in the middle of a massive battle and then out of nowhere a rival Orc shows up to also try and kill me, it's really super neat.\n\nI have also been sent a screenshot from a friend of mine, he had avenged my death in his game somehow, had no idea that functionality existed, very cool. He killed a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Uruk that had killed me around 7 times after brutal battles.\n\nEDIT* ~16 Hours Play Time\nI have noticed I have been spending large amounts of time just roaming the landscape and interacting with the enemies ranks, manipulating them to my liking and toying with the enemies. Don't get me wrong, the story missions are fun and interested and well acted, but maaaaaaaan I love screwing with these Uruks. Being able to mount Caragors and Graugs is pretty excellent too.\n\nI also have been pleasantly surprised by unexpected occurrences with animations. For example, standing above a Graug and raining arrows down on it, when it unexpectedly climbs the wall I was hiding atop of. Totally blew me away, same with the Caragors, they can reach places that I just didn't expect.\n\nEither way,  I am in a second zone that is much more green and lush than the first, and I am just astonished by how great this game looks.\n\nEDIT* ~25 Hours Play Time Completed 100%\nAfter 100% completion, I can say that this was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had with a game in a long long time. Thank you very much to the developer for such a detailed and fantastically fun game.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nPros:\n+Amazing Graphics\n+Wicked fun combat\n+Nemesis system is mind boggling and entertaining as all hell\n+Open world was expansive and fun to live in and discover\n+Great upgrades + abilities\n\nCons:\n-Getting stuck on a wall or ledge is frustrating occasionally\n-Quicktime events are nonsense (that said, I don't know the alternative for some of those moments)\n-The missions where you have to free the slaves are too numerous and repetitive\n-A broken achievement (you will obey) was a little frustrating.\n\nConclusion:\nI fully recommend Shadows of Mordor as one of the most important and excellent games to play this year.","September 30, 2014","true","27.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

It takes place between the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, with Sauron coming back to Mordor as the backdrop for the plot.  Enough Tolkien to immerse yourself in, without it completely destroying the lore to make a playable game.  Don't get me wrong, there will be several WTF moments where it appears to go directly (or indirectly) against the mythos of Middle Earth. Generally speaking, however, it is excellently done, and you can tell the creators had a love of Middle Earth.\n\nAs has been mentioned before, the gameplay is combination of Batman: Arkham Whatever and Assassin's Crap.  The fighting mechanics are lifted almost directly from Batman, and I consider that a good thing.  My only gripe is that the combat is a bit easy, and although you will die, towards the end of the game death will only occur if you're just not paying attention.  The final mission was a blast, although the final boss was a let down.  (When you can tackle 30+ orcs at a time, how do you make a 1:1 fight interesting?  I don't know, and neither did the developers).\n\nThe game takes awhile to complete if you aim for all the side missions.  I rarely felt bored or like I was wasting time when going after the side missions, and the main missions were well scripted, interesting, and thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nIf you're a Tolkien fan, you'll love this game.  If you're not a Tolkien fan, well...I don't know what's wrong with you.","February 2, 2015","true","102.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However to me it is worth praise.\n\nThe developers have found the way to make this games story smooth, dark (a welcome addition to a lotr world) and wrapped it up nicely showing us for more to come. From the discussions I observed, the hate for the story, which is usually number 1 argument for people that dislike Shadow of Mordor, come from people that- 1. Have not played the game. 2. Are mindless trolls. 3. Are children. Without much spoil it is unique in this plot, that you the to be-deadman is revived as a vengeance thirsty ranger to partake an adventure with a wraith that has merged with you, and like your guide or your Virgil, that  ghost rival of Sauron, guides you through your  journey of Mordor.\n\nThe voice acting is top notch, and deserves a medal. Artifacts you find have listenable memories, Uruks chatter, sing, banter among each other, heck even on the loading screen you can hear pieces of dialogues take place.\n\nThe nemesis system, something new and unique. Your each enemy is made real with a personality, a name, appearance, motives, fears, strengths, and witty one-liners.\n\nThe combat system offers much choice in your style of rampaging massacres. Bow, dagger, sword, maybe riding on top of a caragor or a graug? Or a little of everything?\n\nThe power up in this game is up to you. You start weak.  Apart from some of the skills that unlock with the story as it goes, you the player can get nearly invinsible as you progress, depending on how many side missions you have done or how many uruks you have killed, and also depending on the runes you equip.\n\nThe good priced  season pass includes alot of extra content, making sure you find more than 50+ hours here.\n\nVerdict- Something unique and refreshing, give it a try.","January 15, 2015","true","69.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has an interesting enough story to keep you going but the true star of the shows are the gameplay, which is a mixture of the Batman and Assassin Creed games, and the Nemesis system. The Nemesis system is what really sets this game apart from any other game before it, there is something very powerful in seeing these no longer random nameless orcs rise up in the ranks because they killed you and now it’s become personal why you want to take them down.","January 5, 2015","true","33.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game was a blast.\n\nStory-\nThe story is short but good, i was engaged the whole time and wanted to see what would happen next.\n\nModels/Animations-\nCharacter animations and modles are very well done when it comes to the orcs you fight. Every little detail to the face was animated and moveing giving the orcs emotion and sometimes making them down right creepy. The main character you play as could of had a better face model but since you play him with his back to you this doesnt realy matter. ;D\n\nCombat/Movement-\nThe combat is much like the Batman game series. You can counter/stun when an enemy attacks, flip over enemies to bulky for the frontal approch, and there is a hit counter that can trigger instant kill moves on any enemy. Movement is also like Batman again but with some Asssassins Creed mixed in. Though climbing is faster in this game then in AC.\n\nAbilities-\nYou start of with minimal abilities like you would expect, but slowly unlock and grow your arsenal to become a ghost god basicly. Some abilities are unlocked threw the story only and there are two different skill trees. Ranger which focuses more on the realistic way to fight and the Raith which uses your ghostly power to take down your enemies in horrificly gruesome ways.\nYou can also upgrade your weapons with Runes to give them specific effects or traits. Makes for interesting combinations.\n\nConclusion-\nI very much enjoyed seeing the story behind the Rings of Power and who made them. Cant wait for the next game to see the story continue from the cliff drop ending.\n\nPros-\nGood story\nGraphics\nCombat/Fighting\nEnemy diversity\nAnimations\n\nCons-\nNeeds different locations\nSomewhat small maps\nShort Story","February 1, 2015","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All wrapped in the gorgeous and unforgiving dangerous setting of Mordor. This game is truely gold and everyone who has ever played any of the three series of games i mentioned will have a blast with Shadow Of Mordor. I enjoyed the nemesis system which brought purpose and replayability to the game. The extremely violent combat gave me a rush, especially when taking over outposts and capturing warchiefs.\n\nCons\nThe shortcomings are limited but still need to be noted. at times it was hard to control Talion. A few times he wouldn't climb up unless i went down and back up again. The camera, though 90% on point, would sometimes make things hard to see in tight areas. But the main thing that annoyed me was the nemesis system getting in the way of itself and gameplay. Almost everytime i went to capture a warchief, there would be other captains that would see me and then the nemesis system would direct my screen away from Talion and to the captain for his quick speech saying he has seen me before. Though the system is great and above all other games' AI, it sometimes got in the way especially during intense battles where every move counts and the flow of the combat means everything, just to be thrown off by the nemesis system kicking in. It didnt ruin the game at all, but was annoying.\n\nVerdict\nThe few problems i had didnt turn me off to the game. it remains to be one of my favorite, definitely my top pick for games released in 2014. i only found one small glitch that made a few of the walls bright neon colors but that was literally the only glitch and it was during free roam so it didnt hurt gameplay. Overall i give the game a 9/10 simply for being able to blend 3 game mechanics from 3 different games into one beautiful looking game with plenty of satisfying gameplay. its not a 10 just for the nemesis system getting in the way of itself. Also not a 10 for the reason ill explain in the spoiler section.\n\n\n\n\n\nSPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ni felt the ending of the game was so build out through my 30 hour gameplay. the story of him avenging his family's death was so compelling, even if not unique. His friendship with the hunter and queen. all very well done but i feel like Mordor needed....well more Mordor. the world seemed a little bland and the story needed more scenes like when Talion and his minions stormed the gates, that was exciting and had such a Lord Of The Rings feel! one big team against another in an all out fight in an open field. I loved that part but it only lasted a few minutes. Also the end we so built up just to be a quick time event where you hit a few buttons and beat the dark lord!!! common!! Ive been wanting to fight him since i first watched LOTR!!!! i wanted a real awesome boss fight. the only real boss fight was in the cave with the hunter. but the ending did leave with sort of a cliff hanger, hopefully a second game will bring a more exciting setting, boss fights and epic moments of two teams just clashing in all out warfare!!! other than that, everything the game did, it did it right. it was fun and now i still have 63.5% left in the game even after the main story!. plenty of fun packed in, a real joy to play.","January 8, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics are simple to learn, yet challenging. The Bosses system is fun and intuitive, combat is very well made, the story opens up some of the middle earth lore that you would not be able to know without the books.\n\nIf you are thinking of buying this game, i definitely advise you to do it, you won't be dissapointed. Getting the season pass is up to you, depending on how much time you have to play and how much you like the game, it is a decision that you should make after playing a few hours and see how you cope. I myself haven't purchased it, but as soon as my campaign finishes, i plan on getting the DLC content separately (there is still only one DLC for 6.99£, and season pass is at the moment for 19.90£)\n\n","January 14, 2015","true","24.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Add to that the Nemesis system and this game instantly becomes contender for GOTY 2014.\n\nI recommend this to all fans of hack'n'slash genres, but it can be played by anyone, since the combat is fairly simplified and forgiving, unless you use Death Threat and try to take the target head-on.\n\nI have had a blast playing this, and I am sure many others did the same. If you want to play a real action game, don't hesitate and buy this, totally worth the money.\n\nPS: Getting the Season Pass makes life easier thanks to the Legendary Runes you get.","January 14, 2015","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And they're all pretty spot on.  Mix between Arkham City and Assassin's Creed with a Middle Earth back drop.  That orc has been flogged.\n\nI'm just going to mention the two things I liked the most becuase they really are worth mentioning.\n\nFirst, the Vendetta system.  A system that allows you to take on an Uruk Captain that has killed another player or players. I avenged some Brazilian guy whos handle was something along the lines of ♥♥♥♥♥ Rocker.  Avenging ♥♥♥♥♥ Rocker's death made me feel really good about myself....  Viva la ♥♥♥♥♥ Rocker\n\nSecond, the enemy models.  Going into this game (besides some animal types) I knew I was going to be fighting pretty much nothing but Uruks (Orcs, gobs, etc).  So I expected to be seeing a ton of clones.  Seeing tons of the same model over and over again has always irritated the ♥♥♥♥ out of me in games (a blemesh on the other wise great Bioshock series).    So I prepared myself for an onslought of what might as well have been a clone army.  But to my surprise the character model variations (and the models themselves) in this game are fantastic.  I'm guessing the developers had a kind of mix and match system working on the fly for the enemy models becuase you harldy ever see the same looking Orc twice.  Some are fat, some skinny.  Some tall ones, short ones (insert ♥♥♥♥♥ joke here).  Bluish skinned, grey skinned, green skinned.  Giant yellow eyes, small beedy blue eyes.  And the more powerful Captains all look even more distinct with unique names, varying helmets, armour, different swords and crossbows etc etc. They even have different fighting personalities and the War Chiefs (the elite Captains) always have some parting words for you before they go.  I remember this specifically becuase one of them (right before I displaced his head from his torso) said something along the lines of, "You enjoy the killing...  You're the same as us.  A murderer).  That stuck with me.  Never had something a random NPC said stick with me like that.  Anyway, fantastic variation system.  Every game that involves the slaughter of wholesale baddies should have one just like it.\n\nSo yeah.  Its a good game, I recommend it.","January 15, 2015","true","42.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
