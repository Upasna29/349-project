Tearing it from the grasp of the species around me. What I couldn't buy with money I bought with the blood of the innocent.\n\nMy empire was pure; only the clean survived. My empire was strong; I sifted the weak away like chaff. My empire was vast; we spread our might to the farthest corners of the galaxy.\n\nWe were a people of pure war. Gunfire was our music, the smell of smoke and charred flesh was the sweetest of aromas, and the site of corpses and ruins was the most beautiful sight there was. The universe was our canvas and we painted it with blood. Death was our peace and destruction was our prosperity.\n\nWe made petty alliances with the other, impure species in the galaxy. We used them to do our bidding. The smiled as they went to their deaths. Then while they were busy, we claimed what was rightfully ours. We tore down their homes and slaughtered their people. It was but mere amusment to the wars we had seen. Just something to pass the time.\n\nOthers we waisted no time with. They were too unclean to be bothered with. They were dirt and we were to clean the universe. We were to scrub their impurity out of the fabric of space and time. Some species fought back, their fights were mightier than others, but still nothing compared to our vast power.\n\nSoon we met the grox, a mighty empire that had claimed the center of the universe. The center of a universe that belonged to us. We waged war. And we do to this day... but that is what we want. After all this time, we met an empire that would wage war on us eternally. And so, our galactic history turned into a galactic love story. A story of two empire who have fallen in love with the war they wage on each other.\n\n10/10\n\nWill recomend to the corpses of my enemies.","September 15, 2015","true","34.9"," 685 of 723 people (95%) found this review helpful 625 people found this review funny","95","685","723","625","29"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lakerkb25/recommended/17390/","lakerkb25","Loker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lakerkb25/","300 products in account","An asteroid hurdles through space, speeding past alien spacecraft who follow it, attempting to scan it for any life. Within seconds, the asteroid is out of sight, and enters the orbit of a planet. Catching fire, it slams into the ground, creating a crater from the impact. Hundreds of small fragments explode from the asteroid, scattering themselves around the planet. Some land by cities of sophisticated, lizard-like beigns, others by curious tribes who begin worshipping the fiery rocks, and by clueless creatures who poke and lick them. One particular fragment lands in a small pool of water, and you crawl out - a small, slithery cell who's main goal is to survive.\nThis is Spore, the tale of how your microscopic race can go from scavengers getting enough food to barely survive, to a thriving empire that controls the entire galaxy. The game is based on five stages: Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, and Space. Cell station is where your journey begins. There is little customization in this stage, except for the basic shape of your cell and organelles. Once you become the top of the food chain, you evolve legs. Stumbling onto land, you enter the Creature Stage.\nHere is where the true customization takes place. You can collect various parts from skeletons scattered around the planet and add them to your creature. You can make a huge, strong behemoth who crushes his enemies with his gigantic claws, or a small, nimble beign that flies and steals food from his enemies before they notice he is there. You can create your creature based on your species' diet: omnivore, carnivore, or herbivore. Besides the customization, Creature Stage introduces a huge skill in the game that is incredibly useful - friends and foes.\nYou can choose whether to impress other races and become friends, or attempt to destroy and annhilate them. You have to be wise as to who you attack and who you ally; making enemies with all the weak creatures could end up with them evolving into way stronger creatures and destroying YOU. Once your brain has increased, your species can begin laying out the foundations for a tribe. Here is where the friends and foes system comes into major effect. To complete the Tribal Stage and become a civilization, you must complete your Tribe Totem Pole. For every tribe you defeat or ally, a new totem is added. This stage goes by rather fast, and prepares you for Civilizational Stage.\nCivilization Stage takes inspiration from Sid Meier's Civilization series. Your goal is to control every city on the planet, whether through religious, economic, or military means. Religious races can convert the race into believing your civilization is their leader, and is considered the easiest way to complete the stage. Military is just brute force; when it comes to the guns in this, size DOES matter. Economic is peaceful; you start a trade route with a friendly city and eventually buy their city from them. This takes longer than the other two ways but can be very helpful in the long run.\nOnce you control the planet, you can launch a space project, starting the Space Stage, which is endless. All the choices you've made in the previous stages add up to decide what class you are in the Space Stage - perhaps a battle-crazed tyrant, or a religious zealot out to convert everyone to the teachings of Spode. During the stage, your goal is to go from the Captain of your Space Project to the Omnipotent Beign of the Universe. On the way, you'll encounter the Grox - a cyborg race who hate all and arguably are the antagonists of the game. (If hours of work are put into it, you could make them your ally- if you ever do, I commend you for your bravery.) Between space pirates, colonizing other planets, upgrading your fleet, and stabalizing your funds, this is by far my favorite stage. Overall, this is a great game for creative people and truly lets your imagination soar.\n\nGraphics: 16/20\nStory: 17/20\nGameplay: 20/20\nReplayability: 19/20\nSoundtrack: 18/20\nOverall: 90/100","May 19, 2014","true","68.7"," 649 of 743 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","649","743","0","14"

From the cell stage through to the space age, it keeps being fun. It is cute, appropriate for young children, can be challenging if played on harder difficulty settings, and offers you a literal galaxy's worth of content. I once spent over a year playing this game frequenly and barely put a dent in my expansion of the Universe. Making every planet mine, and every world a Tier 3 world was my dream, and the universe is so large, I don't think one person alone can do it, but it sure was fun to try. The addon content, Galactic Adventures as well as Creepy and Cute add more dimension and choice to the game, as well as some new content. One of the most exciting things about Spore is that you can create your own species at every stage, and shape them into whatever or whoever you want them to be.","October 12, 2015","true","39.9"," 201 of 216 people (93%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","93","201","216","25","0"

ABSOLUTE POWER OVER THE ENTIRE GALAXY! if I play my cards right.\nEvery stage of this game is good fun. I abolutely love this game.\n\nMy only complaint is that in the final stage of the game your empire becomes soo large that personally dealing with every little thing and trying to handle the spice trading for your entire empire with your one player controlled ship really started sucking. I wanted to be able to Age of Empires style delagate responsibilities to computer controlled characters. like trading, like military action, like colonization. I wanted to end up being the emperor who could just watch the empire I had built continue to grow, and spread, and take everything over everything. After the setup and planning you do in the first stages of the game, only require minimal player interaction, which would leave me (the emperor) the freedom to go do whatever I wanted. (like finding galactic adventures and lvling my captain. that was fun.)\n\nThat said, this game is fun and totally worth the cost. Its just not made to allow you to be able take over the galaxy to the scale that I had wanted, in other words its sort of soft-capped out.

Hands down one of my favorite games, But this little gem has its flaws and its perfections.\n\nSpore, i can easily say is one of those games which you can let your imagination run wild, make whatever you like, And isnt too complex. So its easy to pick up and learn. Plus the main game, besides the Creature/Building/Vehicle creator, Is pretty fun too; evolving from a simple cell, into a complex creature, then into a tribe, into a nation, and lastly, into a vast empire in space. The replay value of this game can be high, Depends how much you liked the game.\n\nNow as for its flaws... The game has its bug, sure all games have their bugs. But Spore has had some unusual ones. Before i had the game on steam, I owned up to three copies of spore. All stopped working after some time. Each one having a strange error prior to just dying, The last copy i had affected Space Stage, Every Empire, Planet, Solar System, and Galactic Formation were all named 'BADDATA'. Now does this affect the steam version of Spore? I dunno, hasnt happened yet and i dont see anyone else complaining about it. As for some problems that i see with Spore on steam; The game does crash often, and with almost all games that crash often, The game isnt good with autosaves, And if im correct only saves once you get to the next stage. So this can easily set you really far back in Space stage, Sometimes making it not too fun to play. Plus there is the price. The game is kinda dated, and has some problems, So it isnt worth the $20.\n\nSo if its on sale, Go buy this game, im sure it will be an experience.\nNow if its not on sale, Get something that you may want instead, unless you really want Spore. then get Spore.","November 30, 2013","true","44.7"," 250 of 311 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","250","311","0","23"

While i can see why it frustrated a lot of people by taking the relatively cutesy path rather than being a genuine look into genetically creating different creatures, it still gives you a huge amount of options when it comes to making your own creations. The second level is where you really get to flex your creativity and is without doubt the best level in the game. It does rather tail off as you get further into it, especially the fifth stage (space travel), but when you feel like a break from the missions themselves, you can simply head back into the creature creation section and create an entire planet's worth of creatures. If you should find this at a sale price, i would recommend it then, but at full price... maybe not.","October 1, 2013","true","11.2"," 212 of 259 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","212","259","0","1"

The graphics are really nice and the animals are cute....most of the time...\n\nI also love the feature that your behavior effects your reputation as a species, you might be a vicious killer, or a very social creature that likes friends.\n\nUnfortunatly, personally I find the extreme change of gamplay a little boring.

I LOVE going through the Cell stage and then playing through the Creature stage (4.5 out of 5 stars to that point).  The first night I downloaded the game, I had planned to only play a half hour or so before bed, which turned into 3+ hours and having to be harrassed by my husband to finally shut down the notebook.  I was starting to become an addict already!\nAnd then the Tribal phase happened.\nThere is a very natural flow between the Cell and Creature stages, with a little more complexity added when you begin to move the camera around.  The game is entirely at your own pace and you aren't penalized for taking your time to explore, look for additional parts, or make more friends.  It's truly a casual game.  And then Tribal turns the game entirely into a Tower Defense game where you have to control multiple units and every minute you spend trying to build a strategy is held against you as the other tribes start to hate you more, attack your village, and steal your food.  To add to the fun, the interface is confusing and unintuitive.  At that point, the game fell to 3 out of 5.\nI've made it through Tribal once and into the City/Civilization stage.  And that is as far as I'll ever go in this game.  The Cell and Creature stages have lots of replayability, which is why I can still recommend the game despite my obvious dislike of the rest of the stages.  I bought this game when it was on sale so I feel like it was a pretty good buy for the parts I enjoy.\n","November 8, 2014","true","18.8"," 134 of 173 people (77%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","77","134","173","11","4"

In fact, I would've liked it more if the animal stage was a lot longer. The way you interact with other animals, the way you take on larger creatures or even epic monsters, the migration patterns of your herd and exploring the wide world is really fun and really engaging.\n\nBut after the animal stage, the game becomes a very basic, very lackluster real-time strategy game. The tribal and civilization stages are nothing more than mash-ups of Age of Empires and Civilization, the only bonus being that you get to design your stuff. There's nothing here that you haven't seen before, from three-choice politics to point-and-click control of armies comprised entirely of a single land vehicle type, which you will no doubt convert to a fleet made entirely of aircraft due to them not being limited as to where they can travel.\n\nBut the biggest letdown was the space stage. Instead of starting at one vessel and working your way to commanding a whole fleet with which to explore and conquer as you see fit, you're stuck with a single ship occassionally accompanied by a few brainless AI ships who are utterly useless against the more powerful space empires and tend to die pretty quickly. Oh, sure, you can upgrade that one ship, but there's no real sense of progress being made.\n\nThe graphics aren't that great, with everything looking about as well polished as that old CG television show Reboot, just with improved animation. If the textures and shapes were a bit more complex it might stand out.\n\nI'd recommend this game only if it's on sale or free for a weekend, because it really isn't worth paying full price for this. It has enough juice for about 1 playthrough, but afterwards I really can't see any reason to go 'round again except to make different choices that will ultimately lead to the same result. But if you take the path of least resistance, you'll end up making the same choices each time.\n\nUltimately, it's a good concept, but the mid-to-late game mechanics really feel uninspired, like too much focus was given to aesthetic customization options rather than gameplay mechanics.","November 21, 2014","false","29.8"," 1,113 of 1,713 people (65%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","65","113","1","22","62"

The design possibilities are nearly limitless.  Creating and messing around briefly as your creatures is really the only great part about this game.  The Cell, Tribal, Civ, and Space stages are mostly just disappointing and tedious.  If you have a day free, you can play all the way from Cell stage to Space stage in a single sitting.  Space is agreeably the worst part of the game sense you are set as a single ship managing your entire empire. (And no expansion fixes that)\n\nI'm pretty upset that they gave up on this franchise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Admiral_Plasma/recommended/17390/","Admiral_Plasma","Dr. Angela Ziegler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Admiral_Plasma/","21 products in account","Spore is by far one of the best sandbox evolution based survival games I've played. Given that I haven't heard of any other games that pursue this kind of playstyle, my review may be slightly biased. You will start off as a single cell that has been brought to your planet by a meteorite. You can choose between playing as a carnivore or an herbivore. In the first stage (Cell) the carnivore is argueably the better choice because there will be plenty of creatures to eat, and you get parts to add to your cell faster this way. The currency in this stage is DNA points, which can be gained by eating plants (herbivore) or meat (carnivore). Once you have filled the progress bar to full, you will advance to the creature stage. In this stage, your cell evolved into a creature and migrates onto land with a group of your species. You are able to add legs and arms in this stage, and can add a filter mouth or jaw in order to make your species into an omnivore. I highly recommend this because you are not stuck with being forced to find animals to kill or migrate to find more fruit to eat. The currency in this stage is the same as the currency in the cell stage, however is gained by allying groups or destroying them. Once you have finished the creature stage through defeating or allying other groups of animals, you will transition to the tribal stage! In this stage you band together with your group and make alliances with other tribes or exterminate them. There is a wide array of tools available to choose from in this stage, from fishing spears, to stone axes, to healing rods. All of them serve various functions and your main currency to purchase these buildings is food. Which can either be gathered from the wild or plundered from enemy villages. Once you have finished the tribal stage, you will advance to the civilization stage! In this stage, the tribes you either destroyed or allied will band together to form your first city! You get to design a lot in this stage. The town hall, factories, houses, entertainment, boats, cars, airplanes! It's all at your fingertips! The main currency in this stage is called Sporebucks. This is earned by selling spice, the hot commodity in spore, which is produced by geysers on your planet. Eventually, other groups of your species will arise with their own cities. You can either choose to ally them, purchase their city through economic means, convert their city through religious means, or force their city into submission through military means. How you played each stage determines which kinds of special abilities that you have. In the civilization stage, the way you played the tribal stage determines whether you are a militant or religious city. How you caputure an enemy city determines its specialization. Or for instance you capture a military city by religious means, you can choose whether it is a military city or a religious city. Once you have achieved total global domination, you will advance to the space stage! Most people dislike the space stage because it's "boring" or "too different from previous stages". I think it is the most fun stage because you can purchase star systems, plant colonies, craft planets to your liking, discover other empires, destroy lesser empires, uplift a species in a lower stage to a higher one, terraform planets that were 150 degrees Celsious to a comfortable 22 degrees, control the spice empire through taking ownership of the high profit spice planets, defeat the evil Grox empire guarding the center of the galaxy, and so much more! People dislike it because it takes so long, but that's the fun of it. You are but a single planet in a galaxy of tens of thousands! Have fun, explore! They've even included the Solar System for you to find (I've found it)! After playing this game for over a week now, I've expanded my empire to a measly 30ish systems. I look forward to conquering the Grox and expanding my fruitful empire to the farthest reaches of the galaxy!\n\ntl;dr A great game with tons of customization as you expand from a cell to a galactic superpower.\n\n10/10","January 1","true","57.4"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","37","41","4","0"

Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIngredients\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar\n3/4 cup sugar\n2 large eggs\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon fine salt\n\nDirections\n1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)\n\n2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.\n\n3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.\n\n4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.\n\n5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.\n\nFor a Rocky Road Bar:\n1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.","January 30","true","69.7"," 70 of 102 people (69%) found this review helpful 101 people found this review funny","69","70","102","101","3"

The goal of this stage is to eat and get bigger until you fill up the meter at the bottom, it's promising but gets boring fast which is just as well because the stage can be over that fast if you want it to be and you can move on to become a proper Spore creature, going into Creature stage.\n\nCreature stage... is the best part of the game. This is the part where you're shown an almost infinite variety and customizability combinations in the creature editor, with all sorts of interesting options and different things. You can make a four or six legged monstrosity with ♥♥♥♥ing spikeballs coming out of it's nose or maybe a ball with a pair of legs and four arms, with a ridiculous variety of hands, mouths, eyes, assortments of weapons and the likes.\n\nAnd if that didn't already appeal to you, on top of all this, you're shown an expansive world with other species which you can befriend or extinct and giant ♥♥♥♥ing creatures you can attempt to slay if you get powerful enough for thrills. And this courses through an ENTIRE PLANET of these other species and massive creatures. This appealed to me so much that I absolutely loved everything about it, it was so thrilling, it was absolutely majestic and wonderful.\n\nBut then comes Tribal stage. Once you're filled on the meter at the bottom and maybe have the full look for your creature that you want, the content was pretty stunted there. Personally, I would have loved to have the whole game be Creature stage, just getting progressively better.\n\nInstead, it's all taken away from you. You're shown an entirely different genre of game in some sadistic attempt to radically change your idea on playing the game. Initially, I dismissed this as EA's standard policy to alienate their entire ♥♥♥♥ing demographic and tried to make sense of it, but no.\n\nYour love that you put into your creature to maybe make it more socially friendly or combat advantageous in Creature stage? Poof. The only things you retain from Creature stage are the actual planet (which is no longer free-roam), the other species on it (now lowered to domestic pets and other rising tribes which are pretty generic and bland) and the look of your creature as well as it's voice and how it moves (like if you have a four-legged creature, it moves the same way it did when you were controlling it yourself, but it's generic and loses it's charm). The whole game turned into this forced, linear pathway that is completely different from what was shown to you earlier.\n\nTribal was pretty short, though. Civilisation stage... Ugh. It introduced an entirely new editor, but it was like it was trying to shoehorn user creativity back into the game, but with no real purpose. The things in Creature stage were actually relevant to the gameplay, like combat and social, with the other idea of it being whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want and it can apply to the actual gameplay, like moving on. While Civilisation stage things do have the element of application to gameplay, it's just less and less content. There's only the coolness in making vehicles. That's it.\n\nSpace stage is another step where the Civilisation stage was going in the first place, you deal in planets instead of nations/cities, you deal with a galaxy instead of a world... It's incredibly boring, though. There's combat segments and some customization, but the game lost all charm for me at this point.\n\n\nBut yes, if you agree with everything I said and want to buy the game, then NEVER progress past Creature stage unless you REALLY want to. It's not that rewarding. Incredible beginning content with incredible mechanics, but really sucks later on.","December 19, 2014","true","10.7"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","0"

At the time I remember looking this game up and seeing its promise for a in-depth evolution system which seemed almost too complicated for me to understand but sure looked fun as hell~\n\nSo I got it on a CD at some point and I remember playing it all night and day. It was a few weeks before I stopped but while playing it I felt like it was missing something, like I was playing half of the game that was promised. At the time I was on end-game stuff which is the spaceship stage (which pretty much never ends). So I started to realize it isn't really complicated and in-depth as it was promised to be. It seems more basic and nothing super advanced.... but I still loved it. Its a shame though because it could of still been something much MUCH bigger if it had more depth. Also apparently some of the Sport EA servers are shut down now so there isn't much of a community for the game now.\n\nTo keep it short...the game is really fun if you like a mixture of RPG, Sims, Strategy games with heavy customization to keep it personal and unique to every person. I highly recommend this game still even if it is a bit dull around the edges.","May 8, 2015","true","0.6"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","38","50","5","2"

But a new Sim game this is not, and this is apparent right from the moment your asteroid fragment breaks apart and you lay eyes on the amoeba-like creature you're going to manifest.At the start, you're prompted to choose between being a carnivore or a herbivore, and that determines whether your little cell starts with a meat-eating jaw or a collection of small tentacle-like appendages for tearing apart microscopic plant matter. You direct your cell around and eat accordingly. Eating and surviving  are the only real objectives for this first section of the game, which plays like an organic blend of fl0w and Pac-Man, and becomes progressively more difficult as your cell becomes multicellular bigger and more complex.Eventually you'll devour enough to grow a (tiny) brain, and advance to the second phase of the game  the creature phase.Immediately taken to the creator, now in 3D your humble little cell can now use a pair of legs. As your new belegged creature wanders landward, with identical friends in tow, you get your first glimpse of your home planet. This phase of the game is more complex, and you must choose between befriending the other species you encounter, and eradicating them from the face of the planet. The latter works similarly to combat in games like World of Warcraft. You've got a set of abilities and when you use an ability, you trigger a cooldown.The third phase the tribal section  works like a small-scale RTS, with resource collecting, unit production and building construction. You must assign villagers various tasks and spend food on hatching new tribe members, or adding to your small pool of buildings. Again you'll meet other tribes, and you'll be forced to choose between allying with them and systematically dismembering them and torching their huts.The entire time you've been playing, the game has tracked your actions and determined various passive and active bonuses for the next part accordingly, and depending on your technique, you'll end up as a military nation, a religious nation or an economic nation.The actual gameplay for this section plays out like a simplified version of Rise of Nations. You capture resource points, build units, and try to take over the other cities with them. The depth lies within the ability to design the layout of the cities, thereby determining how resistant to attacks they are, and how efficient at making money they are. During the final phase of the game, having unified your planet, you once again take control of a single entity and man a spacecraft.here are several introductory missions to get you used to the capabilities of your ship, and before long you're flying between stars and meeting other races. No longer earthbound, you are literally free to do whatever you want. Interaction with other races is much more fleshed out in this section of the game. There are dialogue boxes a la Sid Meier's Civilization where you can choose to trade goods, or take diplomatic actions, and the races each have their own fleshed out personality.In conclusion, Spore is definitely an exciting game in this time of repetitive ideas in an over crowded gaming market. It's not quite an RTS nor an RPG nor a strategy game but one that successfully combines all three genres into an exciting game that works quite well and is complimented with good graphics and a great premise.Overall 9/10.","September 18, 2014","true","15.9"," 60 of 92 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","60","92","4","0"

WELL ITS NOT.\nThis is easily the worst stage in the game, its slow, monotonous, and annoying, the gameplay is shallow as ♥♥♥♥, the thing feels so much longer than it really is and it just sucks, you can kill other tribes (Once again, ♥♥♥♥ about PETA), and creatures, (PETA)advance as a soicitey, claim some tiki things, make babies, but all of it is executed poorly, its not unplayable, but its not fun either.\nRating:5/10  below average\n\nStage 4: OH GOD ITS A RTS AGAIN WH- oh nevermind this is done well.\nYep, I LIKE the civilization stage even tough most hate it and even tough i hated the tribal stage, you are probably very confused right now but allow me to explain.

The civilization stage takes place during your species era of civilization holy ♥♥♥♥ mind blown more specificly around the time of it where we live in, you start with a rover thingamajiger and make it get spice, then ♥♥♥♥ gets intresting now in this stage, this might shock you but........... its worth not just killing everything  YOU TRATIOR YOU WORK WITH PETA DONT YOU?! ok the PETA  thing dosent make much sense here, we would proably not consider these animals now that they are as far as humans, now you can do THREE things with other members of your own species, including kill (holy ♥♥♥♥ they really are becoming like humans), join up with, and buy out others (Facebook would be proud), you see, buying out is pretty much the best thing to do, how I do it is, make money, buy or join others, use their ♥♥♥♥ to add to mine and ♥♥♥♥ up a weaker group, buy and join some others to get even stronger, rince and repeat till total domination. You can build ground attacker aswell as ones that sail the seas, and ones that fly (Best ones, ovbs), Its a very fun stage infact..... I prefer it to the creaure stage (Gets stabbed)\nRating:8/10 very fun\n\nStage 5: The final frontier SPPPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE, Your species enters the Omnicide space age and goes into space to do space things, you start off getting into your ship and riding around for a little while, upducting some hazardous ♥♥♥♥, disposing of it, saving your city, then you go into SPACE! Its time, this is easily the most in depth stage, and im too lazy too go too in-depth, What? Didnt you see the length for the 4th stage reveiw thing? this one in-depth would be MULTIPLE times longer, ♥♥♥♥ that. So heres the shorter version, you encounter many other species and using your ship and its ♥♥♥♥ton of gadgets you kill, team up with, steal from, do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want with them (Unless you get rekt). Now in this stage there is some STORY, Holy ♥♥♥♥ right? There are creatures called the Grox who are, well... evil, and they kill ♥♥♥♥ and are all big bad yadda yadda, so you become stronger, go to barren planets, harvest spice, spread your people, join other species, killt them, and its all on a ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE map, Near the center of the galaxy is where the grox reside and MAN they dont ♥♥♥♥ around, finding routes to the center while being attacked by legions of ships kicking thy ♥♥♥♥ is VERY tough, you must be very srategic, powerful, and get lucky with where routes lead, or ya know you could just join em, in the end you can reach the center and theres some ♥♥♥♥ about humans IDK.\nRating:9/10 Super amazing and easily the highlight of the entire game\n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10\nThe game has its moments, and those moments are great, and it has some okay moments, it also has the tribal stage......................... as a whole the game is good and worth your time, I reccomend\n\nAlso holy ♥♥♥♥, i stopped playing at exactly 42 hours, talk about a coincedence.","August 15, 2015","true","42.0"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","20","23","13","0"

to gain their allegiance (apparently Doughball! is misspelt without the exclamation mark) and so after missions from the aliens and my own race (one of which was terraforming a planet) I set up a trade route and an alliance.However, my only complaint about the space age is that after the game spends so long increasing the scale, you end up playing as a captain on a random ship.The best part is going down onto planets that aren't spacefaring and just straight-up abducting people.On top of that, you unlock crop circles and can just zap them onto planets.I kept going to Civilization Stage planets and using the crop circle tool to fuel any alien conspiracy theorists that may/may not exist.\n\nAnd that is how you go from spermdog to galactic god in less than three days.","March 16, 2015","true","21.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","14","16","8","0"

When you first start playing, your first reaction is usually, "Awwww! It's so cute!" or, "Oh my god It's going to eat me!" Let me say that this game is very realistic, and if you love animals, or "creatures" you should surely choose to be an herbivore. You choose from Carnivore, Herbivore, and Omnivore. Sometimes you'll say, "Ugh, there's too much going on!" or, "Give me a break!" But in the end things will calm down and you will begin enjoying the game a lot more once you get the hang of it and what to do and what not to do...the easiest way, and the hardest way. Once you get to space though, the game's pace slows down considerably. You get into kind of a routine and begin doing the same thing over and over again. Some quit at that point, and just keep creating games and stopping at space, but if you get past the more boring or slow-paced parts, it gets fun and "not-so-boring." All in all, if you like a game with plenty of chances to show off your creativity, I would definitely recommend this game.","December 25, 2013","true","37.8"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KomputerKid/recommended/17390/","KomputerKid","KomputerKid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KomputerKid/","70 products in account","I love this game. I originally got the boxed version of it for Christmas a few years ago. Last year I got a new PC, and unfortunately my CD would no longer work. I am so glad that steam had this, as the steam version of this game is essentially DRM Free (Steam is the DRM in this case.) And now I can install it on as many Windows PCs as I want. Unfortunately there is no Mac version, like the boxed edition has. So if you have a Mac, you need to use the boxed version, or the origin version, which has the DRM unfortuneately.\n\nThe only cons I can think of with this version at least, are sometimes, when you die in the creature stage, the game crashes (only happens after you move nests for the first time, but seems to stop happening once you have a big enough brain to advance to tribal.) And the game may crash when you are placing buildings in your cities in the Civilization or Space Stage. (Usually this only happens in space, when you have LARGE empire, and even then it isn't too killing. Just save before placing buildings.)\n\nNow for a list of Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\nVery Robust gameplay. 5 stages, Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, Space. I like each of them a lot, but I feel that the Tribe and Civilization stages are waay to short. In the Cell Stage, you are a Cell, and you need to eat, and evolve. In the Creature stage, you are a Creature, and your goal is to develop your brain, while at the same time collecting parts, and improving your Creature. The Tribe and Civilization stages play more like an RTS, and your goal is to dominate all the tribes and civilizations. In the space stage, it is essentially an open-ended sandbox, and you can do pretty much whatever you want. The only downside is you don't have unlimited money, so it isn't a TRUE sandbox.\n\nAttention to detail. This game looks quite realistic, but still has that cartoony feel to it. The Water looks very similar to real life water, especially when the sun is reflecting off of it. Creatures, and Plants, with certain paint coats, will also have the sun reflect off of it, and it looks quite pretty. There are also Nebula, and even Supernovas (Which is just eye candy, no stars actually blow up.)\n\nReplayability. There are 10 different archetypes in space stage, and each has a unique superpower. The possibilities to get all archetypes are practically endless. The archetypes are, Warrior, Shaman, Trader, Ecologist, Scientist, Knight, Zealot, Diplomat, Bard, and Wanderer. Each has a unique super power, and if you have galatic adventures, can obtain the other super powers via adventures, without losing your current super power. (with the exception of knights and wanderers. The Knight Super Power is impossible to acheive via galactic adventures, only through evolution. And Wanderers do not have a superpower, as that is the archetype you get for starting in space.)\n\nCons:\n\nThe only one I can think of is the one I listed before, where the game may crash on death in the creature stage, or when building buildings in the Civ or Space Stage. Both are minor, and as long as you save frequently, you should be okay.\n\nOh... and EA has abandoned this game unfortunately. They're too proud of the new Sim City, and the Sims 4 to even consider fixing this game, or making a sequel to this game, which really sucks. In America the servers for this game, are suprisingly still up, but AFAIK the European servers went down, but the Asian and Oceania servers are still up too I think.\n\n","April 18, 2015","true","217.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/recommended/17390/","turinwing","Perdix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/","148 products in account","TL;DR : This is not a game; it's an environment in which you can admire your creature-making and vehicle-making skills in cool situations.  It's very repetetive, but the scope of the game allows for it to be somehow addictive once you reach the space-age.  So yeah, it's great for very casual gamers, but anyone who wants to experience interesting gameplay will find this game lacking.  Pick it up if it's a couple quid, but I wouldn't pay full-price for it.  Also, ignore the expansion packs.\n\nThis isn't really one cohesive game, but a series of mini-games, so I'll just review each one seperately:\n\nCellular Stage:\nNo fun at all, but it's designed as a tutorial to introduce you to the creature-creation and DNA mechanics; swim towards stuff in 2D to get points once your creature auto-eats it - other creatures for 'bad'/'carnivore' points, plants for 'good'/'herbivore' points; a mixture for 'neutral'/'omnivore' points.\n\nCreature Stage:\nLike the cellular stage, but 3D, and to get the 'good' points, you have to sing, dance and pose your way into getting other creatures to like you.  Creature customisation gets real here and you spend most of your time wandering around picking up skeletons to unlock new parts.  This is the most boring stage IMHO due to it's repetition.\n\nTribal Stage:\nExactly like the creature stage apart from instead of unlocking new parts, you unlock buildings to give you weapons to kill, or instruments to win over other tribes; it's only less boring than the creature stage because it passes much more quickly.\n\nCivilisation Stage:\nThe overall point of this stage is the same as the tribal stage, but you also get to design vehicles (land / sea / air) and buildings - as the modelling is the most fun part of the whole game, this is real fun.  You have a -little- bit of resource management as when you're putting the buildings in your city, there's an optimal pattern. It also introduces the 'diplomacy' mechanic which is basically 'get people to like you by giving them money, and then ask them to give you everything they own'.  This bit goes by in a flash, but that's good because the most fun part is...\n\nSpace Stage:\nThis is basically where you apply everything at once - you build spaceships, buildings, vehicles, and even new creatures (once you get the 'creature tweaker' tool for your spaceship).  You can basically take over the whole galaxy by terraforming each planet and putting down colonies...which is fun and satisfying for the first few times, but once you get your first million bucks everything becomes VERY easy and the game stops being fun to play.\n\nIt doesn't stop being addictive, however, because you still find yourself saying things like "If I make my main spaceship look like a star destroyer, can I try and befriend every other alien race who's ships are TIE-fighters so I can fly around with an Imperial fleet?" and you spend the next several hours exploring the galaxy finding / uplifting new races; or you set yourself the task of entirely wiping out the 'big bad' Grox...which I think is impossible, but still.\n\nSo yeah, I mean...it's a really great casual game, but if you're after any depth at all you will end up disappointed.  It is very cool flying around in an X-Wing though, and painting every planet white...and setting the ground units to imperial walkers and the air-units to Snow Speeders so you can re-enact the battle of Hoth...","June 8, 2014","true","19.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","7"

I genuinely enjoyed the beginning stages of the game, but that rush progressively became less and less enchanting with each progressing age.\n\nThe game is essentially 4 mini-games strung together with 1 giant never-ending game at the end. You start out as a single-cell organism struggling for survival in a world of eat-or-be-eaten. It's a nice, relaxing evolution game, and to be honest, I would have been perfectly fine if the majority of the game was like this. But this age is over all too soon and you'll find yourself on taking your first steps on land.\n\nAs a terrestrial creature, new challenges arise. It's time to make friends, kill enemies, fight for survival, and forage for food. It's a good progression from the cell stage an it's kind of fun, but not as much as the previous age. Soon, your species will propogate to the point of having their own town. Around this point the game feels like a stripped-down RTS game. You gather resources, forge alliances, crush clans, and expand. It's a rather awkward stage and the gameplay itself is also so radically different that it almost feels out of place.\n\nThe civlization stage is similar to the tribal stage, but you have entire cities and vehicles to do your bidding. Rather than playing like an RTS game, now it feels like a stripped-down Civlization game. You get to do some major customization now, but it's all cosmetic. As you near the end of the stage, the time comes to launch your first rocket.\n\nThe Space Age makes up the bulk of the game. Now a space-faring race, you do pretty much what you were doing before but on a much grander scale. Hundreds of planets to explore, most of them look the same-ish, and to be honest, this is easily the most boring part of the game. Play as a Fedex service, do some feng shui on planets, become a trader, there's so much to do in this stage... and yet there's no real goal, other than than reaching a certain part of the galaxy, but the game will still go on regardless.\n\nOverall, Spore is... difficult for me to rate. The parts I liked, I liked a lot. The parts I disliked, I got bored to tears. What began as a fun evolution game ultimately ends up as a chore. The amount of micromanagement magnifies tenfold with each passing stage, and since the game changes radically with each stage, it's constantly throwing new stuff at you, while simultaneously rendering old knowledge irrelevant. I'm sure many people enjoy the endgame, but definitely not me. I give this a 7/10.\n","August 24, 2015","true","21.8"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theivanator/recommended/17390/","theivanator","Ivan Ivanovich Ivanowsky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theivanator/","79 products in account","If you're gonna get it, get it while it's 5 bucks. That is the price it is really worth, maybe 6. This game is a good stepping-stone for the evolution genre, and a few other indie games are following in it's path if you dig around on the internet. It's the first iteration of a still new genre. You can create a variety of your own creatures in the brilliant creature creator, and the main appeal of this is being able to see other people's creations in your world! Cool right?\n\nWell EA has abandoned this game, so don't expect to see anything cool other than what the game developers put in there. Sometimes you can see your own creations, so that's cool.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the variety of creatures, most of them behave the same way. You a few abilities, ranging from stealth to very limited flying. You can be a herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore.\n\nThe game has 5 stages that are all pretty different, but the game shines in Creature mode, the second stage. Where you control one creature in your species, and evolve it as it gets more sentient. Like I said before, most creatures behave the same way in Creature mode. They all hang around in their nests and hardly interact with eachother, and if they do they don't do it enough. I wanted to see creatures huntings other creatures, and bird-like creatures and bugs, but all I saw was one wandering into an aggressive territory and getting slaughtered. There is no variety of roles in the ecosystem of the game. It's just "Five Boogleborfs hanging around a nest. Kill them or sing at them?" And that's it.\n\nSometimes you see "Epics" which are huge creatures, that are indeed epic. Every once in a while a world event happens, like a meteor shower or a UFO flies by. While cool, they don't mean anything.\n\nThey did a good job of making a world that looks real from far away.

Here you start as a freakin single celled organism.\n\nWhat I love with the early stages of the game is that your creature evolves from that single celled organism to whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want to go with until tribal age.\n\nI must say tribal stage up to space age the game changed for me, you stopped evolving and instead start using clothes.\n\nSpage Age I must say is pretty freakin huge!!! So huge I can't explore it all and that's just a single galaxy.\n\nAs you go further in your own civilization you notice less and less species surround you (extiction is common even in outer space because of sentient beings being ♥♥♥♥♥)\n\nRecommendations:\nYou should grab Galactic Adventures expansion as it becomes bland after exploring different sectors.\nIf you want the online feature to work, put the game product code you have on steam (you can get it on the CD key of your game [library->games->spore->CD key]) and put it on origin (Origin->add game->put the product code).

After playing it again and again i can say that this is a game with much replay value allowing players to experiment with differnt combinations of creature types like becoming an omnivore or becoming a waring civilization or simply making it so your species can finnacially succeed. I can also say that all the different stages add something different to the emersion of gameplay whether your managing food in tribal or designing new vehicles in the civilazation stage.The space stage may seem repetitve and tedious but not only does the rest of the game make up for it but the creators added the Galactic Adventures DLC to make things more interesting. But, as an older games there is expected to be bugs to it graphically or bugs that affect gameplay. The only major one i've come across with my crappy computer was an occasinally crash that shuts the program out. A simple solution is to simply save the game constantly. Besides that there is hours of gameplay that is fun to pick up once and a while. I suggest this to anyone who just wants to play god and screw with life. Even though it says i have only played it for a small amount of time i've been playing it on a seperate file on the DLC for over a hundred hours so listen to some of my advice.","July 30, 2014","true","554.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

No, needed this game.\n\nThis was the game that got me truly into pc gaming (besides StarCraft and Unreal Tornament 1) but the problem was that I didn't have a computer and the money to get it but today. I have the damn thing, finally.\n\nBesides I am way, way out of the time this game was brand new and pretty much this game has a dead community  to make it blunt. Also, still like in middle school, when I read about this game in a review out of a Game Informer in 2004, I find it appealing, interesting and funny still.\n\n(For the sake of lawls, you can be a warmongering herbivore with bowlegged legs that is 10 feet high, with arms without hands and has only ears as "eyes".)\n\nI truthfully love the creative spirit this game brings but the only thing that is lacking is that its so hard to register for a Spore account so you can post up your creatures, look at things other people made, use the different creatures in your game and play as them yourself and more.\n\nSo if you've read up to this point you might think I would recommend this game, right?\n\nWrong. I believe this game is so outdated that EA won't touch it. (Its only 6 years old) So they're just being lazy folks, this game has potenial, STILL! They make it hard for us, the gamers. We just want to get a damn account so we can just share our ideas and creatures on the outdated Spore website (which should be updated anyway!), don't get me wrong though I love this game with a passion but it fails in supporting a gaming community.\n\nFinal Remarks:\nI was sad that EA did this to a awesome game they could of built so much more on, but they killed the hope of what Spore could of became. This game could of had a chain of games like Elder Scrolls but with creating a universe around you. Instead it became what you see in my review, a sad game that EA wants to bury and throw under the games that make them more money. So my dear reader, this game is a 5 out of 10. Its aged badly because no options to change to HD, the Spore website, and other things that just doesn't fit today. If you want a fun game to play thats relativily casual this is your game, but if you want a great community of games on steam and off? This is not for you.\n\n[NOT Recommended]","February 7, 2014","false","34.2"," 38 of 66 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","38","66","2","0"

It may not be as good as I thought it could be. But once I looked past the dissappointment, I realised that there is still a good game here.\n\nLet me get the things that upset me out of the way. The Creature stage seems to last too long with little variation. You either kill everyone around you, or charm them. And charming is a bit confusing, so it always boils down to me killing off races of animals and watching the progress bar rise ever so slightly each time.\n\nSpace stage is practically pointless. I feel that there is no goal in it. Sometimes, there are parts of space you can't  get to because they are just a tiny bit too far away. Cell stage was funner than both of these, which is pretty sad. City Stage is too short. It only lasts an hour and a half, at the most. Which sucks, because it's my favorite stage. You get to command vehicles you created to destroy other cities and conquer them. But the biggest danger in City Stage is turrets, not enemy vehicles.\n\nThat's about it for the things I dislike, so on the the praising for Spore's creativity.\nCREATING THINGS IS GREAT. They made spinoffs based only on the Spore Creators, and there is a reason for that. You can construct creatures ranging from spiders with dolphin heads to dragons with butterfly wings and a human nose. It's great. The Vehicle Creators are my absolute favorite part of the game. I have created Spaceships of every shape and size, and i am proud of them. You will never see the same ship twice, unless someone actually made a duplicate. I feel like the game would be cooler if more people played and interacted, creating new creatures, buildings (oh yeah, you can create buildings. not my favorite.), and vehicles. But that's just me. Maybe? People, join me, i'm lonely.\n\nSpore is not a bad game, as long as you are creative and can deal with a bit of boring gameplay early on. You can create endless creatures, vehicles, and building with endless variety. The Tribal and City stages are fun, but short. good thing you can repeat them any time. I give Spore a 6/10, and I do recommend this game.\n(this is my first long review)\n\n","July 7, 2014","true","50.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I highly suggest you save very often or else you'll end up like me and be into the tribal stage when your game crashes and whisks away all your progress down the drain. EA dropped the ball so much that apparently there isn't even an autosave function. This game crashes so much and personally i don't think I'll ever be playing it again. The game itself is very fun as you get to guide the evolution of your species from a single cellular organization all the way to space faring god. EA made a lot of promises about this game that they didn't deliver. So pretty much standard EA behavior.\n\nPros:\n+ Engaging gameplay\n+ Enjoyable & somewhat diverse scenarios\n+ Diversity among creature creations\n+ Looks good for something made in 2008\n+ Lots of unique body parts to chose from\n+ Species specialization (e.g. carnivore, omnivore, herbivore)\n+ Different creatures/species have different "voices" (diversity of creature communications)\n+ Decent job explaining functions of everthing through all stages\n\nCons:\n- Stages of evolution rather short\n- Space stage the longest stage (Dispropotionate compared to other stages)\n- Cannot continue to gain the evolution points to unlock body parts once you complete a stage\n- Only real option once completing a stage is advancing the evolution\n- Rather odd taking over planets in Space stage with your single ship\n- Actually rather odd doing everthing in the Space stage from your single ship\n- Rampant crashes\n- No autosave feature\n- Very few save slots for different worlds\n- Too few stages of evolution\n- Almost zero interaction available during Space stage with nonspace faring civilizations","December 22, 2015","false","27.8"," 38 of 69 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","38","69","2","16"

I remember playing the game way back when and it was quite fun, a decent game overall.  But.... it's EA.. I should've known better to think it was really given any REAL effort.\n\nOne mistake, I'll admit, was my own.  I didn't realize that the game didn't have any autosaving, and you had to save manually.  So when the game crashed, I lost every bit of the game that I'd been playing.\n\nOf course, the fact that having my internet go out for a few seconds caused the game to crash... I hadn't expected that to happen.   Nor did I expect to have to create an origin account for the game.   Nor did I expect to have to spend a half an hour getting it to reset my password because every time it accepted a password when I tried to login it said invalid password. ((luckily I was finally able to get a password that worked by saying something derogatory to the company in it.. they had no problem letting that go through it seems, just not a NORMAL password)).  Nor did I expect to have to reboot my entire computer just to be able to log into their servers.\n\nThe issues are plenty, and now that I've already spent money on it, I've seen quite a few other people on the net that have had problems with it crashing.   Is the game good?   Sure, it can be fun.   But seeing as how EA infrastructure and coding can destroy just about anything.. well.. good luck if you decide to try it.   I hope you have better luck than I.","June 24, 2014","false","0.1"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","4"

You begin as a single cell organsim, happily eating (plants or other organisms, or both!) and eventaully running away or fighting other organisms. As you eat, you gain DNA, which is used to modify your creature, from eyes to appendages used to attack others or defend yourself, and other some modifications that do not require DNA, such as enlarging or reducing the size and shape of your creature, enlongating or shortening your spine, even individual segments of your spine!\n\nAfter you consume enough DNA, you will be able to "find a mate" and change anything you like about your creature, including color, color patterns and layers of color and patterns, and anything else you can imagine. Really, the whole point that Spore really drives home is that your creations are only limited by your imagination. Once enough DNA and parts are gathered you can "evolve" to the next stage of evolution, in this case, evolving legs.\n\nOnce you crawl out of the primordial soup and make landfall, you will have a nest for your species to stay in, and the real adventure begins. You will meet other species and decide if you want to befriend them through either "Impressing" them through song and dance and whatnot, or kill them into extinction. In the next stage of evolution you have a third option to send them gifts, which they may or may not accept. Each decision you make affects the outcome of your creature. Befriending tribes gives you abilities to make it easier to befriend other species in the future, as does killing them, or gifting, the economic solution. Whenever you successfully befriend, or kill a species, you will be rewarded with new parts to help evolve your creature. Many of these at this stage have actual benefits, such as arms with hands that have sharp claws, which will aid you in taking down some of the tougher species, or other parts that boost your ability to sing, dance and otherwise impress other species. As with the previous stage, once you have collected enough DNA through befriending or conquering species, you will advance to the next stage of evolution, Tribal. (NOTE: When you finish creature stage, before you advance to tribal stage you will be given one last chance to change your creature in any way you see fit. Once you enter tribal stage, NO MORE CHANGES CAN BE MADE TO YOUR CREATURE.)\n\nThe tribal stage is arguably the most difficult stage because you really have to begin managing your resources. You have to gather food to feed your tribe, and plenty extra if you plan on gifting to other tribes. You have a village and as with the previous stage, instead of parts, you have buildings in your village that will assist your tribe in your goal. At this point it is a good idea to settle on whether you plan on being a war-mongering military society, a happy-go-lucky religious society (you still sing and dance to befriend other tribes, but in the next stage you basically convert new species to your religion in order to become allies) or an economic powerhouse (in the near future, capable of purchasing entire star systems). Once you have  enough allies or conquor enough tribes, you advance to the next stage, Civilization.\n\nCivilization stage is much like the creature stage, in that it opens up the game into a new level of depth and this time, micro-management. You will discover Spice, the source of all income, and mine the various spice gysers near and far to increase your income (which replaces DNA) and go crazy with creation. Much like your original creature, you can choose from a preset list from Maxis, or if you signed in at the beginning of the game (or at any time for that matter) you can use or modify any creation by any person who has played Spore. Of course, you can also create your own from the ground up, including a Town  Hall, a Factory, Houses, and Entertainment buildings. You can use these in city planning to create a well-balanced city. Too many factories will boost spice processing, but make your city unhappy and easily susceptible to religious attacks, which are much more effective against unhappy cities. Too many entertainment buildings will make your city happy, but your spice production will suffer. You will learn the proper balance with time, experiment and try different things, which is what Spore is all about! Anyway the objective of this stage is to destroy or ally yourself with other rival factions of your species, which has become the single most dominant sentient creature on your planet. Of course you can also establish trade routes with rival cities and eventually be given the option to purchase them, making them as much yours as a city you started with. Again, eventually you will destroy or ally yourself with all the rival factions on your planet, and advance to the final stage, Space.\n\nThis is by far and away the most fun stage in the game, and once you reach space stage with one species, you can start a new species at any stage (Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization, or Space) any time you wish. Your species has advanced enough to begin space flight! From this point, the universe is your oyster! The same ways you haved allied yourself, purchased, or conquered others until now remain the same, although, remember that at least in the beginning of space stage, your species exists on but one planet, whereas other species you meet will be spread across several planets and even start systems! If you want an accurate scope of just how huge this game is, zoom out from your planet, to your start system, complete with other planets, to your local star system cluster to eventually the entire galaxy. Every start system, every planet you see you can visit! You can establish colonies on new worlds to expand your empire, meet new species and decide how to deal with them, do missions for them, hunt for valuable artifacts, and even terraform planets from T0 (No atmosphere, very difficult to sustain a profitable colony) to a T3 oasis, with several booming colonies, ripe for the picking with all different kinds of Spice! From this point you can do whatever, go wherever, whenever you want!\n\nAll in all, if you like creative freedom, an explorative nature, and want to build your own galaxy spanning empire from a single celled organism to the most powerful species in the galaxy, this game is for you! (On a side note, Spore and Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack are completely compatible with Windows 8.1)","July 2, 2014","true","24.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Like, 600+ hours.\n\nAbsolutely love this game, I never stop coming back to play it.\nI will admit, when I first got this game, oh, 4-ish years ago, I was expecting a tad bit more out of it than I saw. Then again, Spore, in and of itself was an INCREDIBLY ambitious game in its early stages. It's not the perfect, all-encompassing game some, like me, might hope it to be, but it is incredibly fun and incredibly challanging on the higher difficulties, ESPECIALLY in space, which is pretty much nigh impossible to completely "finish", lest you have no life whatsoever. It's nice and kid-friendly with the cartoonish creature designs, and the quick gameplay up to the space stage is a boon for casual gamers. But for those of us seeking to conquer the galaxy, and get the real sense of action and adventure, the space stage has enough alien genocides, nuclear explosions, and planet busting for even the most hardcore 4X strategy gamer. It's an enjoyable game with a nice mix of everything and quite a few challenges mixed in. If nothing else, play it for the space stage; probably the best, least mundane part of the game.\n\nThe DLCs add some nice features as well; the new adventure feature in Galactic Adventures adds an interesting new level of complexity and depth to the already complex space stage, and makes nice use of the creature properties you all thought were going to be useless after the creature stage.\n\nSide note, FINALLY managed to make a decent-looking human with the in-game parts - a painful ordeal, to be sure.\n\nOh, and make sure not to ♥♥♥♥ off the Grox if you like your ♥♥♥ where it is.","May 27","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Joguei muito mesmo quando criança (ele é um pouquinho "old" , mas é gold, certeza). Em comparação a outros jogos, ele tem uma temática diferente. Segue a teoria da Evolução, em que você cria um ser vivo e de tempos em tempos ele desenvolve habilidades e suas proles nascem mais inteligentes. Porém Spore é divido em uma espécie de estágios, em que você simula coisas diferentes daquela espécie que você criou (estágios em que você é só uma pobre célula dependente e vivente na água, depois você já se adapta à terra, depois tem uma família, uma população toda  e por fim um planeta - sim você brinca com a galáxia- ). Com Spore você não fica naquela "mesmisse" o tempo todo como The Sims ( e sim, é da mesma empresa desenvolvedora Maxis). Bom, para não ficar com uma descrição muito subjetiva, segue abaixo um vídeo perfeitamente explicativo. Ele te toma meia horinha mas tenha paciência, porque vale a pena (a não ser que você realmente não goste do gênero). Por fim, é um jogo divertidíssimo, fácil de mexer e gostoso de jogar (com deliciosos efeitos sonoros e uma rotação de câmera divina -não que isso seja muita coisa).\nDivirta-se e brinque com a Genética do Darwin  :3\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ag84AuBigE","May 17, 2014","true","4.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","5"

My first 9 hours into the game got me hooked, but once i started space exploration, the game got EXTREMELY boring and repetitive. Sure the galaxy is HUGE and there's soooo much to explore, but after a few hours in space, the same thing happens over and over no matter where you go. The replay value just simply isn't there. I personally bought the game for 12.49 and I will honestly say it's the worst purchase i've made on steam in terms of $$ and hours logged.\n\nEdit: If I had just bought the spore game itself without the expansions/dlc (which would amount to $5 on sale), then i could say the game was worth it. So my recommendation to you guys would be to just buy the $5 spore game and not the entire package.","December 22, 2015","false","14.2"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","19","35","2","0"

After playing it again and again i can say that this is a game with much replay value allowing players to experiment with differnt combinations of creature types like becoming an omnivore or becoming a waring civilization or simply making it so your species can finnacially succeed. I can also say that all the different stages add something different  to the emersion of gameplay whether your managing food in tribal or designing new vehicles in the civilazation stage.The space stage may seem repetitve and tedious but not only does the rest of the game make up for it but the creators added the Galactic Adventures DLC to make things more interesting. But, as an older games there is expected to be bugs to it graphically or bugs that affect gameplay. The only major one i've come across with my crappy computer was an occasinally crash that shuts the program out. A simple solution is to simply save the game constantly. Besides that there is hours of gameplay that is  fun to pick up once and a while. I suggest this to anyone who just wants to play god and screw with life. Even though it says i have only played it for a small amount of time i've been playing it on a seperate file on the DLC for over a hundred hours so listen to some of my advice.","July 29, 2014","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm sure there's a mod for it (haven't actually checked) but the fact that the Devs didn't already put in an auto-save feature actually ruins the game for me.

Keep in mind that it has a lot of nostalgic value to me, so i might give way too many positive points.\nPositive:\nThe Cell Stage: It has a great feeling to it! Like in games like Fishing frenzy, you eat and become bigger, until you can eat things that originally were bigger than you. The stage itself doesnt have a lot of depth. You basically eat or be eaten. And i'm fine with that.\nAlso, i really like the thought of  millions of years passing while you create your creature and live. I find that appealing. It does also apply to other stages, like:\n\nThe Creature Stage: For me, this is definetely the most fun. And the most defining stage. Here you can choose to be: Herbivore, carnivore or Omnivore(both)! Your choice will affect your playstyle and later game.\n\nHerbivore: Pretty easy! All you need is to go to nearby trees and bushes to collect food and that's it! But another factor in it is: Befriending others. Since your attack damage is not that high, you can't really kill. And killing wouldnt even benefit you. So, to make friends you need to have higher stats in social than the creature and mimic their moves.\n\nCarnivore: The hardest of all 3. You need to hunt others, because you need meat, and only OTHERS HAVE MEAT. This is really straightforward, since you don't have good social skills, better just kill.\n\nOmnivore: THE easiest. This is the definition of "doing what you feel like", you have both social skills AND murderous adaptation! Just do what you feel like, but keep looking at the progress bar to stay in the middle.\n\nThoughts: I LOVE this stage! It really makes you feel like you're inside of it! The creatures, meteor showers and even MOTHA♥♥♥♥IN SPACESHIPS. + i don't know why but i really like seeing Epics [huge creatures with a 1000 hp and kills you in one hit. Fun]\n\nThe Tribal Stage: So, you finished moddeling your creature. As deranged as it looks, it'll stay that way forever. BUT NOW THERE ARE OUTFITS. That's right! You can put outfits which make your attributes greater, for example: a hat, that has 2 COMBAT and 1 GATHERING.\nIn this stage, depending which play style you chose, you play as:\n\nThe social bloke: The guy who befriends everyone. Yes, your tribe is known to be the FRIENDLIEST on the planet! You bring gifts to meanies and you mimic people with instruments that you build huts to in your tribe place thingy! FRIENDS!\n\nThe murderous bloke: Everyone is scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of you. You're known to be the most irrational, murderous tribe on the planet! You build huts for weapons, and you destroy other tribe's huts and kill EVERYONE!\n\nThe whatever bloke: So, you chose omnivore. You're known to be the most irrational on the planet. Sometimes you befriend others playfully with didgeridoos and other times YOU RIP THEIR SPINES OUT WITH AXES AND LIGHT THEIR HOUSES AND CHILDREN ON FIRE WITH TORCHES.\nStill trying to keep in the middle, i guess.\n\nThoughts: I really like this stage! I find it fun, trying to collect food, tame wild animals and fish!\nAlso, alot easier to kill Epics in this stage. Still pretty hard tho.\n\nThe Civilization Stage: So, depending on what you chose, it all came to this, which is:\n\nIf you chose Social (herbivore) you are: A religion civilization!\nThat's right! Your one and only weapon against others is religion! Since you need to capture all cities or you won't advance to the last stage, you need to create your own custom buildings, vehicles! Fun!\n\nIf you chose Aggresive (carnivore} you are: A militaristic civilization!\nYep! Your one and only weapons are...well...weapons! I feel like this is the easiest to play. You pack firepower, and punches. You also need to create custom buildings and vehicles.\n\nIf you chose the middle one (omnivore) you are: A trade civilization!\nYeah! You don't push religion or bullets down people's throats. You collect money, and you just buy other cities! Strangely enough, being omnivore is the hardest in this stage.\n\nThoughts: I also like this one! I love the thought of designing your own vehicles, boats and planes and buildings! I love the thought of being able to follow your own theme or just be incredibly random! Also, this stage is the defining chapter of WHO you are as a civilization. Are you a friendly religion-based society? A murderous bloodthirsty-based society? Or are you rational bussinessmen?\n\nThe Space Stage: This is it! You're at the top of...well, anything! You're free to do what you want, because after this it won't matter, althought how you played earlier affects how you'll play ti'll the end!\n\nFriendly: You get friendly rays and stuff\n\nNot friendly: You get lasers and stuff\n\nMiddle: You get some advantages in money and buying (i think)\n\nThoughts: I LOVE this stage! Your one and only objective is to: spread your empire! There's almost no choice here tho. You WILL have allies even if you're ♥♥♥♥ing insane. And you'll have enemies if you're even the friendliest person in the ♥♥♥♥ing galaxy!\nYou can go abduct animals! Abduct plants! Colonize planets! Change planet temperature to uninhabitable from habitable, or the other way around! This stage defines your mark on the galaxy!\nNegative:\nNo multiplayer\n\nI absolutely ADORE this game! And if you're wondering whether you should buy this, please just listen to me: YES! YES YOU SHOULD. This is honestly an INCREDIBLY unique experience and i absolutely love it!\n\n10/10","January 5","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

It eats almost everything it can.\n\nInvictus goes on to evolve into a beast and causes a mass genocide of other species on the planet.\n\nInvictus makes tribes and then finishes its mass genocide.\n\nNow for the interesting part.\n\nSo, with the Invictus species being the only species left, they are massively split between the usual economic, religious, and militaristic. There are only two militaristic states. Purple (me) and Yellow. The purple state and yellow state are constantly at war until finally the purple state takes over the yellow state. Once these wars are over, on the planet's mainland the other states have been conquered by the massively religious Blues. The blue state then immediately declares war on the purples. The purples then rush to conquer the center island to gain aircraft. They gain aircraft and then start to take the mainland. This basically turns into Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia. Basically, a slaughter for the blues. I make every theocratic city bow down to the great purple power. HAIL!\n\nLong story short, as space is basically the other half the game, I conquer everything by slaughtering everyone and there's only one species left, which is Invictus.

Let your imagination be your guide. You can literally spend 100% of your playing time (like I often do, myself) just designing a multitude of different creatures, vehicles (land, sea, and space) and buildings as well. The game reminded me a lot of Black and White, which I used to play near-obessively when I was younger.\n\nThere's more to the game than just customization and character design, of course. Following the evolutionary story mode itself presents all sorts of interesting scientific, biological, and sociological mechanics. As a gamer, it's the ultimate sense of creative control to supervise and influence a creature's growth and development, along with all the cultural and societal changes that go along with it. It's just so enthralling to raise a creature from infantile stage as a microbe, all the way to a prim-and-proper gentleman of a monster.","July 1, 2014","true","78.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

While Will Wright's original vision of the game was curtailed by EA's desire to rush it out, Spore has a certain charm that I love. When it came to Steam, I decided I needed to buy it again. This and the expansions are really games for people who love to create and create you can! Ships, creatures, builidings, vehicles, planets, missions, and a whole gaxaly's worth of shher fun awaits.\n\nIt's not a "serious" space sim. You have to go into Spore with a sense of humor. It pays a loving if rather quirky tribute to Star Trek and Star Wars and other franchises - there is a HEAVY Hitchhikers CGuide to the Galaxy vibe in Spore. Now, all of that said, the base game is good, but it really shines with the Creature Cereator and goes into warp speed with GalacticAdventures. The latter expansion features on planet missions. There are both Maxis created and user created missions and they range from cute to quite frantic, violent, fast paced affairs.\n\nI realize that Spore received mixed reviews. But bear in mind that these reviews were partly informed by the fact that Will Wright was not given time to complete his vision for this game.\n\nThis game is a guilty pleasure for me amid all the "serious" games I play.  Spore is more of a huge creative playground and it does it better than Minecraft at least for me.","November 17, 2014","true","1.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Even so there was (and still is) a huge amount of delight to be had in raising your creatures from single celled organisms, chosing their skills by rewriting their DNA from generation to generation until they become civilized and then developing them into the endgame (space exploration) via technological advances.\n\nSo why no recommendation?\n\nWell for a start the game is just outright unstable. The general instability just doesn't seem to be fixable. Everywhere I looked I found it was just an accepted side effect of running the game. So it will crash. And it doesn't autosave. So you must save often. And if you screw up and save after it's begun breaking it will destroy that save game and make it forever unloadable. It's also been ditched by EA so it won't be being fixed.\n\nThe actual evolutionary stages (barring the last) are just too plain short. I wanted to spend hours on each stage but you zoom forwards, even if you go the completionist route and stick around until you've done every last thing you can. The combat is not great, the social minigame is read a cue and then press one of four buttons (creature stage) three buttons (tribal stage) oh we got rid of the buttons just click on it already (civ stage)\n\nThe final space stage is huge and is where you will will either spend most of your time, or where you will get quickly fed up and return to the start to create more creatures. There is literally an entire galaxy to take over including a race of extremely unfriendly borg *cough* sorry, I mean Grox towards to the centre. Your creature, that you poured so much time and attention into is replaced by a spaceship and it all gets a bit meh.... Galactic Adventures does try to address this but not well... (I'll deal with that on it's own though).\n\nInitially you will ooooh over the creature creator. Eventually you will be frustrated by it's limitations and the relatively restrictive set of main parts. The inability to set a gender/voice for your creature is most evidenced when you create something female looking and it talks like a brawny guy or something cute and sounds like it's just waiting to eat you for breakfast. There are a huge number of really minor fixes that could have been added to this that would have provided some huge quality of life improvements for this game... but despite them being suggested over and over again when the game's developers were still active, they were unfortunately never addressed.\n\nI still love Spore.

The game has incredible potential, but unfortunately I do not see EA updating the game any time soon as they most likely only added it to Steam to increase sales - not to actually update or improve the game in any way...for example: getting rid of the huge number of bugs. I would not buy this unless it is on sale.\n\nAll flaws aside, Spore is a fantastic God game in which your objective is to guide your alien race through various stages of evolution. I'd even say that the game is eductational to a certain degree. Throughout the game, you will make decisions that will later affect your race in a number of ways.\n\nSpore does an amazing job at allowing the player to take full control of your race, from creating the species step by step, all the way to eventually exploring the galaxy and building relations with other races or decimating them completely. The choices and decisions you're able to make are endless and allow for unique and fun playstyles while you expand your turf throughout space or do whatever else you may wish to do.\n\nAlso, there are llamas.","June 29, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found myself hooked right from the Cell Stage all the way to Galactic Adventures, and from start to finish (well, it is technically endless) the game is fully customisable...limited only by what parts you are given and your own imagination.\nYou want to manage a planet full of 1-eyed, ten-legged, two mouthed, bright pink and yellow monsters? You can do it!\nLike to be friendly, only to turn on your enemies with nuclear weapons later? You can do it!\n\nSecond warning? The Space Stage gets very dull, very quickly, without Galactic Adventures.

At  times, you are the bottom of the food chain, but eat enough, and you can get that satisfying feeling of eating thoses who tried to eat you. Like I said, Feeding Frenzy.\n\nThe creature phase is a lot of fun, simply because you can make your character anything you want, and it still looks ridiculous. It also offers the choice: Aggressive or Social, letting you play your way(as a personal preference, I go neutral).\n\nThe tribal stage is by far my least favorite, but that's personal preference. It plays like starcraft, where you select a group and lead them somewhere by clicking.\n\nThe civilization phase is where decisions have to be made: Will you ally with the red city, or take them over for their resources. It causes quick thinking, and I love it.\n\nThe space phase is immensly fun and funny, wherther it's an alien race offering you an umbrella, or the worshippers of Spode, or the "voice acting" (If you can call it that) Buying galactic adventures adds more to the Space phase, but it's still tons of fun without it.\n\nThe only bugs I've run into are some graphical glitches, which I assume are caused by the shape of my creature.\n\nAll in all, I would say that this game is a must buy.","December 17, 2014","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You start from the cell stage and work your way up to creature, tribal, civil, and space. I found that I much prefer the Creature stage mostly because you can be the animal, stalk your pray (if your a meat eater), tear into their flesh and all that good stuff. I just really enjoy being a savage animal. Once you go into the Tribal stage thats when the RTS part of Spore comes in and some people prefer that but like I said I just enjoy being a savage creature killing anything that isn't my own!\n\n9/10","November 30, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Teras having 5 different series on spore. I've played for nearly 23 hours at the time of creating this and its still entertaining. On the modded side of things the creepy and cute parts pack is not a necesity but its nice to have some lttle peices to have being a cheap-ish price its fine, the Galactic Adventures mod is a must get, after you've played the space stage for a while its a great addition, luckly for me i was able to buy this game for a low price due to the 75% Christmas Discount. I believe this game is well worth the money sadly the error in spore servers makes you opptionally go through a long series of steps to go online, the game overall is great fun and the creativity is too, the player input in to the game is outstanding. At this time Spore is most likely my favourite game. Good bye and good gaming!","January 5","true","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With this setup, the only good thing I can see is that you can destroy an empire more than once for self-satisfaction. The endgame is also lacking in that you cannot explore your terraformed and sculpted wonderplanets, so you have to buy this when the game and Galactic Adventures are at least half price. "Create" mode is like a dumbed-down 3D modelling system.This game consist of various other games that are shortened and lacking as much content placed side-by-side, with your stamp all over the 2008 cartoon graphics. So how can I possibly recommend this game?\n\nBecause this game is satsifying, and it will be satisfying each time you play.\n\nDo yourself a favor and don't go on a wiki until you have played one empire until you are content. Then, go find out all the different paths that you missed, and strive to take them in your next game. You can be a malicious herbivore. You can be\ndemonic in the creature stage and friendy in the tribal stage. You can beg for peace throughout billions of years and make a corrput spice empire. The gameplay is a vessel for the stories you create in your mind, much like Dungeons and Dragons, and if you find it too easy then raise the difficulty. Ignoring what this could have been and seeing what's here is the key to his game.

Its brings out the creativity in people's mind and is very vast in the styles you can use for your creature and engines/cars. The one thing that I do not like about the game is that it forces you do follow to story line and dosen't let you really stay in a certain stage very long. You also go throw the stages really fast and I would rather stay in the creature stages more when you get to control your creature. Overall the game is really fun and if you have a creative mind I highly reccommend you give the game a try.","July 10, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Or maybe a creature with huge arms and tiny legs? Spore is not limited by the ever-present boundaries of physics or common sense, and even in the later game where you can no longer evolve your creature physically, visiting other planets to find that 8-nosed monstrosity you made as a joke living in harmony with 'normal' creatures is great fun.

Great game if you like to create and like to decide your role in the world (because you not only get to create your creature, you also get to choose how it lives, is it a creature that eats everything? does it kill everyone on sight? or is it a peaceful plant eater out to make friends?).\n\nI recomend you look at a lot of youtube videos and decide if it will be a good fit for you.

It does so while keeping the same element that binds together all these playstyles. You create your own- WOAH. To understand Spore's key element, you need to take a look at EVERYTHING it has to offer. You begin emerging from a meteor as a cell, where you swim around the Tidepool searching for food. Depending on what you are (carnivore or herbivore) you eat different creatures, food, and other things. eating gives you DNA, the currency that lets you change up your cell in a way that gives it protection, speed, and tricks. These tricks can then be used during the creature stage, which is where youwalk around the surface of the planet (you get to name it, too!) finding food. Other creatures inhabit the land too, though. You have two options: Friend, or food. You unlock HUNDREDS of new partss to use on your creature, including pincers, cooler eyes and mouths, arms, legs, and the list goes on. afterwards you are trested to the Tribal Stages. Here you select units (which are your own creature army) and tell them where to go. Now you can't change the look of your creature, or even RENAME them. All you can do now is give him some odd looking tribal clothes. Other tribes steal your food (new currency), and it gets pretty hectic. Tribal isn't as good, but its short and brings you to Civilization stage. Here your creature has built towns, trade routes, tanks and fighter jets, designed by YOU. Once again, selected unit-based gameplay, but its more fun than Tribal. i just find it fun to send my army to a small town ready to be conquered. As for the Space Stage, you now control your designed spaceship to conquer or ally other planets.

To be truth the only stages i play are the cell, creature, tribal, and civilation stage. The space stage how every is a really bust because you could have just arrived at a star and they start attacking at you. The part of the game that about everyone enjoy is the creature stage which funny when creating your creature. The only problem Im having is the creatures I have made in the past are come back. Also this game unforunatly breaks Darwins theory of evloution stating " a specie that has adapt to their new location is more likely to survive then the same speices that didnt adapt." Also the DRM on this game is terrible. I will recommand this but only because of the creature creator is which is wonderful.","February 11, 2014","true","138.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're not patient enough to sit and try to find all the different parts, you can go from single celled organism to space age in less than 3 hours. But once you hit that final stage there is so much to do. It has blown my mind, between the species evolution,  to the different societal  choices. It's fun, and it's goofy, and the way you play can vary from person to person.","December 14, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Teras having 5 different series on spore. I've played for nearly 23 hours at the time of creating this and its still entertaining. On the modded side of things the creepy and cute parts pack is not a necesity but its nice to have some lttle peices to have being a cheap-ish price its fine, the Galactic Adventures mod is a must get, after you've played the space stage for a while its a great addition, luckly for me i was able to buy this game for a low price due to the 75% Christmas Discount. I believe this game is well worth the money sadly the error in spore servers makes you opptionally go through a long series of steps to go online, the game overall is great fun and the creativity is too, the player input in to the game is outstanding. At this time Spore is most likely my favourite game. Good bye and good gaming!","January 5","true","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To be truth the only stages i play are the cell, creature, tribal, and civilation stage. The space stage how every is a really bust because you could have just arrived at a star and they start attacking at you. The part of the game that about everyone enjoy is the creature stage which funny when creating your creature. The only problem Im having is the creatures I have made in the past are come back. Also this game unforunatly breaks Darwins theory of evloution stating " a specie that has adapt to their new location is more likely to survive then the same speices that didnt adapt." Also the DRM on this game is terrible. I will recommand this but only because of the creature creator is which is wonderful.","February 11, 2014","true","138.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The actual "campaign" is split into five stages: Cell, where you eat everything to grow; Creature, where you become friends with other species or kill them off; tribal, where you become allies with other tribes (or conquer them); civilization, where you buy buildings for your cities to increase income, then ally yourself or become enimes with other cities; and space, where you roam the galaxy terraforming, colonizing, waging war, establishing relations, and more. It ultimetly combines arcade, adventure, strategy, and sandbox gameplay, topped off with a system of deciding whether you're a carnivore, social, economic, etc. Not to mention, the creativity is amazing. You can create your own cells, creatures, buildings, cars, boats, planes, and even spaceships, with a ton of creativity. Overall, I think you should get this game if you don't have it, and although 20 dollars seems expensive, the game is worth its price.","April 28, 2014","true","51.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

From a tiny cell to a Galactic empire, you guide your creature though all kinds of choices. It really makes you feel like a god, making a species from cell to space, everything that happens is because of you. Its endless what will happen and very addictive. 10/10, it preforms good for me.   the only issue is EA, we all know there the devil of gaming, and you need all these account stuff to get anything made by other and not Maxis.

I got this game back in 2010 by retail, and I immediately fell in love with it. The level of creativity in it is amazing, it's funny at times, and has decent replayability. It really allows your mind to wander, and create your own little world. Not to mention it can be difficult at times on the hardest difficulty. The expansion pack Galactic Adventures really added some much needed flavor to the gameplay. I could continue to regurgitate praise for the game (And trust me, it is a great game worthy of the praise it gets) but I felt some things needed to be changed. First off, if they ever created a second spore, they need to add an aquatic/fish stage. That would really lengthen the game and please a lot of fans. While this was on my mind, it was never a big problem for me personally. The big gripe I have with this game is the Space Stage. When I first got to space stage, I was incredibly excited. You are instantly allowed (except for the boring intro tutorial) to wander around and explore this vast universe filled with alien life. You got to find wormholes, explore planets, find aliens, kill aliens, etc... For someone who is really in love with space, I explored every solar system I could get to. However, after exploring for a bit, I noticed that every one of the solar systems is almost the same. I'm not talking about the way they look. Cosmetically, each system can vary from cookie-cutter to extremely unique, as do the planets. But gameplay wise, there wasn't a whole lot of new stuff. Again, Galactic Adventures changed this a little bit, but not entirely. Being the last stage of the game, I felt like it kinda gave up at the end. They could have done so much more with space stage! Now, I know trying to create 100,000 different solar systems is near impossible and time consuming, but I feel like a little more flavor would have been nice. The other thing I saw wrong with space stage was the Grox. The Grox can first show up all the way in creature stage, and the intro into space stage sets them up as a terrifying advanced race bent on destroying all. And that's exactly what they are. When I went to war with these things, I was determined to obliterate them. But no. Their empire is HUGE. About 2400 systems. Again, I know they are supposed to be this invincible empire, which they almost are, but this makes fighting them fun and challenging to just boring... Same thing. Bomb the planet while avoiding space crafts. Move to next planet. Do the same thing over. Even if you cheat, it takes forever. Not to mention it's almost impossible to remain neutral with them. Even if you don't bother them, your allies get attacked, requiring you to fight them off. It's such a hassel. And the worst part is that when you finally take over all 2400 systems, what are you rewarded with? A new weapon? Access to a planet creator? Boosted relations with all alien empires? No. You get an in game medal, and bragging rights. It's just not enough. However, despite all this criticizm, this game is amazing. If you are a person who loves sci-fi, or just loves to make things, give this game a look. It's definately worth the price. 8/10","May 19, 2014","true","221.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played Spore quite a while back, right when it came out, I played it for hours on end. I decided to come back to it 3 years later, and wow, it's still a really addicting game, (44 hours? That's not much. Well, I've played on the Creepy And Cute expansion for a lot more) they include multiple types of gameplay, as in Cell stage, you work your way up and grow by eating until you are large enough to walk onto the shore. Creature stage is slightly different, as it's a bit more open world with more options and possibilities. You can either socialize or hunt down creatures in a nest. Creature stage also opens up to the Creature creator, with far more parts then Cell stage that will help you adapt and survive to eventually make it to the top, eventually leading you to Tribal Stage. In this Stage, you take control of your tribe members, socializing or killing off other competing tribes. Tribal stage also leads to equipment to put on your creatures. Once you defeat or ally with 6 of the tribes, you head off to Civilization stage with 3 unique ways of gameplay. This stage you take control of cities, by either capturing them with military might, buying them with trade routes, paying them enough for them to eventually ally with you, or forcing your peaceful beliefs on cities. This is where Spice begins to take an important role, when you capture these spice geysers, it gives you income, which allows you to build your cities and create vehicles. Once you get world domination, it leads you to a casual Space sandbox. This game is all around a really amazing game, I have to give it a good 9/10. Totally worth the money.","April 8, 2014","true","44.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DuskySpark/recommended/17390/","DuskySpark","Ｄｕｓｋ³","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DuskySpark/","285 products in account","This game falls victim to your typical "It's made by EAxis, so it sucks!". While that could've been arguemented before on the retail copies of the games that had DRM, so you could only install it on 3 systems, the Steam version has completly removed this, allowing you to install it as many times as you want, thus removing it's main downside.\n\nAs someone who originally bought the game back in 2008, I can say it still has it's enjoyability. It tends to be a game that you'll play addictivily to for a while, forget about it for weeks/months/years and then come back to.  Like The Sims™ series, it still has a modding community, with many mods that enhance the gameplay for both those who play the game and those who simply love making the most complicated creations. Recommended mods are Platinum Spore and Dark Injection.\n\nFor the game itself, it varies in game style. The first stage is the Cell Stage, which is more of a 5-10 minute minigame until you reach the Creature Stage, which without the Galactic Adventures expansion, is most people's favourite stage. Later stages follow a sort of stragedy feel with controlling multiple of your species, until reaching the Space Stage. This was a sort of disappointment for many, which is why I also recommend the Galactic Adventures expansion, which highly increases the playthrough by offering challenges in the style of the Creature Stage. Random picks are chosen from uploaded adventures, so there is always more to try out!\n\nIn the game itself, there isn't much of the community seen rather than downloaded creations popping up in your travels. If you have an Origin account, you can sign into Spore with that and start looking up all the aliens and spacecraft you like! One thing I do not like with what I assume is an issue with the Steam edition in the game is that it seems to download nearly  every single new creation made, which leads to my games made with rather serious and 'realistic' worlds to be filled with blobs with eyes that took 10 seconds to make. I do warn others about this, and also as a way to suggest that more people put in their effort with creating. It's not that hard, especially after looking up tutorials >:P\n\nAnother issue is that all the expansions are listed as seperate games, allowing one to launch those, which may lead to some confusion among the community hubs. It's not too much of an problem, however.\n\nAll in all, the game is genuinely rather fun. I wouldn't get the whole pack at the full price, but next time it's on sale, do consider it. As someone who loves to draw the odd monster or so, I find the game very inspiring and it helps 'sculpt' the creature.","June 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DuskySpark/recommended/17390/","DuskySpark","Ｄｕｓｋ³","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DuskySpark/","285 products in account","This game falls victim to your typical "It's made by EAxis, so it sucks!". While that could've been arguemented before on the retail copies of the games that had DRM, so you could only install it on 3 systems, the Steam version has completly removed this, allowing you to install it as many times as you want, thus removing it's main downside.\n\nAs someone who originally bought the game back in 2008, I can say it still has it's enjoyability. It tends to be a game that you'll play addictivily to for a while, forget about it for weeks/months/years and then come back to.  Like The Sims™ series, it still has a modding community, with many mods that enhance the gameplay for both those who play the game and those who simply love making the most complicated creations. Recommended mods are Platinum Spore and Dark Injection.\n\nFor the game itself, it varies in game style. The first stage is the Cell Stage, which is more of a 5-10 minute minigame until you reach the Creature Stage, which without the Galactic Adventures expansion, is most people's favourite stage. Later stages follow a sort of stragedy feel with controlling multiple of your species, until reaching the Space Stage. This was a sort of disappointment for many, which is why I also recommend the Galactic Adventures expansion, which highly increases the playthrough by offering challenges in the style of the Creature Stage. Random picks are chosen from uploaded adventures, so there is always more to try out!\n\nIn the game itself, there isn't much of the community seen rather than downloaded creations popping up in your travels. If you have an Origin account, you can sign into Spore with that and start looking up all the aliens and spacecraft you like! One thing I do not like with what I assume is an issue with the Steam edition in the game is that it seems to download nearly  every single new creation made, which leads to my games made with rather serious and 'realistic' worlds to be filled with blobs with eyes that took 10 seconds to make. I do warn others about this, and also as a way to suggest that more people put in their effort with creating. It's not that hard, especially after looking up tutorials >:P\n\nAnother issue is that all the expansions are listed as seperate games, allowing one to launch those, which may lead to some confusion among the community hubs. It's not too much of an problem, however.\n\nAll in all, the game is genuinely rather fun. I wouldn't get the whole pack at the full price, but next time it's on sale, do consider it. As someone who loves to draw the odd monster or so, I find the game very inspiring and it helps 'sculpt' the creature.","June 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its worth playing if you like games with plenty of user created content, but those looking for an exiting strategy game should go to civilization or something of the like. The space stage does get significantly better with the Galactic Adventures dlc, though not really enough to make it fun.

Still, if you can get it for a low price, you should!","June 2, 2013","true","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is one of the games I grew on. Yes, it does not have a wonderfull graphics or breathtaking action (actually it does) but this is a really good game. Kids can spend hours playing it, adulst will enjoy it's madness or simply make a ♥♥♥♥-like creature.\nI highly recommend it to young gamers.\n\nThe creature redactor is wonderfull. Make anything your heart desires and it will still look and move fine.\nThe sounds, the music are great. Feel the atmosphere of new-born life and the beauty of space.\nEnjoy silly jokes while trading alien races :)\nMeet an Unidentified Walking Objects made by other users while playing. Some things they build are hilarious.\nYou will have an ability to take over the whole galaxy. Is'n it awesome to be an overlord?\nIt is easier to play as a peacefull creature. Be good.\n\n\nDisadvantages are:\nSometimes the game does not work. :D\nIt is hard to beat it only for the first time. Try to find out everything by yourself so the game would be more interesting.\nSpace stage is completely boring without Galactic Adventures. With GA it is just a little less boring.\nToo easy to understand how the game works. The interaction with animals/tribes/civilisations is too predictable.","March 26, 2014","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But there are reviews against Spore like, The game Spore is not evolutionary correct and that the creatures evolve depending on what the player thinks is "cool". But I say that it is just a game, it doesn't have to be correct. If it was put in the education genre then there's a problem. It is a sandbox game not a realistic game, it is to express creativity among players not false images of evolution. That is why if they say, type or write something idiotic about Spore, in fact about any game ignore them and buy it or promote it.

This is one of the brightest, best, most ingenius games of all time. I don't know what you're thinking it looks like, but once you play it through, you'll know why many call this a "Masterpiece".\nDon't be fooled by my hours. I played this long just to write a review. I have had this game since it's release in 2007/2008 and along with that used the expansion pack Galactic Adventures.\nSometime in this world, this game will climb from the grave of olden forgotten games and rise above all in a blinding light. It will look down upon the next generation of gamers and wave its finger. It will bathe them all in its healing glow, and the unfathomable legend that is Spore will ask them; "How will you create the universe?"\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get to some points.\n\nGOOD:\n- Open the game. Look at the title screen. Put your hands around the screen as devilish or heroic you want. YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE GALAXY TO COMPLETELY CHANGE TO YOUR VERY OWN WILL.\n- I recommend this game.\n- You can change anything. Literally. Serious here. Except plants. Sky? Water? Land formations? Vehicles? Your face? A city and it's entire layout? How about the song that plays in cities 24/7 and tortures it's civilians? Make it as monotonous as you wish. Oh, you can also change other planets. Don't have to be yours.\n- Funny. Oh, no I don't mean the game's humor. No, I don't mean giant walking pink floppy things. I mean: you have to get used to this game and know how it works. When something goes wrong or stupid, you'll know. xD\n- I recommend this game.\n- Plenty of glitches to exploit the creators to make some pretty cool looking stuff.\n- Classic RPG feel but without an annoying "Level"ing system.\n- If the community was active, it has a very flexible way to find other people's stuff and do things with it. ^^\n- GET THIS GAME ALREADY.\n- Play this game. Make stuff. Make it evolve. Click the timeline button. CRY LIKE YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.\n\nI feel like I'm betraying 9 years of my life and my favorite game of all time by writing this, but...\nBAD:\n- The community is D.E.A.D. Which is why we need to CHANGE THAT.\n- No multiplayer. Boo. :<\n\nHowever, along with no multiplayer, you can still access, comment, message, all that good stuff to people you're friends with in the game. Put their creations in your own little world and DESTROY THEM!\n\nSomewhere out there, there are still people making stuff. Well.

Simply put, God gave the gifts of imagination and creativity to all Mankind. These happen to be two of my favorite gifts that God gave us. Spore happens to be a game that allows for alot of creativity and imagination on the part of the player!!! That in itself makes the game awesome!!! There are an incredible amount of options for creating your own race of creatures and the creativity does not stop there. You can design all your buildings as well as all your vehicles (land vehicles, boats, flying machines such as helicopters, airplanes, spaceships and any other flying devices you can think of.), you can decide which plants and animals will be placed on which planet for them to inhabit. You can also terraform any planet in pratically everyway!!! You can raise or lower the land, change the atmosphere and even change the color of the sky of each planet!!! Now I could go on forever about the creativity of the game, but I really need to mention that the play control is excellent and more importantly the gameplay is truly excellent!!! I'll finish by saying that Spore is not only my favorite game of all time, but I also believe that Spore is currently THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME!!!\n","February 17, 2014","true","166.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It lets you create your own species and evolve them from microscopic cells, to a space-fairing empire. As you go along each stage, you get to use a powerful editor that lets you create virtualy anything you want. You could create something out of Mass Effect or Halo, or whatever you want. Imagination is the limit! When not in the editors, you will be spending time in Spore's 5 different stages. Each stage has its own kind of gameplay, giving you different genres of playstyle. I enjoyed all of the stages, but thre were a few problems I had. The lack of an auto save feature can be annoying at times. The gme sometimes crashes and  when I forget to save, I lose alot or all progress. (So remember to save) Another problem I had was in tribal stage were my tribe's men wouldn't harvest meat from hunting. (This wasn't too big a deal, I just restarted the game and it was fixed) There are a few bugs here and there, but they shouldn't be gamebreaking. Overall, this is one of my favorite games.

The truth is, from Cell stage right up to Space stage is ridiculously fun. Gameplay is a bit repetitive, and the controls can sometimes make you want to tear your hair out, but, overall the different stages keep things interesting right up until the end. In my opinion, Space stage is the least fun with it's running all around the galaxy trying to do missions and make trades. If you're looking for a fun game that you can pretty much play Cell stage to Space stage in a sitting or two, this will keep you entertained. The quirky mannerisms of the creatures (in pure maxis fashion) will make you giggle, and the customization is pretty fun too!","June 13, 2014","true","159.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, "signs point to no"\n\nSpore tends to get some mixed reviews, but between the yea and nae side, I'm definitely with the "yea"s.\nDespite some rather nasty bugs I've seen reported (yet have never experienced myself across 3 different PC builds with 3 different versions of windows of the games era) and a few un-fulfilled promises about the amount and variety of gameplay Spore would have, it's still a wonderful game and fits into my collection quite nicely between SimLife, Civilization, and EscapeVelocity. I'm kinda dating myself a little with those references, but if you enjoyed those games or the genres they came from, then collectively you'll likely enjoy Spore\nYou start in a cellular / molecular stage which is...well...Sparkle2Evo..."thats all I got to say 'bout that."\nNext, you're on land and as a walking, talking, biting creature have more of a "squad leader & servants" role to play in eating, killing, mating, and exploring your way through new body parts that offer bigger and better bonuses to gameplay.\nThen you move to a rudimentary Age of Empires tribal stage where you manage a small flock of your spawn and interract with (and ultimately ravage if ya play like me and always go the hostile route over the cuddly, fuzzy, social route which IS offered I might mention) other tribes of creatures.\nThen you hit the global "Civilization" stage where you're moving ground, air, and sea units to claim, control, and harvest resources while you devise the downfall or annexing of your neighboring nations.\nAnd last but certainly far from least, the space stage. This part of the game could have (and in the past, regularly was, and with great success; see EV:Nova) been its own full-production game. Exploring space, planet-scaping newly discovered worlds for colonization, a (rather awkward and sometimes uncooperative) combat system with various upgrades and features all coat this area of the game with a thick layer of nerdy OCD. Here you meet other species, conduct trade routes, colonize planets, establish automated trade routes, improve your ship, explore further and further and with more and more efficiency and profit making more and more homeworlds as you go for your species until...well....honestly I haven't gotten past this part. I enjoy it too much and haven't wanted it to end any of the half a dozen or so times I've played to this point and coasted along in place for a while before setting it down only to start over again later to replay it all.\nThere have been many frustrations with this game for me, partly because I enjoyed it so much I didn't want anything to go wrong ever, most often it was due to a program crash that would hit me unexpectedly when I hadn't saved my game in a particularly productive couple of hours. But it was easily more a problem with my computers than it was the software itself.\nBut that being said...I know the integrity of the program has been in question multiple times so...for some notable ratings...actually I suppose I'll put them at the top.","June 5, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Another thing is that if you are more about fighting, you can battle against other spores. I reccomend this game to people ages 11 and up because it does have some other things.

It lets you create your own species and evolve them from microscopic cells, to a space-fairing empire. As you go along each stage, you get to use a powerful editor that lets you create virtualy anything you want. You could create something out of Mass Effect or Halo, or whatever you want. Imagination is the limit! When not in the editors, you will be spending time in Spore's 5 different stages. Each stage has its own kind of gameplay, giving you different genres of playstyle. I enjoyed all of the stages, but thre were a few problems I had. The lack of an auto save feature can be annoying at times. The gme sometimes crashes and  when I forget to save, I lose alot or all progress. (So remember to save) Another problem I had was in tribal stage were my tribe's men wouldn't harvest meat from hunting. (This wasn't too big a deal, I just restarted the game and it was fixed) There are a few bugs here and there, but they shouldn't be gamebreaking. Overall, this is one of my favorite games. (If you like this game, be sure to heck out it's other awesome dlcs.)","April 18, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

There's not much to say with it, but there are obviously pros and cons with this game. A pro would be the "create your own animal" aspect, they really give you the parts to do this. I own the Creepy and Cute pack and robot parts, so that adds another 80-100 parts to the already decent selection, disregarding mods.\n\nA con that should rather be addressed would be, in my personal opinion, the lack of replayability. Sure, its fun for a couple of hours, evolving your creature, making a tribe and going to space, but this DOES NOT CHANGE. You just take your creature through the same levels again and again and again. There's also a lack of inspiration to move past the creature stage, but that's just me. Spore changes itself from 2D all-you-can-eat buffet with combat plastered on to thirdperson survival game with creature combat to something like a real time strategy game with masks and hats or whatever. I haven't even gone to space yet, but I'm going to assume its entirely different as well. If I wanted to play minigames, I would've booted up ♥♥♥♥ing Mario Party.\n\nThis next issue doesn't really matter any more, but the DRM was just shoddily integrated and really said "We're EA and we don't really give a flying ♥♥♥♥". When your "most anticipated game" gets spotlight as the most pirated game ever, you know you did something horribly wrong. Also, you were only allowed to install 3 times once upon a time and the DRM was the largest reason why the game got 1 star on Amazon. Anyway, I'm beating a dead horse that was festering for about 6 years or so, but it was a noticeable point in Spore's history, and I don't put that term in a good way.\n\nSpore is, overall, a decently aged game. I wouldn't recommend it at 20$ right now, but its worth a good 10-15$.","April 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is an attempt to branch off, and is a good try. Will this game ever mesure up to the sims? Unfourtanatly no, but thats because the sims is so great and appeals to us cynical controling, power craving idiots. I still do like the game for its creativity and fun, there are some sequences that can get a little stale and boring, however every time i play this game, either with friends or myself, it always leavs me laughing like a lunatic, Just like sims. Its still good, but its stuck under the huge shadow of the sims, and i just wanna say this game is a great find.","November 26, 2014","true","6.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I've been a huge fan of Spore since I first played it in 2010, and am still dumbfounded by the level of creativity of some of the community's creations.\n\nSome people seem to be having issues with their Steam Key not being verified correctly when signing up for online. I too had this problem. Thankfully I had my old account to fall back on, but I do reccomend that you look into this issue before purchasing the game. The community aspect of this game is what really makes it shine, and the game suffers somewhat without it.\n\nThis game has serious replayability, and the exploration aspect is mindblowing. You can explore an entire galaxy full of stars, the vast majority of which have orbiting planets, some of which have moons. Alongside this, the space stage has a number of beautiful features such as binary systems, black holes, protoplanetary systems, a stunning galactic core, cube planets, and the elusive storybook planets. There are also many others including easter eggs (finding Earth, for example).\n\nEach stage is as good as the previous, and the level of customisation is mindblowing. For this price, everyone should be buying this game... Well, I'd be saying that if online worked for everyone.","June 19, 2014","true","65.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You start as a cellular organism, and build your way up to traveling around IN SPACE. If you have a very creative mind, you NEED to play Spore. Everything about your organism is customizable, and it makes for a lot of fun. I find myself just making new creatures just to see how cool they look. I mean, who wouldn't want a huge duck billed purple dragon creation that sings? I did that. And it was glorious. What I also like about the game is that you can interact with other creatures that people have made and uploaded. But just be warned. There's a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥ organsisms. So be prepared.

I've been a huge fan of Spore since I first played it in 2010, and am still dumbfounded by the level of creativity of some of the community's creations.\n\nSome people seem to be having issues with their Steam Key not being verified correctly when signing up for online. I too had this problem. Thankfully I had my old account to fall back on, but I do reccomend that you look into this issue before purchasing the game. The community aspect of this game is what really makes it shine, and the game suffers somewhat without it.\n\nThis game has serious replayability, and the exploration aspect is mindblowing. You can explore an entire galaxy full of stars, the vast majority of which have orbiting planets, some of which have moons. Alongside this, the space stage has a number of beautiful features such as binary systems, black holes, protoplanetary systems, a stunning galactic core, cube planets, and the elusive storybook planets. There are also many others including easter eggs (finding Earth, for example).\n\nEach stage is as good as the previous, and the level of customisation is mindblowing. For this price, everyone should be buying this game... Well, I'd be saying that if online worked for everyone.","June 19, 2014","true","65.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Spore is an excellent concept, but the excecution is quite poor.\n\nThe original idea could have been a masterpiece. The game changed for the worse, but still remains a half decent game, that I would certainly recommend buying, in a sale.  The creature design makes the game. It makes a ruined concept good. We have people making amazing things,  but if you want an anteater slug that can't defend itself, or a treeperson, then that can be done too.\n\nBuy this game at £15 if you want.
