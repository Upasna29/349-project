That means: fiddle with stuff until you solve a puzzle. Then walk a ways, and get a new puzzle. Repeat. Think 'Portal', but without the sense of humor.\n\nYou've got a giant metal ball and a magnetic gun at your disposal, that only controls the ball. With this one mechanic, you face a series of increasingly-complicated obstacles. Also: undead zombies and mummies.\n\nThe Ball is creative and well-made, but I grew tired of the repetitive gameplay more quickly than I expected to.\n\nHowever, if you see The Ball on sale, the fun of plowing over zombies with a giant metal ball is defintely worth the price of admission.  You throw the ball, kill a few, then kill a few more on the rebound. It's a unique form of combat, and always good for a laugh.","October 31, 2013","true","1.2"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","45","56","0","0"

This means there is a lack of real plot, narrative and character. Each new area feels like an excuse to show off puzzles or the environment rather than the story dictating locations and pacing.\n\nPuzzles and combat are at the heart of the game and they both work together nicely with neither one taking precedence over the other. The game starts by dropping you into an undiscovered and mysterious ancient civilization buried deep beneath the earth. Of course like most ruined and ancient civilizations it comes beset with dangers; luckily you also find the ball of the title as well as a hand held artefact that controls its movement. The ball is a large and powerful weapon but also unwieldy, you can either magnetically draw the ball towards you or punch it away using a piston of varying power. Control of the ball is key as it'll be both your protector from arrow traps and monsters as well as solving numerous puzzles littered around the ruins.\n\nCombat is bowling on a grand scale as you launch the ball towards the enemy watching as they topple like skittles; it's a great effect and really feels like it has an impact when it strikes down a horde of mummies. And they do come at you in hordes with combat often a quick affair as you fire the ball around trying to knock down as many of them in one go as possible. Firing the ball with too much power will strike down more enemies but also leave you vulnerable as you slowly draw the ball back, it's a fine balance and knowing when to fire the ball as well as when to bring it back is key to survival. Thankfully the combat never overstays it welcome and after clearing a room of enemies you'll end up with a new puzzle to solve.\n\nThese puzzles are probably the highlight of the Ball, it will obviously be compared to Portal and whilst not quite as ingenious the puzzles are still well thought out, neither being too complicated nor too easy. The majority of the puzzles require you to guide the ball over various obstacles to reach buttons that allow you to progress. The element of solving puzzles and exploring new areas as you descend further into the ruins is what makes the game.\n\nOnce you've completed the main storyline there are a number of survival arenas which are hectic battle against the clock as waves of monsters stream into small arenas as you fire the ball around and set off traps in a desperate attempt to survive the round before it starts again. They are a nice time diversion after completing the game but no more than that.","June 16, 2014","true","10.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiwiSalad/recommended/35460/","KiwiSalad","KiwiSalad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiwiSalad/","572 products in account","I'd like to start this review by saying, the Ball wasn't a bad game, I just found myself bored a bit to often to confidently recommend.\n\nThe game itself functions well enough. I never encountered any game breaking glitches, never sank through the floor,  lost the ball, or had a button simply not work. It plays just fine in that regard. The ball control is a bit wobbly in terms of getting it to shoot precisely, but it's very slight, and most of the puzzles allow for that little bit of wiggle room.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty easy, and never really force you to do any huge mental gymnastics. The hardest part of the game are the survival levels and those just involve surviving waves of enemies. The enemies are easy enough to kill (rolling the ball over them) but they're a non-threat for the the campaign and appear so sparingly in the campaign they almost feel a little out of place. They aren't there as a puzzle impediment like the turrets in portal, most times (a few exceptions), they're mostly just thrown at you to be a momentary antagonist.\n\nThe story is interesting. However you only get it through finding secrets and once you've clicked out of the text screen there's no way to recall that text without playing through the level and finding the secret again, so if you miss one that's unfortunate. The secrets themselves are easy enough to find, you just have to be patient and willing to hunt around for hidden alcoves and the like. They do however have a stage selector so if you really want to play a level over it's easy to do.\n\nThe game looks nice enough. The graphics are consistent, and I never saw any graphical glitches, but the ball itself is a bit annoying. Even transparent it's very noticeable and still impedes vision to a degree. The problem there lies in the design of the ball. The ball is made up of two parts. A round solid peice, and a complex framework. Everything fades out except for the framework, which there is a lot of, causing a sort of cage like effect on your vision.\n\nOverall the game was alright. I don't regret buying it, or playing it. If you're looking for a game similar to portal, while this is in the same vein (logic puzzler), it isn't in the same league. If you want to have some fun walking through mildly Aztecian ruins, smashing some zombies, and solving some puzzles give it a shot.","June 5, 2014","false","33.6"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","24","34","0","0"

Using these abilities, you then use the ball to solve a variety of chambers, working your way through the game to its finish. Additionally, the Ball can be used as a weapon to take down enemies that attack you, leading to a bit of first-person crowd handling while you maneuver them into a position where you can mow them down.\n\nIn addition to the core story, there are a couple other modes, such as survival mode where you seek to survive successive waves of enemies.\n\nThe core gameplay itself is quite solid, and the puzzles are fun, if a tad too long - much of the scenery is repetative, so it feels padded and artificially stretched out. Additionally, while I found survival mode to be quite fun, the combat which is put into the main storyline feels a little out of place.\n\nUltimately, if you enjoyed other first person puzzle games such as Portal, you'll probably find something to like in this game. While it's not quite up to that series' quality, there's a good bit of fun to be had.","September 10, 2014","true","11.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

If you want a game similar to Portal, look for Quantum Conundrum, or even The Talos Principle.\n\nIt started off ok and promising, but I soon got disappointed. There's a lot of potential, but the execution just fell short.\n\nThe basic premise:\nYou have a huge ball that you can use to solve puzzles and smash things/creatures. You can hit it away from you when it's close to you, or use your ancient weapon to attract it to you.\n\nWhile some puzzles look nice, they're very boring, repetitive and seem not very well thought out.\nThere are a lot of sections when you just have to carry the ball slowly over long stretches, and it feels like they're trying to pretend the game's longer than it really is.\nPhysic could've been explored a little bit more, but I'm afraid it wouldn't have been well implemented, due to how unpolished the game looks.\nEnemies. God, why are they even there!? Battles are basically using your ball as a yoyo and/or shield while dodging the enemies and running them over. Hit it away, smash some monsters. Drag it back, smash some more monsters. Very boring.\nMusic and sound: I usually don't pay attention, but that noise of you constantly dragging the ball is really annoying. And the "music" is just more random noise, trying to build an horror atmosphere that just shouldn't be there, and it doesn't actually make it through to the game.\n\nI know it's cheap and it looks great (I was really excited to play it), but although it's not the worst game in the world, and it's playable, I can't say it's good either.

I kind of regret not playing it sooner!\n\nThe Ball has you taking on the role of an archaeologist exploring an ancient mayan-esque city buried deep underground. The only tool at your disposal is a small tool that can be used to hammer or to pull the game's main implement: the ball. You use the tool and the ball to solve the majority of the game's puzzles as well as to destroy enemies by rolling the ball over them. The game's atmosphere is pretty cozy and the music fits the visuals and I get kind of an early 00s FPS feeling from the controls (which is fine). The puzzles are very easy and you likely won't find yourself struggling for very long to move the ball along. Eventually the game throws a few "boss" like monsters at you but again these can be quickly solved through trial and error. There is also not much of a plot to the game unless you manage to find all of the secrets, each revealing a bit of the backstory to how the ball, and city, came to be. Overall I would recommend grabbing this game during a steam sale (it's not really worth it's base price of $10 IMO).

Likely.\n\nThe Ball is a first person puzzler from the same developers of Killing Floor that draws similarities to Portal and Q.U.B.E, set in a ancient South American cave and ruins network from a civilization that centered around The Ball. This ball can be "kicked" and "attracted to you" with an acient tool called The Hammer to activate switches and transmit effects like spikes, fire, electricity and mines, which are either used to solve puzzles or occasionally deal with hostiles. The majority of the puzzles are pretty easy to figure out, even if you are not into puzzle games, save for a couple moments that may require you to "think from another angle". Combat sometimes feels inconsequential, but gets more interesting when there are tons of enemies or you have to deal with foes that can be killed directly by the rolling of The Ball. The game is at its best near the end game, though, some situations like an oil and fire  combat part and the last puzzle were annoying.\n\nTake my timeplayed and subtract about 7 hours to get a more accurate play time. The game also includes extra missions including a Portal 2 like test chamber series. Owning the game entitles you to a skin of the main character in Killing Floor, though it is odd that you never see the guy until you play KF. Has X-Input support. 1920x1080 is the highest resolution.

It’s not Portal, that much is clear. It doesn’t have any of the dark humour or as much as the intelligence, but it makes up its own stand-out moments. Like walking through a spider web, and having your vision obscured by silky stands and a small shower of bugs, or stealing inside a newly-opened cavern and discovering a long dormant piece of Aztec machinery or a long forgotten temple rising majestically out of the swirling dusts.\n\nFull review // http://www.honestgamers.com/9250/pc/the-ball/review.html","November 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Somewhere in Mexico an archaeologist is falling in a cave and discovers a link between aztecs and alien culture. First he finds in the cave is an amazing weapon he carrys all around ... but the weapon can only do 2 things: kicking or attracting "The Ball" device. Not to say it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ worthless without "The Ball" what doesn't count if there were no action advententure elements in this game, but they are. So you have to kill all enemies with "The Ball"\n\nOk the puzzles in the game are good as Tomb Raider puzzles and the hardness is raising on higher level. But there are also these annoying jump sequences where you die in lava, spears or have to do it again. Sometimes the physics engine produces moments that "The Ball" flips away or you slip down the stairs without any reason.\n\nWhat really is bad: there is no important character in this game what makes it very uninteresting. Some elements looks like Unreal1 engine.\n\nWhat really is ridiculous are the achievements like hammer the ball 5000 times where you only need max. 500 for the whole game. Or road warrior achievement doesn't count on railway victims or the "amazing" survival modes ... Oh wait one is good: the Portal course.\n\nConclusion: Buy this game only if you like puzzles very much. In my opinion the enemies which are in this game are more disturbing than helpful. For Killing floor Achivement "No time for Love, Dr.Jones" better contact me than buying this game.","December 17, 2013","false","23.0"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","22","41","0","0"

You push a big ball around the whole game to push switches and squash enemies.

And the atmosphere is top notch, playing this game made me feel like I was going on an Indiana Jones adventure.\n\nThe story is mostly dictated through secret collectables. I couldn't find them all so I couldn't follow the story very well, but you'll still get the gist of it if you don't collect them.\n\nMy one complaint is that It's kind of hard to see through the ball sometimes, but I got around this by keeping the ball behind me most of the time.\n\nOverall a great polished game.

Basically, it's just you and a giant ball up against a bunch of puzzles and an army of undead mummy-things. The main focus is on using the ball to solve puzzles, but there are also enemies that appear from time to time to switch things up and add a bit of tension to the mix. The game does a good job of steadily introducing new mechanics as you make your way through the ancient underground labyrinth. I was able to finish it in just a few short hours, but to me, that is a plus (it did not overstay its welcome). It's definitely worth the price, so I say take a look at it if you're looking for a fun yet different sort of game to while away an afternoon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinsmarck/recommended/35460/","Kinsmarck","Kinsmarck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinsmarck/","244 products in account","For a game that originally began as a mod for Unreal Tournament III, The Ball is a pleasant little distraction from the usual fare of first-person action titles.  I’m reticent to even call it a first-person shooter, even though it’s won awards as such, as it’s much more of a puzzle-solving game, and players receive exactly one weapon throughout the game.  This weapon, which looks and functions like an Aztec-skinned rip of Half Life 2’s gravity gun, provides players with a means of interacting with the eponymous Ball, which remains their primary tool throughout the game.  However, both Ball and control gun are disappointingly bereft of any ominous names.  For shame, Tripwire.\n\nAs a 1940’s paleontologist working a presumably remote dig site in the deserts of Mexico, The Ball quite literally drops players into a winding cave system lined with cryptic, ancient ruins. Quickly discovering The Ball and its control device, something draws the player ever deeper into a dangerous labyrinth of trap-laden, zombie-infested ruins.  Is it an insatiable curiosity, ancient mind control, or just a rail-roaded plot? I don’t know, it’s never really explained, but the puzzles players are led to are cleverly designed, visually appealing, and genuinely entertaining to solve, so a flimsy narrative is somewhat forgivable.\n\nHearkening to the addictive, puzzle-solving gameplay of Portal, The Ball was actually released just prior to Portal 2’s debut, and the influences are genuine and very much intended, even going so far as including a cross-over stage in The Ball’s challenge levels.  Trouble is, with just one means of solving The Ball’s puzzles, they do get a bit stale and predictable after a few levels.  Different environments allow The Ball to perform many more functions than simply rolling around like something out of Indiana Jones’ nightmares, but most of these functions are short-lived, and don’t feel like their true potential was fully explored, especially regarding the layering of multiple special functions at once.\n\nCombat is another of the game’s shortcomings, as it largely consists of just  repeatedly blasting and retracting The Ball back and forth like some skull-embossed yo-yo from hell.  Boss battles and blinged-out Aztec zombie waves alike (Did I mention there are lots of zombies?) suffer from this repetitious bore, which is quite a shame, considering that one of those bosses happens to be a giant, zombified King Kong.  No, I am not kidding.\n\nAt the end of the day, The Ball is a fun little niche title, and to its credit, it never really feels like it’s trying to do more than it can.  What it sets out to do, it accomplishes, and does it well.  It may only last players a day or two, but for just ten bucks on Steam at the time of this writing, I’d say those are days well spent.\n\nRating: 5.2\n\nVisuals: 5\nAudio: 4\nControls & Mechanics: 6\nAtmosphere & Experience: 5\nEntertainment Value: 6\n\nFor more reviews, articles, and videos, check out LastLevelPress.com!","November 25, 2013","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Ball is a physics game with okay graphics and rather unchallening gameplay. The pace is too slow and there's too many stretches which are filled with idle walking and pushing the ball where it needs to go to.\n\nAll in all, an interesting concept and definitely not a bad game, but the lacking execution and boring stretches make me unable to truly recommend this.","January 17","false","8.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I will give it credit for trying out a new idea, but it could have been made much better. The most simple way to explain this game is "Portal 2" without portals or any Glados or high graphics or complex puzzles, basicly a sphere and a button and turrets are all thats left.","August 7, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This would be an alright little puzzle game if it wasn't so darn slow, clunky and disjointed. Moving the ball by hitting it around with your screen estate waster of a hammer gun is tedious as all hell. Having enemies and an energy gauge seems very pointless, as well. I'm not sure how all parts of this game came into being, but lumped together their sum is probably less than expected.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cthulhunest/recommended/35460/","cthulhunest","YoSaff #uffda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cthulhunest/","580 products in account","This is a really frustrating game because the concept is brilliant for a puzzle game (you have a giant ball and a tool for moving the ball, solve puzzles) but then they felt the need to implement combat. Combat has absolutely no place in this game - the mechanism for killing the standard enemies is just "run them over with the ball" and for the miniboss creatures who show up at the end just in time to stop the momentum dead in its tracks every one boils down to "place ball here, lure miniboss into damaging effect". If you're lucky that just involves hitting them with the ball, if you're not it involves luring them near electricity or landmines or oil trails or some other damn thing.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the recurring worm miniboss which spoils perhaps the best chapter of the entire game, which is just a rehash of the tentacle alien from the original Half-Life, only instead of distracting it with grenades you wait for it to go into an idle animation and then dash from place to place.\n\nHonestly if they released some special no-combat-we-swear version of this then I'd have next to no problems with this (although there are always nitpicks, like how the game throws down checkpoints regularly but only saves after like a third of them) but as it is the game feels like it's stretched way too thin and it means that even the interesting ideas such as the anti-gravity field are woefully underutilized and undeveloped. Can't honestly recommend it in this state.","December 21, 2014","false","6.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A puzzle game that has innovation to it.  The puzzles mixed with some combat make for a very different experience. The ending to the game was a shocker and different than many other games I played. Based on what led up to it I expected something different. I highly recommend this game to others and heck I haven't even played the survival mode yet which will be more intense as I think you are dealing with more baddies while solving puzzles or just dealing with waves of baddies.  I am not sure on that but the point is I have played half the game and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  In terms of graphical presentation it looks pretty decent. It definitely has it's own art style standing out from other games.  As for the music in the game it is perfect.  It is creates suspense and give you a feeling of awe, amazement and wonder in regards to what you are seeing.  It makes you want to play the game further.\nIGN gave it 70 out of 100 and PC Gamer gave it an 81 out of 100.  Overall the Metascore was 68 from professional reviewers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/35460/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","As soon as you start the game, you will notice that the mood, setting, and atmosphere are superb. The storyline is mysterious and well thought out, with interesting to watch cutscenes. The lighting effects further enhance the overall flavor of the game, and adds an eery feeling as you explore each level. The game mechanics are well implemented, but they do take a bit of getting used to, as initially, the controls may seem clunky. The game rewards you with an achievement for killing innocent bystander monkeys and even keeps track of how many you have killed, which is rather pointless and mean. Regardless of the monkeys, there are plenty of monsters to kill that will come at you relentlessly. With that said, there is not much variety in who your enemies are, but this does not feel too repetitive or boring, since you will be doing all you can to control the ball and attack them with it, and there is a great amount of excitement and fun in the process. This mechanic really isn't as simple as it sounds, and it does take getting used to and learning the techniques. Killing the monsters makes them splat with some gore and loose body parts. These moments are incredibly tense, exhilarating, and action packed. The Ball manages to put together various aspects from a few genres and implements them quite well. It feels like a first person shooter, adventure, puzzle game, slightly reminiscent of the Portal series. The level design is outstanding, and truly sets out to make an experience that is memorable, tense, edgy, creepy and extremely satisfying. The buildings and other structures are masterfully crafted and placed in the game world for much enjoyment. Simply looking around each level is an absolute delight by itself. In The Ball, there is an overall feeling of loneliness, as you must progress through the dire situation of being lost all by yourself, without anyone helping. It also manages, through its mood, setting, and atmosphere to positively produce emotions of fear, despair, worry, and awe. Being inside the various tombs, caverns, and other structures presenting a theme of ancient Mexican civilizations is truly amazing. Everything has near perfect timing, expert design, wonderful execution and flawless placement. There aren't that many bosses in The Ball, but the few you will encounter are skilfully crafted, and a joy to watch and fight against. The puzzles are all quite intuitive and requires the perfect amount of thought in conjunction with action dexterity. They are all well developed and enacted, providing much satisfaction as you complete each one. If some of the puzzles may seem a bit complicated, the designers have included a hints system that allows you to get on the right path of puzzle solving without sacrificing the gaming experience and other plot elements. Adding to an already extremely positive overall experience, the ending was thoroughly satisfying. Once you're done with the campaign, you are also given the option to go through small, new levels not found in the campaign, in the so-called Survival game mode. It is an interesting change from the campaign, but it does not compare, as it is taken from an entirely different context, and has a whole different approach. This has been the best overall experience in a first person game since Half-Life 1. The Ball is that amazing. The environments are beautiful, the game play is rich and interesting, and it never gets boring. It is also perhaps the most fun you will have as a virtual, in-game archeologist. The Ball is a truly magnificent experience.\n\nThe Ball is amazing.","March 20, 2014","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The core concept is there, but nothing ever builds on the original push/pull ball mechanic. This game could have been a pretty awesome coop puzzle game, but it is single player only.\n\nPROS:\n-Nice idea\n-Ball moves around easily and without headache (this COULD have been a major frustration point, but is executed almost perfectly).\n-Voice acting is ok (for what very tiny bit there is).\n\nNEUTRALS:\n-Graphics are just barely acceptable (quality/resolutions)\n\nCONS:\n-Walking/swimming/railcar simulator. MASSIVE amount of just walking around for no reason. Areas are large and excessive for no real purpose, especially since there is very little to explore (a few secrets but thats it). No other drops, items, collectibles, etc.\n\n-NO SPRINT/RUN.  For a game with massive amounts of walking, why can't we run!?\n\n-Barely two game mechanics (push/pull ball and magnets in the levels that do the same). No additional mechanics are introduced over the first 3 levels (8 levels total so little less than half the game). No other items, gear, or abilities. The core concept is good, but nothing ever builds on it.\n\n-Environments are very bland with the exact same textures over and over.\n\n-Puzzles are very straightforward; barely require thought. Almost every "puzzle" is just push these switches in linear order.\n\n-"Survival" mode (and all combat in the game) is extremely boring and repetitive. Just  hold the ball and swing side to side. Although a number of cool traps exist, using them is usually to your detriment as it is more effective to just swing the ball.\n\n-No plot/narrative. Every now and then there is a tiny bit with a voiceover, but as a whole characters just show up and virtually nothing is explained. Given how expansive the environments are, you would think they could use this space to tell a story....but no, it just adds to your playtime by making you walk longer between areas.","February 18","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Ball provides some kind of story about Mayas and makes you carry around a... you gessed it, huge ball which is mandatory to solve the puzzles the ancient mayas (Which now seems to be some kind of zombies) layed in their underground temples so new visitor could have some fun.\n\nThe problem is that the Mayas were wrong.\nThe story is almost irrelevant to the development of the game: There are mayan ruins, there are some dead guys trying to kill you, and something about a virus, but the level of the puzzles is just ludicrous.\n\nLet me put it in a new paragraph: If you ever played an FPS like Half-Life 2 which has "puzzles", you know which is the level of the puzzles in The Ball. There is no genius, nor interesting uses for our big hamster ball. Figuring out how to walk to the next room could be a challenge a monday morning or after a hangover, but for the average player each puzzle provides as much challenge as open a soda can and drink it. Or maybe walk from his house to the grocery store and get the soda can.\n\nThe game took me over 5 hours to beat it (not trying to do a speed run), and, given the circumstances, it is a good thing for the game to be so awfully short.\n\nAvoid it.","December 23, 2013","false","5.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

You lug around a special gun that has two different (but related) firing modes, and are tasked with solving various physics-based puzzles, some of which require you to manipulate a certain geometrically-shaped object. It's Portal, right? It's not, of course: I'm talking about "The Ball". The Ball *so* wants to be the next Portal game -it has all the trappings- and completely fails to achieve that goal. While Portal has a sublime mix of intriguing puzzles and an interesting setting, The Ball's puzzles are rarely a challenge and the setting is uninspired. Quite simply, The Ball is *dull*.\n\nThe game started out as a total-conversion for Unreal and, had it remained only that, I would have been more forgiving. After all, free software from an independent up-and-coming group of developers is worth the benefit of the doubt. But when packaged and sold at retail, I expect a bit more. While the controls are adequate, the puzzles are a repetitive "push the eponymous ball onto button" (often mixed with some atrocious jumping challenges) that very quickly wear out their welcome. The game environments are bland and filled with pointless dead areas where nothing happens.\n\nOther reviews indicate that the game does pick up right near the end, but I never got that far; the tedium of the first three quarters of the game wore me out. Rumors of a few interesting puzzles a dozen levels down the line just isn't enough to keep me trudging through the characterless boredom that comprises the rest of the game.","November 27, 2013","false","2.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but the game doesn't really give you any impetus to keep going. I realize that I still have roughly 5 to 7 hours of gameplay left, but I think after the first level something more significant should have occured.\n\nThe game just feels like going through motions. Hit switch, move ball, hit switch, go through door, hit switch, move ball, watch out a bad guy, hit switch, go through door, etc.\n\nThe game looks fantastic, even after all these years, it plays well, controls well, and mechanically it does what it sets out to do, but there is just no real reason to keep going.\n\nAnd while I hate to compare this to Portal, the game does showcase how you can have simplistic mechanics but keep the player engaged and entertained at the same time. With every succeeding level Portal lays out a narrative through audio and visual cues, one that makes you want to engage with the game and see and hear what comes next. But with The Ball, you get none of that engagement. A few story elements thrown around in what seems like an afterthought, and some one off expositives via secrets.\n\nThe worst thing I can say about this game is that it is disappointingly boring. It's not bland, it's not ugly and it certainly isn't a waste of time, it's just ... there.","January 4, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ball itself is a simple artifact with only two controls, hammer, and recall, allowing you to bowl the ball down hallways, or draw it back to you as needed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Striped_Socks/recommended/35460/","Striped_Socks","Hatchet Harry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Striped_Socks/","466 products in account","I remember when I first saw The Ball pop up on Steam and I got quite intrigued. I had pipe dreams in my head about using the ball so solve almost acrobatic puzzles using football style trick shots or impressively complicated rube-goldberg devices. I didn't buy it in in the end though. However it popped up again as part of a Tripwire Interactive bundle so I finally grabbed it.\n\nStraight off the bat I can say that The Ball isn't terrible, it's not Duke Nukem awful or Call of Duty boring. But it's not impressive either. It's a sort of safe affair through out.\n\nNo where did I find the satisfying trick shot or juggling that I dreamed up. But that's not to say the puzzles are boring. They're fairly straight forward and no one should really find themselves stuck at any point. Some of them are still pretty clever in themselves. But the main pitfalls of the puzzles (and these are major problems with the game) is that The Ball, the main focus of the game that you drag about, never really does anything but act as another way to press buttons you cannot reach. Well, that's not strictly true but more on that later. The puzzles do not really expand to include new concepts or mutations ( again there is an exception but later on) passed  ' this button needs pressing, get to it'.\n\nThere is also a strange problem with the pacing of the over all game. The core mistake is that the game gives you little to no motivation to carry on. There is quite little reward. There's no narrative to get into, no rewards or things given to the player. You just seem to 'do' and then move on to 'do' again. The game attempts to break itself up with some random and ultimately pointless vehicle sections (mostly on a rail and with one controllable vehicle) that just seem to stretch out phases of nothingness.\n\nThe problem of lacking purpose persists into Boss fights also. For example (Oh and spoiler alert. Oh wait ! No narrative! Nevermind!) at some point you and your ball get trapped in a small square arena with a cannon that shoots bombs that you activate with a button, and a 15ft enraged zombie gorilla (yep). The solution is, obviously, to blast furry undead ♥♥♥♥ with the cannon.  This is pleasantly easier said than done. Until you die. At which then the game spits you out back into the arena as if nothing happened and all challenge just dissipates. What was a hectic boss fight becomes just another puzzle but with a random, annoying element (that happens to be a 15ft zombie monkey). This nonexistent difficulty curve is through the entire game mind you, so it's pointless to add enemies in it at all.\n\nBut some positive points: The game really innovates for about 5 seconds near the end. With one very small puzzle which adds new elements to the game. The Ball suddenly has this fun low-gravity field sorrounding it and much of the puzzles have you throwing the ball, jumping into the field as it cruises through the air and leaping out of it onto a far distant platform and turning in time to catch the ball again. All in one smooth move. And that is cool. Then the game snatches that fun from you and says "right, that's enough satisfaction for you, into the pointless ♥♥♥♥ing vehicle you go".\n\nIf the Ball dared to change things up a bit, added a bit more personality and varied the aesthetic it would of been a killer fun game. But as it stands it's merely safe and easy.\n\nWorth a quid or two if it's on sale. Don't pay full price unless you're a serious lover of balls.\n\n(Look mum! My degree from a dissolved university was well worth the 3 years of infinate stress and life long debt!)","March 28, 2013","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An entire experience centered around a simple to use ball leads you through a series of huge ancient ruins in an experience that can only be described as 'one hell of a ride.' The story is purposefully trimmed down, leaving you to peform as a true archeologist and piece together the events that occured so deep inside the mountain through the discovery of artifacts which unfold pieces of the story as they are discovered. The ball itself is a simple artifact with only two controls, hammer, and recall, allowing you to bowl the ball down hallways, or draw it back to you as needed. These two simple options turn into a menagerie of puzzles, combat, and various other uses you never imagined.

The Ball has many, many levels and they can be challenging at times, you also go through very samey looking levels that aren't really nice to look at and there is almost no story to the game.\n\nSometimes the game gives a hint that something interesting is about to happen but then it will do something very anti-climatic. Literally nothing happens and what narrative there is makes no sense and means nothing to the player. This continues throughout the entire game and by the end you're left confused as to why; the ball is now a flying saucer and wonder who is the mysterious alien leader guy casually walking around.\n\nOverall the game is just boring and the puzzles are kind of challenging (to those who aren't complete experts) but also tedious. There is almost no story/confusing story for your efforts and this game just drags on and so there is no enjoyment in this at all. Only buy if you like intermidiate difficulty puzzles, the gravity gun mechanic, the companion cube part on Portal but a lot more of it and/or find achievements rewarding enough for your efforts. DO NOT buy this game just to get the Killing Floor achievement. Avoid this game or buy cheap in a sale, unless you are desperate to play this game.","January 3, 2014","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Ball is a good puzzle game inspired by Portal, and it could be a very good puzzle game if the puzzles were harder. You spent most of the time rolling the ball than thinking of what you should do to solve the current puzzle. The game is not very long, every room is a different puzzle, but for 60% of the game the only gameplay mechanic is to roll the ball. Later the gameplay expands by introducing other ways to interact with the ball, but the puzzles do not get any harder. There is a survival mode where you have to kill monsters with the ball, which in my opinion is not something that should be focused in a puzzle game.","March 23, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles however are very simple and most are solved quite easily. There is little story development in the game, and almost no characters whatsoever. It is still fun to play and I really enjoyed playing it, but I can only recommend it for fans of puzzle games, and for those who want to play Spebbs' DLC character in Killing Floor."\n\nPros:+ Physics based puzzles that are fun little brainteasers\n+ Solid level design, creating a good environment to adventure in\n+ A survival gamemode\n\nCons:- Barely any story development\n- Little replayability\n- Repetitious combat\n\n6/10","February 13","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art and themes are really dry, so all you really get out of it is a bit of brain-bending.\n\nThe primary mechanic of this game is pushing and pulling a giant ball using a special ball-pushing device. The ball can be used to smash enemies, push buttons and and break obstacles. There's some story about how it's an ancient Mayan artifact or something but the story's lame enough to not be worth remembering.\n\nThe game designers did a good job of finding new gimmicks and mechanics to keep The Ball at the center of the gameplay. For being such a limited premise, it's pretty darn long. After just a couple hours in I found myself wondering, "Is there anything else they can even do with this idea?" Sure enough more ball-related puzzles keep coming. I'm impressed by their focus and ingenuity, but I must say, it gets kinda stale.","May 30, 2015","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/35460/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","The Ball with some pretty big flaws.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the good: The environment design. The vast caves and ancient mayan/aztec/central american cities are very captivating to look at and explore. There are some great vistas in the game. Similarly, the design of the enemies is pretty good. Also, the ball puzzles are, for the most part, fun, if quite easy to solve.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of problems. The first thing that hits you is the wya the game is renderd. It has a sort of "cell-shaded-but-not-really" feel to it, and it looks as if someone was toying with the saturation filter a little too much at times. But this isn't anything major, and is probably more a matter of personal taste.\n\nOne of the biggest gripes I have with this game is the level design. Yes, I just praised the environments, you would think the level design was good too, no? Unfortunately, this game suffers very badly from "invisible wall syndrome". Rather than design the areas you can walk around to not have areas you can cheat your way around, the devs simply slapped an invisible wall wherever you're not supposed to go. This is really jarring and annoying when I encounter it in a game, especially one that involves having to more around an object like the ball. It ggets so bad that at one point, thanks to a physics glitch, I had trapped myself floating in mid air, standing on top of an invisible wall, and was unable to get back into the level because it was there.\n\nAlso, on the subject on exploring the nvironment. There comes times when you try to explore the area to find more "secrets", but find yourself being forced onto the next area because you solved a puzzle or boss fight too quickly, which prevents you from finding the secrets. This is very annoying.\n\nThere are also some "boss" fights which range from incredibly easy to beat to downright impossible without dying many times first. You shouldn't have to rely on the game saving your progress on dying to get past bosses.\n\nI would also like to touch on the story. It starts with you trapped down a hole. Fair enough, an archaeologist is bound to have that happen to them once or twice. But then it appears they have no rope to send down the hole. And apparently they need a crane to lift you out. None of this makes sense, the hole isn't really that deep, and pretty early on in the game, the player mysteriously produces some rope with which to tie the ball to things.\n\nSo in short, The Ball is a fairly mediocre puzzle game, which if you're just a new and casual player, you may enjoy, but if you've played games for a while, you will very easily spot the flaws in it.","January 12","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether it's poor design or just a bug is hard to tell - that's it's been there for years makes the developers look bad IMO tho.\n\nSome of the first-person platforming is grim/fiddly and frankly we could live without it\n\nSummary: There's plenty to do and most of it is fun - if I could just walk a BIT less and feel a BIT less sick and have my progress saved properly it would be top notch.\n\nAs is, it's a recommend but make sure you have time to complete a level (in some cases 20-30 mins) because the game probably won't save halfway because - well - who'd want that? ;(","December 2, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
