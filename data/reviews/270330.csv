It turns out to be a terrible port and not worth a 5 dollar price.\n\nPros:\n-Intriging story\n-New setting\n-Great art style\n-Intresting concept\n\nCons:\n-Terrible textures, texutes don't all match, some have darker outlines and some don't, no shadows, everything looks flat\n-Poor sound effects, I had to turn down the footsteps, they are not smooth and the chain hit sound blasts louder than the others\n-Horrible controls, says full controller support but I had issues with the controller sticking and the buttons it says to press dont work (example it said to push "a" but the actually button was the trigger) also it wanted me to middle click which is not intuitive at all\n-Dialouge boxes don't work well, I had problems navigating through the lines and when they closed they would flash for a frame or two\n-Dialouge is written like a tumblr fan fic, early on the dialouge said " *Ku walks forward and raises his had* " which brings us to our next con\n-Animations are not smooth, they don't flow with the movment and the cutscenses are just controlled walking.\n-Music played by the early npc musicians was incredibly repititive, literally 4 seconds and looped for multiple npcs. I did not hear any other music after this so I do not know the quality later on\n-Dialouge is written is a script like context, instead of a box at the top it says like "Culan: Ku, blah blah blah" and the name is the same color as the rest of the text.\n\nThis game is a tossed together ios port with an asking price that is not worth it. I could recommend the game at around $2.50 but not at $5, This was written on March 17 so the game might get future updates to improve. I would love to play this game but the flaws are too much at this current point. I hope they update to fix some of these issues.","March 17, 2014","false","1.1"," 78 of 92 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","78","92","0","0"

The "poing" combo attacks in particular are annoying.\n- The controls and movement are clunky.  I was playing with a mouse and clicking to move too often sent me in the opposite direction.\n- There's no choice during cut-scene exposition so breaking that up into sentences which need to be clicked in turn is unnecessary.\n- The script could also do with a good proofread / edit / rewrite.","March 18, 2014","false","3.6"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","29","37","0","0"

It took me under an hour & a half to complete, and I ran around searching every corner of each map.\n\nIt says it all that the length is my lasting impression of this game. It doesn't really have all that much going for it besides the visuals. The general look of the game reminded me a little of Bastion, but K:SotM does have its own unique look. The game presents itself as a top-down action game with a very distinct art style almost like each moving part of a character model is a separate cut-out drawing. This is rather pleasing on the eye, although some models have clearly had less attention than others. The screen is also too focused on the player, so you cannot see very far in any direction. I also had to use Task Manager to close the game at one point in the story, as an image that covers over almost the entire screenspace would not go away and the menu was unresponsive.\n\nThe game control scheme includes gamepad usage, however I could not get my official 360 wired control to work (and Steam forums are littered with others having issues with different controls). Instead, I had to use my mouse to play the game where left clicking moves your character & attacks, right-click performs a dodge roll, and space bar fires your projectile. The input of what I pressed on my mouse was frequently ignored by the game, causing me to stop moving at crucial moments, or for it to not use the correct weapon. The combat felt very clunky because of this. Also, there is only 1 melee weapon, and 1 projectile weapon. The lack of variety, no abilities, and only 1 melee combo attack mean that combat gets very stale regardless of the enemies. There also is not a huge range of enemies in the short campaign, although there are more variants of these enemies in the combat arena mode which adds a little extra lifespan to the game.\n\nThe audio is rather bland. There is not much of a soundtrack, none of the characters are voiced, and there are only a few sound effects in the game.\n\nSo to summarise: I do not recommend K:SotM, even if you have spare money to burn and it is on a heavy discount. There simply is not enough content here, and even if there was the gameplay is too repetitive and glitchy.\nTo top it all off, the game ends on a humongous cliff-hanger that cannot really be justified when the game is so short.","March 19, 2014","false","2.8"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","0"

You can control the boy with a mouse as I did or you can use a controller if you'd prefer, either way it plays well, but I prefer a mouse and keyboard with this game. This Adventure game is fairly short which I like, as it does not drag on like other games can. KU is quite easy to play there are not alot of enemys coming at you, so if you dont like difficult games then this is a good game for you. The  handdrawn artwork is very nice and unique. Also there are some fighting Arenas that open up at the end, so you can test your skills out there. My advise would be look at some youtube videos of the game, as thats what helped me make my choice to buy this game and see what you think of it. I have no regrets buying this game, I feel it was worth it, although quite short .... To the DEVELOPERS, this is a very nice game in my opinion, It does play really well now. I hope there are more chapters coming to this nice game, as I'd like to see more to this story about KU ; )  Keep up the fantastic work you are all doing and THANK YOU.  : )","March 19, 2014","true","10.3"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reasonance/recommended/270330/","reasonance","Reasonance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reasonance/","1489 products in account","I am sorry to write this but this has to be done.\n\nI was really excited about this game, hoping for another Bastion with some more of a Zelda-like twist to it, all of that in a interesting setting based on the Celtic lore.\n\nWhat I've got instead is a shoddy mobile game that fails to adapt to proper, traditional controls - its interpretation of mouse clicks is laughable, still relaying on a way too large waypoint crutch, originally used for the touch input, which results in imprecise, frustrating controls and leads to really shoddy animation loops - like the one infinite run you get on all the elevators.\n\nGamepad input is even worse - I've tested with a wired 360 controller - menus don't navigate properly, Ku is infinitely running in place when left analog stick is in neutral position, mouse cursor disappears in the menus while controller is plugged, controls while talking to NPCs are sluggish, easily resulting in nigh-infinite conversation loops. I got too frustrated with them in the beginning to even try going back to them when combat started, so I am no able to comment on that.\nI am not sure if there is a DirectInput gampead support yet - Buttons might be rebindable via *sighs* Unity launcher.\n\nCombat. It sucks. Okay, let's elaborate:\nLMB: dash to an enemy and hit it, switching enemies will chain hits, up to, I think, 4, each of the hits after the first one resulting in more and more irritatingly high pitched sound effects.\nRMB: Dodge roll, uses 1 stamina, stamina bar has 3 charges [at least at the start of the game] - I didn't find it reliable in battle, as it didn't trigger all the time while in combat - though it might be related to my facing or direction of the right mouse click, so I can't truly judge that yet.\nAnd that's it for the start - insanely boring, and really not as responsive as it should. I'd rather play Diablo 1. at least it works properly and reliably. Combat mechanics fail utterly.\n\nAnd it gets worse. Not long after the beginning of the game proper you get a weapon that allows you to fire, for free, every second or so, a blue projectile that COMPLETELY PARALYSES basic enemies. Yeah, think about that for a second. Nice way to make the combat even less substantial. It's bound to MMB, or it's, supposedly, able to be fired by clicking [presumably LMB] and then SWIPING in a desired direction  - it never worked for me though, but well, we generally don't swipe on PC.\n\nStory starts slowly, wasn't paying much attention to it due to growing irritation. No obvious typos, or grammar problems from what I've seen. Text available in English and Irish!\n\nAnd after all this bitter grievances time for the stuff I actually liked: the graphic style and the music - the brass steampunk characters and structures contrast nicely with lush green environment, and soundtrack seems quite fitting, and miles above the quality of sound effects.\n\nGame runs okay, even on my rubbish laptop, it's an Unity game, and, sadly, all options are in the launcher in the form of those idiotic profiles (e.g. Beautiful) - please devs, DON'T DO THAT, you can do proper options in Unity too!\n\nI was forced to stop playing the game on that weird maybe flappy bird inspired thing which failed to work for me - craft dropped down no matter how I've pressed the LMB [neither one long press nor clicking like a maniac resulted in any sort of response]. I quit to main menu after that. Weirdly enough, when I tried to "Continue" later on, it failed to load my character and it's bird, or made them invisible - Level seemed to scroll okay though, so I think I was unable to reach the failure state - yet another case of poor QA in this title.\n\nSo let's recap: Basic MOBILE Zelda-like Action-rpg in brazen steampunk Irish setting. Terrible controls, Bad animations, Irritating sound effects. Interesting art direction and fitting music. Lackluster mechanics. Broken game section.\n\n(SADLY) NOT RECOMMENDED\n","March 22, 2014","false","1.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Had to resort to use the mouse, though that meant not having a mouse pointer when going in the menu (or at the start screen), which made quitting the arena after a game over quite annoying.\n\nI didn't complete the game because after getting past the falling rocks part, some sort of problem/bug had me stuck there in cutscene mode and I really didn't feel like continuing on since I didn't have any fun while playing.\n\nThe only positive I can see is that the art is pleasing, but sadly that does nothing for the gameplay which I found really lacking.","March 23, 2014","false","7.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Filled with puzzles, combat and set in a unique world it's surely a winning recipe, right?\n\nWhen you first emerge from the tunnels you are greeted with a colourful, friendly village full of interactive characters (make sure you speak to them all and you will be rewarded with an achievement). Speaking to them provides you with information about the main protagonist Ku who is an unruly youth constantly getting himself into trouble. Your first mission is to head out to find the leader of the village. Once you speak with him about the ring that went missing, he explains that it is the main energy source for the village and without it they are doomed. That is where your quest begins, you are ordered to head into the wilderness and hunt down a replacement ring from the North.\n\nAs you travel through the lands you are pitted against a variety of enemies and puzzles that block your path. You must hack and slash your way through your foes and chain together combos in order to do more damage and finish them off quicker.\n\nThe combat system actually turned out to be a lot of fun as it involved quickly stunning enemies, getting as many hits in as possible and then diving back out before you get hit. This can lead to some very tense albeit short battles that involve you having to be brave and tactical. The Combat Arena takes the combat to the next level pitting you against constant hordes of enemies to win score based on the number of enemies you defeat and rounds you clear. There are 4 levels to be played within the Combat Arena, each of which gets progressively more difficult. There is a leaderboard function on the game also, for you to compare your standing in the world however it was not working at the time of writing.\n\nAs I mentioned the game does not revolve entirely around the combat, there are in fact puzzles to solve in order to progress through the game. Although incredibly simple to solve they do offer a well needed variety to the game. They usually involved dragging an item with your mouse, or hitting certain posts to open a door, nothing too challenging but fun all the same.\n\nThe whole game is controlled by only the mouse which in fairness was all the game needed. You left click to move and attack, right click to roll/dodge and hit the middle button to fire your stun laser. Unfortunately the controls do feel clunky at times, especially when you are in the middle of combat and you really need to react quickly!\n\nMusically the game felt very vacant and desolate. The music that was playing in the background was generally quiet and didn't really create much of an atmosphere. A large portion of the time I found myself concentrating more on the sounds of my own footsteps than the music itself. The only real exception to this is when you are in the village and you stand near someone playing an instrument.\n\nArtistically is where the game really shows it's true potential. The artwork in this game is brilliant with some very interesting character designs, however the graphics really don't do them justice. Its a shame really as the game shows some true artistic potential which really hasn't been utilised.\n\nOverall I think the game had a lot of potential but unfortunately it wasn't able to capitalise on it's strengths. The price at time of writing is £3.99 on Steam which isn't too steep but it could do with being longer. Taking only around 2 hours complete you barely feel as though the game has begun when the end credits begin to roll.\n\n5/10 - Fun to play while it lasted but could do with polishing.","July 29, 2014","true","1.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

There are a good variety of bad guys to face that require different strategies, and both an up close attack and a ranged stun attack  There are a few puzzles, but nothing very difficult.   It has a cliffhanger ending, stating that there will be a next chapter, so if that kind of thing bugs you then steer clear, but I personally like short games that are fun throughout so it did not bother me.  I played with an X360 gamepad, it worked well, very intuitive controls and out of the box support and mapping.  I did run into a bug near the end, but a restart resolved it, otherwise no problems.

This poor-mans-bastion is very clunky in action and suffers from terrible controls. Your basic attack can only be used when enemies are seen and you walk towards them - this you can "combo" into 4 hits to different enemies by targeting them, each attack getting slightly more powerful than the last one. Sounds decent but NOOOOO. Computer says NO several times. Basically you just hit an enemy, use rolling to get away from it's attacks and get rewarded by a weird BLIMB-sound when the enemy is struck. After several hits it just falls down and you might get a health orb from it. It this point I was so excited by the fascinating gameplay that I vomited.\n\nAnimation is utterly, hideously deformed puppetry. Characters feel and look like paper models and even if it's artstyle decision it's so very wrong.\n\nQuests in this action rpg (buahahaha) consist of fetch quests through uninspired landscape fighting humanlike insects and avoiding being blasted by electric toilets that roam the country.\n\nFinally I got to fly this coppermade chicken, dodging stormclouds with epic flappy birds controls (seriously, it's just pushing a button to get higher) and to my surprise got an achievement "Flappy Birds".

The protagonist gets stuck in walls, walks to the wrong place and dies or gets stuck during cinematics, quest progress is reset when leaving an area (e.g. at the beginning do the tasks required by the weapon master, leave the area and return; the guards once again won't let you leave the camp and you have to do all the tasks once more). The controls are erratic, evasive action does not work half the time.\n* the enemies are boring, there is absolutely no challange in fighting them, even before obtaining the ranged weapon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/270330/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","In this game, developed by bitSmith Games out of Dublin, you will be playing the part of Ku a very undersized individual of a village that is in serious trouble. It turns out that someone has made off with the power ring that helped power the village, and now without it the village is in grave danger. You decide that you are the only one that can do the job so you are sent on an adventure to the outside world, a place that no one really knows about, and is said to be full of danger.\n\nGraphically the game looks like it was hand drawn by a very skilled artist. Unfortunately some of the effect of the art is ruined by the fact that the background layering on the screen mixed with your character's position is a bit all over the place. What I mean by that is that there are times where your character might accidentally lose his head, graphically, because of something that is supposedly behind the character but is being rendered in a layer in front of him. Overall, though, the enemies, other characters, and environments look amazing.\n\nThe music fits the game nicely and I could definitely listen to it even with the game not on. My one issue is that the settings for sound and music levels do not save from play session to play session. So if you have that perfect balance that you want in the game, you are going to have to either take a screenshot, to make sure you get it back the way that it was, or you are in for a rude awakening if you play the game a second time.\n\nThe controls are probably the thing that doom this game the most. I do not know what happened with the controls, but I can tell you that it was not good. I started off playing with the mouse, and apparently you should be able to play the whole game with just the mouse, but it turns out that my middle mouse button, or the wheel, did not register in the game, and you need for it to work to get you out of some situations, or to solve a puzzle. Thankfully the spacebar works as a substitute. Then I got to the flying portion of the game and found that no matter what buttons I pushed, including the left mouse button, which was shown on the screen to me, there was no key registering in the game, and I crashed and burned each time. Now that caused me to have to break up my gaming sessions because I needed to then find a controller to test the game with. When I plugged in the 360 controller I found that the mouse button now worked, but as I had plugged in the controller, I wanted to play the rest of the game with the controller. Sadly this was not a permanent solution for playing the game. Several times during my second play session I had to revert back to using the mouse because I could never get the precision, or the comfort of playing with the controller during battles. It was completely hit or miss.\n\nAlright so lets get into the actual game play. First off whomever wrote the script really should have read over it as there were some very odd choice of words used. I felt like they were trying to show how smart they could be by using seldomly used big words, instead of using language that would help the player better understand what was going on. There were also some glaring issues that drive an OCD person crazy. When entering a cutscene, if you were using the mouse chances were that you could be locked into a perpetual state of running during it, and since there were no voices to what was going on, all you could hear while you read the dialogue was the sound of your character running. Speaking of which, if you accidentally over-run the point in the level where you are about to face off against the fire bolg, it will kill you during the cutscene, literally every time. Oh and speaking of that beast, if you are stuck in a state of running when you finally have to face off against him, which you really don't get to do, you will see the cliff give way and your character will run FOREVER in the sky, and you can't advance the game. The final quick thing I have to say about this game is that it is an hour and a half game, with a to be continued slapped on the end. With that short of a playthrough, the developers should have added the to be continued on to this game.\n\nNow there was one thing that I think the game got right and that was the use of the power glove that your character had that allowed him to lift objects in the level and position them where you would like. Speaking of the levels, I think a map could have been nice in the game, and also if the game is supposed to be linear, point a to point b, type of game, they need to make entrances to different parts of the level disappear, block it, close a door on it, something because gamers will want to backtrack if they think they might have missed something. Alright, one last thing, the random load screens that have nice drawings on them, but don't really do anything for the game, except will not disappear until you have clicked on the button, or pressed the B key if you are using the controller, it feels like the artist had some more ideas that weren't put into the game and so this is how they displayed them. It would have been nice if the game just incorporated those into cutscenes.\n\nAlright so here's the deal folks, this could potentially be a good game, but they should have tested this game to its full extent, and also work out some of the obvious kinks in the game. I wish I could give this game a score based on potential, but that would be unfair, so I've got to say avoid this game, at least for now, and I give it a 3.7 out of 10.","March 25, 2014","false","1.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Which is a chore as it doesn't always save when you enter a new area, so chances are if you try to do manual backups you will end up replaying a lot of maps. Also, game can't be reloaded as exiting and reentering breaks controls. Have to restart for controls to respond again.\n\nAvoid.","March 21, 2014","false","7.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The best part of it was the art style and the "Celt-punk" mythology used in the game, a fresh take on things, but it's spoiled by mushy controls, tedious slogging around for overly simple quests, identikit maps, and downright bad sounds.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Beautiful and often evocative and/or creepy art, with some unique ideas.\n+ While there are Celtic fantasy games, this is the first technology-based idea I've seen, and that's creative.\n+ Some good music was struggling to get heard in some of the areas.\n+ The characters had an interesting basic design, and Ku seemed true to his namesake.\n+ The fighting progression was well done.\n+ Some fairly creative change-ups on the quest, with new challenges.\n+ Imaginative monster/villain design that needed different approaches for different monsters.\n+ Easy to figure out what to do in a particular challenge.\n\nCons:\n\n- Incredibly bad sound effects. Some very common sounds such as walking and fighting are actively obnoxious.\n- If you enter a cut scene while walking, you get to hear the obnoxious walking sound effect during the entire scene, because it doesn't stop the character from walking.\n- Some of the cut scenes should be more tightly scripted or meaningful. They steal control from the player and can be tedious to wait through.- Tedious quest design, with overly simple puzzles, and some quests which required slogging all the way back through long and empty maps.\n- Very little interactivity in most of the maps. So, interesting art but very little to touch or do. Very dull character interaction on most of the NPCs.\n- Poor/weird animation in many areas.\n- The map designs should be a little more distinctively landmarked; the maps hindered exploration a bit.\n- A little bugginess: fighting charges you to an opponent, and it's possible to bug onto an opponent in an area that you can't get down from, like a wall. (Workaround: reload the game; you have to do the fight again but it gets you off the wall.)\n- Mushy fighting which isn't very kinetic and it's not always apparent that your actions aren't taking effect.\n- Inferior writing. (There are bits that were funny, but sharper writing would have made this much better.)\n- Uneven pacing. (The beginning particularly is poorly paced.)\n- Short. (Not as much of a con at this quality level, but if the game were improved and had more to do, this would be a con.)\n\nAll in all, while it's not outright bad, it's not outright good either -- I find myself unable to recommend it, but it's a shame because I think this could have been a good game with more attention to quality.","July 2, 2015","false","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JTtheGhost/recommended/270330/","JTtheGhost","RadSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JTtheGhost/","337 products in account","Before you read the review be warned that I will be grading this on an "Indie curve" meaning less than 5 developers\n\nSound 5/10\n\nThe sound is position based and is confusing as to the point of origin of the sound most of the time, not to mention the sounds   are comparitive to sound samples from a bad EDM song.\n\nBattle system 6/10\n\nLacks any real depth, and most of the battle system is learning how to bug the enemies out so they can't hit you. Also your primary "slash" attack has the awesome ability to get you stuck in walls and in other places you don't belong and can't escape.\n\nBosses 2/10\n\nThe bosses of this game are all incredibly easy and short lived, and feel like normal enemies, except the final boss which felt more like the first real boss in the game, but still exceptionally easy. One of my major complaints is you don't heal your health after a boss though.\n\nArtwork 9/10\n\nThe art is gorgeous and was my primary attraction to the game, however it is hindered by bad coding to fit different screen resolutions and can look a little distorted depending on the resolution you are playing in, which disappointed me greatly.\n\nStoryline 2/10\n\nI started out with a great concept of what needed to be done and I talked to the whole village. I was continually disappointed by how everyone didn't react to any changes in the plot at the start, or the fact you had a sword. Then after you left the village none of it really related to the rest of the game and soon as you finish the "prologue" there wasn't really much of anything to the story besides run through a bunch of areas as fast as you can, and if you want, kill some enemies. Sure people would talk, but it didn't really mean much of anything, and made no real sense when you string all the sequences together. This is disappointing for an indie action adventure game as one of the easier tasks is to write dialogue that makes the story actually mean something and connect the pieces.\n\nBugs squashed 3/10\n\n*contains spoilers*\n\nOne of the major things I have always looked for, be it a flash game, or a normal game, is both major and minor bugs that inhibit the game, as well as exploits, crashes, etc. Well your main slash ability can put you in an area you can't move, enemies can sometimes still hit you even if you dodge roll away, double dialogues to someone that you're only supposed to talk to once, at the start of the game if you leave the sword training area you have to go through the whole screen's process again including all the training to get through the gate. In the final boss the "laser fields" are sometimes passable and sometimes not, and sometimes enemies get stuck on them making your slash the only way to get to them, leaving no way back if you don't leave an enemy around to slash to. Also at one point after exiting and reentering the game to get around this I had no HUD and couldn't see my health, which was great after the boss when I died first hit to one of the small mobs. Also as another note, in my display resolution (1366x768) I couldn't see discriptions for the hover overs in the escape menu either.\n\n*end spoilers*\n\nOverall 5/10\n\nBetween the bugs, the general ease of the game to beat it in <1 hour of time, and the lack of engaging story, I rate this extremely low, even with an indie curve. Some may not share my sympathies, but this could of been polished a lot more to make it far better than it ended up being.","June 22, 2014","false","1.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Sound design\nWhy the hell is my character constantly tapdancing, its so incredibly annoying to constantly hear his "TAP TAP TAP" with every freaking step, if you decide to make stepping sounds, do so without wanting the palyer to rip his ears out.\nThe same thing goes for every other sound, the swordhit is laughable, the shooting sounds weird, only the music sometimes manages to fit sometimes.\n\n2. Combat\nThe combat is case sensetive, meaning your character only swings his sword, whenever he feels like it, that lead me to hammering my controllerbutton, till he finally swinged his sword and even better I got stuck in one room, because an enemy, that I needed to kill, was hidden behind some texture, as you can't kill anything with your shot I was forced to quit the game all together, as there is no way to "reload" the room with entering and exiting, you just run into pure blackness, when you go towards the "entrance".\nFurthermore the combat is void of any strategy, I actually tried to play the game like you normaly would, dodge incoming attacks and hit and run, turns out its much better to just keep on beating on normal enemys and just avoid boss enemys, because just attacking the small guys leads to quickly finishing them off with the combos and makes them more likely to drop health items\n\n3.Bugs\nThere are several obvious bugs, for example in the end i had 10/8 stones in my overview, several achievments did not unlock and of course the game ending bug for me was that I could not kill the guy blocked by scenery, which wouldn't be a problem, if either my range attack would do more than stun, funny enough you would think that constantly shortciruiting a roboter will kill it after some time, or if the swordswing would not be depending on the enemy, as i'm sure I would have hit his hitbox otherwise\n\n\nIn the end the game is lacking in many things, its rather short, as I'm sure I was just about to finish the game before the bug hit, its very bug ridden, the combat is bad, the sound is annoying and that all is a shame because the world itself seems atleast interresting, even if you get to know next to nothing about it..which is also a shame.","May 29, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Around ~1.5 hours.\n\nIt's not awful, but not particularly good either. I would rather give this a neutral rating, but given the many negative ratings (which seems a bit unfair to me) I'll stick with a positive one - I didn't feel like I "lost two hours", but there are certainly many, many better games out there. Overall it feels like what you'd expect from a mobile port for a rather short adventure game.\n\nThe mouse only control scheme isn't as bad as I thought it'd be, but there are some places where you can briefly get stuck in the terrain (easy to fix, but the rate at which this occurred became annoying). There are some nice moments to the story, but as a whole it's rather bland, cliche, and unnecessarily leaves a lot of unknowns to make room for a sequel(s). The combat is boring point and click as you'd expect, with roll and stun features too. Like the movement it can feel clunky, but it's simple enough that it doesn't heavily detract from the game.\n\nIt's rather short, probably ~1.5 hours even with looking through every nook and cranny (I had some afk time). On a side note, if you expected this to be "thematically appropriate" for St. Patrick's day or other Irish festivities like I did you should look elsewhere. It has Gaelic names and one guy playing vaguely Irish music in the first act but that's about it; the rest looks more like Mad Max than Ireland.","March 18","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
