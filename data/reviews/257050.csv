The general sandbox activities of building and resource gathering are interesting, particularly wiring your base with power and lights.\n\nSadly that is where the upside stops. When I originally purchased this game in beta most all of the things you can now find in the “Future development plan & DLC” were to be included in the game by the time it was released. Especially the story and an ending for the game. An immersive story for a 2D sandbox was one of their main features at that time. However, now the designers have fallen on hard times and have decided to break those promises due to their need for funding. Additionally, work has effectively stopped on this game while they attempt to make a similar companion game to get more funding to finish this one. This information, along with a much longer explanation, can be found on a recent post of theirs on the official forums along with a passive suggestion that it is the purchasers fault for buying it on sale.\n\nI realize beta is a fickle thing and you might not always get exactly what you expected. This goes well beyond that however in my opinion. To be realistic, this game by the standards of their original plan is still in beta and was simply rushed to release in an attempt to gain further funding. I whole heartedly recommend against this purchase. The DLC may never arrive at this rate and most of it was originally supposed to be in the actual release. It strikes of an unethical approach to development even if they had the best intentions to start with which is suspect at this point.\n\n*UPDATE* It's been several months now since this change in the games direction with no recent news or updates from their main site. Given this was back on April 30th, it's probably fairly safe to assume the game is dead at this point with it being over 6 months.","April 30, 2015","false","32.4"," 194 of 211 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","194","211","2","4"

I no longer recommend this game, don't waste your money on it's current state!\nUpdated Introduction and Summary sections! -\n\n[ Introduction ]\nMy opinion about this game WAS very ambiguous: I couldn't say if it was worth buying or not. Now that I sinked in more hours to discover what the game's about, I must label it as DO NOT BUY.\nThe current major version of the game is 1.2 and there's too many bugs (including game breaking bugs), story progression is broken, and there are many unfinished features.\n\nHopefully the review below will shed light on people that haven't bought yet and are looking for an unbiased review (I'm not an early supporter nor an early hater).\n\n[ Overview ] :\nThis game is a cross of Under the Ocean and Terraria.\nIt's graphical style is very cool, with nice looking objects, equipment, armor, bases and world.\nAlso, a non-blocky-pixel-sandbox is a great change.\nYou're dropped in a planet that is very dark and the days are very short. The darker it is, the more frequent are monster spawns and some can even get tougher if you fight them in the dark (no worries on that, though, since your armors have lights - once you get some energy storage equipment).\nNote: I have no idea why a human ship is orbiting such planet and no idea why you crash land in a pod there.\nYou discover the backstory through datalogs you find during exploration.\n\n[ Positive Points ] :\n- Tutorial gets you through the basics, enough to move ahead.\n- Non-blocky-sandbox.\n- 3D characters on nice 2D environments.\n- Tech-tree and rich crafting system comprised of resources and components. Your tools, equipment and armors aren't made only of metal ingots - sometimes you need to make secondary components like rubber and silicon, or more complex ones like a dynamo or motor. It is a fresh and interesting crafting and discovery scheme with great potential.\n- Diverse lamps, technology, power and wiring makes base building look cool and planning ahead is necessary.\n- Digging/mining spread of 3 blocks or 1 block, toggleable.\n- When crafting or researching, the craft/research system takes resources from inside storage containers, like barrels and closets, so you don't have an inventory full of resources everytime you want to do something - you just have to be near your storage.\n- Some itens takes time to crafting or research, which feels better than "instant crafting" in this case.\n- Elevators, hover-platforms, switches, rifles..technology - nice features.\n\n[ Negative points ] :\n- ANOTHER game that puts "Survival" in it's description and features no survival at all. If "surviving" aggressive mobs is "survival", so all the games that feature aggresive AI is a survival game? There's no need for food, water or sleep, which made me wonder what's the fun in "surviving" an alien planet in this situation.\n- Technical-wise, the game feels like a beta. It seems that every technical detail was made to annoy the player. If you keep autosave on, it will interrupt your game abruptly and prints a big "SAVING YOUR GAME" title every time it autosaves, it's terrible. Graphics can't be tuned at all (except toggling 5 or 6 options). This makes playing on older machines really hard or even impossible. Also, turning off dynamic shadows breaks the (bad) lighting system. Last but not least, the game can crash everytime you try to exit it - in my case, forcing me to CTRL-ALT-DEL my way out.\n- Lighting system is weird (radius/spread/emanation) and annoying for a game that tries to be beautiful. It also doesn't look realistic - underground, you have to put way too many torches because of it.\n- Performance can be bad for no reason in many situations, leaving me to believe the game isn't optimized at all.\n- Movement system is annoying. Even if you tap a button, your character starts running, which looks bad and can give you many fall deaths (combine this with poor performance and autosave, guaranteed deaths).\n- The music, initially "Okay", gets repetitive and annoying really quick, and the sound-effects sometimes are awkward or way too loud compared to other effects.\n- Backgrounds look very ugly and out of place. Also, you can break very deep cave walls, and the background is usually a plain blue color that may or may not emanate light.\n- Resource gathering and base-building takes a long time compared to other games.\n- Research system feels weird: you waste the same resources to research a new item that you would use to craft it (also investing research points). It feels like a relabeled leveling system for crafting.\n\n[ Summary ]:\nBased on the points above, the game feels unfinished and lacking heart, which makes it, currently, a DO NOT BUY title. Plus, the devs had the boldness to launch it with no "Early Access" label.\nIt would show potential if it was a beta, but it seems the developers think it's safe to say it's an 1.0 (1.2 actually).\nEven for 10$, it's not worth getting in this: no one should launch an unfinished, buggy and broken game with no warning about it.\nIf the devs leave it in it's current state, this will just be forgotten.\nFor your current sandbox needs, go for Starbound instead - even in BETA it's more finished, polished and stable.\n\nI've ditched many hours and still haven't found what the game is about.\nDon't waste your time.","December 12, 2013","false","47.7"," 383 of 508 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","383","508","0","26"

Sadly that's a greenlight/early access speciality of devs. While the game is fun with the content so far see review below I don't intend to reward bad habits (like selling unfinished games) by recommending the game to anyone.\n\nDev goes on about act 2 etc. but updates indicate he's given up on this product or working on DLC\nor episode 2.\nIf you don't wanna support this behaviour, don't buy this game.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOld review:\nHad a fun time exploring the content of the game just after release. (31 hrs on record) Felt unpolished but the devs still add to the game and also Terraria wasn't quite finished after release. I'll be returning to the game once there's more content and the plot completed.\n\nAs you see on the pictures you explore a dark planet (as a stranded astronaut). Creatures spawn aggressively in the dark so you put up lights and build a shelter. You dig down to get rarer metals, craft better armors and weapons. You know the formula.\n\nLooks and atmosphere are the selling point as the game is prettier than some of its competitors and feels claustrophobic in the dark depths filled with horrors. Despite being a Terraria-like the game has its own feel to it unlike say "Edge of Space" which I still find slow-going with a cumbersome control.\n\nConcepts like electric wiring or rails aren't properly explained ingame but are fun once you figured out/read how they work.\n\nCan recommend for a fun experience and will only become better over time.","February 19, 2014","false","31.0"," 189 of 249 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","189","249","0","10"

Adding to this is the fact that the developers website has not had any news updates since 4/2015 and I think you can see that this game basically appears to have been abandoned.  There are still things to like about this game\n\nSo, with that said.  Would I recommend this game?  As the game stands today, in general, yes I would recommend this game under the following circumstances:\nYou get it on sale.  End of story on price.  Based on zero tangible activity for over 18 months and the fact the dev team has gone MIA for almost a year as of this writing, this game simply is not worth full price in the current state with no believable promise that this will change.\nYou can live without multi-player.\nYou have no illusions that the game may ever have any additional content added to it and if it is added, the devs last stated plans were to add content and extra playability as paid for DLC instead of free content to those who purchased it in good faith before it was completed as initially promised.  Yes, this is a bit of contention/disappointment for me and most people who bought it under the promise that there was more to come and we would be rewarded for our early support.\nIf those don't apply to you, I would suggest you wait to see if the devs ever decide to show up again or that you simply walk away completely as there are plenty of other games out there.\n\nWith that set of caveats out of the way and if you are still interested here are my thoughts on the game:\n\nI really like this game and I really like the unrealized potential this game has.  I personally am happy with my money investment (got it on sale for like 75% off) and won't feel ripped off if this is not developed any further.  There is not a lot of guideance in the game so you have to piece things together from game play and what little info you can gleen from the wiki and forums.  The building mechanics are pretty decent and I never really felt the game to be TERRIBLY grindy, although it does have some grindy elements as most sand box games do.\n\nHere are some pros (what I love) and cons that I personally feel the game has at this stage:\n\nWhat I love about the game\nThe developers are still involved in the game and add features based on feedback in the forums.  True in 2014, no longer true as of 4/2015 thru to this review update in 4/2016.\nThe developers have been releasing new beta fixes and release level patches every few months.   True in 2014, no longer true as of 4/2015 thru to this review update in 4/2016.\nThe Sci Fi theme as I have been a SciFi fan for a very long time (nearly 40 years)\nThe devs are involved with the community and respond to suggestions and bugs if you join the forums.  True in 2014, no longer true as of 4/2015 thru to this review update in 4/2016.\nThe graphics and music are engaging.  Just check the vids and pics for the game to get an idea of what I am talking about.\nThe concept of light as a strategic game element is used in a rather cool way that I have not been exposed to before.\nThe game offers a pretty decent challenge to newly created characters in normal mode.\nThe game has a story line that is intriguing to me, although it is incomplete at this time so it is more of an intro to the story line than a fully realized story line at this point.\nCons, which I would love to see change but have no reason to believe they will other than empty promises made a very long time ago.\nDevs have been MIA since 4/2015 and no game updates since late 2014\nNo mapping system.  There are tools to work around this a little bit (gps and radar), but if you like Terraria's mini map (I do) then this will be a dissappointment for you as well.\nIncomplete story line as mentioned before.  You basically get an intro story line and then it just abruptly stops as the content is not complete.\nsome minor placement bugs with wiring and devices.  with 1.3.1.2 I have not run into anything game ending, but prior to that patch level, there were some that would cause game crashes.\nNO MULTIPLAYER.  While I love the single player experience.  I have corrupted my daughter into being a gamer and she cannot enjoy this game with me like she can Terraria so that is a big disappointment for both of us at this time.\nIn summary, overall I have enjoyed roughly 200 hours of play time in this game with 3 different characters.  With the final character I have exhausted the story line as well as all of the extra "diary" entries you can find that give you a view into happenings for the lives of others who came before your character.  I am happy with my money investment and would recommend this for casual single player enjoyment.","November 5, 2014","true","287.2"," 107 of 141 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","107","141","0","0"

Actually playing the game proved that screenshots didn’t lie: Darkout is by far the most beautiful game in 2D sandbox exploration/building genre, and while I believe that graphics isn’t that important, great graphics like this certainly adds to enjoyment.\n\nGraphics aside, Darkout has decent crafting and building system; there is a fair (but by no means spectacular) selection of decorative items to craft, and some interesting features, like research system or necessity to connect most advanced work stations to your base’s power grid.\n\nOverall, Darkout has interesting early to mid-game. Finding resources and progressing can be quite challenging, as even early enemies can be deadly when you are poorly equipped, and environment itself can present hazards like long falls or deadly tar pits. As you progress through the game, however, the challenge diminishes, not increases: while you start encountering stronger enemies, their strength increase doesn’t match your stronger weapons and armor, and eventually even hardest areas become a walk in a park with late-tier sword and armor.\n\nAside from drastically diminishing challenge, as you keep playing you will eventually find Darkout rather lacking in variety: there are only 3 surface biomes, not counting very small and very empty coastline biome, and flying islands biome that looks the same as surface jungle biome (other than being composed of flying islands, naturally). There are several different underground layers, but only major difference between them is the music and what kinds of resources you can find there. Also, there is only one boss, and it can only be fought after a rather long questline.\n\nIn the end, despite its flaws, Darkout is a good enough game, and if you are a fan of 2D sandbox exploration/building genre, Darkout will likely give you many hours of enjoyment.","March 8, 2015","true","107.6"," 80 of 104 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","80","104","0","0"

I'll try to be as non-partisan as possible.\n\nWith the explosion of greenlight games and the large number of 'Metroidvania' sandbox style games on Steam, it's hard to make one stand out from the rest. Darkout, like Terraria, or Starbound, takes yet another approach at these sandbox style games, but, of course, is still very much the same.\n\nIndeed, Darkout is much the same old grind. Spending hour upon relentless hour, mining through piles of the same dirt, and rock, only to fill your inventory and discard, rinse and repeat. Just enough to get you the resources to build an elevator to reach the depths of the shaft you just dug. With the same old spotty mouse targeting as others, a horrible grouping system for mining, a terribly inaccurate crafting system, and a slew of other annoying bugs, it is tedious at best during these hours, searching for resources, and can often be a real chore, during these times, to play.\n\nIt has more base in sci-fi than others in it's genre, even more so than Starbound, only short of having a spaceship and being able to explore a number of alien worlds. With crafting devices like the Combinator, the Molder, and the Chem-Lab, weapons such as the Laser gun, and fusion based power devices, it's a sci-fi sandbox geek's dream come true. Coupled with a fragmented, yet deeply frightening storyline, and some absolutely dazzling light effects and much better graphics and visuals, overall, Darkout is a step ahead of the rest. With a fairly extensive research/tech/crafting tree and some fun and interesting exploratory and combat scenarios, heavily focused on the use of light, Darkout is, again, in a class of it's own.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=259009998\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=259011002\n\nA key thing to remember is that being another 'early release' title, or beta, at this point, the small Independent Developers, Allgraf ---- http://www.darkoutgame.com/ are slowly, but surely, diligently churning through bug fixes and adding new content for upcoming stages of the game, including more story, new monsters and biomes and of course, more craft items.\n\nWhile I might not recommend it, at this time, for anyone who is easily frustrated, I am excited for the future of this great game, and can imagine recommending it to any player who enjoys this genre of game, and possibly even players who don't, upon the game's completion.\n\nIn short, after all of that, Darkout is an absolute GEM.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Talishan/recommended/257050/","Talishan","Talishan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Talishan/","144 products in account","So i purchased this game back in beta and played it a bit, I leave my games open on steam when I'm sleeping and such, so I've played it about 1/3 what my profile shows.  That's still enough to get a good feel for the game.  Back then I stopped playing because there were some pretty game breaking bugs when you got far down the tech tree and the story was almost non existent and what was there was pretty buggy.  So I stopped playing to wait for the game to be finished, quite happy with my taste of the game and looking forward to the full version.  I've checked on it a few times since then, but now it's been over a year and I find this... the game will never be finished.  They released it without finishing all the things that I was promised and want more money for DLC that will finish the game.  Considering how badly they've neutered themselves with this move, it's more likely they will never make this DLC anyway.  To top it all off, they complain that the reason is people buying it on steam sale... well I'm pretty sure I bought it at full price, I remember something like $14.99, because I believe in supporting indie games and I could afford it at the time.  Insulting players who couldn't afford or didn't want to pay that much is just wrong.  Having said that, I paid $14.99 for a game that will never be finished and has the same features set as games you can get for 4.99-9.99... Now I don't mind that per se, but I spent that money expecting the features that were promised, I may have been able to afford the game, but I'm not rich, that 14.99 could buy me a game that I will actually enjoy, because I'll never get to play this game for 100s of hours like I wanted to when it was finally finished. That being said, below is my review on the parts of the game that exist.\n\nPros:\n*Very nice aesthetic, lighting effects and such.  For a 2-D game it's quite beautiful.\n*Interesting Research and fun building, you can do some cool stuff farther up the tech tree\n*This game can suck up a good deal of time, it's addictive to a point, but there's a limit\n\nCons:\n*Game becomes repetitive after awhile, mostly due to lack of content, there's plenty of sandbox building, but not much else\n*Game is still relatively buggy, and world files can actually become corrupted, forcing you to start on a new world\n*Story may as well not exist, the story elements are boring, there are no real quests or missions, every bit of it is basically "go find these capsules that have your quest items in it and then come back and put them in your satelite dish.\n*ORIGINAL PROMISES NOT MET - that's the killer for me right there.\n","August 7, 2015","false","97.3"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","39","48","0","0"

I really can't think of any other points at the moment\nCons:\nThe story in this game is forgettable and uninteresting.\nPoor audio editing (certain audio logs contain the voice actor/actress doing a line multiple times)\nGame physics are very strange at times (falling the same distance at the same speed after activating a jetpack once in mid-air does significantly less damage than falling the distance normally)\nThe UI is occasionally a bit clunky and sometimes assumes actions you did not take\nControls in general feel unresponsive occasionally\nCombat is an abysmal wreck, hit detection is very poor and usually works in the enemy's favor (their attacks can hit multiple times per attack)\nEXTREMELY LUCK-HEAVY QUESTS, obvious padding\nThe game is WAY too dark, even for a game called "Darkout" and taking place on a different planet where darkness is a prevalent gimmick (seriously, 18 hour nights)\nThe amount of different, large, power-sucking devices required throughout the game to do separate actions is absurd\nHAS FREQUENT STABILITY ISSUES, crashes, slowdowns, inexplicable framerate drops\nIn summary, if you must buy a 2D sandbox game and you already own Terraria, buy Starbound instead. If you own Starbound too, look into other games, but this game is not worth full price. Not by a long shot. Get this from a bundle or a huge sale if you must have this game for some reason.\n\n...\n\nFor those curious about how I managed to spend over 150 hours on a game I hate, I didn't. 35-40% of that time is from me keeping the game in the background while I was watching videos or screwing around with Akinator.

Not just form the beautiful graphics and art style, but from the story that is told to you through various ways. Between the creepy text data modules you find while exploring, to the audio ones with some very creepy messages, to the beacon that you set up from the start. This game has a very sci-fi thriller theme.\n\nOn top of this it has a very detailed crafting system. A system that is backed by a very deep and rewarding reserch tree. You must explore and mine to collect resources that allow you to further your research and give you access to new crafting items and materials. The research trees are quite large and you will be finding new and great technologies for tens of hours while playing. It's not something you just can blow through quickly. There are double digit tiers of research that have dozens of new items, weapons, armors, devices, building material, etc. in every tier. The more you research the more crafting options unlock, as well as higher end research options.\n\nYou also have to deal with powering up many of your machines and finding ways to keep your bases powered up. Be it through fuel, or various generators having a good power setup will keep your base fully operational. This is a nice touch for this genre and isn't a micromanaging thing. Once you figure out how to use it and create enough power you will not have to worry about it. You just need to figure out how to wire things properly and make sure you have enough power generators to keep the lights on! IF devices and lights are blinking...you know you need more power sources.\n\nWhile this game has a fascinating and creepy story it still is part of the whole sandbox genre that Terraria was a part of. You still must build a shelter, gain access to devices and crafting equipment, and can build a massive base if you choose to. The game even has a building mode that you are basically free to build with no distractions , or need to unlock anything. As you research you have things like elevators, jetpacks, an enormous amount of light sources, and tons of furniture to build as much as you like. There really is some amazing tech.\n\nThe game uses a darkness mechanic in which enemies can become stronger, or weaker when confronted by light. They thrive in darkness and can spawn from it. Even in your own shelter if you fail to provide enough light! You have dozens of weapons such as melee swords, guns, crossbows, grenades, and many more as well as things that allow you to emit light in some ingenious ways. The armors you can make are beautiful and have some very interesting functions. You can equip accessories as well to give you even more passive abilities as you explore.\n\nYou still do a lot of mining for resources of course so the game goes underground to darker caves and not just left and right. You can even go up into the sky once you figure out how to get there. :)\n\nThis is a game that just gets better the deeper you go into it. The world seems to slowly change as you get stronger. Gets darker and creepier as you go further and learn interesting stories throughout the main quest. If you are looking for a happy experience with fuzzy animals and sunshine you will not find it here. This is a sandbox game that is set in darkness.\n\nThere are a few small bugs early on, but the developers are very active in fixing them and have taken polls aobut what the best ways to implement new control options could be. The game is FULL release even if the store page suggests it is in Stage 1. The wording is a bit off, but the new stages are new features that are going to be added in the coming months for free, including Multiplayer.\n\nI purchased this game when it was in kickstarter as well as Starbound at roughly the same time...back in 2012, and have been eagerly awaiting Starbound much more than I was Darkout. By some strange coincidence, BOTH games were released on Steam on the exact same day. The dilemma of which to play was there from the start, but after playing both I have found myself playing strictly Darkout since the first few days I had with Starbound. Since Starbound is extremely early in Beta, and we have had a character save wipe already, I have not even touched it since maybe a week ago, while I am playing Darkout constantly. The early beta of Starbound has actually been a bit of a positive since it allowed me to dedicate more time to Darkout.\n\nI recommend you check this game out and don't even bother trying to compare it to games like Starbound or Terraria. This game is MUCH darker, and the art style is leaps and bounds above the others.","December 13, 2013","true","48.9"," 40 of 59 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","40","59","0","5"

Exploring new zones, finding rare artifacts in which I can use for research and development for advance weapons. Find clues on that has happen on the planet.

Before I even get into it, I'm going to say this game is quite like Terraria in the sense you're plopped into a world without being told much of anything. You have similair freedoms and goals to do to progress, you build a shelter, mine some ores, but unlike Terraria, Darkout has you research new things you can craft which is a system that works pretty well. As for starbound, comparing starbound to darkout isn't exactly fair as Starbound is in beta and these two games aren't trying to do the same thing at all.\n\nThis game has a heavy sci-fi element, which is a nice change of pace from being in a psuedo-fantasy setting. You'll be utilizing high tech things like the Combiner to craft stuff, creating and using guns with special ammo, and a bunch of other neat stuff I haven't learned how to do yet. Obviously it has high emphasis on crafting, but it's different from Terraria in the sense that you need to research new recipes rather than pure trial and error. If you should ever run out of things to research, try to find and decode data modules from salvagable wreckage scattered on the planet's surface, or craft things you researched as this may open up new opportunities.\n\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, you start the game having crashlanded onto some weird shadow-dimensional planet with things from bioluminescent forests, to strange occultish outlands. I'll go ahead and list the positive things about this game. The art style, graphics, and especially the lighting is incredible, I've never seen 2.5d done this well, I was pretty impressed with how awesome my mining area ended up looking when at the end of the day it's just a series of caverns. One of my favorite things in this game is the "Auto" feature that's assigned to slot 1 left mouse, it basically means you don't need to put an axe/pickaxe/shovel on your hotbar and manually equip them just to chop trees/mine ore, it does all that for you upon using the function. Tools don't have durability either as far as I can tell, so you won't be needing to craft new ones every 5 minutes.\n\nNow for the negative things I have to say about the game. The animations on both the player and monsters can be strange sometimes but that's the least of the bad things. The tutorial doesn't tell you several essential things to know, such as Shift+Right Mouse will pick up already placed torches/furniture/items you dropped on the ground. The controls are somewhat clunky, but you'll get used to them pretty fast. While the game has a decent soundtrack and great atmosphere, the sounds mobs make when you hit them are really badly done which I found pretty strange.\n\nAs for the combat, it's a bit worse than Terraria's, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the combat is awful as I find it mediocre at best. You seem to be fighting strange shadow creatures, as far as I can tell you need to use both light to get their shields down, then you can hurt them with generic physical damage. I've just been using my Glow Torch as a melee weapon since it's both emitting light and doing physical damage. If you played Alan Wake, you know how the story goes with shadow creatures.\n\nOverall, do I recommend this? Yes, but only if you liked games such as Terraria. I would recommend Starbound as well, but I can't say I like Starbound better than Darkout, nor Darkout better than Starbound. They're both really good in their own ways, plus Starbound is far from finished so it's not exactly fair to make a comparison just yet as Darkout is not an early access title.","December 6, 2013","true","4.9"," 69 of 112 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","69","112","0","0"

I guess I wanted to switch to a more sci-fi setting after dealing with bows and arrows for so long. I like the crafting progression, e.g. you don't use the useless torch the entire game like in some cases but move up to better lights. Also the user interface improves usability a lot in some cases. I love the AUTO feature, where you just have all the tools (axe, shovel, etc.) in your inventory and then the game automatically selects the correct one. I never realized how much of a useless chore it is to change between different tools manually. Also there are other nifty features, like opening two containers and moving stuff between them without actually having to pick it up yourself, etc. I also like that you can extract more valuable resources (copper, iron, etc.) from sand and stone (albeit not very efficiently, which is good for balancing reasons). Instead for having chestfuls of useless dirt and stone (I don't like to throw stuff away), you can simply chuck it all into the machinery and convert some of it to better materials. The game is not perfect, but I am having a lot of fun playing it. The most important thing is that they are still improving it. And the essential thing is that it's not alpha or beta or whatever that smells like early access. The game is done and playable as it is, so you don't have to wait forever for them to develop it and wipe your world in the process. I'm going to stop talking now and go play the game some more.

Good to see Steam Greenlight in action. Great game so far. I've lost a lot of time with this already during the beta exploring and building my bases and spelunking into the depths of the world. I look forward to seeing this game evolve and expand in the future. There is so much room for expanding this game with more biomes and enemies in future patches.\n\nGraphics are very nice to see in action. The lighting and fog is something you need to see in motion before it settles in just how dang atmospheric it all is! The game sure as heck does not look procedurally generated either. Nice terrain and deco that looks more akin to what you would expect from hand crafted levels in other 2d games. The list can go on for ages I am sure but I have not seen everything this game has to offer yet. I look forward to what’s in store!\n\nThe logs system reminds me of System Shock 2 and Unreal 1 with its story progression. It’s there for those folks that love their world and lore development, but not intrusive like so many other games these. Finding other abandoned camps and supplies in the world gives the sense that you’re always just one step behind some other survivors in the world.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone that likes to build their worlds and get lost exploring alien landscapes. There is a cool, creepy, lonely atmosphere that keeps you wanting to see what is just over the next hill. Then again I’ve run back screaming to my base a few times with those bloody evil shadow wolves and their sonic howls…. Fun times!\n\nGive this game a try and keep it installed.

Your character feels "floaty" and is prone to getting stuck, the enemies are sometimes so vague and non-chalant that you don't even realize they're enemies until they've started to attack, and at the very beginning of the game, I found I had to murder myself because I began skipping the never-ending slew of tutorial pop-ups, only to find out I can't progress without my (now unreachable) ship salvage.\n\nIt seems like there would be a promising game underneath the surface, but in its current state it's a muddled, hand-holding mess that relies extensively on the use of control-map tooltips to give some of the most basic information, and then entirely omits the simplest things, such as how to remove a placed object, or pick one up that you've (inevitably) accidentally dropped.\n\nRiddled with odd typos, frustrating HUD, UI and crafting elements, Darkout feels bizarrely unfinished for a completed product, and plays more like an Early Access title.  I still find myself desperately wanting to enjoy it, but buyer beware:  This is not something that you'll find you can pick up and play without scouring through clunky tutorials just to figure out where they put that damned button.\n\nIf it's "Terraria in space!" you're looking for, just go invest your time in Starbound.  This would have been an intriguing title had it come out a year or more ago, or had it more time to be polished into something that didn't require that you were all but forced to read in-game manual after in-game manual just to learn how to play the game, rather than the game teach you how its played in way that's more interesting than shoving your face in a textbook and inhaling.","December 4, 2013","false","0.5"," 224 of 397 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","224","397","0","18"

Anyone who has played Terraria will know more or less what to expect in this game. Procedurally-generated world, exploration, resource collection, crafting, etc. A lot of basic Terraria concepts and mechanics still apply. In particular, digging a "hellevator" (a mine shaft straight down to the magma-filled lowest levels of the world, with water at the bottom to break your fall) is just as useful in this game.\n\nThe things that are notable with this particular game:\nHi-fi graphics that capture much more detail than the pixelart graphics used in most Terraria-clones.\nLightness / darkness mechanism. The darker your surroundings are, the more likely that things-that-go-bump-in-the-night are to spawn around you, and the stronger these dark monsters are.

While I can't disagree with that, to a degree, Darkout carries with it a much more fun atmosphere for me. The gameplay itself is great, with all the things that I've taken to enjoying from games from the Terraria format but the addition of light being used as a kind of weapon, I love that mechanic. Couple that with significantly better graphics than it's counterparts and it's a fully functioning game. Darkout is by far my favorite of this genre at this point. Add in also that it actually feels SCI-FI, which the others don't do until late, late tiers, and it takes the cake for me.\n\nThe only two really annoying things that I've found is that the game doesn't tell you the importance of the destroyed beacons you pick up and that it has a tendancy to crash due to what seems like autosave issues. SAVE THE BEACONS. You need something like 6 to progress the story. And you can turn off autosave which seems to help with the crashing issue, just manual save.\n\nOverall, I recommend Darkout for a great single-player experience of the Terraria-style gameplay.

They game is supposed to have an end but dosent yet. We were told there would be 4 stages of development but before the second one was released they abandonded that devlopment style along with the multiplayer and other features that "Stage 2" was supposed to have. If you want a sandbox game there are 3 other games(not including Terraria the grandfather of the 2d sandbox genre) who although they are all still in Early Access have more content and are in a more complete state. I personnaly dont care about multiplayer, the fact that they abandoned it entierly, or the fact that they released an unfinished game as 1.0(plenty of EA, and Early Access, games have done so too). The main problem is that this game is Supposed to have and End(you will be able to keep building after the end), and it does not.

It's set on a world of perpetual night, and it manages to make it look amazing with the different zones all looking spectacular.\n\nThe combat is pretty frantic, especially when you get into the game and start coming across the different enemy types, all of which have their own little set of abilites and attacks to deal with instead of the far too common 'just give it more HP and make it red' style of enemy progress. It can get a little bit too hectic towards endgame though, with enemy spawns becoming extremely rapid. By that point you can just ignore them though.\n\nBuilding is fun and fairly satisfying, watching your wooden hovel evolve into a high tech fortress is never going to stop being enjoyable and the tech progression is both big and fairly straightforward too. There's a fair few different 'this looks like a wall from Star Trek' type backgrounds and walls you can build with, but they are all kinda the same so that's a downside for the people who have to build that perfect unique base. You do need to wait for different items to be researched once you have the components, and there are build times too, which some people find annoying. I never had a problem with them, I just queued a few things up and went and did some renovations.\n\nThe real problem with this game is that it is not better known.

For better picture about game development I reccomend to visit developers homepage, where the atmosphere  is less trollzy and "steamy".  There are still plenty of things planned to be added, include multiplayer.\n\n*Thumbs up* from me without any doubt, I've got my investment back in form of entertainment, and there is much more to come.","February 19, 2014","true","69.4"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","0"

I understand it is technically still being added to, although it is no longer in beta, but it feels far more complete to me than many other Early Access/Early games in the same genre that I have played. As the game stands now, it has furnished me with many hours of entertainment and I have still not maxed out all of the tech trees or fully explored the world I generated. In general, my rule for buying games that are not yet finished, is this: If, hypothetically, development on this game stopped tomorrow, would I still enjoy playing it? And I feel that with Darkout, the answer is probably yes.\n\nIf you are familiar with 2d sandbox-style sidescrollers like Terraria and Edge of Space, you will feel at home here. However, what Darkout does differently is adds light as a game mechanic, since the world you are building on is never fully illuminated, and enemies both spawn and gain health in darkness. There are several beautiful glowing plants that spawn and will keep you from dying before you set up your homebase, but you'll very quickly find that creating light sources will become your primary occupation. Once you've progressed further down the tech tree, your options for creating light sources become more elaborate, and you can create your own wonderland of lights just for the heck of it, if you like. I should probably also mention that this game does not have very many RPG elements, which is a big plus in my book. One of my gripes with other sandbox games is that they relied too much on random drops or big boss fights to get to the next level of crafting.\n\nThere is a storyline in the game, but finishing these quests is optional and shouldn't interfere with the rest of the game. As far as I know, you can completely ignore it if you wish, and still manage to find every ore, tool, machine, etc. while you build to your heart's content.\n\nIt is true that some of the building systems in the game are a little bit unintuitive, and if that's something that tends to get on your nerves, you will probably be unsatisfied, as I did find myself having to look a few things up here and there. However, having grown up with older games in which this was much more common, it's never particularly bothered me. The graphics in the game are quite lovely and allow for some really impressive building options. I suppose one of my gripes is about the music, which resembles the sort of track you'd find in a space-themed action movie these days. I guess it fits, but I get a little bit annoyed after a while, since it is tense, and I feel like the pace of the game is slower and a bit more peaceful.\n\nTl;dr version:\nPROS\n- Looks great\n- Huge tech tree, lots of crafting options\n- More based on crafting than roleplaying\n- Multiple options for gathering ores\n- Playing with light and colors is fun!\n\nCONS\n- Crafting is sometimes unintuitive\n- Music gets annoying at times\n- A few other small gripes which don't break the game: (Trees don't currently respawn, Game occasionally gets interrupted by autosave)","July 16, 2014","true","11.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The label 'mixed reviews' is not doing it any justice, like Edge of Space. Glad I am sometimes looking through the label 'mixed'. This game is awesome! That being said, I bought it after the latest december patch.\n\nAbout the game:\nDarkout is a craft and survive game with the most beautiful graphics I ever saw in the genre. The devs put very much detail and hard work into this game making it look this way. You are basically crashed on a mysterious planet and have to do 'missions' to progress while you craft a solid base and unlock more tech as you progress.\n\nPro's:\nEven a small world is big, this game is big.\nExtensive crafting system\nBeautiful graphics and sound effects\nExcellent gameplay-mechanics\nHigh replayability\n\nCon's:\nNo interactive tutorial, mostly text so it has a very steep learning curve. Prepare to have google and the community at hand. But once you learn the mechanics, you're addicted!\n\nThis great game is needs to reviewed again by the previous negatives. As it is now, you'll get more than enough gameplay for your money. It has very few bugs left (at least as far as I have played) and is lots of fun. When the positives go up, the game will get sold more. This game needs to get sold more. For maybe more content and a part 2.

I think it is a great game and have logged many hours on it. I also feel the game will be even better going forward. The graphics are the best for this genre of game. For the peopel complaining about performance issues.... well your computer must be well past old to have any and it would be time to upgrade. The game runs smoothely for me with no crashes. The only issue as far as bugs I have come across is dying while going down on a long elevator ride.\n\nThis game is not finished but they never said it was.

I would also not complain about a slight boost in light radius either, but that can be moded in the future :D\n\nOverall the game is not finished but is quite wall polished for being in phase 1 of 4.

I decided to try it out since it seemed similar to Terraria which I quite enjoyed. I read up a bit ahead seeing people saying that it was just another "Terraria-clone" and even more saying that it could hold its own - I will join the ranks of people who think this is a great game that brings new things to the "Terraria"-idea.\n\nThere is no denying this game is very similar to Terraria, meaning a lot of what made that game fun is present in this game - advancing your knowledge through exploration, research and crafting . However, I definitely enjoy the building part a lot more in Darkout than I did in Terraria. In Terraria it only felt like a necessary evil to get further down the layers, whereas in this game the building is more intricate and detailed, giving more options and satisfaction as you discover new things.\n\nDarkout also offers a story, which although I have not yet got far through seems really interesting and was something I missed in Terraria.\n\nEverything isn't 100% intuitive and I struggle to figure out pretty much the same things I did when playing Terraria, how to interact with objects and how to make them interact with eachother, but it's never been anything that's annoyed me. The game is incredibly dark (hence the name I guess!) initially and I remember thinking that you need painfully many lights to see anything, but that's a hurdle quick overcome given some exploration and time.\n\nSome have complained about buggyness which is something I have not encountered yet while playing.\n\nOverall I really recommend this game if you had any fun with Terraria and/or similar explore+create adventure games. It offers just the same amount of "just a little bit more mining so that I can craft X" as the best of the genre.","June 14, 2014","true","51.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I find the crafting, mining, and exploring - while not totally intuitive - very entertaining, it's mainly because of the fact you're not told much - and are left to work out what the hell is going on, and what you've got to do - that makes it entertaining.\n\nThere's plenty of stuff to do in Darkout: build structures, dig tunnels, find resources, run out of resourses - find some more, slay the creepy denizens of Toxteth (my randomly generated world!), research and craft better kit and machines to help you slay those denizens. Granted, other games have done this, and in a similar style - but Darkout has the added bonus of excellent 2.5D graphics, good lighting, and some nice effects that give the game a kind of dark - but also colourful - atmosphere. Darkout also has the added bonus of being quite a relaxing game to play, mainly because of the contrasting darkness and vibrant colours.\n\nIn summary: Darkout deserves a lot more recognition, it reminds me in a way of the old 2D Metroid games - it has a similar feel when playing - with a liberal dash of Minecraft thrown in. I really like the game, but be warned... they mostly come at night.... mostly.","June 18, 2014","true","59.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Gorgeous graphics & haunting sound effects make for an extremely atmospheric game. I have played pretty much all of the recent 'sandbox block builders' like Terraria, Starbound, Edge of Space, Windforge, Asteria, Signs of Life, etc and I find Darkout to be the most enjoyable Single Player experience yet. It has a great many sci fi items to craft and the building mechanic is very easy and fast to use, similar to Starbounds and superior to Terraria imo. Combat is fast paced and fun with the weapons responsive. I have been playing the game exstensibly now for about a week and have yet to see a single crash, it is very stable. The gfx are smooth with no performance issues whatsoever and the character is easily controllable. The spelunking is great fun and ive often found myself saying 'im off to bed' only to still be awake many caves later! A very enjoyable experience so far and Im looking forward to seeing the new content thats been promised by the devs.\n\nIf, like me, you have read some of the negative reviews and posts for this game and are 'umming and ahhing' about purchasing because of it then id really advise you to give Darkout a chance. I have yet to experience any of the so called game ending bugs or glitches and ive been playing it all day solid for the last few days. The only bug I have found is a very minor irritation at most, sometimes when dragging an item out of your inventory the item will be dropped from your cursor to the floor or placed in a storage device if you happen to be stood near one. Finding the next Story log can be a bit random but the devs have said there will be more story structure to come. On a final note the only thing lacking is a co op mode to play with your mates, once that is included, as the devs have said it will be, then I think Darkout will be a real gem of a game.\n\nUPDATE :\nAfter 100+hrs of play there are a couple of things I should add to the above. Firstly there could be alot more variety to the mobs, yes there are several types but they do all feel a bit samey. Whilst I stand by what I said previously that the audio is nice there is a distinct lack of ambient sounds. Whilst not immediately apparent it can make the world feel a bit more sterile than it would otherwise and as the gfx are so atmospheric the ambient audio can be conspicuous by its absence. Finally the main issue I had after so many hrs of play is the definite lack of endgame content. On Terraria I have over 300+ hrs mainly due to endgame content that I played with a friend but there really is nothing to do in Darkout endgame other than building projects once all research is done and you have explored all biomes.\n\nI have still had a great time playing Darkout even with the negative aspects above and £10 for 100+ hours of entertainment is a great deal by anyones standards, so still very recommended just be aware of the longevity of it in its current form. According to the developers there is alot more content to come so hopefully that will address the issues mentioned here.","March 15, 2014","true","117.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Why Darkout in particular? Well, the standard answer is if you liked the others, you should like this one. What makes this different? The lighting & light mechanics are the new thing, aside from the graphics being a lot less pixel-y than the others. The graphics really are nicely done, even at this early stage (with limited character appearance choices). The lighting effects are cool, and the availability of light is very import... even more than just knowing where your character is going. Light helps manage the shadow creatures on the planets, and this is even more obvious when you start delving underground or otherwise expanding your mastery over the world.\n\nIs the game worth it? Yes, as an Early Access game, there's enough to warrant a buy. Is it better than Edge of Space or Starbound? If you care more about graphics & lighting, and the impact of light on exploration & survival (i.e. more horror/survival than Starbound's survival-y survival), then consider this one. Until they are all finished, it's hard to say one or the other will be the best purchase, however.","December 30, 2013","true","2.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The world that your character crash lands onto is inevitably filled with so much murky darkness that it’s sometimes hard to tell exactly where you are inside of the game. Darkness also conveniently spawns creatures ranging from flying jellyfish to dogs to giant bugs, all of which want to eat you and teleport you back to your base. Once you run out of the game’s initially provided light sources and you’re scavenging in the darkness with threats all around you trying to find enough goop to fit in a jar so you can see for a few minutes, you’ll begin to wonder what else you could be doing with your time.

I'll break the game down into a few categories, make an analysis, and then leave it up to the reader whether or not the game is worth the price.\n\nGraphics:\nArguably the least important part of the game, but let's start here.  The style used is a bold attempt to use more modern graphics (in contrast with terraria and minecraft) into the sandbox arena.  While the graphics do create a beautiful environment in the few biomes I've been in so far, to overall feel is admitedly a bit awkward.  A few times I've been hit by jellyfish floating behind trees that I cant even see!  The graphics style changes the way you interact with the environment.  For the first time (that I've seen), blocks are no longer immediatley distinguishable.  This makes it harder to build precise sized structures, but it makes things look much better when they're done.\n\nControls:\nThe first comment I have is about the wonderful idea to map pairs of items to the hotkey bar.  It's very intuitive and maximizes the use of the mouse.  However, since I'm not used to mapping things way, it makes it a bit difficult to think of useful pairs.  Otherwise, the rest of the controls are fairly obvious.  However, there are a few controls that are less obvious, but I'll mentin that in the next section.\n\nGameplay:\nSo unlike most sandbox games, there is a fairly detailed story.  When you create your first world, you get introduced both to the game and to the controls via a tutorial.  The tutorial seemed a little awkward and unresponsive, and didn't mention things I didn't already know like how to pick up an item (it's shift+right-click BTW).\n\nAnother key point to this game is the research system.  Everything you do gets you research points, and you use research points to research new items to create.  Instead of having the ability to build everything off the bat, you have to find and discover resources and then research various uses of them.  It's pretty cool.  Another great thing is that you dont have to constantly consult the wiki on how to build something (sometimes in terraria, always in minecraft).  You can view every possible thing you've researched at any time and see what the ingredients are, regardless of if you have them in your inventory.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile it has its flaws, the game is still very fun to play.  Considering the fact that the game is still being worked on extensivley, I see no reason to judge its flaws too critically.","December 6, 2013","true","25.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

A side scrolling platform game and a crafting game.\nThe introduction of this game beautifully presents the game well with detailed graphics and a good opening soundtrack.\nMy first impressions of this game was frustration but with a little time I began to understand the idea of the game and it's goals. The main storyline is a little weak at the moment. So you are left to work things out on your own. However I do believe the creator's are currently working on the storyline.\nThe crafting element of this game is like solving one process which then reveals more crafting processes to solve. The rewards for creating something new is satisfying as it is something new you can place in you own designed shelter. I would not go as far to say that the designs of shelters in the game are endless but there are a lot of layout possibilities.\nThere is no time challenges whatsoever in this game which makes it an enjoyable logical problem solving game. So even if you have crashed landed on a unknown planet there is a relaxing attitude to the ongoing problems ahead of you.\nThe challenges it presents do become addictive after a couple of hours of play. It is one of those games that will keep you returning now and again for more. It's replay value is good as you can create something a little different in a new location every time.\nThe in-game graphics are nicely detailed creating beautiful alien world environments. The lighting in the game looks natural and the glowing effects of plants and creature work well in the alien environments.\nThe sound effects are done well adding to the atmosphere of the alien world around you.\nControls are simple but can be a little annoying at times however you set them up.\n\nThis is a good game to get involved in. I definitely recommend this game. As it is a Greenlight game it is by far complete. But with a bit more work this game could potentially be fantastic. The creator's of this game appear to be listening to the players and are actively responding.","December 11, 2013","true","73.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The UI is very clunky, the game buggy and development extremely slow. The world is less interesting and the game simply isn't as fun as Terraria (or Starbound or a half-dozen other similar games). That's really the key here - it's derivative and there's no real compelling reason to buy or play this. There are simply too many games that play the same way that are clearly better.\n\nOne of my biggest concerns was that the development plan didn't look like it was going to happen. I said so and was roundly criticized for it. Then two years later the developers want customers to now pay for features that were promised (and listed on the Steam page) via DLC because they haven't made enough money. Then when that plan wasn't met with overwhelming joy (is there any wonder why?) they just abandoned the game without another word. So if you do decide to buy this, know you're only getting 1/3rd of the original planned game - and it shows.\n\nSimply put, save your money folks.","November 4, 2014","false","3.7"," 27 of 52 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","27","52","2","3"

Games being bought on sale is part of how steam works, if you cannot operate from making sale money, which is still income mind you, you shouldn't have put a game on sale. It largely is an excuse or cop out and makes people feel nothing but angry at the dev.\n\n[original review]\n\nIn the age of builder games becoming a fad and a "me too" dev bandwagon. Darkout manages to maintain enough uniquness to still be found enjoyable and not another complete clone.\n\nDarkout is set in the 2d perspective much like Terraria and Starbound, It appears to be directly influenced by terraria due to how some of its more basic features (foreground/background, block selection, etc) are handled. It lacks some of the more condensed easier features of Starbound but the game still manages to be interesting. The most noticable difference between Darkout and other games of the genre is its graphics level, a full head and shoulders above most other games in the genre it provides lush jungles, beautiful reflective crystal caves, and ominous ruins for the player to traverse that all look stunning.\n\nDarkout's plot is fairly simplistic, you are crash landed on a planet that mankind in their ages of space travel not only avoid but have largely forgotten in a "we don't go there" fashion. Not long into your first nights you encounter shadow beings that inhabit the planet and from here a greater plot of what happened on this world forms which is also continually expanded upon by found audio logs and the like, the main story involves the distress beacon and it was either bugged for me or is as far as the devs currently have it as even with objectives completed I could not advance the story.\n\nThat brings us to the next thing to note about the game, dispite not being marked early access, many aspects of the game are still under construction and things change from patch to patch. Some of their concepts for how crafts are made make very little logical sense (copper + sulfuric acid = platinum??) and these to me feel like place holders till the real content can be developed. In all though as far as the game goes, this game manages to offer enough to be more than "just another builder" and I recommend it, though you might want to wait for a sale.","March 1, 2014","false","62.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as bugs I have only encountered a rash of broken worlds when I was transferring computers, but I was more than happy to start from a clean slate with my new, much improved computer. It does require a pretty strong system to run without constant lags and freezes, I imagine this is due to some lack of optimization that'll be cleared up in the future. But if you can run this at it's full potential then there is little that is more rewarding. It does, as most games that involve mining, take a little luck and A LOT of patience to really form a thriving base, but there is little that could rival the beauty of four whirring fusion reactors in a titanium fortress with colored lights throughout. Devs have not been  very active due to some serious roadblocks, but if enough people read this, and buy it then activity will pick up, so BUY IT!\n\n\nUpdate: I am trepidatious. After a long time of absolutely nothing from the devs they release a statement that says that they will be releasing DLC's to finish the game. If they had been at least releasing small updates and micro patches to keep the game running and showing an effort to hold customer attention I would not mind A (1!!!) DLC to see to it that this would go to the end. However, the dev's fortitude is definitely admirable. I just question how viable DLC's and a second game are going to be. I had my fun with what is on this so if the DLC's fail then I cannot complain about the money I spent. However, it is a bit shady to come up this short after such a long time. I still recommend it because it is still good, but I am unsure of the future. Hold for future updates.\n\nUpdate: I expect this to be my last. This game has a great atmosphere and an excellent system, but the developers are too busy to really make it work to its full potential. It has been 8 months since we last heard from the devs after 6 months or more with no word from them. These words feel weird to type, but this game is abandoned. It would be nice to have the developers at least affirm their existence once in a while, but we have no such affirmation. As such I am changing this review to negative and officially filing this game as one that almost transcended all others before failing.","August 16, 2014","false","104.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's now been 7 months with no new news, and Allgraf's Facebook, Twitter, forums are all dead or spam-filled.\n\nSwitching my recommendation to a big fat NO.  If Adrian Banninga or Allgraf Studios are still around, they're certainly not focused on their customers.\n\n-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --\n\nI love this game and really hope the developers finish it and/or release more content some day.  If you want an incredibly beautiful sandbox mining, exploration, crafting, base building game in a very different SciFi atmosphere then Darkout is a great choice.  Environments, mobs, players and locations are all very well done.  Combat is decent but not ground-breaking.  Crafting is deep and can be a little confusing but the rewards for climbing the tech tree are consistent and fun.\n\nThere is a story, but it's more like background flavor at this point.  There is no ending or defined final objective, although there is a boss type creature you may encounter (but cannot fight).\n\nThe game was supposed to be survival-ey, but there's no food or exposure system, enemies cannot penetrate even the simplest of shelters, and no harvesting is required to run your power generators... so "survival" is reduced to not being killed by mobs when you leave home.\n\nI still hope someday we see some things that were on the 'to do' list, including a real final objective to the game, enemy base attacks with mobs digging/breaking into bases, and multiplayer.\n\nSo yes... I recommend it for what it currently is - a beautiful exploring, crafting and base building game.\n\nIf you want a full story or a more survival-like experience then sadly you should look elsewhere.","February 1, 2015","false","85.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't care.\n\nSo why the positive opinion, surely i can see the game is a broken heap of promises? literally Hitler etc?\n\nWell no. When it comes to failed Early Access games it really is so that failed EA games on steam can be roughly grouped so that some are big scams made by a egotistical dev that bans everything that moves, Others become leftovers from too ambitious plans.  Darkout is big on the too ambitious plans department. It has lots of potential that partly shows - but will never be fully unlocked.\n\nIt is true that this game is 'just another broken down Early Access story' as i can only assume development is stopped and no patches are coming. even for the basic bugs such as elevators.  Surely this state is so bad that this game is now worth zero ...right? Again no. I wasn't there when the promises were made and instead i got this game very cheaply so i can honestly say 'anything goes' as long as it's at least semi entertaining.\n\nSo i boldly installed the game and set my aim trying to get atleast some 2-10 hours of gameplay. Since i only paid some euros surely i will get something for that?\n\nTurns out i will get a lot more than that. This game is no Terraria substitute when it comes to gameplay hours so nothing like in the hundreds of hours but tens of hours are pretty much guaranteed and more if you use achievements as a motivator. This game can hold out against Starbound on it's own - at least for awhile before the lack of diversity in biomes and mechanics start to weight in on it (Starbound itself is not a very 'happy camper' either - could be in better shape as it's been in Early Access for a very long time).  Ok so how about Edge of Space?...um. no.that one is a EA chapter on it's own. And then...well there are not that many sidescrolling open world sandbox scifi-survival games that rely on darkness as a element. I am all ears if someone has something like this that blows the competition out of the water and isn't a metroidvania lite-sandbox like Asteria.\n\nSo unless you get hit by game not working on Windows10, story data modules not appearing or something else that prevents the game from running properly then you are in for a pretty decent and scary survival treat in the darkness.\n\nEarly to mid game is the best this game has to offer. Remember that feeling in Terraria when you went undreground in low wood/copper tier garbage equipment? fearing heights?  That feeling lasted for a very short time. In this game it is constant companion for hours to come and only later will you be able to tackle it partially. Heights just for once is a big problem you will have to deal with and finding the blueprints and ores you need is no small thing. Exploring the colorful but dark caves is hard and dangerous work in this game but down to the mines you must go.\n\nI definitely recommend getting this game on a sale. After installing it leave the prejudices out and also dont look at the (outdated) wikis unless you are completely stuck. Learn the UI and off you go. The best part is the early game: The road from sticks and stones to iron and beyond is a long one and full of peril and i have enjoyed myself so far more than what i expected.","June 6","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You must find your way through different biomes (jungle, ocean, caves...), explore, gather resources, craft, and build yourself a shelter. The atmosphere is oppressive and you're glad to find whatever light source you stumble upon or assemble.\nStill, there are a few points I feel bad about :\n- The absence of a map showing your position and the territories you've explored, thus you can lose your way easily.\n- The randomness of the world means you can have difficulties accessing even basic materials, such as coal, water, or sand. The only way, it seems, is to keep going further away and deeper. But again, the absence of map means you often have no idea where you are and where to return to.\nI will go back to play soon and keep enjoying the game, while hoping the devs fix this problem soon ;)","July 22, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The obvious comparisons to the likes of Terraria and Starbound don't really do it justice. For one thing, it sticks much closer to its sci-fi roots. The guns in this game are very well done, and the armors feel like survival gear at lower levels and full environment suits in later levels.\n\nFinally there's the central draw of this game: using light as a weapon. It IS a very dark game, but there are plenty of items that can - and SHOULD - be used as light sources. The various shadow creatures hit softer and take a lot more damage in a well-lit area. A particular brilliant bit to exploit this is that the various guns (once you have a power source for your armors and batteries to charge those power sources) have a tactical flashlight. This means your shotgun will weaken them before you even fire it.\n\nAll in all, there are worse games to buy. It's an interesting interpretation on a market that's quickly being saturated with unimaginative clones.","May 19, 2014","true","67.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The research mechanic, as well as the simple wiring that is mandatory to power most crafting stations, makes it fairly engaging without being overly difficult (you can almost always see what sorts of loot you want with a simple mouseover). Needing to find blueprints for all the top end items (for example, the top Mark 3 version of the basic leather armor can't be crafted until you find the blueprint) instead of just unlock them through research gives you an incentive to explore and fight tough monsters, while the frequency of drops for those sorts of recipies dont leave them feeling a grind.\n\nThe light/dark mechanics still need some work, as it is high light just massively increases the damage you do, but overall its fairly simple. Sadly, a highly illuminated base is just as likely to get swarms of monsters running through as one that's completely dark, but at least they are far easier to chase off.\n\nThe game has a narrative/quest line, which can be pretty engaging, but sadly it has a habit of bugging up and not advancing. For the most part this has no negative impact on gameplay - only the very first step is mandatory to be able to achieve anything, and all that requires is to use a piece of your characters starting gear so I doubt it will cause any real problems.\n\nSome parts of the game are a little unclear (for example, to fight the City boss, you need to purify relics, but while the relic will tell you what you need to purify it, it doesn't tell you how to apply the items - you need to go back to the relic gate you got the relic from and activate it with all the items in your inventory). For the most part it's very easy to figure out what you are doing though.\n\nOne thing that bugged me to no end however, is that the order of items in your crafting list is determined by the order you unlocked them in your research list (NOT the order you research them). So you might have all the mark 3 metal armour above the mark 2 leather, or you might have an exo helm near the top of your armour list, the legs in the middle, and the bodyarmour at the very bottom.

It looked interesting but something about it seemed off. Maybe it was just a hangover or I was coming down with the flu. Recently Darkout went on sale and all of a sudden I found myself saying :why was I not interested in this before?” It's like Terraria on a creepy planet. Needless to say I bought it and fell in love with it. Please keep in mind that the game is still very much a work in progress and by no means are any of my negative opinions to be taken into count for the final game.\n\nThe Good\nThe graphics are great and the lighting effects are really top notch. It's not difficult to imagine yourself on a dark lonely planet surface trying to survive against a swarm of shadow creatures. The story line has tons and tons of potential and definitely kept me interested with me wondering whats around the corner. Each time you research and get a new tool, weapon or device it feels rewarding, as if you really earned it. The creatures advance with you and the challenge of exploring, gathering and completing tasks progresses naturally. Worlds are randomly generated and available in 3 sizes so there is replay value for days and days.\n\nThe Bad\nThe sound design could use some real love. The music is kinda so so and rather unremarkable but the sound effects are really jarring at times and sometimes don't make any sense. Take for example when you hit a non shadow creature with a glow torch it makes bubble sounds like a water cooler. There are  several moments where the game simply stops you in your tracks and demands you to level up your tech or you simply run out of things to do and it can be frustrating to backtrack and try to find out what you missed or how to progress. While I'm against total hand holding, there needs to be better clues in place to help the player know what the next move is. There is a very limited assortment of creatures and it quickly escalates into tedium with some varieties.\n\nThe Ugly\nAlthough very fun and easy to lose hours and hours in, there is a definite lack of content. I hate to bring this up only because the game is clearly not finished yet but after playing for awhile it's like you hit a wall, or a void as it were. There are lots of bugs yet to squash and some things don't function as intended. Development seems nearly glacial.\n\nI feel horrible bringing up negatives about a game that is still in the works but I felt that they were worthy of a note. Bottom line: If you like Terraria, get this. It's a ton of fun and very engrossing. While the updartes may be slow coming, there is just a ton of potential here. If the devs continue along this line, by the time it's finished, patches and fixes not with standing, Darkout will be a completely epic game worthy of comparison to the mighty Terraria.","April 11, 2015","true","43.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

After playing it again this is what i came up with\n\n=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=\n1. This review might be a bit longer.\n2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will delete your comment]\n\n=REVIEW=\nSo this game has changed since i last played it. My last review was about the long loading times and how confusing the game was.\n\nThe game is still a tad confusing since it is a game just like Terraria where you get thrown into a world and have to move on from that point but it is much easier then before. The little tutorial leads you through mining, building and construction fast and gets you your own shelter. From that point on you are on your own.\n\nThe game before was similar to what it is now. I did give it a thumbs down though due to the fact that the loading times for the game and the world were so big. I was sitting here at one point, the excact same PC, and waited for an hour until i decided to ALT+F4 the game and just delete it. Now even on a big world i am only waiting for about a minute and that is already a big plus. I wrote in my first review: "If you would be able to play it." Well you most certainly are able to play it now.\n\nThere are some problems with the game though. Ingame you start with a starterkit, what is totally fine. The tutorial leads you to your very own shelter, that you have to build, but what is also totally fine. From that point on though you are completly alone. Of course that is what the game is about but you dont know anything about your controls or how to deal with placed objects that you want to get rid of (BTW you hover over the object and hit Q).\n\nDue to a lack of options the game has a few FPS issues and also graphical issues. The game is very beautiful but i noticed some graphical glitches. I dont know if that only occured to me but that is just what i saw so it will end up here. In total the game also isnt running as smooth as it should. And my PC can handle high definition games.\n\nBut overall the game is good. It is as hard as Terraria and in some points even harder but still enjoyable. The crafting is easy to manage and building, even though a bit tricky, is easy just as well.\n\nSo would i reccommend this game to a gamer that has not bought the game yet?\nIf you have spare money: Yes\nBut if you have a different game with the same price you also want i would reccommend for you to buy the other game first.","May 13, 2015","true","13.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It is a very beautiful game, brimming with atmosphere and with breathtaking landscapes. Light effects are superb, and while some clunky animations sometimes break the illusion and makes it feel more of a pre-rendered 2D platformer it doesn't happen much. It's a very solid an impressive effort on that aspect.\n\nBut Darkout is not only about eye candy: The inclusion of electricity, along with various lights, devices and generators really stands out among the game's features. Its crafting system also encourages the player to make safe routes, build a hover-sled network and make outposts along the way as they keep scouting ahead to try and make sense of their situation, and survive. New crafts unlocks new research that unlocks even more crafts, giving the player so many options to build and decorate bases it's a bit overwhelming at first.\n\nYou will find camps, leftover supplies and ruins as you scout, and from there you can get data sticks that you  can use to hear another survivors' stories as you try to fix your distress beacon and attempt to get rescued. Story is not very fleshed out yet, but as it stands right now it can last you for a long time, while still being completely optional. Reminds a bit of how Half Life treats its plot, in the sense that it's there, you know what you need to do, but there are no briefing pages or objective markers, and it gives the player an objective to focus on, as well as freedom to do it however and whenever they please.\n\nAny defects I can find to this game are quickly dismissed by its 10€ price tag and the fact that it's clearly described as a work in progress, such as the relative low variety of enemies (still, 6 different enemy types thus far is pretty impressive), the fact that you sometimes "drop" your inventory while rearranging your stuff, that falling on a tar pit can sometimes be a long and unscapable death, and minor gripes such as being unable to switch the suit's lights on/off with a keystroke or taking a sled from a line without having to disassemble the whole thing, pylons included. Game only crashed once on me in 20 hours of playtime.\n\nIntel I7 3700\nNvidia GTX 650 2G\n8 GB RAM\n2 TB HDD\nGigabyte Motherboard.\n\nAbsolutely recommended. Even if you don't like survival games and especially if you like sci-fi. It drags you in and doesn't let go.\n\n9/10.","December 8, 2013","true","50.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Started playing it again a couple of weeks ago and found that development seems to have ceased some time ago.\nThe game isn`t fully finished (and likely never will be) and the devs have disappeared, "So why are you recommending it?" I hear you say.\n\nWell, that`s because what is present in the game is actually quite good. I`ve played various 2D side scrolling crafters, and Darkout is a definite step up, it`s a real shame it won`t be 'finished'.\nFor one thing, it looks really nice, I mean really. The textures are smooth, the backgrounds are actually worth studying, never mind the foreground. The art team have made an effort and it shows (especially in the stratosphere).\nThe whole concept of the plants and creatures adapting to the darkness makes for an interesting change to the usual environment. Just moving through the jungle biome with all the glowing plants and the fireflies drifting around is surprisingly enjoyable. As is taking the jetpack above the clouds and exploring the skylands.\nI`ve yet to craft the underwater propulsion doodad, so I don`t know what (if anything) is to be found in the depths of the ocean.\n\nThe crafting. There is a lot of stuff to play with. Build power generators and lay wiring networks to connect up lights, teleporters, elevators, gun turrets, and your crafting stations. One definite thing I love is that you don`t need materials in your inventory. Heave everything into chests/closets/storage vaults and as long as the container is nearby then the game knows what`s there, and draws whatever you need from wherever it is.\nI haven`t reached the end of the tech levels so I haven`t yet came across any gamebreaking bugs that others have encountered. In saying that, the elevators are a little...quirky, I suspect mostly due to their speed.\nOne of the biggest issues seems to be finding the datacubes, but I found all I needed pretty quickly (so far anyway). Once I went to the relevant biome the mobs were dropping the cubes like confetti at a wedding.\n\nYes, it can be a little grindy and repetitive (if you`re intent on quick completion), but I think I`ve found that with most games like this, and I do find it amusing to see people complaining about the story. After all, I don`t recall Minecraft having a riveting plot...\n\nI`m not really focussing on reaching the endgame as soon as possible. My goals at the moment are:\n- build storage tanks for all the tar I come across (there`s a feature/bug involving liquids and buckets which means tar and water are unlimted, but underground tar pools are still a nuisance)\n- dismantle the city for all that lovely titanium\n- find those damn crystal caverns\n- use my newly crafted GPS to find sea level, then drill a tunnel from my base to the shore (why move to the beach when you can bring the beach to you? ;) ) so I can use the limitless waters of the ocean to drown the underworld....

It is now 5/21/2014, I still see hardly if any updates at all from the game developers. This does not look promising.\n\nDarkout has some very novel idea that puts a spin on exploration type games.  Exploring a world usually covered in darkness and you have to rely on the light to be your weapon.  However it's still suffering from a number of setbacks which makes it pale in comparison to Starbound.  It's especially sad since I have played Darkout at least a year ago and have not seen enough improvements right now to warrant my attention.  Basically between the time I first played it to now, there doesn't seem to be that much difference content-wise.  It feels just as clunky and unpolished as before.\n\nThe control scheme is not intuitive.  It feels clunky at times and occasionally buggy.  You can't change your binding as well.  Using the mining animation as an example; when you mine, you can mine up to 4 squares that repositions itself so you can mine in various ways.  That may sound fine on paper, but it's not the most intuitive of mechanics.  It's actually quite clunky.  The tutorial is somewhat ok for newcomers, but it's still lacking explanations on the deeper mechanics of the game.  Not to mention the main quest line right now is still very much incomplete in the beginning stage.  Exploration is kind of pitiful.  The background is pretty, but at times distracting especially when you are deep in the lava layer where it becomes incredibly difficult to determine where the solid ground is unless you are wearing illuminated armor.  While there are different biomes, it's mainly just a change in scenary with some difference in enemies.  Enemy AI is your typical-run-up-to-you-and-headbutt/puke-in-your-face variety.  I find the game's main challenge comes from waiting, WAITING for the little research bar in your window to finish researching whatever blueprint you've found.  It's tedious busywork.  While I understand finding blueprint and maybe even the need to allocate points to research them. I'm not a big fan of the waiting game, especially when you have just 5 slots to do anything constructive.  This is the same for crafting certain objects in the game, you can only queue up to a maximum of 5 slots.  I'm not baking clay or smelting metal, why do I have to play the waiting game when I should be off doing exciting things?  I forgot to mention the autosave.  While it's a handy thing to have because the game does crash now and then, it's one of the most intrusive thing I've ever seen.  It literally freezes your game a few seconds just to save with a big AUTO SAVING across your screen.  Hope you weren't in the middle of a climcatic battle with the locals.\n\nDarkout is OK for a game in its genre, but there are better alternatives out there such as Terraria and  Minecraft.  Even with its impressive shiny graphics, it doesn't have the same polish to back up the content.  Until more content and better controls are updated, I will sit this out for now.","December 28, 2013","false","22.9"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

I stranded in some dark would of another planet, the tutorial hints told me to collect wood by catting trees. So wa walked a bit to a side and fell in some small pond - but no chance to get out even though it was not very deep. So that was my first death. I tried again a few times, but no chance. When I finally got some wood on other side, the tutorial told me to craft some stuff, to male small free field and to build the shelter. While I was still was figuring out how to even move properly and to place the blocks, the first creatures attacked me while I still had no idea how to defend or if I even have a weapon. The tutorial said that if the auto-slot is active, alwas the most adequate tool will be used automatically. there was also a weapon symbol sometimes when I pointed at the creature but my char did not attack it, not even with fists. So I looked into my inventory again and found a pistol. But that didn't work either. I don't know if it required any ammuniton or something. Aftera lot of dieing and respawning I by accident I found that the glow torch works as weapon - if it's active. It gets automatically deactivated whe you place blocks or start digging. After a lot of dying and respawning, running out of wood blocks while still have no proper flat area for shelter, I gave up. Not even the digging and placing of blocks is an easy task. The char mines 3 blocks at a time not the one I selected. He starts swimming when in water which goes not even to his chest, but is then unable to get out of it.

It's basically a terraria clone, but seems to be more complex and has a higher learning curve, as it bombards you with like 20 tutorial boxes before you even do anything. I clicked them away, so i probably missed the hint that all tools you need are stored in your crashed ship, which you have to drag'n'drop over to your inventory one by one. My first run hence ended in a ditch which i couldn't escape, as i didn't have the shovel from the spaceship-trunk to dig me out. Second time i took my items and i got attacked by lizards. Tried to shoot them, but my pistol didn't seem to have ammunition. Couldn't be bothered to find out why and ran away.\n\nIt just didn't feel like a polished experience, more like an overambitious indie-project without a clear focus. Even the most basic steps you have to do from the start on, which doesn't strike me as intuitive. On the other hand you're splashed with unnecessary details, like the 20 items you get from your spaceship trunk. Most of them i didn't even know what to do with. It just lacks the charm of other open-world-games to maintain my interest over those flaws.\n\nIf you love Terraria, but found it too easy and want a scifi-twist on it, give it a try. I myself don't see the point.","July 19, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Doesn't matter if you click 'yes' or 'no', it closes the game(which works just fine in background, though, besides graphic part - you can walk, interact with objects and so on). Obviously, you can't play the game when all you see is some error window.\n\nI Tried to update drivers, change resolution, effects and other stuff - game seems to don't give a damn about this.\n\nThere's no solution or troubleshooting discussions in community hub and developers "main Darkout forum" isn't very user friendly so I didn't found any info there too.\n\nSo. What can I say about this tricky situation? Game is unplayable in this state(at least, for me) and I recommend you spend your money somewhere else.\n\nP.S. Intro movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Seriously, it's a piece of crap. Really. Yup.

I say that because I could not even play it. There was no option to rebind any keys so the movements keys were stuck as WASD. I am left handed though. Maybe other lefties have learned to adapt but I am used to being able to rebind keys to the right side of the keyboard. Not having the option removed my ability to even attempt to play.\nI saw some posts about the issue dated Dec 2013 and it is still not addressed. I have little hope that it will be any time soon. I'm actually let down such a simple mechanic was ignored. I looked forward to playing this game.\nSo a warning to other left handed people that rely on being able to rebind, skip this game for now.","October 3, 2014","false","0.2"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

The developers would be well advised to stop trying to cram new content into the game for a bit, and work on stability. I stopped playing this game a while back because of the constant crashes, and only returned when I got my Steam code and saw it was out of beta. Only to come back to more random crashes. And now, late in the game (all research found and done), am I only just now figuring out their "tutorial" story line, which does a great job of hiding itself. If this game could be shut down without a crash I'd die of shock.

Much.\n\nIs it frustrating to play?  OH YES.  But that isn't what frustrates me.  No, what makes me gnash my teeth is that in the grim and filthy world of Darkout, there's a little gem trying to shine its way into existence.    At the heart, Darkout is a Terraria-like crafting action game.   The platforming action is so-so.  It's not as polished as I would desire, but it's workable.\n\nThere's crafting, and that's well done.  Your crafting devices are even smart enough to pull materials from nearby chests, which something every damned Minecraft-y game should copy.  Right now.  (Really, why do I have to juggle around 20+ items in and out of my inventory just to build a few things?)\n\nCrafting progression is..  Odd.  It's tied to tech level (which controls overall access to receipes), but tech level is independant for each class of item.  For example, I could have tech level 2 armor but tech level 4 tools.  It's not entirely obvious how these tech levels work together for progression, and it becomes even more complicated when some items or component receipes won't unlock until you either have their base materials available or their base components.  The game does not give you a list, but fills in the blanks as you figure things out.  Which means it can be frustrating unless you want to pour over the (sometimes incomplete/outdated) wiki to figure out how to build something.\n\nWorse, some items are locked to quest progression.  You won't get the component or the receipe until you've triggered a certain quest.  And this is where the game basically makes me want to eat my keyboard.\n\nThe story quest is broken.  Simply BROKEN.  And horribly designed.  No other way to put it.  Items refuse to drop, or spawn.  Eventually, you can get the game to spawn the needed items by generating new worlds and exploring them, since like Terraria your character is easily transferred between worlds.  It's never clear exactly why you can't proceed in a quest either;  There are THREE different places to look in order to determine quest progression.  I kid you not.  Three different indicators across two different UI screens.  Even so, these hints are vague and often don't point to the real cause as to why you cannot progress.\n\nI've given up trying to beat the story quests.  Maybe it's doable, with hours upon hours of careful combing and re-loading of games and generating new worlds in order to re-comb them for the necessary item drops, but screw that.\n\nI had fun building my character so he could fly and have laser-guns and chop down trees with a plasma-cutter, but once I tried to actually beat the game, I realized it was totally not worth my time.\n\nDo not recommend this game, even for $4 that I paid for it.\n\nPity, too, because the game looks rather nice and has an art style other than 8-bit retro, which seems like Every Damn Other crafting game has decided to copy.","September 30, 2014","false","36.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It's not labeled early access. Stage 1 (as they call this not-in-beta game) is not finished, which means there's bugs, and I have yet to come accrosss anything that resembles a start to the story. Random crash bugs (one that seems related to the auto-save) should be a priority fix but... still waiting on the fix. Instead of talking fixes, they're talking upcoming multiplayer (because, you know, if something it's working you should add more things to it first before fixing it), and they have even had to go so far as to post a stickey about forum behaviour, which doesn't speak well for the community which this multipler is being designed for.\n\nYeah Darkout looks good, can be fun when it's not crashing, and I may put in a few more hours into it, but when a game is frustrating, unfinished, and buggy and not advertised as such (saying on the Store page you're working on Stage 1 but the beta is finished is not true - this is just the beta for stage 1, and the previous beta was finished), does not make you want to play it often, nor get your friends playing it.\n\nIf you want a game like this, go with Starbound. At least they don't try to hide the state of their game with newspeak.","January 11, 2014","false","8.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I had played it quite extensively before than, hence my limited hours here on steam. Overall, I like the gameplay, which is why I do recommend it. However, since it has been abandoned by the developer I wouldn't get it unless it was steeply discounted (at least 75% off). I have found it a rather nice timesink for those times where I played it. Plays pretty much like any of the crafting/surviving/building games out there, with a few little quirks all it's own.","May 7","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The crafting is AMAZING and the world is absolutely beautiful, but story progression is a combination of tedium and luck with the Random Number Generator.   The devs are aware, but unfortnately, it leads to overcompensation and inventory bloat.\n\nThe premise of this game is that you are a member of a colony ship, unfrozen and jettisoned onto the world below.  No-one above is aware of the catastrophic events that led them to stasis in that ship, and it's on you to find out why.  I think.   The problems with the story quickly crack open when early quests have you fetch broken parts of a beacon.  Pulling these into your inventory doesn't trigger anything; you then have to kill an enemy and get it to drop a log file (which could also be a blueprint or minor side story item).  This log will look and sound like it was intended to play when you found the broken beacon piece (which happens to also be a random drop from chests and crates that spawn in the wild).\n\nOnce you've done this, the one voice acted character which isn't a computer but *is* interactive (sorta) grows ill in some way and bam, he's out of the story.  In fact, your entire beacon apparatus you spent tons of time building is also now just taking up space.  Hopefully by now you've been doing more things on your own and developing your base.  Enemies grow with your "Research Level" which is just your level, gained by mining and killing things and inventing.\n\nThe story gets harder to follow; the concepts are more abstract and the only indicator as to where to kill something to get it to drop a log or data cube (and yes, this is how all story elements progress) is to catch the one hint in the last log as to where it will be found.   While I appreciate making exploration necessary to progress, this is overdone; there are gates you encounter that need "purification" later which require a lot of searching for some hard to find items (such as big stacks of a certain color of Crystal).   Furthermore, if you start "purifying" a gate you can't work any other gate until that specific one is fixed.  When you finally face a boss, it drops a "leet loot" item but fails to progress the story in any way I can see.  All of the logs that are "above" your spot in the plot line refuse to unlock so you can read them, and I now have 5 metal chests full and am filling a Vault (which holds 100 items).\n\nSome may say ripping on the acting in a game is nitpicky, but there is a limit to everything.   It's clear that someone from the sound studio must have quit their job during development; many of the audio clips have the actors rereading the line to deliver it how they want it to sound.  This normally doesn't make it past the sound studio; someone just grabbed the files and chucked them in.   You'll do a double-take the first time you read the line in the file, but hear the line spoken twice in a row with emphasis on different words.   Unfortunately, it does not have the endearing goof-up quality of the early days of TV like when Doctor Who had to be done in one take per scene.\n\nStill, I recommend a buy ON SALE.   The gameplay itself is pretty solid, outside of some graphics-lag issues when too many items you can't pick up are on screen (i.e. when inventory is full).   You'll get stuck in the story, however; it's essentially an endurance test to see if you will keep playing until you get lucky enough to progress the tale, or if you get bored and stop playing before then.   I regret to say, I am probably in the latter, as will most people be.","March 5, 2015","true","58.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The general story is that your character has been stranded on an uncharted planet that is constantly dark, and you have to find resources and research different items to survive.  Now, it sounds all well and good on paper, but if the two former games are it's parents, then this is the resulting child after Minecraft took thalidomide during pregnancy.  It's bad, not Ride To Hell Retribution Bad, or Duke Nukem Forever awful, but it's close.  It has an awful interface, it crashes more than Oblivion packed with mods in the wrong order, making it playable for no more than 5 seconds and when its not wanting to crash, it bugs out and lags even on my high end computer.  When your trying to dig or mine it won't let you half the time, and you have to line up your mouse perfectly so you can, except, as a rule, it  has to be lined up a mile away from the object your trying to interact with.  However the worst thing about this game, and I say the worst thing, is that there is no sense of direction.  I seriously had no clue on how to play or what to do.  Even after reading the manuals in the main menu, I still felt as lost as a Christian in a Marilyn Manson gig.  It's as if one developer thought "Hey, you know how there is that time in Minecraft where you get really bored because you have no clue what to do, well how about we increase that feeling by making the players have no clue what to do at the beggining of the game,"  And the rest, instead of just killing him, by bludgeoning him to death with his own shoes, nodded and agreed.  Now I know the game isn't 100% finished, before I start getting complaints, but neither was Minecraft and we all loved that for some strange reason.  The difference is we only got bored of Minecraft recently, while Darkout is just plain bad to begin with!","January 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

There is no way around it. Darkout is a shameless attempt at replicating the success of other crafting games, no doubt. However, as tempting it is to mock and jeer at posers leaching off of other people’s good ideas, it is quite difficult to keep up the scorn if they do such a good job at it that it sometimes eclipses the original source of inspiration while bringing up new ideas and bouts of creativity.\n\nDarkout can easily stand on it’s own rather than being a game people only turn to when they can’t get access to other crafting games. It has a steep learning curve, but otherwise it has everything a crafting game needs; resources, blueprints and places to build to your heart’s content. It also has an odd focus on lighting as a play mechanic and power consumption, which is different than almost all the other crafting focused games, but the game's ambition also has its minor hiccups.\n\nThe basic idea is that the player is a futuristic survivor that crash landed a spaceship on a planet that becomes more dangerous the darker it is. The survivor's goals boil down to savaging his/her way off the planet by exploring it, cultivating it, and finding out what happened to the other survivors through traces they left behind. The game is almost spooky in this way and playing tag in the dark while aliens are trying to eat you can be thrilling, but the same clash of elements that make the game interesting can also give way to long boring stretches.\n\nFor instance, the games’ learning curve and complete lack of direction more or less haunts the player the entire game if they are new. While using your own smarts is most of the fun, there are times where a bit of direction is needed. The best examples of this are usually when there are obvious solutions to problems the game won’t allow for; The player starts with a gun and ammo and then runs out the first night only to be forced to discover by accident that only torches, not obvious deadly sharp things like your axe, can be used to beat monsters to death until enough points and materials are earned to make a sword and arrows. Other oddities such as the player will invent things that run on a power source before they know how to build a power source also exist causing unexplained confusion.\n\nIn conclusion, the when player is on the roll inventing and discovering in the right order Darkout flows perfectly and really adds to that sense of thrilling survival, but when something is thrown out of whack and the randomly generated world gives out some secrets before others sometimes the pacing grinds to a frustrating crawl that leaves the player digging for long stretches searching for that next blueprint or that one unique material that doesn’t seem to be anywhere. Pacing disruptions are it’s only real fault however, and the rest of the games seems to function well enough so there is no reason not to try it anyway. There is some great fun to be had here and players are encouraged to see it for it's own unique qualities.","October 4, 2014","true","9.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The controls have a little bit of a learning curve, so don't expect to know how to play from the start, they are different enough from other 2D builder games that  you will have to take some time to learn them.

It realy did seem like my kind of thing, and the fact it had bumped the technology and graphics up from sprite based intreuged me. I must say that the general astethics of the game also realy looked like something i would enjoy.\nAnd seeing phrazes like "The love child of Terraria and Metroid" really helped, seeing as those are two things i like.\n\nDarkout does something most worldbuilders don't, which is a focused tone. And imagine "Focused" written in huge neon letters. going away from offering you a selection of desert/plains/underground/snow/ect, it keeps a very consistent dark jungle planet theme going. And it does so with remarkable sucsess.\n\nOn that note, let me talk about the astethics some more. This game is absolutely beautifull, absolutely fantastic actually in that regard. Everything from the enviroment design, to the animations, the armor design, the enemies, the music, the backstory, the music, you name it, is done to perfection. It all comes together like a beautifull symphony where everything works together.\n\nIt also sports an intersting research mechanic in which you don't magicaly know how to make everything, and do not in fact start out with the blueprints to, or knowlage of how a high powered assault rifle works. Blueprints can be found lying about, or can be accuiered through research. In my opininon, this is a brilliant mechanic, and also adds to the general feel of the game.\n\nAI behaviour is alright. They do the standard search around for the player, then charge. There is an interesting mechanic this game has, and that is its light system. Light sources can help lowering an enemys deffence, and make it go down easier. If you have enough of it, it might kill them by you looking at them too hard as well.\n\nAs a worldbuilder, it is quite alright. Nothing truly remarkable, but the astethics and the interesting mechanics puts it above average. Add to this the way most equipment requires power (this being a hard sci-fi game after all) makes base construction  very interesting. It also does a lot of little things to help you out, for instance: If you are in proximity of a container holding the resources you need, you do not in fact need to pick it up and place it in your inventory, which cuts down on the tedeus micromanagement a lot.\n\nOn the subject of combat however, the game leaves something to be desired. Most weapons unsattisfyingly "Pow-Pow" their way through the enemies, and the animations and effects mannage to fall flat in that regard. I would have loved seeing their light engine at work with something like a muzzleflash.\n\nBut where the game fails is in it's lack of substance. The enviroments, while beautifull, are quite limited to three actuall surface ones, which are simply progressively difficult, and there isn't enought to discover there. Which is a shame, since this is a worldbuilder where you hardly have to go underground at all. Which i think is a good thing. There are shamefully few weapons. Not realy many varriations. Linearely upgraded swords, and your standard arsenal of conventional weapons. Rifle, pistol, shotgun, grenade launcher... I'd like to see some more choises within thise things. For instance, several different rifles.\nIt also realy lacks substance in it's equipment range. While there are several well designed and absolutely awesome armors, there is a lack of equipment to use with them. Rocket boots, jetpack, rebreather, en setra.\n\nBut the cardinal sin, is the fact that the game realy, realy feels like it's still in beta, and can be difficult to get running. The menus bug out constantly, and a lot of items lack a description. Having such captations as "Comming soon", if any at all.\nIt's also worth mentioning that while the astethics are absolutely fantastic, there is one place it fails, and that's in the enemy sound design.\n\nTo summarize what has become a nightmareishly long review: The game is absolutely stunning in it's visual design, and it's immersion level is top notch. It has some realy interesting mechanics rarely seen in this genre. It's use of light as more of "A thing", the very absorbing base construction, it's use of research all work realy well, and fits perfectly within it's sci-fi setting. The story is intreuging, and the enviroments make you want to explore. It realy -feels- very different from other worldbuilders. So if you're prepaired to overlook it's lack of substance, can handle a small truckload of bugs, and the odd bizzare peice of sound design, then i can recommend this game.","December 10, 2013","true","69.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Slick UI, easy to use, nothing annoying.\nVenture into the dark and monsters start to spawn... got to carry a latern or be a good shot to survive.

More survival than sandbox, but still we've go ourt 2 layers to destroy, base to build up, etc.\nThe  [m] button makes the tool you're using focus on 1, or hit 3 blocks at once... that alone is freakin' amazing.\nDrag & drop placement out of inventory, very practical, indeed it's the little things\n"Darkout" and "Windforge" are both really good for alternatives to "Terraria."   It's got "1-more-block" syndrome & the story / atmosphere are new enough that it's an adventure.  The art is especially beautiful, with glowing flora and fauna, sometimes I caught myself just looking around.  Guns shoot well & are responsive.  Fortress building is excellent, if a bit odd sometimes, it still functions faster and more efficiently than all the other sandboxes.  It is possible to trap enemies as well, which is pretty hilarious, providing ways to make XP grinders and the like once you have enough resources.

Yes, the digging and finding new stuff definately works on my Minecraft/OCD center. It's very addicting. However, the UI commits some unpardonable errors. Dragging stuff from your inventory to your hotbar will instead dump it on the ground 60% of the time. Trying to close a door can make you drink a health potion instead. Attacking a monster will sometimes open a cabinet, or stick a light on a wall. You shift-right click to pick up some stuff, but other stuff you can just walk over it to pick it up. It's breaking the first rule of UI design - if the player does something, it must be consistent throughout and work as the player expects it to.\n\nI also have issues with the procedurally generated worlds not producing good worlds to game in. Something like tar should be available after a little searching. I had to abandon one world and start another because I was stuck without it. Another world, I literally had none of those squid things to kill until I quit and reloaded. Then suddenly they were there. The algorithm needs to put common stuff near you and rarer stuff farther away, and the player should be able to complete the first couple quests more easily, to give him incentive to continue. There is good potential here, and as I said, it's a very addicting game, but I think it needs another 6 months in the oven.\n\n-Eddy","December 11, 2013","true","64.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Half the time you place the block, and the other half you sit there madly clicking the mouse while nothing happens. There also seems to be an issue with lighting. Sometimes my placed torch will seem to provide almost no light in a tunnel. Then I move a few feet away from it and suddenly the tunnel lights up magically?\n\nAlso, you are going to die. A *lot*. A lot, lot, lot. Most creatures can kill you in a few hits. If you die, you leave your equipped armor behind so you have to go retrieve it. The tips seem to indicate that light keeps the monsters back, but I put torches all over my building and monsters still swarmed it. Also, due to the lighting issue mentioned above, it's often hard to see more than a few feet in a cave and this has caused me to fall to my death many times.\n\nMy recommendation: skip it.

Not exactly Terraria to be quite honest. If only it had come out earlier instead, and gotten some love early on. As it stands now, the game is pretty damn polished and done as a base game. It needs more content though.\nThe crafting is very interesting and has a lot of depth to it. There's a real potential of making very interesting bases with electricity, generators, battery storage and the whole lot.. Only sad part is that it's not really that heavily focused upon. You can spend a lot of time progressing without even touching upon the tech that is available. Eventually and enevitably it will catch up to you though.\nInteresting merge of self tought tech along with recipes you have to find out there. A story that could have gotten somewhere, if it wasn't for the unfortunate mechanic of how it progresses. There's a few tweaks and bugs in the story that needs to be ironed out, as it's terribly immersion breaking as it is right now.\nThere is a grind to the game (naturally), but nothing you can't handle or expect from a game of this genre. Like I pointed out earlier, there are some flaws to the way you progress in the story though.. Making it somewhat of a burden to have to soldier through..\n\nBut all in all I have to say I really like this game. A lot! I only wish it had more content to it. More story and a way to travel to other planets perhaps, or other planes. The maps are either small, medium or large, but even then.. they are only so big. Once you've explored it all, it's done. There's a saving grace in that you can use the same character with progression attached to it, on other worlds you create though. As a fresh start in a sense, but separated from your previous world.\n\nI really recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Terraria, Crea, Minecraft or any other game where you build, explore and and progress at your own pace. It's a beautiful and very underrated title that deserves much more attention than it's currently getting. Hopefully there's more content to come for this title!\n\nEasily a 10/10 from me","October 15, 2014","true","41.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And I've only played it for six hours.\n\nSo, first off, it does borrow heavily from Minecraft and Terraria as far as the mining-for-resources-to-survive aspect goes.  Same could be said for the crafting mechanics, too.  But the tone of the game is vastly different, much more oppressive, and considerably darker. Exploration is key, both above and below ground, and enemies can continuously spawn in your general vicinity if there is not enough light. No matter how many times you kill them, they will keep spawning right in front of you. This adds to the tension, especially if you are trying your hardest to mine a large vein of ore before returning to base, and you're out of torches.\n\nThe game also progresses a lot slower than would be expected. Sure, your starting tools don't break after repeated use, but the crafting and research mechanics will slow you down if you can't identify what you need and how you're supposed to get it. This actually held me up for about an hour, where I was furiously looking for stone to smelt for tin ore.  I felt pretty stupid after I realized the solution was right in front of me.\n\nI can't really do the game justice with this review, but I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival adventures, resource gathering and building up tech levels.","December 30, 2013","true","18.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However it provides a level of production value otherwise unseen in this genre. Despite being an unfinished product it already boasts a high level of polish both in terms of presentation and balance. The dark sci-fi setting delivers a strong sense of lonliness and constant danger and the rate of progression and difficulty seems tuned just right.\n\nDarkout isn't going to win any prizes for originality and currently suffers from being a bit too crash happy (a problem mitigated mostly with autosaves), but if you loved Terraria you'll find a lot to love here.","December 30, 2013","true","39.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In most resource-gathering games, basic tier materials are soon forgotten near end-game but not so here. The same copper, coal and tar u find initially are still useful and necessary many levels down the tech tree. For example, tar can be turned to sulphur which becomes sulphuric acid when mixed with water. Throw in copper with the acid and u get platinum. Every material is linked in more than 1 way to another and the constant combining/mixing of chemicals and compounds to get others really reinforces the sci-fi theme of this game.\n\nThe initial going can be tough but if ur willing to invest some time/effort the eventual sense of accomplishment is strong. U go from working with simple copper and stone to eventually anti-matter and motors. Ur wooden shack lit by basic torches and glow jars soon become high-tech labs with fluro lamps powered through an electrical sys u lay urself.\n\nThe main story is a little clunky and in some cases, broken right now but it doesn't impede the actual progression. That said, data logs are still abound which add backstory and flavor to the atmosphere. The devs seem to be quite active and hands-on with the forums so the game will hopefully improve over time.\n\nOverall, if ur a fan of the sandbox/resource-gathering genre and crave a sci-fi take with increased graphical fidelity, give Darkout a shot.","December 20, 2013","true","102.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And I've only played it for six hours.\n\nSo, first off, it does borrow heavily from Minecraft and Terraria as far as the mining-for-resources-to-survive aspect goes.  Same could be said for the crafting mechanics, too.  But the tone of the game is vastly different, much more oppressive, and considerably darker. Exploration is key, both above and below ground, and enemies can continuously spawn in your general vicinity if there is not enough light. No matter how many times you kill them, they will keep spawning right in front of you. This adds to the tension, especially if you are trying your hardest to mine a large vein of ore before returning to base, and you're out of torches.\n\nThe game also progresses a lot slower than would be expected. Sure, your starting tools don't break after repeated use, but the crafting and research mechanics will slow you down if you can't identify what you need and how you're supposed to get it. This actually held me up for about an hour, where I was furiously looking for stone to smelt for tin ore.  I felt pretty stupid after I realized the solution was right in front of me.\n\nI can't really do the game justice with this review, but I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival adventures, resource gathering and building up tech levels.","December 30, 2013","true","18.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However it provides a level of production value otherwise unseen in this genre. Despite being an unfinished product it already boasts a high level of polish both in terms of presentation and balance. The dark sci-fi setting delivers a strong sense of lonliness and constant danger and the rate of progression and difficulty seems tuned just right.\n\nDarkout isn't going to win any prizes for originality and currently suffers from being a bit too crash happy (a problem mitigated mostly with autosaves), but if you loved Terraria you'll find a lot to love here.","December 30, 2013","true","39.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Grungy Sci-fi, well-written plot communicated via discarded data logs and patchy radio transmissions, and sandbox exploration and construction? Absolutely.\n\nTo be completely honest, there is less in the way of pure progression content than there is in, say, Terraria, and there is currently a bug that can prevent progression through the main quest. That said, the price is still justified in my mind as there is still plenty enough to do even though you can run into a show-stopper for the main quest, that doesn't really block your character's progression, which is what sandbox games are really all about, right?\n\nThe dev team is also quite dedicated; a control bug I reported on the forums received dev responses shortly after and was fixed two days later. It was an easy-to-fix problem, granted, but it was definitely nice to see that sort of response to the community.\n\nI would highly recommend Darkout to anyone who enjoys sandbox games and/or sci-fi.

It makes a nice addition to the collection.\n\nI played this game several months ago on Desura, and at the time I played it, there were issues which stood in the way of me actually enjoying the game. Now, at the Steam release I have to say the game has improved vastly.\n\nThe setting of this game is interesting, you're on a planet which is shrouded in a mysterious darkness, and its swarming with all manner of darkness dwelling evil things. A major gameplay mechanic is using light sources to shape the environment. Illuminating areas deters enemies from entering, weakens them, and prevents them from spawning entirely.\n\nAnother feature worth noting is the technology development in this game. You start out with some basic tools and spend your first day building a crude wooden shelter. Via the research system and exploration and discovery of new materials, you can develop more advanced technology; a sonic drill, jetpacks, armor, even transportation. Though the research system is a bit tedious, it does help to add structure to your game progression. It seems like theres always some new and cool gadget to work towards making.\n\nMy only gripes at this time with the game are some of the items you need to progress. The research system depends on you discovering new materials to unlock new relevant items. Some items are very difficult to come by, especially to newcomers. I'll cite gas as my first major roadblock. (hint: it comes from plants under ground. Not very deep, but you need to keep an eye out for it.) After that, certain components become integral to your machines. You can find random treasure scattered across the surface of the planet, as well as underground which will yeild items you need, but they are too unreliable for some items. You need to find blueprints from these treasure chests, as well as from the more tough enemies in order to craft your own.\n\nThat having been said, I have been enjoying the game plenty, and I appreciate how much its improved from the first time I played it. At the time of this review, the game is in "Stage 1". I'm looking forward to what they do with Stage 2.","January 19, 2014","true","43.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's because you'd be lending your support to a team that doesn't understand fair and ethical business practices. This game was billed as complete at launch, with extras on the way as a bonus... Those extras turned out to be essential parts of the game that were missing, and now the devs want to raise more revenue by charging EVERYONE for ALL of those additional portions of the game as DLC. Doesn't matter if you bought it at launch, doesn't matter if you were a beta tester--fork it over, cuz we're outta $$$.\n\nTo make matters even crazier, their OTHER plan to fund the completion of Darkout is to make another game, and use the profits from that. Sooo, we sold you an unfinished game, then lied about it... but trust us, this new one will be great! Yeah, OK. They don't seem to understand the damage that this has already done to their credibility as a studio.\n\nThey also asked for donations on their website. Because, when I think "charity", game development studios are at the top of my list for needy folks who could use some spare change or a simple cup of coffee.\n\nHonestly, I don't know if it's desperation or sheer arrogance or both on their part, but I'd implore you to spend your money elsewhere, no matter how low the price of this game goes.\n\n\n\n** Update: I went on their forums several months ago and posted a longer message than this but in a similar vein... and no one's even responded to it. That was JULY 13TH. If you wanted any clearer signal that support for this game is nil and that the project is dead, I'd urge you to go to darkoutgame.net and check out Exhibit A.","July 12, 2015","false","67.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Since the developers have fallen silent after April/May 2015 and it seems like the main dev allegedly got a job elsewhere ,you can safely assume that this version of Darkout is most likely the final one with no further updates.\n\nBUT this game is still very well worth its current price (12 Euro).\n\nHow many games (like adventures) are just "done" at one point without being patched any longer, and how many games have "open" ends like showing how the end-boss re-emerges indicating a continuation that often never is delivered? So what? Does this make games any less enjoyable?\n\nIf I hadn't played this game I definitely would have missed out on something inspiring :) So if you like games like Terraria, Starbound, Crea, Signs of Life and the like, and you have a little extra money to spend then give Darkout a try one day - it's a fresh take on the 2D-sandbox genre.\n\nThe pros:\n\nThe gameplay of Darkout is interesting nonetheless, the game looks and sounds beautiful, it has nice features, an atmospheric gameworld to explore and a lot of stuff that can be crafted & built. On my PC with Windows 7 prof. the game runs smoothly with nearly no bugs.\n\nThe speciality of Darkout is to light up the world while aiming for your goal (collect audio logs to find out what has happened and then defeat the boss-mobs). As dangerous creatures are all emerging from clouds of darkness you will have to protect yourself, your base and your paths by placing durable light sources all over the game-world. Torches will burn out though and lighting will be attacked by creatures, so placing durable lanterns or even setting up long electricity grids is highly recommended if you plan to play this game for a longer while.\n\nYou will have to create pathways between the many islands floating in the sky and you will also have to dig downwards to reach deeper layers of the world and caves full of crystals that you'll want for crafting more advanced equipment and useful stuff for your base and transportation. You can build teleporters later on (sadly the "sledges" do not really work so well, and the elevators are a bit uncomfortable to use because you can easily drop to your death if you miss your step and do not build a safety-ladder next to the elevator-shaft ).\n\nIf you are an "achiever"-type of player and/or a "builder"-type, you could set yourself the personal game-goal of unlocking all existing crafting-recipes and/or of building a giant (lit) base in whatever creative shape (there's a "builder"-mode too) and you will enjoy this game a lot. The surviving-, building- and crafting-features are well done with many things you can make and/or strive for, and these main features do not seem "unfinished" (or "clunky") in any way.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- "story" and "quests"... this game DOES have a "story", but it's unrefined and unfinished. Unfortunately only the first "quests" within this storyline will ask you to build (rather "place") stuff. All the other "tasks" will just make you wait for data-logs to spawn in a specific biome (UPDATE: or go hunting for evil creatures in this biome) and then search for these logs - one after another, and again and again. Well, listening to them is not so bad because of the rather nice voice-acting\n- many crafting-recipes also depend on receiving such data-containers purely by chance  (UPDATE: the chances that these will drop as a loot from creatures that you kill have seemingly been raised and you don't get "corrupted" ones any longer, but a message instead that no new data-logs are available currently until later on, so this is much better now)\n- the starting "tutorial" consists of a bunch of tiring text-windows filled with small letters that you'll just want to click away, instead of being a quest-like "training" for your character\n- the game does not feature an multiplayer-option even though this was originally in the pipeline\n- more types of discoveries, creatures, biomes, drops and resources would have been nice, because the variety is lacking a bit and get a bit boring after playing for a while\n- renewable ressources are lacking too - growing plants like trees yourself purposefully is not possible for example, and botanical materials are not used much anyways (plus your character does not need to eat nor sleep), and there's no mapping feature. However there are a lot of additional trees growing on the islands in the sky, and you can extract the most common ores from bits of stone and earth that you will collect when digging\n\n- the development of Darkout has suffered from financial problems (like when Desura went bankrupt and did not pay developers or when Darkout was in highest demand during summer sales for very little money) for quite a while. However also some not-so-good decisions have been made along the way, like presenting the prospect of "upcoming" features like multiplayer and promising frequent updates time and again. It would have been better to just keep silent...\n\nAfter this statement was published one year ago http://www.darkoutgame.com/2015/04/30/update-on-developments/ a ♥♥♥♥-storm followed, and then Allgraf Studios https://www.facebook.com/AllgrafStudios/ has seemingly gone into hiding.\n\nEver since then no news about the planned spin-off Darklings or anything else have ever been heard. It's very likely that this new game has been nipped in the bud because of the same lack of funds that Darkout and it's scheduled expansions/updates had suffered from, but perhaps also from all the badmouthing and even personal insults that people have thrown at the developer/s.\n\nLike other players who enjoyed Darkout I still somehow harbour hopes that even though the developer most likely will never want to take up working on this nice game any longer, at least the game's source code might become open source - or perhaps might be handed over to someone who would like to fix some bugs and create a proper story-ending. Well, a complete overhaul of the quest-system starting with the tutorial and adding some substantial content to this quest-line as well as more creatures and - renewable, useful - flora to spice up the game would definitely be even better of course ;)","June 28, 2015","true","170.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cutebeaver/recommended/257050/","cutebeaver","Cute Beaver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cutebeaver/","166 products in account","I purchased this game on sale at Humble during the end of summer sale for 75% off. If you want to help the developer and it sounds like a game you would enjoy then purchase it at full price. If your not sure get it on sale but keep in mind it is single player and that "might" never change in the future because the developer is lacking funds.\n\nDarkouts reviews are mixed because of angry backers who were promised content that had to be scrapped from the original project. They have a right to be upset... However the developer does actually want to add that content in the future, but it will be released as Paid DLC. The other source of negative reviews are those with early access bugs... Don't let these people stop you from experiencing something fun and different. At first glance they nearly disuaded me as well and I am very happy I ignored their rage and tried it for myself.\n\nDarkout Feels Different\nThe game itself is really amazing the art style is just gorgeous and light mechanics are very unique. Having light as a battle mechanic gives a small but considerable degree of strategy to your base designs and how you handle combat. The Darkness itself can be interesting as it conceals enemies and resources and allows enemies to spawn undetected. This creates gameplay that draws you in because your constantly on alert making sure nothing jumps you. In contrast something like Terraria all enemies on screen are known and obvious... I think the darkness and the unknown makes the game more fun and I have yet to experience this in any other similar games of this genre.\n\nThere is a text based mission style tutorial, and its not as hard as people say. Follow the directions, read, and you will be fine once the first five minutes pass you should have a pretty good idea of how to handle invintory, your hotbars, controls and they even give you flares and a lamp, and gun to start off with. Crafting is not difficult once you get the hang of it either. Honestly I love how you have to discover how to create things for yourself. Oh look you found a vine? Lets learn to craft this into rope. Oh you have rope? Lets learn to craft this other thing... Its wonderful and I much prefer that to the terraria style of crafting where "I magically know everything somehow"\n\nThe enviornment itself sustains you. Learning to hunt the shadow creatures and various glowing wildlife allows you to heal. You can be creative and sculpt locations for these creatures to thrive. Your home base also becomes a safe location during the moon phases. Darkmoons are long periods of near pitch black conditions where enemies spawn much more rapidly. Being caught away from home during one of these moon phases can be particularily unpleasant.\n\nAs you can see from a single player experience there is a strong push towards a slightly more immersive style gameplay both in terms of crafting, exploration, and moment to moment combat in the darkness. The beautiful artwork and lighting effects also adds to this sensation as well.\n\nThe game is very much Sandbox right now. Story isn't 100% completed but you still can find audio logs from survivors who have died long before you arived, broken shelters, debris and other signs of previous human activity hidden in the game. Its very interesting and if this sounds like something you would enjoy trying then help the developer and purchase the game and make your own opinon about where it stands at this time.\n\n10/10 would crash land on creepy planet again <3","September 11, 2015","true","22.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

The visuals were the most effective and pleasant blend between light and dark I've seen since the super-classic Heart of Darkness. When I first played it, however, I was shocked at how dull and unresponsive the game truly was. Now, I'll let the devs off with a warning and a slap on the wrist for it THIS TIME, since this is (s'far as I can tell) their first title and all, and of course that it's brand spankin' new, but the fact that you can't change the controls DRASTICALLY lowers my ability to appreciate it. Then there's the unforgiving gameplay, which I can't really say is altogether BAD, but this time around it's not good either. I've played games like DayZ, RUST, Demon Souls AND Dark Souls, and all 'cept the first one, I've appreciated how unforgivingly ruthless they all are. When you die, you focking DIE, bïtch! You don't just get to restart from a checkpoint or reload your latest quicksave from 2-3 minutes earlier. No focking way, dude. When you die in those games, you suffer. A lot.\n\nThat's not the case with Darkout, however. When you die in this game, you don't lose anything. At all. Oh, unless of course you count the time it'll take you to get to wherever you were and keep doing your shït over there. But the grim fact in this case is that losing anything from dying isn't what's so appallingly frightening about death in Darkout. It's the fact that when you respawn, you'll end up in the exact same spot as before, and if (Bunne forbid) you died where you respawn with no ammo on your person or with an enemy lurking about (which WILL be case if you died there, you unfortunate bästard you), then you're focked. Hard. In the äss. With a baseball bat.\n\nUnless you do things right on the first in-game day with about 5% margin of error, chances are extremely high that you've focked yourself over REAL BAD, hombre. You start the game with a pistol that fires GLOWING CYAN BULLETS! Pretty sweet, right? Wrong. 'Cause guess what? Yup, that's right! You don't have infinite ammo. Because that's for püssies and Bruce Willis, depending on if it's in a game or an action movie, respectively. And it gets worse. You start out with only 35 bullets. The most basic enemies require 1 hit to kill 'em. But that's 1 HIT. Miss, and you've wasted a shot. Then, when night comes, you'll be getting focked over by some kinda headcrab-esque "parasites", which unless you aim perfectly at 'em, takes at least 3 rounds to kill. AND, it gets worse... you'll need to do a LOT of gathering, harvesting, researching, crafting and other böllocks to even be able to get any kind of effective weaponry to defend yourself with.\n\nI've never been one to turn down a fair challenge, but this? Nah. This game ain't fair or challenging. It's frustratingly poorly designed, and there's very little about it that makes it worth buying, let alone playing. HOPEFULLY, we'll see some patches (and they better focking come SOON as well!) and it'll all be fine 'n' dandy, but until then, I'm afraid this game just BARELY manages to score an average rating with me. 5.6/10","December 26, 2013","true","93.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I glitched through the ground five times, and i tried to jump over some kind of acid pit and died from nothing. the controls, suck, from what i remember, the default controls (For me) wasn't WASD, it was ESDF. There were the kinda messed up hotbars, where i had to press an odd combination of keys to get to the bottom row, and it didnt carry over to the next slot, so, say i was on the bottom slot, if i changed slots, i would be on the top slot. There were many items to get at first, many had no descriptions at the time, and were very hard to tell what does what. Though you may not believe me due to my time on the game. But in my opinion, its not. I also noticed something, you "Fight shadow enemies sensitive to light"... IS THIS ♥♥♥♥ING ALLAN WAKE? NO. IT ISNT.\n\nThis game tried to be original with its enemies, but instead it kinda turned into a 2d space sandbox allan wake... That was a terrible analogy. BUt i mean. Okay, so, in allan wake there are these dark enemies, if you shine light on them the darkness stops protecting them allowing you to dammage them, see, THIS is a GOOD design choice, this game, just is like "Hey! Lets make 'Shadow Enemies', which are basically skyrim vampires! Where, ya know, because they are shadows the become weaker in light!" This seems to be a thing in games focused around enemies infected with darkness or shadows or something, I mean, Look at "The Darkness", Instead of the enemies effected by light, YOU are, and light is actually a BAD thing that you will suddenly HATE! If this is how the enemies worked, where you LIKED the light because the enemies become freaking... Black tin cans, but instead they are like "Hey, the enemies can be dammaged in dark AND light, but light makes them have less health" What about, you cant harm the enemies, or they regenerate health at a rapid pace unless they are in light, if they are in light for along time, they can be damaged outSIDE of light (Why did i put emphasis on SIDE?). I have a very hasy memory of this game, and i dont feel like getting 3 gigabytes of space used up on my hard drive so i can confirm my claims to be Extremely Accurate, but if i remember correctly, the shadow enemies are slightly weaker in light.","September 12, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","4"

As a single player experience it is very entertaining and now is the time to get in on the action. Even though it is in an early stage it will pay for itself.
