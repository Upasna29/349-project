The screen shake (which I think I saw an option to toggle) and the color scheme I picked (amber-hued Gameboy'ish) made it impossible; that and not fully comprehending the several lines of "Tutorial" that preceded the actual action... I know exactly what does what, but hardly how to do it.\n\nWhy I haven't changed the two settings that hindered my progression: I get lost in the menus because buttons don't do what they do in every other game (A confirm, B back, up and down go up and down and left and right cycle between the highlighted thing). There is usually a legend that tells you what button does what in the menus (directions take you to different (parts of the) menu(s) - X is, by default, the confirm), but again, it's just so unintuitive and the options aren't accessible while in-game it seems - must access from the main menu.\n\n\nThe game itself seems glorious, for sure.\nI just don't understand how to get (to) it, I guess.\n\nThe basic movement/platforming/combat (except for counters) are all smooth, responsive and satisfying (that exception is no doubt my own fault). I got stuck at the "Push down twice to move through certain platforms," tutorial initially because no matter what I pressed (using controller), nothing happened. Eventually fumbled my way to the options, changed them around and was able to make my way to the counters tutorial... to find that I, again, need to change options apparently.\n\nInitial fiddling aside, I have to recommend the game because I just know it's worth it. (<< Translation: Crap 'review.')\nGot Glass Wing, Caster and now The Joylancer.\nCan't wait for the next game that (*seems to) emulate N64, PS2 or Gameboy.\n*Caster looks more like N64 but I feel it plays like PS2","July 22, 2015","true","0.8"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theangrybeard/recommended/315540/","theangrybeard","TheAngryBeard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theangrybeard/","149 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game gets straight to the point: the satisfaction of busting through enemies is one of the biggest draws for action/platformer games, and Joylancer nails it. Not only is it rewarding to plow through enemies, but there is enough depth to the combat and movement systems to let you plow through them the way YOU want to. Even more than that, just being able to fly across levels with the few actions available to you is just a hell of a lot of fun. Boss battles, though? That's where the game may catch you by surprise. No spoilers, but you'll want to use every tool at your disposal when facing them...\n\nThe A/V experience is a bit harder to gush about; you may need to spend a few minutes messing with the colour presets to find something that you will enjoy playing with, although the basic preset is decent. The nice thing is that if you ever DO get bored with one selection, you can just go fiddle with it until you find something more appealing. Also worth mentioning is the music, because your mileage will likely vary: the harsh soundtrack can at times be distracting, but it can also fit the action quite nicely. It appears that there will soon be a feature to choose which track plays during gameplay, but it isn't there yet, so be wary/look forward to that. Personally I enjoy most of the soundtrack, so that'll just be a bonus for me when it comes out.\n\nThere's actually a fair amount of content not in the game yet, so if you prefer your games to be made of whole cloth you may want to hold off for a few more patches— but the feel of the game is definitely enough to warrant a purchase right now. If you're looking for in-depth combat mechanics in a simple-looking game, Joylancer has it. If you're looking for a satisfying score/time attack action game, Joylancer is quickly becoming that game. If you're looking for frenetic and fun multiplayer, Joylancer has got your back.\n\nThere is true joy in lancing.","November 15, 2014","true","1.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Let's talk Joylancer, shall we?\n\nWhile the game just recently hit Early Access and is obviously not finished, for what its worth, it actually plays pretty damn well all things considered. The multiple color schemes, the feel, and the looks all scream Game Boy and Game Boy Color, and on that note, they have so far excelled in bringing in the nostalgia train for this gamer. The controls take a short amount of time and practice to get used to, and the uppercut lance technique seems to be particularly tricky (at least, to me, that is).\n\nCombat is frantic and furious, with things exploding and being knocked all over the place. Expect a serious amount of carnage for such a promising game in the future. Oh, did I mention I tested this game out with an Xbox 360 controller, and works wonderfully? They even got the pad to vibrate when your lance is fully rev-ed up. Nice touch.\n\nIt's got my thumbs up for such good quality at such an early stage, keep up the good work, developers!

I call him MacDaddy.\n\nIn a world barraged by broken AAA titles and sequels to games that got boring three sequels ago, Joylancer is a diamond in the rough, drawing its inspiration from Nintendo's Gameboy and utilising a two-button system that seriously kicks ♥♥♥. It comes with a learning curve, but you'll soon be popping out combos and tearing through your enemies like there's no tomorrow, with awesome customizable visuals and a neat soundtrack to match the frantic action.\n\nThere's currently only an hour or so worth of gameplay, but Joylancer is such a blast that I keep coming back to replay it on increasing difficulty levels, and with regular updates, the game is only going to grow.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultraviper/recommended/315540/","ultraviper","Ultraviper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultraviper/","671 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLots of poor design choices. Example:  When the game first starts it asks you if you want to go through a tutorial. If you say yes, it puts you on the main menu afterwards. The problem is there are actually THREE tutorials and you have only done one of them. The game doesn't even tell you there are 2 more unless you go into the tutorial menu. But why would you go into that menu at all when you just finished the tutorial? Another example: When you first start the game it asks if you want to turn on rumble. Sure, why not? The problem there is that the controller vibrates CONSTANTLY. Literally. The rumble doesn't stop. Ever. So you go into the options to turn it off. It's not there. The option is actually in the character profile screen for some reason.\n\n\n\nAlso the game isn't that good. The game is based around a completely unncessary "revving" mechanic where you have to hold down and press X (when using an xbox controller) to charge up energy. You have to do this 3 times to get a full charge. There is no reason to ever do anything in the game un-charged so all it does is add extra button pushing for the reason of... I don't even know what, I guess the developer just really wanted people to press extra buttons. Imagine a mario game where you could only jump if you hold down and press B 3 times before each jump.

I got it very cheap in a bundle, but after playing it, I feel like it will be well worth the price they're asking for it. I dont know exactly how much content is currently in the game, but the developer promises a large number of levels and multiplayer modes, and considering how active said developer has been, Im inclined to believe that. That said, my opinion is primarily based on the gameplay and mechanics thus far, how they feel, as well as the art style and music. The game is very combat focused, taking a lot of cues from both fighting games and modern hack and slash/spectacle fighting games. The control scheme is simple, but responsive, and the way your various abilities interact creates a variety of mobility and combat options. The combat thus far is fairly challenging and shows a huge potential for depth, much in the same way that games like Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden, and Bayonetta do. The similarities to these types of games seem to be the primary criticism most are leveraging against this game, that Joylancer's combat ultimately boils down to frantic buttonmashing, as many also say about the games I mentioned. You certainly COULD get by with mindless mashing, but there is a lot more to it if you try to learn how everything works. The art style, in my opinion, captures the retro feel while not feeling like a duplicate of any particular game. However, since it does carry the sort of 8-bit/early handheld graphical style, many may form their opinion on that alone, and you probably know whether you like it or not. The music is pretty damn good as well, and fits the high-speed, aggressive nature of the game. If you're interested, I'd definitely reccomend picking it up in a sale or a bundle. If you're not too sure, as with any early access game, wait for the full release.","March 22, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Very solid game. Interesting mechanics that, for the most part, feel natural and allow for great mobility. Especially exciting if you like speedrunning because the movement mechanics give a lot of interesting opportunities with regards to movement optimization. As for story, well... I don't know. I was busy enjoying the gameplay — and, in my mind, that's great. Any game's gameplay should (ideally) be good enough to stand on its own without a story, and for Joylancer that certainly holds true — at least for what I've seen so far.\n\nOnly negative point that I've run into so far is a grinding and extremely insistent disharmony in one of the BGM tracks (I'm almost certain it's done on purpose and I'm usually all for deliberate disharmony in music, but for some reason this just rubs me the wrong way), but the game allows you to use whatever you want for BGM so it's not a huge deal.","April 6, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The combat is fast, which is one of the positives, but because of its fast nature, figuring out combinations can be irritatingly difficult, especially with a controller (dare not attempt to play it with the keyboard). There is also a multiplier in order to help you get a high score, but the chance of getting a high multiplier is currently minimal as; the multipliers timer goes by far too quickly at higher points, Enemy to crystal collection is far between (would argue that more enemy instances would benefit the game greatly), having to continually charge your drill can slow you down.\n\nHaving said that, I have enjoyed what I have played, and I was intrigued from the first time I layed my eyes upon it, I love Joylancers style and I cannot wait to see more content added to this game. This can be a brilliant game in due time, but as an early access game, it shows promise of a concept which could be quite beautiful.\n\nAn additional note, the music can be really good but one track in particular I do not enjoy as it is disjointed and distracting from the gameplay, atleast for me.

There is a good game here, but things just seem way unfinished.  The UI is kinda unintuitive and doesn't always keep settings -- which is a big issue for me.\n\nAside from that, there's a lot going on in the game that it's hard for me to tell if it's just unfinished, glitchy, or a poor design decision.  The title screen music is a huge example of this, as I find it really disjointed and obnoxious.  There are some graphics that fall into this category as well.\n\nI know the game is not finished, and I definitely don't hate the game or anything like that.  Just, right now it isn't really fully playable by any means, and I can't picture myself coming back to it ANY time soon.\n\nWhen this sees a full release (or at least some MAJOR updates) I'll give it another shot -- and HOPEFULLY be able to change my review!","November 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Good mechinics from what I could tell, but the menues and controller assignments are glitchy and we couldn't even manage to play multiple with 2 xbox 360 controllers.\n\nAs it is right now, I was very disapointed with my purchase, even though i only paid 3 dollers for the game, and that says something in and of itself. The main reason for this is both the incomplete glitchyness of the game, and the music.\n\nI have never before been detered by a games music before, but this time I honestly cannot bring myself to try the game again because of the music. Music in a game is very important to me. It helps set the pace, setting, etc, and it seems this music was going for a sort of fast pace by using a repeatative jumble of notes in all cases. However it sounds horrible. This may be highly opinionated, but I am honestly shocked I don't see comments on this music. Sure, you can set the music to your own music, but thats not really valid excuse. The majority of the time i played was muted.\n\nI even had a firend over to try the multiplayer. We start off by plugging in reguler xbox 360 wired controllers. Should be the baseline for compatibility standards, so how could it go wrong? Well, it comes in as two different things, a gamepad AND a joypad.\nAfter messing around, we got both players set to gamepad, but when we went to play, it switched us back to the joypad and all controls were messed up again. Then when trying to select characters, it was switching color pallets and maybe some other video settings because it was looking weird. We gave up and played a different game.\n\nOne could certainly assume that this would be better on release, but who knows when that will be. No updates in over 2 months. Early access should not be an excuse to not finish development, but its happened before. Right now just about everything is un-finished and more than a little broken.\n\nI have been watching and waiting for this game to get out of early access for a while because I usually like action platformers like this one, but I hate this early access business. In far too many cases it leads to disapointemnt, however, I felt it worth 3 dollers at the time so I broke down and bought it. I am now even more adament about never buying early access games.","December 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Figuring out the menus is currently a nightmare. Navigating the overworld is pretty confusing too. This game has a lot of potential, but it is currently massively hindered by poor UX. I didn't find the tutorials other people are mentioning, but I bet that would be extremely useful because I had no clue what was happening in the game.\n\nAdditionally, when looking for a 4-player couch co-op game, it really needs to have good UX because if even 1 player doesn't completely understand what they're doing it ruins the entire experience for everyone. IMO if you're looking for a casual 4-player game for when you have friends over I would not consider this game at all. If you have friends over who are all experienced with this game and know exactly what's going on, then you'd be fine.\n\nLooking forward to the release of the game to see how these issues are resolved, but I just don't think this game is for me.","June 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

But after only playing thru the tutorial and 2 levels, it currently has frustrating issues which I hope get addressed before it comes out of early access:\n\nPerformance:\nMy computer exceeds all the recommended settings with 4GB of RAM, 2.13GHz processor, and a DirectX 9 capable graphics card, yet it lags on levels outside of the tutorial. Taking the game out of fullscreen seems to help a bit, but I'm unsure why. I'm not sure if it's an instancing problem or what, but I can't understand how a pixelated retro style game can be lagging on my computer even with most of the special effects turned off.\n\nGraphics:\nThere appears to be a graphical glich(es) where portraits don't show anything except a solid color, signs don't have any text, and doors are replaced by solid black boxes on the buildings.\n\nControls:\nWhy is the jump button an input for any of the character's attacks when we have a dedicated attack button? I use a joystick on my controller, so I'm often pressing both Up and Right, or Down and Left, etc. This causes the shortcut for the Drill Uppercut move to often trigger when all I wanted was to simply jump. Which sucks since it uses up some of my Speed charges.\n\nSpeaking of Speed charges, why does the basic attack go thru a full combo with a single button press, thereby consuming all my Speed charges? Additionally, when trying to use the attacks to help platforming, using all 3 charges consecutively and flinging myself over the platform I'm trying to land on is extremely annoying. I'm fine with pressing the attack button 3 times in a row when I want 3 attacks in a row. I'm not fine attacking 3 times when I only wanted to attack once.\n\nAnd lastly, outside of the tutorial level, charging up the Speed bar takes noticably longer not even accounting for the lag mentioned above. Some consistency would be nice. I was about to throw down my controller in frustration until I noticed that spamming the attack button while holding Down charges faster. Brilliant! I like it! It feels good! But why wasn't this explained in the tutorial? The only notion I got was that I needed to hold the attack button, not spam it.\n\nMissing Features:\nThis is more of a nice to have, quality of life/game feel, thing, but why can't I Uppercut in mid air? It consumes a Speed charge, so I can't do it indefinitely and abuse it to kingdom come. After many years of playing Super Smash Bros, doing an up attack move mid-air that flings the character skyward feels like the most natural thing in the gaming world. Maybe make it less effective mid-air to balance it out? Regardless, I'd really like to have this ability.","April 19, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Will likely be right up there as a beloved title with Shovel Knight. As of April 1st 2015 there are only 3 or 4 levels to be played but they are definitely good and overall perfect for building the hype for this game. Can't wait for more to be released.","March 30, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
