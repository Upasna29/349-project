Do you like intense screenfilling action? Do you like explosions? Do you like great music? Do you like explosions? Do you like your enemies to play retro games?(Yes, seriously).\n\nRoche Fusion is an old school shoot-em-up in a modern skin. Smooth graphics and effects that run on pretty much any old calculator. There is a wide selection of ships and powerups, catering to pretty much every imaginable playstyle. The music is fitting and uplifting, epic at times.\n\nPrepare to die and die again some more. It's not an easy game, but once you hit that #1 highscore spot you know why you just spent 4 hours trying to get there.\n\nFor those of you less into shmups and more into rogueli(k/t)es, playing it actually feels somewhat like a rogue-li(k/t)e, since there's so much randomness involved in the enemies and upgrade options.\n\nFor it's price, it's a no brainer.","January 23, 2015","true","48.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","13","13","2","0"

It has awesome graphics, great music, but most of all the gameplay is simply perfect. There are various ships and upgrades, which you can combine in endless ways to get all different kinds of builds.\nIt is one of the most unforgiving and awesome games ever, you will be killed over and over and yet you will keep coming back for more.","January 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

This game has everything I want from a shoot'em up. :)\n\nYou can instantly jump into it with easy first waves and self explaining controls. While you're playing and killing hordes of beautiful drawn enemies you collect aktive or passive upgrades (weapons, shields, drones, rainbows...you name it!). This gives the game a very interesting RPG twist, you now not only hunt for highscores but also for new skills. Also there are 6 ships you can gradually unlock, and each has its own unique mechanics and also upgrades.\n\nGraphics-wise it's a 2D style, featuring gorgeous ships, enemies, backgrounds and EXPLOSIONS! Lots of explosions, great looking explosions.\n\nI'd like to write some more, but I gotta continue my hunt for highscores :)\n\nDid I mention explosions?","January 28, 2015","true","34.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I used to play them back in the arcade days (80s and 90s) but just recently I've started checking a few out on PC. This one looked like a lot of fun based on the procedurally generated stuff and the ship upgrades.\n\nAnd it is. It moves a little too fast and it gets really hard really fast, even on easy, but I still like it. The weapons are interesting, the graphics are nice, it's not too busy that you can't tell what's going on, and the upgrade and unlock system is really cool.\n\n[Edit] The game was crashy after 20-30 minutes but it may be that I'm using a sound card. The developer provided a fix that replaces the OpenAL DLL file and that seems to have solved the issue. I was real impressed at the quick response!\n\nOut of the recent shmups I've picked up and started playing, so far this is the best of the bunch. The music reminds me a little of Daft Punk and it has a really slick presentation. Thumbs up!\n\n[Edit]\nStill really enjoying this game. It's fun to pick up and play and shoot a few things. The upgrade system and randomization is a blast, as well as unlocking new ships. It still gets hard pretty quick even on Easy, but it's just so smooth and fun!","January 29, 2015","true","21.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

There's a lot of options in terms of visuals which is nice to see in terms of those that really have problems like epilispcy or performance issues (which I had absolutely none with all the options turned on). A lot of my negatives about the game is nitpicking some of the mechanics that the game has, in particular with powerups and them disappearing rather quickly. The game is solid all around, and if you are looking for a shoot em up that will keep your attention over time, this is exactly right up your alley. For shoot em up fans that really want something that feels the same, but will keep their attention.\n\n+:\nGood variety of powerups of active and passive powers. Good variety of different ships for different play types.\nVisuals are excellent, and a lot of options available for those that need less clutter on the screen.\nPerformance is excellent. No frame drops, which is critical for a twitch game like thiis.\nSolid mechanics and controls that gives you the right amount of control.\nEnemy variety is good, and randomizes the position of spawning to make it feel different, but familiar in terms of waves.\nThe little touches. The ability to see cooldowns right in front of you when you use something on cooldown, or the sound distorting when speeding up.\n-:\nUpgrades in terms of dropable powerups don't stand around for too long, and takes too much risk to grab.\nNothing truly different from the genre here, just a lot of refinements.","May 30, 2015","true","8.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game has some wonderful elements of gameplay.  We played it for lots of hours trying to unlock every ship.  Once every ship was unlocked...nothing left to do.  I was excited to get like 7th in the world on a 2 player game!  I played almost entirely 2 player, with my kids, so it aht regard it was fun for us.  Once you master dodging the heck out of things it gets more enjoyable.  So on the one hand, enjoyable and difficult and good for 2 player Co-op.  Highlight of the game is the Epic Bosses which are extemely well done graphically and mechanically.  My hat is off to the developers in that regard.\n\nThe rest of this review is the things I didn't like:\n\nThe game relies heavily on the three (or 4) randomly generated upgrades between levels.  Some games you hit all the right stuff each board and dominate, other games you get all the wrong stuff and die off in the fourth level-quickly.  In this way, the later boards seemed more about luck, than skill.\n\nSome upgrades are a must have (which is frustrating) in order to survive the later levels.  Battering Ram, for example, you need because it allows you several seconds of invincibility and cool down is like 6 seconds.  Without it, you just die fast.\n\nSome of the ships are useless unless they get their ship-unique upgrades (homing), which makes it frustrating if they don't show up in the random cycle.  Wish they would make them default, or just offer them every level as an option.\n\nThe Digit ship actually has an upgrade that lowers the ships effectiveness (auto-aiming), which makes you wonder if they completely play tested them.\n\nThe hardest ship to get (and last one we unlocked) is a rail-gun shooting mistake that has nothing going for it.  We tried, we had other player carry it to later boards to make sure we got all the upgrades and it simply sucked in so many ways, weak defense, weak offense, i don't know what they were after on this.\n\nWould like the Ultimate shots to come more often, maybe change the mechanic that drives them (like using combos to earn your ultimate meter instead of the orange orbs).\n\nBut, for all my complaining, we did get 34 hours of fun time with me and the boys as we struggled through to unlock the ships.","February 2","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every single ship at start has unique traits, so in order to go as far as possible you need to take those weaknesses into consideration when taking upgrades.\nVisuals are nice and I'm not observing any lags even with enormous amount of ships you may be fighting after defeating second super boss. When it comes to super bosses, their attacks will make you feel like playing your usual bullet hell.\nMusic is great and it doesn't feel repeating for me at least.\nEasy difficulty is easy, normal is... well... you would need to check that yourself, but I think the only difference is that you take twice or thrice the damage compared to Easy. Personally I've managed to get +600 million score on Easy, but on Normal I've died before getting 1 million...\nSurprisingly enough my favorite ship is Lily, the only one which has no armor regeneration at start.\n\nKinda bad that the developers are not working on this project anymore, because there is at least one known bug here.","February 6","true","102.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
