Alas, there are not much hidden gems and most times you will just pick up another little pebble. Ravenmark is such a disapointment that looked good at first glance.\n\nA warning should have been the fact that Ravenmark is an iOS port. While that doesn't mean that it automatically has to be a bad game, there are still some implications that come along with it. Games for portable devices almost always don't want to bother the player with decisions that he made in earlier stages of the game. Concerning an RPG or strategy game, this effectively means that there are most likely no player choices to be made like specialising the skills of your units, upgrade units after a battle and carry it over to the next or RPG-choices that affect the course of the story. In short, you can expect that everything that adds salt and pepper to a RPG or strategy game will be left out. This, sadly, is the case with Ravenmark.\n\nThe following list rates the different aspects of the game using a scale from very bad (---) to very good (+++):\n\nStability/Bugs: +++\nNo bugs or stability issues encountered. Good job.\nRPG-aspects: -\nThe story is a railroad slideshow without any interaction or possibility to make choices by the player. The characters are flat and either unmotivated good, bad and/or naive. Sometimes there's a voice narration of the character's conversations, which is nice.\nTactical aspects: +\nYou can give direct commands only to a maximum of six units during any given turn, while you will have at most times more than six units of yours on the battlefield. You can group units together and these new formations can be commanded with only a single command. Unfortunately, formations will often times not do or will not be able to do what you've ordered them to. All in all the tactical aspects are okay and the formation system adds a nice new idea to the genre.\nStrategic-aspects: ---\nThere are simply no strategic decisions to be made. You can't upgrade units or characters, you can't decide which units to bring into battle, you can't decide on which terrain to fight, you have no choices regarding infrastructure, unit supply, economics or whatsoever.\nPrice: -\nConsidering the fact, that this is an iOS port, 15 € comes pretty close to a rip-off. With the lack of RPG-decisions and no strategic value, Ravenmark comes down to a casual game with some boring slideshow story. Honestly said, I wouldn't want to pay money for that no matter the cost.","September 11, 2015","false","16.4"," 239 of 294 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","239","294","3","8"

This time, you order units into action (up to 6) but when you end the turn, they move (based on initiative) as the enemy moves. This leads to a feeling of unpredictability to the AI and sometimes the best move actually turns into the worst move, especially if your unit moves after an opponent's. The limitation of orders also gives weight to the formation system in the game. Essentially, you will have multiple units, let's assume 3 swordsmen who can then be grouped into a formation. This formation, while far less mobile, buffs your units a bit while also allowing for special abilities and only counts as one order rather than 3. Basically, it brings additional challenge while also being practical.\nWhile this is still a turn-based wargame, there is a heavy focus on story in between (sometimes during) the battles where you learn more about the main character and his motley cast of friends and possible enemies. The story itself is pretty simple (from what I've seen so far) in that it follows the typical Hero's Journey story type. Main character seems talentless but actually has lots of potential and becomes the savior of... etc etc. Truly though, the story does a great job at adding background to what would otherwise be a series of challenges and scenarios!\nTo sum up the rest of my feelings on the game, it has a nice soundtrack, good artwork, an absolute ♥♥♥♥ ton of lore all provided very neatly and organized for Lore Nuts like myself and the game provides a good deal of fun to boot. It does seem like one of those games that once you beat, you may not replay it unless you're shooting for harder difficulties. All in all, I like it and definitely recommend it.\nGameplay Footage and Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbcdT8Fm7Ao","September 10, 2015","true","3.6"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","49","62","8","0"

Ravemark: Scourge of Estellion is my latest taste of this deep, complex genre. While there’s some roughness around the edges, I’m happy to report that it’s a solidly-constructed and engaging story that manages to create a worthwhile experience. So, without further ado, let’s crack open Witching Hour Studios’ foray into strategic glory.\n\nRavenmark: Scourge of Estellion follows a group of commanders in a war that rages across the world of Eclisse. Players will take control of these commanders and their troops, leading them across continents in turn-based strategic battles. Combat plays out in two-phase style split between the command phase, where players will dictate troop formations, movements, and make adjustments to standing orders. After this, the action phase kicks in, with all units on the field making their moves in initiative-determined succession after all the moves are locked.\n\nWhat makes Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion something special, in terms of its combat, is a combination of things. The formation system, which allows players to link and unlink units of the same type on the fly, gives a great customization to any given battle. Combined with the unique flow of battle from the so-called “WeGo” system and the fact that players have a limited number of command points to work with each turn, Ravenmark really builds a unique and thought-heavy strategic style.\n\nOf course, Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion has to have something more than a worthwhile battle system to really shine. A good game of this type needs a good story, and Ravenmark tries to deliver on this. I say “tries” not because it’s necessarily unsuccessful, but because the story features such a large cast and scale that it can be tough to follow. With war, betrayal, and politics playing out across the land, players may struggle to keep up with the many twists and turns, but it’s clear a ton of work went into crafting the complex tale.\n\nIf there’s anywhere that Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion falls short, it’s probably in the aesthetic design. There’s a lot of bland battlegrounds with tough to discern features, which can make using the terrain to your advantage difficult. Even so, the ways that it can be used when you’re able to are great. Placing archers on high ground, using defensive-minded formations to control choke points, and keeping an eye on how to outflank your opponent will all serve players well in their efforts. The unique flow of battle can turn the tide in an instant, though, so the most important thing is to keep an eye on the whole and predict what your foe has planned so that you can act accordingly.\n\nAll told, Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion is built on one of the more strategy-focused systems I’ve had the pleasure of playing recently, and the formation and command systems are top-notch ways of adding some additional depth to the typical tactical style. While the story is dense, it’s not incoherent, though less attentive players will find themselves lost. With a Steam price of 14,99€, there’s plenty of content to say it’s easily worth it. While the reliance on forethought and the thick, winding plot may be overwhelming for some, this is a must-have for players who love to put their minds to work in tactics-first games.","May 11","true","10.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

The combat is layered quite deep, as is the exception lore of the gameworld itself. In truth, the Codex itself that comes with the game is worth the price alone.  I had the good fortune of receiving an early review copy from the folks of Slitherine. Ive played quite awhile and haven't even cracked the surface of the game. The combat system of the game relies heavily on Hero abilties, as well as "anticipation" in Ravenmark you don't directly attack the enemy, you move a unit adjacent to an enemy unit, or where you think they will be, there is a good chance they'll manage to get out of your way due to a combat ability, etc.  Below I have provided a wonderful battle from one of my streams that I like to call "Battle of the Trojan Caravan" so as not to give away spoilers I won't be telling you how far into the game this is, but let's just say on the scale of battles this would be considered miniscule. As the game progresses battles become truly massive affairs, with multiple armies facing off for one ultimate goal, total domination of Estellion.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sCko9ZD6o&feature=youtu.be\n","September 10, 2015","true","10.3"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","31","46","3","0"

At times it can be fairly agonizing to figure out the best course of action with a limit of six commands per turn, factoring in the order of operations, and not knowing exactly what the opposing forces will do. The storyline is passable, but it has hints of a good amount of worldbuilding.

On the one hand, it presented a really well polished nice looking unit by unit combat system and a lot of thought has gone into the command structure and how it all works but I'm not convinced this new way over micromanaging units is really needed. I pretty much exclusively play Turn Based Strats and this one is certainly inovative but again, I'm not sure if it really works. One very off putting part of the game is the JRPG style story elements inbetween each mission. I presonally hate these story arcs unless its imperitive to the game play. Take Banner Saga for example, a game that NEEDS the story arc as choices between characters really matter later on. And on the flip side you have something like Age of Wonders which doesnt clog you with story because it wants you to just get on with the game.\n\nGenerally speaking, This game isnt for me as its a little off the track of how I like my turn based strategies but if you are the sort of person that wants a spin off of TBS as well as you like fleshed out story, its probably for you.
