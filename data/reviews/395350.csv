This did not affect my opinion; I will only recommend games that I like. If I do not like a game, I will not recommend it. Period. View my mission statement.\nREVIEWDoors is a very simple game that puts a modern-indie-game spin on the classic logic puzzle of The Honest and Dishonest Guards. There isn’t much innovation to the gameplay, but there is a good atmospheric presentation and an alluring simplicity to it all. I enjoyed it, but I can confidently say that not everyone will. I really enjoy solving the style of logic puzzles used in the game; I even sometimes look up riddles similar to these for entertainment when I’m bored at work. If you like this kind of thinking game too, then you should consider trying this game; but also be aware it is very short, and will be beaten in one sitting.\n\nSo, yes, Doors is very short. If you approach the game with a comfortable pace, and actually solve the riddles, it will probably last about the same amount of time as a modern Hollywood movie. I like short games a lot, because I like variety and won’t live forever, but I will say that I would have been more content with more content. Yes. Mostly because I was enjoying it and I wasn’t ready for it to be over. It definitely could benefit from another hour or so of gameplay.\n\nThe riddles start off pretty easy, and slowly get more complicated as you go on. Some of them towards the end are quite tricky and the final puzzle is definitely hardcore. If you get stuck you may be tempted to just bulldoze the puzzles with good ol’ trial and error, but you would only be eliminating the purpose of the game (which is to solve the riddles by understanding them).\n\nThe atmosphere is easily the most alluring aspect of the game. There is a persistently mystifying ambiance which is juxtaposed with suggestions of an unknown actual reality.  It feels like you’re down the rabbit hole. There are clear and strong influences from games like Portal, Limbo, and The Stanley Parable.\n\nIt won’t appeal to everyone. It is/was clearly a very small project that is intentionally compact and quaint. But if you are like me and like these types of riddles, then you probably will enjoy this entertaining, but quite brief, game. Consider it for a price you are comfortable with and give it a whirl.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 12","true","3.2"," 140 of 176 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","140","176","6","6"

Let's be real here, gamers love when a game recognize them as real people playing it and that they are not just another game characters. Hence why games like The Stanley Parable or The Begginer's Guide became a hit. But if you are a game developer, you cannot just rely on this fact.\n\n======OVERVIEW======\nThis game gave me mixed feelings, I must say. Honestly, after few of those puzzles, I felt like this is it, there's not gonna be more, you will just go through these doors and you either choose a correct one and go to the next puzzle, or a wrong one and die. Thankfully, I was wrong. Later on it changes a bit but since I don't wanna spoil this game for those of you, who want to buy and play this, I'm not gonna go into details. But these few changes it made, I wanted them to last longer, I had not enough of it and yet again I found myself in front of those doors. I really hoped that after all, I may enjoy this game, it might have a bit of a crazy story like The Stanley Parable did, but no. The story was almost nonexistent. It felt like the dev just wanted to throw something in, so it's not that monotonous but he just didn't have enough time to think about it. It felt dull. It was dull. Sure, few "jokes" here and there but it didn't change my mind and opinion about this game. And bacon as a "main thing"? Oh my god, amazing idea, people love bacon, no doubt about that, so they will automatically love this game as well. I just hope this was not what went through the developer's mind even though I wouldn't really be surprised...\n\nPROS- visual side\n- trading cards\n- achievements\n\nCONS- overall dull experience\n- NO replay value\n- no interesting feature (like voice-over or soundtrack, something to catch your attention)\n\n======RATING======\nFirstly, if you don't enjoy walking simulators, you're definitely not gonna enjoy this game either. Apart from the last puzzle, it is not a "my brain hurts" type of game either. There's not much to say. Overall dull experience, nothing to be hyped about. Atleast the graphics of this game are polished. However, it is not enough to change the fact that I can't really recommend buying this.\n\nFor recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","February 12","false","2.4"," 109 of 142 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","109","142","7","4"

I was a little worried, but my love of logic puzzles overcame that fear, and I bought it anyways.  I've been recording the game, and I've played one hour of this, (the rest of the time at the moment was me setting up the recording, and leaving it open while editing)  This game is a great logic puzzle game, as you recieve puzzles like seeing two doors: Either they are both correct or they are both incorrect; One says "Both doors lead to death" and the other says "This door leads to bacon".  Which door do you enter?  That one in particular was a VERY easy one.  They get pretty complex.  I've used up 10 notebook pages trying to solve these already.  Anyways, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to get confused. :P  Also, I want to aknowledge the people who say "It's easy, just keep guessing until your right".  To that I say, "Really?"  What's the point of buying a puzzle game, if you DON'T LIKE PUZZLES?  Stop trashing the game when you don't even like the genre.  Saying "Just walk in every door until you get it right" COMPLETELY misses the point of the game.  The game is not supposed to entertain you for thirty seconds at a time, this game is something you sit at for long amounts of time, and actually use your brain.

Walk for a bit.\n2. Stumble upon some doors. Read the writing above them and on the floor, choose which one you think is the "right" one. Two possibilities :\n- Wrong door. You die. Reload and try another one until you find the right one.\n- Right door. You can continue playing.\n\nRinse and repeat until done. Some exceptions here and here that spice up the boring linearity of the game a bit, but it's so rare and insignificant that you won't even remember it. The main problem is that the game lacks substance and could be summarized by a series of multiple choice logic questions written on a piece of paper. And even if it tries to compare itself to The Stanley Parable, there just isn't enough stuff other than these questions to keep the player interested.\n\nMy advice : don't wait for a promotion to buy Doors. Just don't buy it if you want anything more than logic questions.","February 13","false","3.3"," 118 of 176 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","118","176","12","2"

(The tags lie.)\n\nThe challenge in this game is to pass through 23 doors that lead to bacon - and to not pass through the approximately 100 doors that lead to death (which means retry, because there's autosave if you haven't turned it off). To help you with that, you need to determine which of the logic statements above the door is correct. (The statement on the floor is always correct.) It took me somewhat longer than an hour to do the first time. I've never seen a game like this, and I hope there'll be a sequel with more levels.\n\nThe rules:\nIn every puzzle is a door that leads to bacon. All other doors lead to death.\nOn every door is a statement. It may be true, and it may be false.\nIf one statement on a door is true, then all statements on that door are true.

About halfway through (maybe about 20 minutes?) a plot element develops, which I found really interesting! But it is shortly abandoned for the same puzzles I solved earlier, and none of them really left me scratching my head. Not only that, but choosing an incorrect door has no real negative outcome. The fact that I can try over and over on the same puzzle, being helpfully loaded right back in front of it, leaves me with no motivation to truly solve it.\nThe influence of The Stanley Parable is evident here, but it feels cheap. The office section of the game just screams it, but almost nothing is interactable, and the signs don't make any real sense to the "narrative" we find ourselves in. If it's satire, it's not working. I also would have liked to see more varied humor on the doors. The main joke with the bacon falls very flat. We get it, bacon is so great. It would have been a little funny if it was mentioned just once at the beginning and then you get it at the end. Instead the word is shoved down your throat so much that when the actual bacon does show up you don't want it at all.","February 13","false","1.1"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","31","41","0","0"

That's pretty much it.\n\nIs Doors groundbreaking? Heck no, it's essentially a book of "The blue man lives in the green house, and the green man is next to the red man's house, so who lives in the purple house?" style puzzles put into a game. Despite that, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. Doors' is a match made in heaven between Limbo's sharp visual splendor and The Stanley Parable's wit and charm. The gameplay is really well done, and it keeps introducing new concepts. Storywise, Doors falls a little flat. I won't spoil anything, but the ending could've been handled better, and it just felt lackluster.\n\nDoors is not a game for everyone. It's very short (we're talking 30 minutes to an hour) and is definitely more logical than Limbo or The Stanley Parable. Doors has little replayability due to the nature of its' design. There are a few easter eggs here and there, but Doors is ultimately a really great concept with great design, subverted by the lack of content. I recommend it, but only if there's a sale going on, or if you like logic games.","February 12","true","0.2"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","24","34","0","0"

The puzzles made me engage my noodle; the first achievement I got made me laugh out loud; the description is honest about it being short.  I loved Portal and Portal 2, and enjoyed Antichamber, so I took a risk.  I'm glad I did.\n\nIt's a little pricey for what amounts to a very brief book of logic puzzles, but it is attractive if not actually pretty, and has a bit of mystery to it.  If I have one complaint it's that we're supposed to buy that anyone could be expected to believe the game is anything but a simulation, when everything around them is that Limbo-esque, foggy black that Unity game designers use to look arty and so they don't have to design textures.\n\n...That's for giving me that first achievement, Mr. Weibel.  You know the one I mean.\n\nI'm also not wild about the sound design -- the sudden bangs are a little incontinence-inducing.  But that is a fine nit to pick.\n\nIf you like logic puzzles, and Doors is on sale, go on and pick it up.

Too much, some would say. After finishing The Witness, i was craving more.\nI had a look through some interesting games and i come across Doors. I figured it looks interesting enough to give it a go.\n\nThe game is a glorified version of the Knights and Knaves logic puzzle. You are given a set of statements, some are true, some are false and you need to figure out what to do with that information. In concept, a good idea for a puzzle game, but i think the game could have presented the puzzles better.\n\nEach of the doors in the game were pritty much side by side and had no variations. The majority of the game consisted of a kinda empty scene in black and white. the modeling was very good, and i think a bit of colour and maybe a higher draw distance and the game would have been very beautiful, as well as that, when the game says it's short, it's really short. I was able to complete it within 50 minutes, and i was kinda disapointed it ended so soon, it felt like i was barely getting into the game when it ended.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were a little too straightforward. If you didn't take notes then it would be easy to see how people would make mistakes but given the instructions it wasnt too hard (all besides the very last puzzle, which even though i was able to work out down to two of thirty doors, there was no way i could find to decisivly figure out which one was correct without guessing)\n\nTL:DR\n\nThis game is a lot like a cheap burger.\n\nSure it's good but its not very filling, and also it's really bland and plain, it needs something to spice it up a little and i think it would be much better. 4/10\n\n","February 14","false","0.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

A word of warning: If you're no good at even the simplest of "riddles", be fully prepared for this game to make you feel like the dumbest ♥♥♥ who ever walked the Earth.\n\nEssentially it's just a series of "choose the correct door or die" conundrums, in which you select the correct portal by way of a process of elimination...a process which I still managed to get wrong at least half of the time (so yes...dumb + ♥♥♥ = me)!  But it's a smidgen more than that...it also sets itself up as a bit of an atmospheric mind-♥♥♥♥, emulating not just a logic-based video game, but indeed a kind of corporate or governmental logic-testing simulator, complete with minor electronic "glitches" and so forth.  At first the slightly spooky landscapes you briefly traverse to get to the next puzzle seem like little more than an opportunity for some nice sound design and some snazzy screenshots, but as the game progresses, it does succeed in making you feel like you've just been a part of a short-but-sinister psychological experiment, the end result of which may very well be your own extermination (for the aforementioned crime of being such a chronic and incurable dumb-♥♥♥♥).  It's a minor touch, but a welcome one, just the same.\n\nOh, and on the subject of "shortness"...yeah, it's short, but don't let my brief playing time or all the boastful reviews fool you.  Sure, all bar one of the puzzles involves so few doors that you could just zip through them methodically 'til you find the right one, but anyone seeking to solve all the riddles fair-and-square is bound to take a little longer, unless they have an extraordinary natural talent for this kind of thinking.  Oh, and good ♥♥♥♥ing luck to anyone believing that they can solve the second-last puzzle in under two minutes without cheating (which I most assuredly did, by looking up a walkthrough...'cause in less than two minutes I knew it had me beat, plain-and-simple)!  There's also quite a few wacky little Achievements to pursue, for those so inclined, so earnest players could easily get more than a couple of hours out of this game if they don't give in to the ever-present and most assuredly evil allure of the walkthrough.\n\nIf all this talk of logic and puzzles has done your head in already, you may want to skip this one.  For anyone else, the price being asked is more than fair for the product being offered, though the sitting-square-on-the-fence people might at least want to wait on a sale.  Recommended, but only heartily to those mental masochists out there who enjoy a good head-pummelling.  Me, I could probably go a few rounds of Killing Floor or Borderlands right now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheUnicornHunter/recommended/395350/","TheUnicornHunter","Mardo, the Unicorn Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheUnicornHunter/","796 products in account","Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam group\nFew words about the game\nDoors is a nice logic game, with a simple idea of choosing between doors. Sounds easy, I know. Wait until like 10th level, then we'll see. As said in game description, Doors obviously took an inspiration from Limbo and Stanley Parable, because it looks literally like mix of those two. Unfortunately, huge potential is left out. We all get the idea of hidden "understory" going on, but for example Portal explains bit here and there and lets us connect some things, make up some things that fit etc.. But here developer literally threw at players torn pieces of written ideas and it's either not enough to create something nice from it or it's just impressively shallow story. It's hard to say that I recommend or not recommend it, as there are pros and cons everywhere. Only if there would be "Mixed" button, I would press it without hesitation, but as I quite enjoyed it, I'm going to press "Yes".\n\nAdvantages\nFirst of all, if you're into puzzle games, you like mind twisters etc., you will enjoy this game. Plenty of puzzles, at first quite easy, but they will get harder after few levels so be patient\nGraphics are really minimalistic, yet they are somehow nice and well-fitting here\nSounds in game are pretty, realistic and, same as graphics, nicely match with surroundings\nQuite cheap, so if you will enjoy it, that's good. If not, hey, it has trading cards and achievements!\nNeutral stuff\nNice try to implement Stanley Parable idea, but it didn't worked out as good as it might have. Nothing connects to anything, part of "story" disappears as sudden as it showed up and it's leaving feeling of... unfinished, left out idea.

Yeah, it takes a while to figure out some of levels (unless you're rushing through them without trying to solve them properly), yet it ends suddenly (about 1 hour) and there is ALOT of potential that could be used in many different ways to fill story a bit or develop some more puzzles to improve its length\n\nDisadvantages\nSoundtrack feels like developer couldn't decide if he should put music in there or not.

The length is short but sweet, any longer and the gameplay mechanic would of gotten stale.\n\nYou usually get people complaining about the gameplay and length of the game because they completed the game by rushing through doors and not actually reading them logically. You can't complain that a game that sets out to accomplish a genre is doing too well. Such as a horror game being too scary, or a puzzle game having too many puzzles.

You have to use the power of deduction and true or false facts given to choose which portal - or 'door' - to go through. One or more doors leads to bacon, the others death and sometimes, a door leads to an office.\n\nIf you have played before and know most of the correct doors it'll be a breeze, but it makes up for that by making your first time very difficult, especially if - like me - you weren't expecting something quite so challenging. Get your brain working, because you'll need it!\n\nIt plays very smoothly, a few frame rate hiccups every so often but nothing so bad as to be game-breaking. There is also no HUD but in all honesty, Doors has no reason to have it.\n\nDespite being simplistic, the game is visually brilliant with the audial ambience just as great. One moment you're staring into the void of black and grey, trying to figure out which door takes you one step closer to your delicious victory and never-ending supply of bacon, the next, you're wandering through an office as though you own the place. The sound effects add to the mysterious atmosphere as well, sounding somewhat like you have entered the stomach of a dinosaur.\n\nOverall, the game is a great concept brought to the world using an almost perfect balance of atmosphere and gameplay for a puzzler like this and if you enjoy games of the puzzle genre, I highly recommend you buy it.\n\nI give it 9 out of 10 juicy rashers of bacon.\n","May 14","true","1.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

However, this one has a low price tag, so I decided to throw a few dollars at it.\n\nI enjoy the atmosphere of the game. It does remind me of Limbo. The settings for the game are very basic. Really should have a volume setting. The player moves at a slow enough pace to take everything in, but I'll elaborate a bit on the movement speed later.\n\nThe puzzles are "eh". I have to wonder if I really suck at logic puzzles or did the developer intentionally use broken logic. Some of the puzzles don't seem to match what the statements are pointing at. Again, maybe I just suck.\n\nSo, gameplay. You walk, read what's on the ground in front of the doors (or portals, which I guess is the Portal influence), read what's on top of the doors, and use your brain to pick the door that'll bring you a bit further in your journey. Choose wrong, and start at the beginning of the area. Oh, and remember what I said about the movement speed? Yeah, enjoy walking from the area spawn to the doors again. It starts to get old after failing 3 or 4 times. Should have just put a respawn in front of the doors. As some of the other negative reviews point out, you can just "brute force" the puzzles and eventually get the right door, but that's the nature of this type of puzzle game.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. There are some fun little notes in the office area, but that's the end of the humor (from as far I got, at least).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/395350/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I recieved a free, early copy from the developer. Keep that in mind.\n\nIf you’d prefer a video review, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9VQ9P9A4mY\n\nThe whole gameplay loop is that you’re presented with doors and some instructions, and all but one leads to death, and the one that doesn’t, apparently, leads to bacon.\n\nI was a little torn with the presentation. On one hand it’s simple and clean, on the other I think you could argue it’s a bit boring. I tend to lean to the former rather than the latter, but I do think there’s a small subset of people who would be put off by it; if you’re not a fan of the bleakness of a game like Limbo, say, in terms of colour and style, then you’re not going to be stopping to take in the world. All that said, I think it serves the purpose well; I much prefer a simpler approach like this as opposed to an ugly attempt at something more complicated. It also fits in quite well with the story, and there is a story, and a theme, and an atmosphere, but i’ll talk about that in a sec.\n\nThe mechanics, well, there aren’t really any gameplay mechanics. This is where the game is going to lose most people. It’s not a walking simulator, like dear Esther, but it’s hard for me to class it completely as [PAUSE] a puzzle game. I’d say approach it more as a short brainteaser book that, doesn’t have too many puzzles and they're all really the same puzzle at varying difficulties but, there’s also a narrative there that you need to read between the lines to discover as you continue on in the book. I’m not saying it’s not a game, it is a game, but it has that quality where it’s for a very specific kind of person. Not necessarily for the person that loved Gone Home, but maybe a fan of The Witness would enjoy it, or any other puzzle game that asks a lot of the player. And the mechanics have their own intrinsic issues; you can brute force the game by guessing the answers and, I’ll admit, I ended up guessing a lot of the final puzzle in impulsive frustration. The fact that it’s possible to do so I think should be put down as a negative mark for the game, because I’d argue that, unless you have the will of a black hole, the minute most people get frustrated they’ll begin to just guess in order to beat the puzzle.I do think that’s a design flaw, but at the same time it’s slightly difficult to criticise a game for giving you more options you know?\n\nSo there is a story to the game. In particular before I say anything specific I'd like to talk about the atmosphere, and I think it’s pretty much as good you can get for a game like this. It’s a really interesting mix of horror and humour, and I think it works. Ambient, ominous noises chirp away at your ears, if you’re wearing headphones, but at the same time your final goal always seems to be.. bacon, which is so tongue and cheek -- I think there’s people who would argue that’s almost a little too much in the other direction. In terms of the actual story itself, and underlying narrative, I thought it was super interesting. If you want to know nothing going in, which I’d recommend, I’d say you should hit that annotation on the top right that will take you directly to the score, or hit the temporary one in the top left to take you to the overall verdict section. The fact is, the story is so minimal, that to say anything about it might be a major spoiler for some people. I’ll still try and keep it as vague as possible. I do wish there was a little more to the story than there was, but it was good enough to give an otherwise empty, soulless, game, a breath of life. It gives it some heart and context; I could imagine what the scenario was, and it managed to make the mix of the two H’s: Horror and Humour, actually make sense. There’s a reason why some things are scary, and there’s a reason why some things are ridiculous. It all makes sense within the context of the story and, I’ll harp on about it, story is a huge part of a lot of games because it’s the glue that brings all of the pieces together to work as a cohesive whole, and even if the mechanics didn’t satisfy me much, I still felt like I had a complete experience because of the story.\n\nIn the end I got a couple hours out of the game, and it was a fairly interesting experience. Personally I’d say that the $5 is not necessarily too expensive, but I do think it could be lower. There is a discount for the game on launch which I believe will bring the price down another dollar, but, ultimately, I’ve gotten way more out of some games that even cheaper. Blitz Breaker is a recent game I reviewed; I got 15 hours out of the game and it’s $3 on Steam. I also think that was a much prettier game with a lot more visual polish; what i’m saying, is that the pricing of Doors could be a lot better, or the game could have more to offer. I’d say, if you like games such as The Witness in terms of the style of gameplay, and you like minimal suggestive storytelling, and you don’t mind if there isn’t much eye candy; maybe you want an experience kinda like The Witness but in a bite-size portion -- I think in that case it’s probably a must buy. I just don’t know how many people that actually is; it’s really a unique game directed at a unique audience.\n\nSCORE:\n\nPRESENTATION: 7\nMECHANICS: 6\nSTORY: 8\nPRICE/QUALITY: 6\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT: 4\n\nFINAL: 6.2/10\n\nDoors get an above average, 6.2 out of 10. It’s a full point above average. The presentation was ok but a little boring; what pushed it up to 7 rather than 5 or 6, was the quite striking contrast between the doors and the rest of the environment, which I liked, and the thematic relevance of the presentation as a whole, including spoilerific parts of the game.\n\nI do think the mechanics are above average, they show a level of creativity beyond what tends to turn up in the Steam store, but I also have a hard time imagining someone loving the game, or even really enjoying it. And I think that comes down to the fact that there really isn’t a mechanical reason for this to be a game, if that makes sense. It’s just logic puzzles that anyone could look up online, but the thing that makes this different from an online blog, is of course the story which I rate quite highly. It’s handled pretty well, and gets the point across, I just wish there was a little bit more of it, and a bit more fleshed out. admittedly I didn’t look into the details of the story, but I’m just talking about a few more story beats for the casual player. The story also didn’t blow me away, it’s not the next Portal 2 in terms of originality.\n\nThe price is good. It’s pretty fitting. $5 for two or three hours is, like, really really acceptable. I’d maybe even lean towards cheap, which is why it gets a 6. But it could have been more for the price, or cheaper still.\n\nIf we’re talking personally though? I just found myself frustrated at the puzzles a lot. I didn’t really feel good solving them either. My brain isn’t really built for logic puzzles. I would have rated it lower for enjoyment if the story hadn’t intrigued me as much as it did, though. It’s one of those things where I can recognise a pretty good game, but I didn’t really like it myself.\n","February 12","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I understand that it is intriguing to put another layer of narrative on a rather mechanical core game, but it just really comes across as a mediocre rip-off. while the story bits here and there caught my interest, there really didn't seem to be any good reason to go for the whacky humour of stanley parable. the visuals and level design here were so close to the original, that i kept expecting some big fourth-wall-breaking revelation, that at the same time seemed totally unrealistic to connect with the elegant and rather straight-forward puzzle mechanics. well (spoiler? idk...) there is none and so this part leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nlast thing: cut out that bacon. really. "is this memes?" i mean seriously? yes, the internet loves bacon. haha, funny. i was wondering if you were going for the "cake" thing in portal - but portal made cake a "meme" and didn't use the next best funny little stupid internet thingy to center the narrative of an otherwise mindful game around.\n\nso that's my mixed bag. great puzzles and enviroments on the one hand. totally unnecessary stanley parable rip-off and immersion breaking bacon hype on the other. still recommend it in the end. i guess not everybody out there is a homourless vegetarian who is forced to go through the "bacon is good" door ;-)\n","February 14","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a semblance of a vague storyline.  The puzzles get challenging towards the end.  Some of the fonts, and the office layot entirely, reminded me of The Stanley Parable, which was great, because I throughly enjoyed that game.  There were a few little funny bits here and there, especially in the office complex.  It's only 4 dollars.  Overall, a decent game.\nHere's what I didn't like:\nThere is an obvious lack of any sort of finished story.  I would rather like a sequel to come along and sort out everything.  It just...stops.  End of story.  Some parts of the office were very intrigung, and an explanation would have been wonderful.  There were only a few puzzles.  It's a short game.  An extremely short game.  I was almost disappointed by its shortness.\nBut I'm recommending this game anyways, with the caution that it is short and sweet.\n6/10 Fun while it lasted.","February 14","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Finished the game, found it very philisophical and interesting. I decided not to return the game because I would love to support the developer. The ending seemed to hint at a larger upcoming things which I plan on buying. Only improvement I could see in the game is a little more punishment for losing a level. You can guess doors at random if you don't feel like trying with no punishment. I suggest mixing up the texts, having a few presets for doors, I don't really know.

If you are going to implement puzzles in a game then make sure that you have a decent number of them, not 20 and then goodbye.\n\nThe biggest letdown is that there is also no real different ending, and the ending that is available is very likely ment as a joke, kind of a slap in the face to laugh with you one last time. For 5€ this is so basic. There is also no sensical progression of difficulty, as there are spikes in between the short amount of levels that are very complicated due to unclarity (luckily, only 3-4 are this way).\n\nAll-together, I seriously doubt the amount of work that was actually required to design Doors, considering that there are tons of in-your-face invisible walls with no intelligent way to design anything different to hide them. The only level that is NOT in a seemingly virtual world is also super-rigid and the monitors that are included in them look like a box with an image straight out of photoshop.\n\nIf there is anything I can applaud, is that there was (minimal) effort to implement some kind of 'story', and that for the first few minutes the bacon thingy is funny (although repetitive very soon).\n\nNot recommended until it goes on sale.","February 17","false","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Doors is an OK game with a linear, mysterious story which is never blatantly established. Doors has linear gameplay with no mechanics but to walk, look around, and choose. The concept for Doors is very similar to that of The Stanly Parable with making choices. The choices that you make limit you to getting only about two endings depending on if you picked wrong or not. #1. If you choose wrong you die. #2. If you choose right you get bacon. Now the only reason I'm saying this game is only OK is because of the fact you have to pay for this game. I beat the game in only about 15 minutes with no reason given as to what I was doing and it was not memorable. Doors just simply isn't a good game. Overall, Doors should be a free game with more mechanics and more gameplay, and explain the story. Hell, gameplay wise I'd be just fine if they added a jump mechanic for no reason. Maybe I'm being too harsh for a game that was released maybe a couple months ago. But, if Doors gets an update and cleans up it's confusing ♥♥♥♥ off my small loan of a million memes then Doors would be a game worth getting a reccomendation.\n\nSpoiler ahead.

To me, it would make more sense if the darkness theme was somehow integrated into the puzzle-solving mechanic, or didn't exist at all. As it stands, I think that the world is an obstacle between the player and gratification, not something that positively contributes to the experience. The middle part in the office felt entirely unnecessary and out of place because it added nothing useful to the game. The penalty for going through the wrong door is far too small and could be easily improved by randomizing the puzzle on death.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BoxOfFaces/recommended/395350/","BoxOfFaces","BoxOfFaces","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BoxOfFaces/","81 products in account","What would be a simple and promising puzzle game tries too hard to make itself interesting outside of the puzzles that it weighs down the entire experience.\n\nI bought this game because it reminded me of a riddle I really enjoy, but was ultimately disappointed in the product. The puzzles themselves are not always bad, but the game as a whole is poorly constructed and feels like it tries too hard in too many areas that don't add anything to the experience people are here to enjoy - puzzle solving.\n\nThe puzzles are simple. You're presented with a group of doors, each door has a sign above it with some text above it, and you have to use the text to figure out with door to go through. In addition, before each set of doors there is some text on the ground that gives further information you need to solve the puzzle (usually telling you how many of the doors are lying to you). This is a fine idea and can lead to some satisfying puzzles, but the way it's presented has some things to complain about.\nFirstly the wording. The door you want to go through is described as "leading to bacon" (a poor, meme-like attempt at humor I wish I could say only appears in this once) and the doors you don't want to go through "lead to death". The doors where the text above them is telling the truth is described as "correct" while the doors that lie to you are "incorrect". This wording is confusing, and they never explain exactly how all the wording works. They tell you bacon is good and death is bad, but they don't explain that correct and incorrect refers to the text above the door being true or false, rather than the correct or incorrect doors to walk through. Knowing exactly how this wording works is absolutely essential to solving almost every puzzle, which makes it the puzzles seem frustrating, unfair and somewhat random until you figure out their unintuitive wording scheme on your word. All to include a joke about bacon. Clearly the designers had their priorities straight on this one.\nThis all could have been solved if they did away with the bacon/death thing and used correct and incorrect to indicate which door you wanted to go through, then true and false to describe which doors are lying to you. This makes sense, and probably doesn't even need explaining to most people. Just establish that to progress you go through the correct door, and the rest explains itself. If a blue door says "The blue door is incorrect" you know that's not the door you want to go through. But then if another door says "The blue door is false" you know the blue door is lying to you. And so the puzzles begin, with no need for explanations and minimal confusion. It would also help with the text on the ground before each set of doors. They might say something like "One door leads to bacon, all other doors lead to death." But with bacon being substituted for correct, it could simple read "One door is correct." There's no need to explain that the rest are incorrect because correct and incorrect are opposites, and people can intuitively figure out for themselves that "all other doors are incorrect."\nNow, with that simple poor use of words aside, the puzzles aren't bad. My only other gripe is that the game's idea of difficulty is the number of doors a puzzle uses, so as you go, the puzzles begin having more and more doors. This isn't entirely a bad thing, but there are two things about this I do't like.\nFirstly, since this game is played from a first person perspective, keeping track of what all the doors say means walking around constantly and looking at each one individually. This works just fine at first, but as the game progresses and the number of doors goes up, it's honestly more challenging just to keep track of everything than it is to actually solve the puzzle.\nSecondly, Some of the most interesting and thought provoking puzzles are the simplest ones with the fewest. They certainly seem easier, since you don't have to keep track of what 10-20 doors say at a time, but they're interesting and more rewarding. it would have been nice to see them break up the string of huge multi-door puzzles with a really interesting smaller puzzle every so often.\n(It is worth mentioning I didn't finish this game, so it's possible they actually do some of this later in the game. If they do, good on them, but I honestly doubt it.)\n\nNow, if that's all I had to complain about, I'd probably have enjoyed this game a bit more. But no. There's visuals and atmosphere to consider as well, and here's where this game really falls short.\nMost of the time, the game takes place in a black and white environment with a minimalist art style. These places actually look quite nice. It's atmospheric without being distracting, which is perfect for a puzzle game like this. It also helps the colored doors to stand out, which helps you find the next puzzle once you're teleported to the next area. Of course, this wouldn't even matter if they didn't make you walk so far after each puzzle for seemingly no reason, but whatever.\nHowever much I like this art style, it really clashes with other parts of the game, most notably the "bacon" gag. For a game that isn't above using a cheap meme of a joke in the core of the puzzle solving, the serious-toned and mysterious vibe the environments gives off seems like an odd choice to compliment that (and really, if one of the two has to go, it should definitely be the bacon).\nWorse than this is the portions of the game that attempt to... You know, I'm not even sure what the intent was. Was it trying to have a story? Make things more mysterious? Add to the atmosphere? Whatever they tried to do, it failed.\nThere are parts of the game where weird trippy stuff happens for no discernible reason. My first encounter with this was when some random text appeared in the sky but disappeared before I could read it, and shortly after the whole screen "glitched out" as if I was inside a computer, and suddenly I'm walking down a long white hallway. Then I somehow end up in an office building? The hallways of the office building have no sense of direction and are littered with posters that try to be funny with little success. It feels like I'm playing The Stanley Parable, except there's no narrator and it's written by a Facebook account that does nothing but repost relatable jokes. Some of the posters are kind of amusing, but most of them just seem to think random equals funny. (HaPpY PlAtYpUs DaY!!! . . . No, one of the signs actually said. I wish I was making it up.) But even the jokes that stand up on their own (A.K.A. don't make you cringe) are not clever or witty, or even relevant. After wandering the hallway of bad jokes and unnecessary turns, I stumbled across a room with some sort of sci-fi test tube looking container. It was open, so I walked in. It closed, lowered me into darkness, and the I appeared at the next puzzle.\nCan... Can somebody explain to me what the point of any of that was? What does that add to the game? What does it add to the experience? Why is it in the game? It is really hard to resist the urge to use caps lock right now in order to better convey my sheer bewilderment and confusion at the inclusion of the sequences in the game. If the rest of what I talked about doesn't ruin the game for me, this absolutely does. It takes me right out of the experience and leaves me more confused and annoyed than at all interested in the game.\n\nIn the end, this was a simple idea that tried too hard in too many unnecessary places and ruined what could be a fun puzzle experience. If you can get past this, you might have a good time, but I personally find it unenjoyable overall.","March 28","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is too short and in more ways than one. There are around 20 doors or puzzles, and each puzzle is maybe only a minute or so long. So it felt like I was burning through the game really fast.\n\nI would suggest that the developers work on more interactivity on each level. Instead of a path approaching doors, add a bit more to distract the player... possibly even more puzzles to solve in order to reach the doors. That would add a lot more to beef the game up and give it some more substance.\n\nIt certainly has the feel of Limbo and The Stanley Parable, but that's just it... It's as if they took those two design elements and mixed them rather non-homogeniously (they don't mesh.)\n\nThe experience is worth it for a low price, and other than that... if you like logic puzzles... you're good to go. I wouldn't consider these puzzles to be very difficult, not that I got them all on the first shot either though.\n\nThe puzzles kind of remind me of the brain teasers we used to get in grade school.

I'm not a heavy puzzle game player and I did spend significant time exploring the "intermission" between the puzzle sections. If you rush through, you could certainly complete it much quicker. If you watch (Many a True Nerd) Jon's playthrough on Youtube, you're seeing nearly the entire game.\n\nI really wish there was a neutral option for recommending the game. The puzzles are good but they end very quickly. The middle section hints at a story but it isn't ever developed.\n\nIn the end, if 4 or 5 dollars for a half hour to an hour of decent entertainment sounds like a good deal to you, pick this up. You could certainly spend more on an hour. Otherwise give it a pass. Oddly enough, this is a puzzle game that probably isn't well suited for people who love puzzle games. There simply won't be enough to the game to keep a regular puzzle player busy for more than a few minutes.\n\n","February 16","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You do play much of it on paper, but that's no bad thing.  Right now I'm playing a level at a time.  Some of the puzzles are making my brain bleed, but they are DAMN well constructed.  My only critical point is that on choosing the wrong door, you should not simply be taken back to the start of the level.  Maybe if there was some reward for getting the puzzle correct first time.\n\nI can see that the game maker has relied on so many influences, from portal to parable.  I think he has done himself a disservice here, as the game could stand on it's own two feet for it's well crafted puzzles.  Having said that, it's the trailer really drew me to this game.  In hindsight I may not have picked it up without those references.\n\nIf you like a challenge then give this a go.  I'm surprised that the reviews have been so mixed.  I'm just as happy in this world solving puzzles as I am in “The Witness”.","February 18","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Early in the game, puzzles explicitly say whether exactly one door leads to bacon or multiple doors could lead to bacon.  Later in the game they stop saying this, but there's apparently an assumption required that only one door leads to bacon.  Would've been better if this was made clear.\n- There's a typo in one of the levels.  Pretty sloppy.\n\nDespite all the cons I'd still generally recommend it.  I mostly enjoyed it for the brief time it lasted.  I've wasted $4 on worse things before so I'm not going to lose sleep over it, but it feels like it should be a free demo version of a much longer and more varied game.\n","February 18","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
