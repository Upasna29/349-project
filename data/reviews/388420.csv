"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/388420/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","In Between is a story-driven puzzle platformer with gravity rotation mechanics that has the makings of a new classic. It looks similar to gravity puzzler The Bridge at first glance. But with the instant gravity flips of And Yet It Moves, several unique game mechanics and a mature and tightly interwoven story, the game is a fresh experience that is well worth playing.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is a young man whose life is suddenly shattered when he is diagnosed with lung cancer. We follow him as he learns to accept his fate, in a game where story is told in smooth transitions between playable cutscenes and puzzle chapters. The five main chapters of the game are inspired by the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.\n\nEach chapter introduces a new game element, themed after the stage it represents. The symbolism isn't necessarily clear-cut, like in the denial chapter, where darkness chases you from one or two sides of the screen, and can only be held off by facing it. This obstacle makes sense though, and is explained in the story segment leading up to it. Anger is more easily grasped, since it's represented by red pulsating, and sometimes moving, orbs that kill on touch. Bargaining has levels where you simultaneously control a mirrored shadow protagonist, and in depression you have to move through scarce sources of light to avoid the deadly darkness. The final chapter is more of a narrative device, and is one I choose not to describe to avoid spoiling the experience.\n\nIn addition to the five main chapters, there's also a tutorial, which is designed to make you comfortable with the gravity flip mechanics. Like the first four of the five main chapters, the tutorial contains 12 levels, of which nine are required to unlock the next chapter. The first nine levels in each chapter are for the most part easy enough to figure out for someone with a bit of experience with the genre, but getting the timing right can be tricky in some of the levels. None of the levels have checkpoints, so if you mess up and die, you will have to start over from the beginning of the level.\n\nGetting through the game took me just over three hours, but solving the additional 15 harder levels doubled that, so the game should offer about six hours worth of gameplay in total. If you go after the hidden glimmers of hope or a no-death run, you can probably add several more hours on top of that. The game never gets as punishing as The Bridge or Closure, but if you've made it through Braid and LIMBO, you should be able to solve most of the levels of In Between without too much trouble.\n\nThis is a game well worth playing for the story alone. The subjects of grief and regret are topics I haven't seen explored in games often enough, and seldom as intimately as in this game. We get to witness the protagonist's struggles with accepting his imminent death, memories of his childhood and his troublesome relationship to his father, and having to leave a young daughter behind. Most of the story is told through playable cutscenes and in spoken thought leading in to levels, but some levels also have memory shards hidden as cracks in the wall that trigger when you walk past them.\n\nThe game is fully playable with my wired Xbox 360 controller, though I prefer to play it using the keyboard. It's controlled using both sticks on a gamepad or WASD and arrow keys with keyboard controls. There are no options for rebinding keys, but I found these defaults intuitive and easy to play with. I haven't experienced any technical issues with the Linux version, but the demo on Steam is available for Linux, so you can try it to see if it works well on your system.\n\nNOTE: This review was originally posted on GamingOnLinux[www.gamingonlinux.com].","August 28, 2015","true","14.2"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","41","44","0","0"

But I only played it for about three minutes. The quality of art, the story and the game play are so readily apparent that the choice was simple. Admittedly, I've played less than an hour, so this review will likey not be my final version.\n\nA contemporary, urban male is facing a rapidly approaching death, and must prepare emotionally and mentally. This is done through a series of puzzles involving (superficially) gravity. (I say superficially, because even at early levels "In Between" offers much more, as well as great potential.) A friend looking at the Store Page was immediately repulsed by characteristics seemingly shared by platformers. I have to disagree. It doesn't call itself a platformer, and had it been a platformer I would have quite possibly expressed the same distain. No, "In Between" is a story driven puzzle game. A good one. And the puzzles can be quite difficult (in a good way.)\n\nThere is a world of gravity-based games available. "In Between" shares characteristics with "The Bridge", but has far more story. Actually, the gravity puzzle aspect is quite similar to "Gravity Error", so liking either is a strong indication of a players feeling about the other. But the gravity aspect is just a stepping stone to qualities that the excellent learning curve has just begun to reveal to this player, so I have nothing more to say at this time.\n\nExcept - PLAY the demo!","August 21, 2015","true","0.8"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","42","50","3","5"

Much detail was put into this game, but there were a few design choices that seemed lacking.\n\nWhen I look at a level menu I expect 3 things usually associated with icons and/or a text blurb:\n1) The Name of the Level.\n2) Has the player reached the endpoint?\n3) Has the player found the all the secrets?\n\nHowever what I got was:\n1) A layout of the map to memorize\n2) A filled inner circle once the player reached level endpoint\n3) A half circle to indicate if a memory was present in the level\n\nWhile it was does contain the basic information, it is impossible to tell someone about a level by describing a map.  The levels aren't numbered, just nodes of circles along the bottom of each section to choose from.  The issue is I can't describe the unique map within a reasonable time frame, and describing a node means nothing to another player since they all look the same.\n\nThe next issue is lack of objective information.  If I had never looked at the achievements, I never would've known about the "Hidden Glimmers of Hope" with one hidden inside a level within each section.  Also there's no indication of which level contains a glimmer nor the specified rules you must abide by in order to obtain it.  If it's hidden, leave hints.\n\nLastly, if you are making an achievement for doing all the levels "perfectly", you need to display to the player which levels are done "perfectly".  Re-doing levels because the player isn't shown they obtained something does not result in replayability (fun) as much as frustration.  The feeling of progress is done if everything appears done.\n\nWith that out of the way, I only have two suggestions for the developers.\n\n1.  QuickSave - not checkpoints, just being able to save at any certain safe point allows faster iterations which means less frustration.  Not every game can benefit from saving whenever, but this certainly would've.\n\n2.  Difficulty Tweaking - You know what I'm talking about, those extra spikes, the movement speed of darkness and orbs, orb speed scaling bigger/smaller, certain placement/existance of spike balls.  Making a game easier doesn't make the story less appealing.  It is true players have different meanings of "fun" and "satisfaction", but if they aren't being satisfied on lower difficulties, they'll raise the difficulty, you could even have an achievement as an incentive for them to challenge themselves.  As for the obvious "It's too hard" players, you could have a secret death counter, and if they die over and over again in quick succession, prompt them about lowering the difficulty.  Rayman Legends used this similar system, but the impact it had was minor due to the levels still remaining the same instead of making the level with less deathtraps.....\n\nIn fact, let the end users set when they want to be notified if it's too hard.  They choose how much death should lead to their acceptance of lowering the difficulty.\n\nOverall, it is a well made game and other developers could learn a thing or two from it, both in regards of what to do and possibly what not to do (though I found what this team did, did it right.).","October 10, 2015","true","17.2"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","43","52","0","0"

It's an interesting game, really interesting, full of moments that get your mind working, pulling themes in to the gameplay. It's an aspect of the game that brings to mind Braid, too few games find or even try to find a way to let their narrative affect their gameplay.\n\nIt’s maybe underselling things a little bit, but In Between is a puzzle platformer, you have to get from the start point to the level's exit. To do that you have to flip gravity, walking on the ceiling, flinging yourself from one wall to another. The difficulty comes in what's put in your way, be that spikes, blocks, or environmental effects, which is where the narrative comes in.\n\nIn Between deals with terminal cancer, or at least deals with dealing with terminal cancer. You're essentially playing through someone coming to terms with their fate, their mortality. Each set of levels is themed around one of the 5 stages of grief. Without wanting to spoil too much, 'denial' sees you avoiding a closing darkness, kind of like a Mario level that's constantly pushing you forward. The developers have found reasons for introducing mechanics to the levels, you're soon encouraged to face down the darkness, push it back, and depending on your perspective, either face or push back the truth.\n\nWhich brings me to 'anger'. In anger you have to make your way across the winding levels, altering gravity, while avoiding giant red balls of anger. It's at this point I noticed the game starting to become a bit more ruthless with its difficulty. You'd solve the puzzle of the level, work out how to traverse its obstacles, only to die on a spike placed a pixel away from your safe landing zone. It's not that the other levels aren't difficult, but 'anger' feels needless, almost cruel. I've started to wonder if it's deliberate, if it's recreating the feelings you would experience when going through that stage, why's it happening to you, it's unfair, it's cruel.\n\nOr I'm over thinking things.\n\nEither way it's a dangerous game for In Between to play. There's a lot of points where In Between just isn't that fun, where the more frustrating parts of the game drag it down. You don't always get enough time to properly see the task in front of you, meaning it takes repeated attempts to even start to figure out what's being asked of you, often having to redo difficult sections just to get the opportunity. It's why falling to a simple spike is such a killer, and why, despite knowing what the game would lose I did start to pine for a checkpoint or two.\n\nThere's nice touches, or 'nice' touches, where when you die the background of the level cracks, showing what's behind, as though it's you scarring, your defences cracking, or the truth breaking through. The story can be very affecting, small instances, ideas it brings forward, not just a man facing death. It can also be a little maudlin, and the script heavy handed. While the narration performance isn't bad by any means, the choice of making it gravely does make it sound a little teenage comic book at points.\n\nWhat In Between deserves credit for is the wealth of ideas it brings to the table. No two levels are the same, mechanics are tossed away before they're overused, and the 5 concepts evolve over their levels. It's got striking looks, a good soundtrack, and well handled cut scenes. And if you do get too stuck, it gives you enough leeway to skip a few levels and still make progress\n\nUltimately, despite some misgivings I'd still recommend In Between. It's certainly got enough challenge for puzzle fans, but at the same time its themes and how it ties them to its gameplay makes it incredibly interesting for those looking for something different. It's a rare thing. There's a few too many moments where I wasn't having fun, but In Between will stay with me for a while, it will be brought up in conversation, it's definitely worth your time\n\nBitparade: http://bitparade.co.uk/article.php?id=3831","September 11, 2015","true","8.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

Neither am I a fan of puzzle games. This game though. In Between somehow managed to catch my attention and even slip into my wishlist. Glad that I gave this game a chance, I was definitely missing out on some interesting experience. Keep it mind that I'm nowhere near the end of this game but here are my thoughts about it so far.\n\n======OVERVIEW======\n\nFirst thing that actually made me notice this game is the beautiful art-style. The fact that it's hand painted is impressive as well, not gonna lie. It's been some time I've been this mind-blown by visual side of a game. It works perfectly with the whole theme and atmosphere. Accompanied by awesome soundtrack, it's a pleasure to play this game. A very interesting experience.\nEven though this game can be boring every now and then when you're stuck at some puzzle, it's definitely worth to keep playing. If you feel burnt out, just give it some time to think about the puzzles and then come back to it. About the story, I must say that I love those "mind images" popping in levels. Other than that only segments between "chapters" and voice-overs during level can bring you some insights into story. Nevertheless, I'm not really far enough to say anything about the story but so far, I love the progress it makes. Plus those all are good features that can slow down "the burn out" process. Other than that, I don't really have that much to say about the game. Try the demo if you're not really convinced to buy this game and see for yourself.\n\nPROS- BEAUTIFUL hand made art-style\n- controls/gameplay\n- trading cards + achievements\n- soundtrack\n- variety of challenging obstacles/levels\n- atmosphere\n- free demo for you to try\n\nCONS- "the burn out" level is high (I guess that's the thing about almost every platformer though)\n- price tag\n\n======RATING======\nEven if you're not really into puzzles and platformers, this game can bring you some interesting experience. If you love platformers though and you don't own this game yet, I wonder why since I think this game is one of the best indie platformers made. It seems to be a long game as well, so that might be another reason for you to buy it.\n\nFor recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","February 20","true","1.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Yes I am really bad at puzzlegames.\n\nSo, what is "In Between"? Another "usual" indie puzzle platformer? No, I wouldn't agree there. It sure is some sort of a puzzle game and tho you have to be precise often, I wouldn't call it a platformer per se. So what is it then? Difficult to say really. I guess, I would call it a mix of "And yet it moves", "The Bridge", a liiiiiiiiittle tad "Braid" and "A walk in the dark" (at least the levels you play with the girl). That said, In Between sure is no cheap copy of those mentioned games. In fact I think it's an utterly beautiful game so far. Literally it is. I really dig the artstyle. Much love to details, very charming - kind of interactive - cutscenes & beautiful backgrounds. Tho the levels so far look pretty much the same on the first look, you'll notice, that there are lots of details. (e.g. the background shatters a little around the area you failed at. Pretty neat little detail.). To keep a long story short: The game looks very charming & beautiful.\n\nBut as we know, a good looker often fails to deliver gameplay/story. In Between does not fail there. Pretty much the opposite is the case. (To be honest I didn't really expect a story at all). The gameplay so far is very solid, fun and later ingame also pretty challenging. Also it doesn't get boring as the game seems to introduce a new gameplay mechanic with every new chapter (at least so far!). And even tho I failed a lot already, it never got frustrating. With every single fail I did learn something new. And to be fair, it always was my fault. The game never came up with any unfair bs so far. Yes, sometimes I raged a bit, especially when I - once again - failed just an inch before the level exit. But I never had an alt+f4 moment yet. Still I would have appreciated an optional cp system in the game even tho you CAN actually skip the last 2-3 levels of a set if you get stuck. So no one really should have to struggle to experience the quite nice story.\n\nI really don't want to spoil the story here but so far I am actually surprised how well it was put into the game (excellent for an indie game imo). It's nothing new tbh but it's well put together. You will get piece by piece throughout the playthrough. Sometimes in beautifully drawn cutscenes, sometimes in the levels via e.g. memories you can reveal.\n\nThe narrators (both english & german) sound really good & you always hope for more to come. It really keeps you going for the story, not only the gameplay. I was pretty much stunned at first because I sure didn't expect there to be a narrator at all. Also the background music & sound effects is/are pretty good. Mostly soothing & calming, never pushing or annoying.\n\nLast but not least, I think "In Between" is a really beautiful piece of art, without forgetting to deliver fun, varying, challenging gameplay and a well put together story throughout about 60?! levels. Game runs smooth and as it is for me, I didn't encounter any bugs so far. If you're on the edge, feel free to try the demo and see if the game is for you. o/\n\n\n\nPhew, okay, that sure was a wall of text so I guess, I'll just add the usual pro/cons now:\n\n\n+ beautiful artstyle/gfx and lots of love for details.\n\n+ interesting, fun & later on challenging gameplay\n\n+ well thought out level design\n\n+ really good sounding narrator(s)\n\n+ nice background music & overall good sound design\n\n+ a nice told story which fits in very well & keeps you going\n\n+ smooth controls (XBox 360 controller at least)\n\n+ about 60 levels (can't say anything about hidden game modes or whatever)\n\n+ pretty much bug free (tho the devs stated, they found a few little ones)\n\n+ smooth performance at any point\n\n\nCouldn't find any negative things so far. As I mentioned above, maybe an optional cp system would have been nice at least for the later appearing challenging & lengthy levels, but sure isn't necessary to go on with the game/story. Most likely to edit the review, once I've finished the game. o/","August 24, 2015","true","9.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","0"

On one hand, we have puzzles with gravity control, changing gameplay within special levels, avoiding obstacles, planning your way strategically before running towards the end and many more (I don’t want to spoil you too much :D). On the other hand, we have the story of the main character, struggling with his own thoughts on his way to the end of his life. (The narrator does, in my opinion, an amazing job, extra credit for him please! :)  ) Both of those aspects combined are what makes In Between a one of a kind game, or even an art project on it’s own.

Each stage consists of 10 levels, and in some of them you find MindImages that represent the thoughts and memories of the main character.\nThe subject matter is handled very respectfully and in an honest way, so much so that I wouldn't be suprised if it was based on the live of someone that the team knew. The writing is mature and serious, without being overly dramatic and cheesy.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game is entirely handcrafted, and it looks beautiful. The only real problem is that the look of the levels is very similar, however the MindImages bring some needed colour to the game. And it also serves as a way to tell the story, which is something really commendable.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe main gameplay mechanic is that, using the arrow keys, you can change the levels gravity so that you can move on all four walls. This affects some objects like crates, and makes for some interesting situations. However, in each stage of grief there is a different theme that affects the gameplay: for example, in Denial there is a wall of shadow that is trying to get you, but you can stop it only if you look at it. This is just an example of variety that makes every stage feel fresh, in a similar way to the different chapters of Braid.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is very challenging, but never frustrating. Every time you unlock a stage, you gain access to all the levels except the final, which unlocks after that you have beaten 7 levels prior, so that in case you are having an hard time beating a level, you don't have to look for walkthroughs or stop playing because you are frustrated. This makes the experience more enjoyable and accessible.\n\nSOUNDThe quiet soundtrack to the game is very good, but not all that memorable. However, the voice actor for the main character does a brilliant job, making the character relateable. The subtle changes in tone as the game progresses also show the range that he has.\n\nREPLAYABILITYYou will probably come back to try and beat all the levels and get all the MindImages and Steam achievements. Otherwise, you won't probably come back to this game.\n\nOverall, this is the best indie puzzle platformer since Braid. Yes, it's that good. The story is emotional, the gameplay is varied, the levels are challenging and the voice acting is perfect.

I had never heard of it before, and judging from the presently fewer than 70 Steam reviews, you probably haven't heard of it either. But I think we need to change that.\n\nI was drawn to the hand-crafted visuals right off the bat. “In Between” has a very strong sense of individual style and presentation that feels very personal; diametrically opposed to the almost antiseptic feeling you can sometimes get from an ultra-polished AAA title. This game is a bit like flipping through someone's sketchbook come to life.\n\nThat “personal” feel for the art is especially fitting, as it dovetails nicely with the story: a journey of grief imparted in the first-person by a man dying of cancer. Both the writing and voiceover narration are top-shelf. Weighty topics are half-whispered to you by a solemn voice that is like a warmer version of Tom Waits.\n\nOf course, the real meat of the game is the puzzles, and ultimately that is what will make or break the experience for you. Regardless of your thoughts on the audiovisual aspects, if you're someone who hates puzzle-platformers you may not enjoy it to the extent that I have. On that note, I'm going to mention the game “Braid.” Not to suggest “In Between” is a Braid-clone, but because just about everybody played Braid and has an opinion on it, so it's a convenient mental shortcut for me to use here: Did you enjoy Braid for its hand-drawn aesthetic, emotionally groundbreaking non-traditional game story, and sometimes maddening puzzles? If so, I feel pretty solid about this recommendation. Or, did you hate Braid, label its story “pretentious,” and despise its sometimes maddening puzzles? Well, then maybe you should keep walking, and go be wrong somewhere else.\n\nA particularly nice touch here is the way each set of levels introduces a gameplay mechanic that alludes to one of the stages of grief. It works, and feels clever and appropriate, rather than gimmicky. Well done.\n\nI haven't mentioned the music yet, but it fits in nicely with everything else and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nFinal thoughts: I urge you to try... and I mean really try, to finish the story without looking up solutions to any of the puzzles. There are a few optional achievements that you'll want to use a guide to knock out afterward, and that's fine, but try to stay guide-free until the credits roll. Yes, you will get stuck sometimes. And, if you use your brain and continue to experiment, you will get through just as I did.\n\nPlaytime for the main story was a relaxed 3.5 hours for me, spread across a few lunch breaks and taking periodic breaks to ingest food. If you're a mad puzzle genius, I'm sure you can do it faster. Your mileage may vary. Enjoy.","January 16","true","6.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"

As I've said I haven't played any real recent 2D puzzle platformers so I may be out of touch but I honestly haven't seen gameplay quite like this, it breaks through conventional 2D platforming and requires you to view the game from many angles and perspectives.\n\nControls - After the first puzzle you realize how super smooth and simplistic the controls are, I've used both Keyboard and Xbox360 controller.\n\nArt - Great 2D art, really unique complements the game and the story (some nice shaders at work also)!\n\nStory & Narration - I Haven't finished the story but it really connects you with the gameplay, not just telling the story but also guiding you. The narration is top notch, the voice actor has done an amazing job (I enjoy listening to the soft tone of his voice).\n\nSounds - Informative, subtle and non-intrusive!\n\nSoundtrack - I'm a little biased here as I've met and seen Tom Stoffel work! I pretty much came to the game because of the music, but I fell in love with a lot more than just Tom's mastery! *I should note Tom was not the only contributor to the Soundtrack, and there's some real gem's in the official soundtrack from all the contributors* I highly recommend buying the Deluxe edition of the game!!!\n\nI'm going to finish this game, but right at this point I can't see anyone being disapointed. If in doubt go play the demo!\n\nThis game can hold its head up high.","August 22, 2015","true","9.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It invokes presence of mind, tip-top mental health, and puts into place philosophical queries that should become a mirror in our own, real lives.\n\nThe game also has the tendency to infuriate the player with its difficult puzzles. I took some time getting used with the controls, but once my reflexes kicked in, it became less of a problem. The problem became the bigger picture: how would I leave this level? It basically turns the laws of matter around, all the while the protagonist puts together what seem to be puzzle pieces of his life, bit by bit, as if re-experiencing them again.\n\nThe creators did a really great job.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/388420/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Gentlymad’s In Between may be one of the most engrossing and dark puzzle platformers ever developed. I honestly didn’t believe that a puzzle platformer was supposed to delve deep into the topics of the reason of life and mortality. I thought these games were meant to be played to be fun, for enjoyment, for amusement. Then again that just means that I didn’t learn this lesson after playing Sym. Of course, Sym’s message was different –  that game provided an insight into the experience of social anxiety disorder – but both games successfully hit a tone that makes you think about the topic at hand as well, if not better, than other mediums are able to. I am certain that both lessons will stick with me for a long time after having played both.\n\nAs this is a game that absolutely should be experienced first hand I refuse to give any of the plot and narrative away. To do so would spoil the game in the worst possible way.  What I will focus on is the actual game play and the art work. Both of which are top notch. I found some of the levels to be quite perplexing and requiring significant thought. Nothing is unfair but don’t expect anything to be handed to you on a platter because you’ll be in for a rude surprise. Although gravity has been used in puzzle games before I thoroughly enjoyed the way that the mechanic was implemented. It can be frustrating at times trying to work out the solution to the puzzle but that only serves as a positive.\n\nI’m a fan of handmade art in games. They do not suit every game but those that they do it looks really good – if the artist is skilled, of course. The art in In Between helps establish the tone and helps tell the narrative in ways that most games try to and fall short. That’s not to suggest that it’s perfect because there are a couple of levels where I felt the environment got in the way of the puzzle being solved but by and large it is well designed. It’s very moody and deep. The color usage was well thought out. As the description below states this extends through to the soundtrack, the in game sound but I’d also argue that it extends further into the voice work – the words that are said and the tones that are inflected. The artistic design of the game has been very well done.\n\nThere is a demo available to be downloaded and played. Even though I wholeheartedly recommend that you play the game whenever there is a demo available I recommend you try it before you buy it. Once you have I’m certain that you will. It’s a great game with a thoughtful and well written story extending down throughout the artwork. A very concentrated work.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","February 2","true","21.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The puzzles are expertly crafted, offering a great balance of level fairness and precise timing. The story’s presentation is impressive, and offers a deep experience with a minimalist presentation of hand drawn artwork. My biggest problem is that the game is simply too jaded to be declared enjoyable, offering a desolate and hopeless look at our lives. While I admire the developers for tackling a difficult subject, the story misses opportunities to instil hope into those who might download it, looking for some relief.\n\nThe game’s main protagonist has been diagnosed with cancer, and the journey lies between his memories and his coping with an incurable disease. The game’s hand drawn visuals shatter like mirrors as you progress, or whenever you fall helpless to the game’s challenge. Your character spends the game collecting his thoughts as he travels through the five stages of grief; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance.\n\nThe game’s storyline starts with the sad knowledge that you’re dying of lung cancer. Through the cracking walls of the levels’ background, you’re shown the complicated past with your father, the deteriorating relationship with your wife and child and the final thoughts of a dying man. These moments of reflection adds a lot to the game’s narrative, and drives the player into wanting to learn more. After you complete a level, In Between sets the stage with emotional scenes showing your character running through his memories, before progressing into the next step towards acceptance.\n\nThe really clever bits come with each of the transitions, bringing new challenges with each chapter. The first one introduces you to the game’s mechanics, but when you get into ‘Denial’, the game adds in a looming darkness that can overtake you. The only way you can fight it is by facing it, pushing it back while you frantically try to get through the stage. ‘Anger’ pits you against giant pulsating balls, blocking your way and eventually chasing after to consume you. When you get to ‘Bargaining’, you’ll reflect on how your guilt and frustrations affected those in your life. You’ll be separated from yourself, and have to navigate an opposite version of your psyche. ‘Depression’ will have you traversing by candlelight, doing anything you can to avoid entering the darkness around you. You’ll have to navigate blocks around the map, trying to stay close enough to not die. Finally, there’s ‘Acceptance’- where you come to terms with your journey.\n\nThe challenge is perfect. It’s the right kind of frustrating, when you can see what you need to do, but just can’t pull it off. You’ll jump from congratulating yourself after finally nailing that hard section, but then realize you’ve still got half a map left to go. Running back through them again, you’ll see your timing and movements get better each time. If you get stuck on one of the levels however, the game allows you to skip three in each chapter, so you don’t have to sit on a puzzle you cannot figure out.\n\nThere’s some great ideas integrated into to the game’s designs, and some of the small details are fantastic. When you die in one of the game’s puzzles, the wall behind you splinters away where you’ve previously perished. The blocks in the game share a similarity to artwork hanging in your home. The very game you’re playing is presented as an arcade machine in your childhood room. All these subtextual ideas are presented so well in the game, you’ll constantly be thinking of your character’s family and the world outside of your own mind. Every time the map gets the better of you, you’ll feel devastated; filled with dread as you think about their future.\n\nWhile the game performs well, I wish the developers had added a few things that could’ve made the game more enjoyable for me. Using the right stick is frustrating, especially in the middle of a long sequence of jumps, when you try to push down, but it registers as right, sending you flying into your demise. Why couldn’t I map the direction of my descent to the four buttons instead? I also didn’t like how my character always runs, even during scenes like a funeral. It would’ve been nice to be able to slow down and really take in the cut scenes without having to stop. This constant speed also makes some of the game’s gravityzone sections way to difficult.\n\nThe music and sound effects however are very good. The soundtrack jumps between a contemplative mix of bassy electronica and moody piano. These selections are used effectively to convey a different range of emotions as you play the overly familiar stages. The voice actor does a great job with the material, even though some of the lines can be a little hackneyed. His performance adds a tremendous amount of depth and realism to the game.\n\nWhile the journey was enjoyable, the ending left me feeling very upset. Usually with narratives based around death, say with movies like What Dreams May Come or novels like Slaughterhouse Five, there’s usually some uplifting moment in the end- a silver lining. This game offers a very bleak outlook on the fate of all of us, and comes across very jaded and- well, depressing. I know that may sound foolish, but usually when you travel through a story that focuses entirely on dying, there’s at least a positive you can take away in the end. This project simply made me feel worse after completing it. I wasn’t expecting a happy ending, but at least a park was built at the end of Ikiru.\n\nAs an experience, In Between does a great job of creating a sense of dread and heartache in its players. The game sets out to tackle death, and in many ways, it accomplishes its task. While it’s not a home run, I felt the inspiration of games like Braid and The Bridge shining through. I’d love to say that it’s the kind of game to help you through a depressive place in your life, but sadly I can’t. If, however, you’re looking for a great puzzle game, this one will provide you with a solid 5 hours of frustrating puzzle-solving fun.","August 28, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Physics is consistent and fun to play with. Darkness, light, dread and rage. A life left behind.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with In Between.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acdenh/recommended/388420/","acdenh","acdenh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acdenh/","64 products in account","The game is a platformer. The rather wonky platforming gameplay seems to me much less interesting than the story line.\n\nI only got though the first ten or so levels before giving up on this game. The puzzles are easy so far, with the main conceptual difficulty being that this game has no realistic physics engine and some solutions are just not allowed. One especially jarring case is that one cannot change the gravity direction in mid-flight, but this rule does not apply to boxes. But some kinds of boxes can only fall in two directions. And even within these seemingly arbitrary bounds there are bugs. The execution once one has found a path is complicated due to wonky hitboxes and stuttery movement.\n\nAll of these things detract from the stroy and the artwork, which is excellent I find it a pity that I will not see more of it as the gameplay is just now worth putting up with.\n\nSome of the weird physics is intentional and works nicely: it makes the world feel a bit more hostile, alien, unfair, and confusing and these things all fit well into the story line.\n\nThe inclusion of random spikes and obvious but difficult and error prone acrobatic maneuvers, coupled with the poor mechanics for precisely those things, makes this game seem not worth the effort to me.\nThose stale mechanics could have added nothing of value to the game even in the best case.\nPlease, for gods sake game designers, take the gritty details of game mechanics seriously. If you don't: everything else will go unseen.\n\nAnd I say all this as some who has played completely though quite a few superior puzzle platformers, which I do recommend: Braid, Swapper, Dust, Trine2.","December 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Not a fan of the gameplay at all. Requires precise, twitch movements of an analogue stick (if using a gamepad). Death doesn't feel fair or deserved. I don't feel like I learn anything with each death. When I pass a section I feel lucky and relieved, not that I have understood or mastered something.
