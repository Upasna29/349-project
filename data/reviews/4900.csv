So when I saw Zen of Sudoku, I picked it up.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCaRVsTZHqg\n\nWhen I first booted up, I ran into a problem.  The game booted in Fullscreen Mode and immediately asked for my name.  Without Onscreen Keyboard accessible due to fullscreen mode, I was unable to enter my name.  I needed someone to type in my name before I could move on.\n\nOnce my name was entered everything was ok. Options let me change to Windowed Mode which is borderless allowing me to access my desktop easily.  There’s no other accessibility options.  No colorblind options or input configuration are found.\n\nGameplay so far has been point and click.  To choose what number you would like to enter into the puzzle you can click numbers in a grid & click the one you’d like.  The boxes are kind of small in windowed mode so some precision is needed.  You can correct any mistakes however.  When trying to use the keyboard to choose squares or enter numbers, I had no luck.  So far it seems you need a point & click input but we’ll keep our eye out for any changes.\n\nThe game is a peaceful and relaxing.  There’s no timer even on harder difficulties and you can stop at anytime and resume later if you’re feeling fatigued for just need a break.  Audio consists of relaxing sounds but isn’t needed for gameplay.\n\nZen of Sudoku has been fun so far and will definitely satisfy any sudoku cravings.  We’ll keep checking it out to see if gameplay changes or additional issues pop up, but the first look has easy to play as long as you can point & click.","April 25, 2014","true","1.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Ben Kerry, a US marine stuck in on a greek island after being blindsided by the Greek army. This leads to a series of guerilla warefare missions engaging in enemies with a rag-tag group of American-friendly greek forces with a dreamy British leader. You eventually leave your small island to the much bigger island - Altis. Altis is very expansive and covers a wide array of terrain from the salt flats to mountainous regions. It boasts having several large cities and multiple airports. After arriving, you continue your mission with the greeks and the brits. I won't spoil the rest, but you're sure in for a ride.\n\nThe real meat of the game is the multiplayer though. Engaging in platoon sized battles between 50 real life people clearing a city against massive hordes of AI is exciting. The combat leaves you awe-struck as bullet modeling and bullet paths have been integrated flawlessly into the hands of the engine. Multiple vehicles, ranging from Main Battle Tanks to Anti-Air Vehicles, are available from the onset and spice any mission up. When you join a large group, it's utterly fantastic the amount of fun you can have. Imagine 50 other players running toward an objective while trying to dodge MG fire. That's the game's experience.\n\n\nActually, it's a ♥♥♥♥ strategy game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics that make you want to claw your eyes out. If you actually enjoy sudoku, get off the internet. Get Arma III instead, it isn't ♥♥♥♥.","March 21, 2014","true","0.2"," 9 of 30 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","9","30","0","5"
