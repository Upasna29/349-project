The whole game is as if the last twenty minutes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Call of Cthulhu had a baby, and that baby ate LSD infused shrooms. Therefore this game could be considered a confusingly boring waste of time, or a masterpiece of psychological horror that greatly shows the basis of Lovecraftian Cosmicism; how insignificant humans are in the grand scheme of the universe and that there are things far greater than us in this universe that we will never know of. The "narrator" does a spectacular job of showing just how small and weak are character is, and how everything we do won't matter at all in the end. If you are at all a fan of H.P. Lovecraft or even any psychological horror, this is a must buy. It is only 3 dollars and is quite short, but the time you spend with it will be incredibly memorable.","September 25, 2015","true","1.1"," 71 of 78 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","71","78","14","7"

Gameplay consists of basic pathfinding: as you fall in slow motion, select a route; note where you die; take the route again and avoid the death. Had it used the same mechanics and been, say, space-themed -- dodge the asteroids and aliens -- the game would not have been notable. It is the spot-on execution of a Lovecraftian horror theme that makes Euclidean into something special. As you progress from stage to stage, the question is never "How should I proceed?" (find a path through trial-and-error), but rather "What the blazes am I going to see?"\n\nAnd oh, the things you will see ...\n\nAlthough the environments and creatures are largely abstract, there are just enough references to identifiable things to make your descent into the darkness extremely unsettling. Bubbles rise around you, your heartbeat pounds in your ears, classical Greek architecture breaks apart in front of you, worms sprout from walls, and tentacles reach out for you, all as a sinister voice mocks your feeble existence. Phasing, which allows you to pass through monsters unharmed, also reveals those monsters even more clearly. And you -- inexplicably -- can see your own skeleton, x-ray-like. The sound and visual design are extremely well done and show just how much a small indie team can achieve when it has a clear vision of what it's trying to do.\n\nIn games such as this that focus on audio-visual spectacle rather than gameplay, there is always the danger that repeated deaths will break the spell and cause boredom and frustration. In my playthrough, this wasn't a problem because I found the default difficulty low enough that I never got stuck on any one section for more than a few minutes. Fortunately, the game includes three difficulty levels (plus optional permadeath), so if you do find frustration setting in, you can make things easier and get back to enjoying the spectacle of the whole thing.\n\nI do wish the scream that happens when you die were more androgynous or omitted entirely. It clearly marks the player character as male even though there's no good reason to indicate a specific gender in a game that treats the (possibly not male) player personally as the protagonist.\n\nPlaytime for me on the default difficulty was 45 minutes with 9 deaths.\n\nOverall, highly recommended to those looking for an engaging, if brief, experience that focuses less on gameplay and more on overwhelming strangeness and existential despair.","November 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","36","36","0","0"

You want to know HOW hard?  Well, first of all there's three difficulty levels:  Hard, Nightmarish and Impossible.  Secondly, it took me about five minutes to even work out how to START the frigging game (hint:  look up, rather than around you...you'll get what I mean when you play).  Thirdly, I apparently died SEVEN TIMES just on the first level, which is basically only a few minutes long.  Yup, it's HARD.  But what else is it?\n\nWell, it's atmospheric as all buggery.  Atmospheric, and immersive.  Oh, and did I mention HARD?!  Just in case I hadn't already.  Once one gets past all the hallucinatory, Eldritch-ian razzle and dazzle, though, it's essentially a trial-and-error game (a la Limbo, perhaps):  In other words, prepare to die, MANY, MANY TIMES.  There's simply no way anyone is going to get through this game first time without dying a lot, 'cause you need to know what's about to kill you two seconds from now in order to be able to prepare yourself to avoid it.  How do you "avoid" these imminent moments of death, exactly?  Well, in addition to free-floating your way down into a watery abyss and moving left, right, up and down to avoid colliding with inanimate things, you also need to press a button to "phase" into another dimension for a short time to avoid living creatures...the trick here being, that you only get to phase for a limited time, and then you need to "recharge" for a spell before you can phase again.  So...that trial-and-error I mentioned before?  That's mostly about knowing when a beastie is about to cross your path, so you can phase at just the right time and, hopefully, recharge your phase ability in time to be ready for the next one.  Getting all this so far?  Good, neither am I.\n\nIt's certainly a wild-'n'-crazy "trip" of a game, though one which I'm already suspecting I may lack the patience to get all the way through (it's one of those "die-and-go-all-the-way-back-to-the-start-of-the-level-and-listen-to-the-dialogue-all-over-again" propositions, so if you have an even greater pet hate for that kind of repetition than I do, I would probably advise you to stay away).  On the whole, though, I'm fairly impressed, and at a starting price of $3.99 (less, obviously, in a sale), it's surely worth a try if your interest has in any way been piqued by this review.  There's no doubting that it's a QUALITY product - any fool could surely see that, especially in this day-and-age of Early Access games which will never be finished, and Greenlight games which should surely never have seen the light of day - but it's definitely not a game for everyone.  Hell, I'm not even sure just if it's a game for ME!  But it has my respect.  Whether I'll ever have the steely nerves and sheer patience to actually see it through is, perhaps, another matter...we shall see...\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","September 27, 2015","true","1.5"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","39","42","4","0"

Faller titles have never quite enjoyed the success of their horizontal runner brethren but are happy to instil just as much panic in the player. Euclidean isn't so much about the frantic hammering of keys as it is the dread-filled holding of them; the action moves at a crawl, the enemies lurch rather than sprint, the anticipation of collision made all the more tense as you barely squeeze past danger during your descent into a Lovecraftian oblivion.\nThere's a few minor faults here. The title screen is unreasonably obtuse to navigate and the wireframe-esque player model stuck forever in its default pose robs the game of total immersion.

This game really does seem like it would work best with the VR headset and was designed with it at it's center. But beyond that, there is very little to gameplay (more on that in paragraph three).\n\nSo, it does look quite nice, and I like the design of the monsters and the overall artstyle. The opening scene/menu was really striking and beautiful (it sets a mood for sure), and I would like to see more of a full game with this kind of look and feel.\n\nThe gameplay consists simply of falling at a snail's pace down into an abyss. You can slowly drift around as you do so, with the goal being to avoid the monsters and obsticles in your way. This simple gameplay it does pretty well, and I found it challenging. Yet there is absolutely nothing else to that beyond that. I got to level 5 of 9 as of writing this, and that took me about 30 minutes, so that should also be taken into consideration.\n\nI feel I made a mistake in buying this seeing as I don't have a VR headset and the main selling ponit of this game is, quite frankly, VR. They really, truely, need to emphasize that this game was built as a VR experience. Sure, you can play it without, but it is a fraction of the intended experience.\n\nI won't use Steams refund here because the game is functional, runs smoothly, and it accomplishes what it set out to do. At four dollars it is also not a huge investment. But I did not find it particularly enjoyable and I do regret getting it myself. But again, with a VR headset it think it would be a much improved experience.","September 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

I unfortunately don’t have a VR piece of equipment. Your character moves down a void of colours, monsters and objects with a demon voice narrating through your descent. You must make it through the levels avoiding obstacles and enemies which kill you. Upon death you must restart the whole level.\n\nPositives:\n+ Environments are very well done\n+ Colours are nice\n+ Sounds are very good\n+ Cheap price point\n\nNegatives:\n- Character moves too slow (maybe a speed up button?)\n- Frustrating when dying a lot as you have to restart the whole stage, which again is real slow\n- Hard to judge where enemies are\n- Not much fear involved\n\nI would recommend this game to most gamers who are searching for a different exploration type game where you can look around at pretty objects and admire the scenery. The game almost feels like it’s on rails and the game primarily revolves around dodging enemies and phasing through them.\n\nI would not recommend to someone going for a full horror experience, although it has elements of horror and tries to build around it, they are not strong enough and the only reason I jumped was because of an enemy eating me. I wish the atmosphere captivated me more but unfortunately I was left short.\n\nOverall, for the price I would most definitely recommend it. For the price it’s hard to miss out on a unique experience through the descent of ‘oblivion’. Feel free to watch my preview of the first two levels for a better idea of the game.

You float downwards (the main mechanic of the game) until you either get to the bottom or some creature kills you.

A glorious headbleepetybleep ! I thoroughly enjoyed that - THIS is the kind of stuff I always pictured in my head when ever I read Lovecraft's stuff. Alien, inhuman, things beyond perception and euclidean space.\n\n:P And yes, I did die quite a few times. Yet I never felt the urge to rage quit - the frustration of having to retrry stages almost, uncannily enough, felt like a part of the experience. Incredible feel; I felt so darn out of place and helpless. Just falling through an endless razmatazz of an abyss without any proper explanation or reasons. A different kind of horror - not only did it remind me of Lovecraft's stuff but some of Neil Gaiman's ideas from the Sandman series too. This game is the epitome of chaos, and a glorious one at that.\n\nOne has to however, be aware of a few things: The game IS admittedly hard. I had to swallow my pride quite early on and fiddle with the difficulty. And secondly: This is not necessarily everyone's cup of tea when horror games are concerned. There is no gore, naked flying dead guys, blood, or even a proper, perceivable reality.\n\nThe style of the game is simple: You are falling. You keep falling through an insane, abysmal pandemonium where pretty much anything can and DOES kill you. Your task as the player is to control and fine tune your descent and avoid... well, everything really. The sole ability you have is phasing, which you can use to either detect the paths of "living" creatures or to pass through them. This of course, is very limited and only lasts for a few heartbeats, and takes a while to recharge; ergo it will grant your sorry mortal behind a fleeting moment of false security... if you use it wisely.\n\nThe palette and luminance of the game is intense and chaotically gorgeous, fulgent lights and color sometimes blind the player's path momentarily. If one is sensitive or intolerant to such I'd urge either precaution or to avoid it. That having said the levels or rather, stages, were all beautifully designed. As were the aforementioned uh... "living" things which... look like... uh... something you'd see under microscopes in high security laboratories. (Awesome!)\n\nSo if you are a big fan of Lovecraftian horror, I would definitely say give this game a whirl; it bloody deserves it. Same goes for any horror fans seeking something quite different. But be ready to die. 'Nuff said.","October 11, 2015","true","1.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

If you play Counter Strike Global Offensive or Team Fortress 2 in excess, you will most likely be dissapointed in this game, because both of those games rely on constant change to provide entertainment. This game is not meant to be "a whole ton of fun" or addictive, but to rather provoke thought. Consequently, most people whom play games, such as the aforementioned, do not want to think while playing a game, they want to have fun. I would not call this game fun, because it is not supposed to be fun, it's supposed to be interesting and thought provoking. If you failed to take the five seconds to look at the tags, I would also like to point out that this game was inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's pseudo-religion of Cosmicism, which is shown in quotes such as: "They could destroy you with a thought." and "You are simply not worth the effort." Now, if you aren't well read, this will slip by you, but for those who do pick up on the reference, it is quite chilling.\n\nEuclidean's atmosphere is phenomenal, and the narrator does a fantastic job throughout the game. The introductory sequence of the game, which I will not spoil, is incredibly clever. The achievements, while slightly over shot, are fitting to the game's atmosphere, and provide a great additional touch to the game.\n\nHowever, I still have not explained how this game acts as a tool. What could this game act as a tool for as well? Euclidean acts as tool that seperates the gamers who think from those who don't. If you honestly bought this game for gameplay after watching the trailer and reading the description, as well as a few reviews, you should not be allowed to purchase games. This game, as previously stated, is meant to provoke thought through symbolism and referencing. Henceforth, if you cannot respect that video games are not always addictive and oozing gameplay, you fall into the lesser category. That is why this game is a fantastic game, it seperates gamers and into two groups, while existing as a thought provoking and functional game. Well done Alpha Wave Entertainment.

In whatever case, the title screen consists of you, the player, perched and bolted onto the top of a cliff with a few objects scattered about that each has a function like any other old menu screen. Not including the “Start game” button. Level selection is not where you start the game, the game starts when you start the game, and with that the mystifying nature of this game ironically reveals itself. Nothing tends to be simple, you gaze into infinity, you observe what no man was ever supposed to observe, and this game hits the tone of that absolute horror before the unknown or, on the obverse side of that same coin of horror, the overwhelming amount of supposed knowns.\n\nFor a game with consistency pretenses, it dabbles a whole lot in the vaguely philosophical quandaries of man as existing in virtue of the absurd. This tone the game manages to capture is incredibly attractive in many ways, and it strikes a balance between creepy, interesting and outright scary. We get a narrator that admittedly contributes greatly to the sheer uncanniness of the setting, that reminds me a bit of a game like The Void, a game that hits these existential notes of absurdity equally as adeptly.\n\nAs the name suggests, we are dealing at least in some respect with geometry as a general aesthetic. This is mixed with a more organic biology-inspired look of enemies that take the form of deep sea crustaceans. These creatures are interspersed with things like geometrically formed DNA strings, spinal chords and dissolved substances permeating through liquid. There is a naturalist aesthetic to say the least, one inspired by science and fulfilled with a nice color palette all withing a murky and drab underwater look. It all combines and adds to an overall heaviness relating to man as biological/objective being, which the “narrative” perpetually alludes to. The way the game mixes rigidity of geometry with the disgusting fluidity of natural movement creates a feeling of unfamiliarity by way of juxtaposition between wildly separate forms of being.\n\nThe fear is palpable. Everything you do is threatening. Get close to a “solid” object and there will be parasites encroaching and subsequently ending you. Stray too far away and there are multidimensional sea creatures stripped to their elements waiting to subsume your very existence. This is what ultimately makes up the gameplay, it is a game of avoidance. You descend in some type of thick liquid throughout a three-dimensional plane, dodging objects and the like to eventually get to the point of progression. It is a seemingly simple task, that behind its simple concept provides a decent difficulty and forces one to think about the patterns the game has created. This is a game of torturous horror unto the sweetness of bubbly disintegration followed by its corollary reemergence. Along with the simple concept of dodging incoming objects as you fall, we have a dimension-shifting ability, that switches the wavelengths of the light and warps our limited view into a more distinct one that elucidates and sketches out the form and position of incoming objects, and of course, makes you impervious to a foe's onslaught; which is pretty useful.\n\nEuclidean does sound design incredibly well. There is this beautiful concordance between drone, sharp synthesizers and noise, alternating between grinding motors and pulsating echoes, surges of electricity and the like. It is a very full experience, that along with the visuals puts you in a sort of trance. You are put in a crossfire between these blasts of audiovisual stimuli, in accordance between that and me being incredibly tired while writing this and playing the game a very special atmosphere was created, a very anxiety-filled Zen state. Which, I suppose, wouldn't make it a Zen state. It is a twofold emotion that fluctuates between absolute horror and hazy tranquility.\n\nI like my game with a nice dose of pessimistic nihilism. I also like the attempts this game makes of creating horror out of what would otherwise be seen probably as the most innocuous thing you could think of. Unless complexity's daunting nature is a phobia of yours. I think that this goal was for the most part achieved, at least in my case. Euclidean is an interesting first project for a newly formed development group. I will definitely keep my eye out for their games in the future. A cheap, short, but rife with interesting visuals and sound designs, and coupled with gameplay that gives enough intensity (mostly) to combat the boredom or the diminishing returns of what these types of games may otherwise suffer from. It was a nightmarish yet wonderful experience. A great little experience indeed, I would recommend this, if you're interested. It won't eat up too much of your time if you happen to not enjoy the gameplay, and it would support developers who undeniably has some interesting ideas scrambling about in their finite human heads.\n\nThere are plenty of other things to comment on and to draw parallels to, but we'll leave it at that.

Lovecraft fan. I was excited about this game because it looked good and I had read reviews which said it was "Lovecraftian levels of scary." But when I started playing it, it didn't take me long to realize that this game wasn't scary whatsoever. All it is is a bunch of random shapes fly around as you fall through them. There is a narrator who recites vaguely Lovecraftian themes. And you die and you die over and over again because you have little to no control over where you fall through the shapes. So they just constantly kill you and it gets incredibly frusterating. That is it. that is the whole game. There is just nothing here. Seriously, you fall very slowly and cannot speed up nor can you move out of the way with any speed at all. The gameplay is pointless. On top of all that, it is just not scary at all. If you see a review of this game that claims this game is scary in any way or that it is good, they are either trolling or they are friends of the developer.\n\nDo not get this game. It is not worth it. This game looks cool, but that is the only thing going for it. Do not fall for the boarderline false advertising. It is not "Lovecraftian levels of scary" There are much better Lovecraft games out there, like the Darkness Within series.","October 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

More of a visual rollercoaster than a game, but for $3.99 I think it's certainly worth it if you like inspecting sunken Cyclopean cities inspired by HP Lovecraft. This game has been referred to as a "falling simulator" and well, they're right. You spend most of the time looking down as you avoid objects and creatures by drifting slowly down through a watery atmosphere. The creatures look alien and the environments are very stunning to look at. Also this game isn't very hard to run, so you should be able to enjoy a steady 75 fps on your Rift. Don't play it for too long without stretching your neck, or maybe just be better than I am and not need to stare at the ground the entire time.\n\nOne suggestion: the devs should fix it so the little "resolution, windowed?, display" menu doesn't show up, and should just go directly to the Rift without asking.","September 28, 2015","true","1.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's not exactly a horror game.  It's not exactly a game at all.  If I were a pretentious hipster type I'd call it an "experience".  It's just something you play through to enjoy the atmosphere and scenery--it's basically a creepy, atmospheric film you watch, the gameplay is just there to immerse you more in the film.  If you're into that kind of thing, it's very, very well done.  It's exactly the right length, any more would have become boring and repetitive.  It ends while you're still enjoying it.\n\nReally, it's just a bunch of visual effects experts showing off, but that's not a bad thing at all.  The effects are immersive and  excellent.  I recommend playing this on a good screen, with good headphones, in a dark room.  It's surprisingly hard on your computer--I have a upper-mid-range gaming laptop, and I still had a very low framerate at times, even with the minimum graphics settings.\n\nMy only complaint is the interface and menus.  It's somewhere between "buggy" and "broken".  Some menu buttons don't work at all, some settings aren't available, and some video settings change on their own while you're playing, which can detract from the experience very badly.\n\nOverall, it's an hour of interesting, immersive fun well worth the four bucks if you enjoy this kind of thing.  Most of the bad reviews are from people who expected it to be something else, and were disappointed.  All it's trying to be is an immersive film and a video effects showcase, but it does that very, very well.","November 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Welcome to Euclidean!\n\n\nPlot:You are an insect trapped into the ghostly shell of bones that compose your body and fall to your inevitable doom.\nYou can try to avoid some of the perils that lies in the depths of this realm of Gods.\nSome looks are upon you... maybe you can be some sort of entertainment for forces that goes beyond your imagination.\n\n\nMusic/effects:Euclidean is a strong atmospheric game. The main aspect of the soundtrack is the voice that comments your progression.\nMusic feels more like echoes from the world around you. Effects of creatures and the simple fact that you fall into endless dark waters makes the game even more powerful in its attempt to immerse the player (add to that your heart beat that trigger when you are close to a danger).  A true success that can boast in front of famous games such as Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark or even Shadowman (very close to Euclidean ost).\n\nGraphics:A masterpiece.\nOkay i have to admit that geometrics forms can be taken for laziness but i've found the game very appealing and with its own style (that's what we call art). Completely in the mood of Lovecraft's universe with crazy creatures and amorphous structures. I really liked the fact that you can see your body, bones filled with energy that pulse depending of your actions or the environment. Phasing also gives you the interresting ability to have a better view of your surroundings.\nAgain it's another great aspect of the game but won't be for all audiences (again it's art).\n\n\nGameplay:That has been already said, Euclidean is an atmospheric game. You fall into an "ocean" filled with creatures and structures that, if you touch them, will cause an untimely death. You can still phase your body and dodge during few seconds enemies or small obstacles. However it doesn't last long and needs to recharge. From the start to its end (white pulsating orbs for each level) you need to control your descent by floating around with movement keys.\nDifficulty level determines how you can respawn and speed of creatures. There's an option of permadeath that forces you restart all levels if anything kills you...\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE:The sensation of despair and being offense less is absolutely amazing. Euclidean is a joy for every lovers of Lovecraft's universe. Being an insect under the eye of the dark and twisted god has never been so funny!\nHowever the game is very short, i've finished it in 43 minutes in normal mode.\nAnd i didn't try other difficulty level due to lack of variations and the overall difficulty: memorize the way to the end and it's a piece of cake.\nBUT like all masterpiece of immersion, it can't be considered as a game but more like a piece of art that might disappoint.\n\nFor me it was a blast and i wanted to see more ! Especially to know more about the main character and the reason why he is falling into this nightmare.\n\nIf you like art and you're not shy to try a true "Cthulu madness diving simulator"....  Euclidean is for you.\n\n\nN.B: Frankly best 43 mins on a game this year. Please do a sequel!

On the upside, the game is very atmospheric, which is good, because I bought it because I wanted a lovecraftian romp. The narrator was spot on in my opinion, and I enjoyed listening to his cosmic horror styled dialogue. The visuals were entertaining and added to the feel of the game, even if they appeared to be inspired by LSD.  The music was also fitting and I enjoyed the ambience. On the other hand though, the game had some flaws. The gameplay is pretty limited, and... unusual. It plays somewhat like you would expect frogger to play if frogger was upgraded to a modern game and forcably pushed forward (or rather down in this circumstance) by some unseen, mad, god. I didn't particularly find the game play very motivating. Another thing that didn't particularly bother me but could be potentially frustrating to some players is the fact that tutorials come up mostly in the form of hints when you die. You will die (probably several times) before you figure out how to play the game. Another unfortunate thing is the ending is completely ambiguous. I understand that in the genre that they are shooting for, sometimes what you don't know is the most compelling portion, but they could have found a way to make the story feel more like it had a conclusion without harming the overall ambience and feel of the game.\n\nOne final note, the game is short. Some people might say that this is bad. Maybe it is. However, I say it isn't. I paid less than the cost of a fast food meal for about an hour and a quarter's worth of game play. I feel it earned it's keep. However, if you don't want to play three dollar's and change for a bit over an hour's worth of gameplay, this game isn't for you. But if you like lovecraft and want a single sitting game, this one is for you.\n\n\nTLDR:\nIn the end I'd say that this game was a positive experience. I'm happy to have played it. However, it was a closer thing than most. The game definately has its flaws and may not live up to expectations. It definately is a pass if you don't like lovecraftian horror. I give the game a somewhat hesitant thumbs up, I hope to see more, and more polished work from the developer in the future.","September 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I wholeheartedly agree. Sinking to the very depths of sanity and reality, you become aware that the horror isn't in facing demons, zombies, nor jumpscares.

Having played only the VR version of the game (Oculus Rift DK2) and that only briefly, I have no problem with the purchase which given the low price anyone should feel comfortable with buying.\n\nIn virtual reality, you look up and see an anomaly in the sky. This thing approaches you and throws you into an abyss where only the memory of body can be seen and a voice chastises you about even daring to be in such a place then reminds you of the hopelessness of your chances. The sounds come from all around and work well with the 3D audio which helps warn that you're venturing too close to a wall with some geometric snake out to get you. You fall ever so slowly and move even slower bringing up dread as the inevitable death comes close. Large euclidean monsters out of a Cthulu High School geometry class take pattern trips around the areas giving you a chance to either avoid them or phase through. All the while, you look for a platform to get you to the next environment.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, though the slow movement through this geometric environment can be tedious. Not knowing where the target base is at can annoy you if you're not close enough to float over there when you do find it. I played standing up which I recommend, but the inability to reorient meant tactical turning to get the cord from around my neck. Lastly, the developers could do with making looking down less 1:1 when in VR, perhaps a 45° tilt of the head correlates with a 90° downward angle in game similar to what AaaAaaaAaaaa does in its game. Finally, the subtitles should not be frozen to the head mounted display screen as they're difficult to read. I would even suggest having more archaic and animated fonts to get across the mood of the dark voice. In addition, the menu should be placed at normal eyeview and not just where I was looking at at that time.\n\nAgain, a good purchase for those with VR headsets looking to expand their library of official games. It's short, fairly difficult and really offers a treat for the eyes. PLAY STANDING UP!!!","September 27, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theit7/recommended/398180/","theit7","It","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theit7/","43 products in account","This game is very, VERY cool...\nI quite enjoyed the 63 minutes I spent playing this game, and all up It was definatly worth the time and money spent on it. My only regret is that it ended too soon. I felt like I was just getting right into it before it finished on me. Aw well.\n\nNarrative:\nI'll admit, I've never experienced anything 'Lovcraftian' before this game, so I have no grounds of comparison. However, the parts of the dialoge that I did catch (Becuase I wassn't grasping onto my will to not become gemotric soup at those times) were pretty interesting. I don't wanna give too much away, but there were some lines of dialouge which had a 'woahhh' factor. But most of it was "Whatchu doin? Get outta here fool!".\nThe Narrator refers to other beings of some kind. I couldn't work out if those where the things I was avoiding or someing I just don't understand at all. Maybe that was intentional? Who knows...\nSomething interesting I noted though is that the Narrator seams to be some kind of conscious being himself. One of his lines include "I pitty you" implying that he can feel pitty. And yet any thing else he describes seams to exist in a realm where things like pitty are redundant. Or at least, that was the gist I got from him.\nAlso, when he is talking about the 'others' he says that 'I'm not worth their effort'. What does that say about the Narrator though, considering that he spends the entire game trying to interact with me? Hmmmm\n\nGameplay\nRule #1 with this game: have patients. I found that usually when I died it was tawards the third qurtile of the level, and then you have to start it again.\nBut anyhow, I'm getting ahead of myself. The game is divided up into these stages. Each one with their own gemetric enemies and patterns to avoid. The game is slow and moving feels really slow. But I tell you, when you get that 'phase' in just the right moment it feels sooooooo goooood.\nFinal thing: I wish the mouse movment felt more 'Narual' and less like it was ported from a joystick/analog stick movment. I think the correct term for this is the mouse accelaration? *Shruggs*\nOther than that there isn't really much else to it, this game has very simplistic gameplay.\n\nAudio:\nThe sounds in this are amazing! I loved listening to the Narrator. His voice was nice a soothing, and well acted.\nIn fact this entire game could have been quite the relaxing experience if there was an 'invicible' mode or something like that. The music was quite pleasing and added to the game well. Also the sounds effects fit in very nicely.\n\nVisuals:\nFirst off, I wanna say that this game runs smooth as balls. This is what all games should feel like! No excuses! I know my monitor refreshes at 60hz, so I I'm not suppsed to notice any diffrence in frame rate past 60, but this game always ran in between 120 and 180 fps and let me tell you, it definatly had a better feeling to it then Far Cry 4 did while it was running at 52 and even Fallout 4 running at 65. Needless to say I am very thankfull for the uncapped framrate. Mucho Gracias.\nThe animations where really stellar and mezmorising to look at. Nothing too complicated means everything is executed really well.\nAfter the first 3 levels, it seamed like each level would have it's own colour scheme. The second and third levels are partiularly aesthetically pleasing, but unfortunatly this theme doesn't really keep on throught the whole game.\nMost of the individual elements within the game is monocromatic. But don't get me wrong, it looks great that way. Enviromental elements are textured and the textures are also pretty swell, though I wish they could have been higher resolution. Maybe that's just me though.\nLast thing is the lighting. Holy crap the light here rocks. Fallout were boasting their volumetric lighting, and I'll be damned if Fallouts lighting isn't majestic as hell, though even their fogs look like a an unimmerisve fade.

I have always loved H. P. Lovecraft's work. I loved it for the things beyond conseption, the things which shouldn't be able to function in our universe but do, and most of all for the things which aren't perverse because they are the opposite of what our culture advocates, but because they simply exist outside of what we are and can possibly be. In most games, movies, and book that are inspired by H. P. Lovecraft get this wrong, but this game gets it right on the head. Even if it wasn't able to show things that can't exist, it was able to create the feel of something truly alien to all that we have, and can, ever know. In game, the voice (who I think might be Yog-Sothoth) even says that you cannot perceive.\n\nSo over all, yes, this game is something that I reccomend. It simply does something that I have never truly seen done before.

All you want to do is move frantically, run away, but you are stuck moving at a snail's pace while you see your impending doom below you. Or, rather, don't see. Because you get pulses of vision and then everything goes dark again. I am playing this game slowly, one level in one sitting, because it freakin scares me. The antipation of the unknown deaths you will suffer makes the whole game play experience so tense.\n\nI bought this game to scare me. It delivered, better than I ever expected.

I went into this expecting unfinished, mechanically broken, conceptually flawed garbage. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThis game, while by no means perfect, is well worth the time and money for any Lovecraft fan. It recreates the feeling of abject, silent dread you get reading the best stories from the man himself nearly flawlessly. Euclidean draws you in and plays with your head, and evokes images of R'lyeh and the great Old Gods. It is filled with simply designed geometric monstrocities that will disturb you for reasons you can't understand, let alone articulate. You avoid these nightmare creatures as you float ever downward through terrible structures and buildings that only add to the atmosphere of mute dread Euclidean curates so deftly. As you float down using awsd to avoid both "terrain" and creatures, you have the ability to phase through monsters for a short time before the ability must recharge. Adding to the difficulty and the atmosphere is the fact that everything is concealed by a pulsating fog and lighting effects. The sound design of Euclidean is some of the best I've seen, elevating the tension and dread the game does such a fantastic job of cultivating.\n\nEuclidean is a difficult game. It doesn't hold your hand at all; quite the opposite. Just figuring out how to start the game will take some brain power. In the first level you will die several times trying to understand the game mechanics, even if you have read all the reviews. You can't be prepared for this game with words. It defies language. And its three difficulty levels? Hard, Nightmarish, and Impossible.\n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend this game highly enough, and if you, like me, are a Lovecraft fan, I would say you don't have a choice. You NEED to play this game, if for no other reason than to please the Old Gods. I cannot think of a better use of four dollars for a horror gamer or a Lovecraft fan, and you can bet that I am going to wait with baited breath for Alpha Wave's next masterpiece.\n\n","January 11","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's what seems to be a very challenging game, and it looks so damn good on the HTC Vive. The screenshots don't do the game any favor, it's not nearly as dull and flat as it appears to be - on the contrary, it's wide, extremely atmospheric and at the same time bizarrely esoteric; most likely what living through a Lovecraftian horror is supposed to be. You start to fear the walls and beings and on the same time want to touch them out of pure scientific curiosity.

The world itself is interesting to look at in VR, but the novelty wears off quick and you're just stuck with a slow-paced walk around your room.\n\nEDIT: if you like the geometric shapes and want a cheap VR title, go with 5089: An Action RPG it's a fully fleshed out game, and WAY more fun for only a dollar or 2 more.\n\nPros\n-it's a pretty cool geometric world, if I could set this game as a moving background to Steam VR, I would\n-fairly cheap game in a sea of 20-30 dollar VR demos\n\nCons\n-you spend the whole game staring down at the floor which gets very uncomfortable, very quick.\n-not much to do\n-deaths can be cheap\n-it's not always obvious what objects you need to dodge and which ones are just scenary (that break apart as you float through them)\n-gets boring very fast\n\nEDIT 2:\n-is almost never updated...","May 5","false","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Endlessly falling into an abyss of, you guessed it, cubes [-_-] so prepare for looking directly down in VR, which of course is silly with the front heavy Vive. So you step left and right to avoid the..big..cube monsters...and....zzzZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzz\n\nAnyway played it once then returned a few weeks later to be confronted by a menu system that features for some reason a brush, palette and telescope? So after fiddling for some minutes that I will never get back trying to restart for another go, I exited never to return. I am all for challenging gaming conventions but not at the ease of use. Common sense seems to have left the building when this little cuboid baby was being developed.","May 30","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"
