Players must gather resources that include food, wood, iron, gold, oil and electricity to create and feed their nation and armies of World War I.\n\nThe game runs on Cossacks game engine, and is similar to Cossacks/American Conquest series in some ways, the game is overall very unique and fun but has compatibility problems with new hardware and operating systems.\n\nPros:\n-Good old Isometric graphics similar to Cossacks/American Conquest games.\n-Each nation has its own fairly accurately represented style of architecture (Something very hard to see in other games, most games use the same re-skinned copy/paste models).\n-Good World War I atmosphere.\n-Good sounds and music which fits well in WWI period.\n-In-game tutorial, commanding units, developing economy, using tactics and strategy.\n-Five nations to choose (Austro-Hungarian Empire, Britain, France, Germany, Russia).\n-Campaign for each nation and some extra missions.\n-Skimrish mode against AI.\n-Wide variety of units, buildings and technology.\n-Specialized units that is specific of each country of the era.\n-Challenging AI, playing on medium difficulty feels like hard, AI actually uses tactics\n-In-game encyclopedia included (Museum) , which is good to have one.\n-Would run smoothly on weak/old systems.\n\nNeutral:\n-No widescreen support (Not a big deal for me).\n-No peace time option in skirmish mode like in Cossacks/American Conquest series.\n\nCons:\n-Compatibility issues, the game is likely not going to run without problems on new hardware/Operating Systems, (works on my Win7 64-bit Laptop but not on my desktop PC with the same OS and superior hardware).\n\nOverall the game is challenging and fun, I played years ago on Windows XP (outside of Steam), had issues too, but the one on Steam is (Gold) which is v2.0 so in theory it should work better than the old retail version, and that is true because I tried Disc version of The Entente: Battlefields World War I, and it didn't run on Windows 7 even with after patches.\n\nI'm recommending the game to anyone who likes RTS and WWI, especially if you also like Cossacks/American Conquest series, but keep in mind the game might not work on every system, so think about the risk.\n\nThe game is fairly cheap, $1.99 in the US, 1,99€ in Europe, £1.59 in UK and less in other countries, if you're a fan of RTS and old games then get it, you can keep it to play later on some weak system that is built for old games like me.\n\nThere are some tweaks and fixes that might fix your problems, don't forget to read pinned threads in the community hub, I would have not recommended the game if it was the same version as the old retail one, but this one (v2.0) actually worked on Win7 64-bit, unlike the retail version I have doesn't run, so if you really want to play this game then you have to give it a chance.\n\nI'm guessing the problem is occurring from newer graphics cards and processors but graphics cards is my first guess.\n\nMy laptop specs: "The Entente Gold" (Works).\n\nHP G62\n\n-Intel i5 460m\n-First generation Intel HD Graphics\n-4GB Ram\n-Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate\n\nMy Desktop PC Specs: "The Entente Gold" (does NOT work).\n\n-Intel i5-2500k\n-GTX 770\n-8GB Ram\n-Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate\n\nCossacks and American Conquest series running perfectly out of the box on almost every known system (Except maybe Win8) I believe it is not hard to do the same for The Entente Gold.\n\nI am kindly asking developers to release a patch to fix compatibility issues with various systems, please fix this game because it deserves more attention and fans.\n\nThe game is a hidden gem, if it ever works.","January 19, 2015","true","2.8"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","21","28","2","1"

Widescreen support doesn't exist, but that's really not that much of a surprise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/285480/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","The Entente is a old-styled RTS based on rarely-used WW1 setting. It was released in 2003-2004 and was made by same people who made Cossacks, on same engine as well, unless I am mistaken. And now it was rereleased on Steam.\n\nYou will notice that while in Steam it's called Entente Gold, in the game itself it shows "v2.0" and intro was edited to say "Entente II". It's not clear what was changed. I remember somebody on Steam noticing it and saying that some sprites were changed. Like they were working to remake it, but then gave up.\n\nAnd sadly, it wasn't changed enough to be made compitable with newest Windows. While it may work fine on Windows XP, anything newer will have bucket and half of troubles, bugs and glitches. Then again, you aren't likely to progress past "frozen mouse" anyway. So you will have to look around Steam forums and guides a lot to fix it all. To try to fix it all. Having ended up using Voodoo emulating software of sorts, I still would have low FPS in this game. Well, it was fine, but only when nothing was selected. And you have to select buildings to order 50 more soldiers, you know. And some people seemed to fail to make it run properly even after trying all solutions. So, be careful. This is the main reason not to recommend the game.\nOh, yes, no Widescreen. You can set it, but it will just will crash the game.\n\nNo idea how mutliplayer is in this game. Actually, when I clicked on multiplayer option, it was showing nothing aside from mirror-effect. You know, when screen places frame on top of each other when there is no background. Leaving only trail of mouse. It could be because I didn't fix it fully. Or it could be because v2.0 changed things or possibly deleted everything related to multiplayer, including menues.\n\nI didn't play much of game because of it lagging on my laptop after fixes. Just few random map battles. It's quite a standard old-school RTS. Even WW1 setting doesn't bring much to it, no trenches to be found there. Having few recources types may be scary, but you just put needed buildings on top of nearby recource pools and then send remaining workers to work near windmill. And well, being 2D engine in beggining of 2000s, it means that it sacrificed 3D looks for sake of having tons of units at same time. And it's spammy, alright.\n\nOne of the more interesting things in it is how your main force, soldiers, are mass produced. In masses. Quickly and cheaply, filling your screen up. But they die like a fly when met with any defencive. While power and recources and time needed to produce better units grow geometrically, so to say. You can make basic soldier every few seconds. Or take half-minute to produce machine gunner. Or few minutes to produce artilerry cannon. Which hits good but misses 90% of time, so it's better used on center of a town. And has firing range bigger than vision range. Doesn't stop unit AI from shooting. Or you can take 20 minutes to create a tank. And the most powerful units are naval ones, taking no less than half-hour or more to complete. Hm, perhaps it's realistical, seeing how history makes a big deal when a ship is lost. It does make water maps take forever when you need a water transport.\n\nBut then again, looking at players on YouTube and looking at AI, mass-produced soldiers are still the thing to do. Sure, a soldiers die like a fly when met with guard house filled with machine gunner. What it means is that you have to create 10 times more soldiers and zerg rush it down, watching them grenade everything. It's also faster than producing heavier units.\n\nAnd seeing how multiplayer does not exist here, AI isn't all that great either. No, it's hard. Until you figure out the game. It's just that his main tactic is massing soldiers are and sending waves after waves at you. It could use more variety, really.\n\nWell, it's quite a curious old-school RTS. Or mass producment of basic units while wasting 30 minutes to build something bigger. I didn't spend enough time to say for sure if it's bad or good one. But seeing how it may or may not run even after fixes, you should avoid it.","August 22, 2015","false","7.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Unless for extreme nostalgia sake - which is why I got it. It's pretty broken. I loved this Entente when I was younger and loved playing it, one of the few World War 1 RTS games out there. The problem I have is this game uses FPS to judge game speed. If you want to run slowly you're going to have 12-18 frames per second. Not to mention the GUI. When up on your screen it halves the already poor frame rate.  It goes up to 35 frames if you turn the speed all the way up but then if you select a unit the menu appears and halves your framerate again.\n\nThe colours are disorientating and can making you feel sick after a good hour or so. The resolution is screwy at best. They are weird to begin with, I'm not sure but I think they're for 4:3 monitors. I'm going to say don't get it if you've just stumbled upon it and thought it seemed interesting.\n\nIf they just made a HD version that got rid of the resolution and framerate problems I would reccommend this game like crazy.","December 24, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So both times I had to do a hard shut-down on my computer to exit out of the game. I tried multiple methods to get the game to work and nothing works. I do not advise buying this game since all it seems to do is crash. It needs at least a patch to make it compatable with my OS, and as it is currently this game was a waste of money.\n\nDo yourself a favor and don't get it until they patch it.

And the game realy does its best to look ww1. The game favors mass waved and turtle tactics. To new users, this can be a shock, especially when the enemy attacks with waves and waves of troops. Gameplay is reletively simple, infantry are you core guys, cavely are good scouts, and the rest support you infantyr and cavelry. Just like WW1. The music is interesting, though nothing to write home about. Armies are similar enough that no one army is overpowered, yet each army has a style that makes them unique.  Now, here comes the problem. This game is infamouse for not working on new systems. It is recommend to use an oldersystem with this game. If not, you may have to toy with the files in game. To some of you, this might be fun. To others, it can be hell. Another problem with this game is that, despite being ww1, there are no trenchs to be seen. Yes sad, but we can't have everything. Overall I would recomend this game. But Buyer Beware, be prepared for problems if you are using a new system. DEVS will not help you. Until a fan patch is made, best to play on an older system or find a home remedy to get the game to work.","February 6, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The interface is fairly simple as are the graphics, but the visuals maintain the game's historic accuracy (the differences between national uniform). It can't be compared to the "Blitzkrieg" series for graphics, and it's somewhat behind the "Battle of Empires" mod for "Company of Heroes", but for the price there's quite literally hours (if not weeks or even months in the campaigns) of game play with thankfully little frustration for the junior leader or even the veteran RTS player. A well-trained AI is built into the game to manage your civil or military war effort for you so you need do very little, unless you really want a challenge. Then you should fully expect General War in all his aspects! Finally and thankfully the game doesn't just park itself in trench warfare-you should expect what really happened in 1914; the dawn of twentieth-century warfare with all the associated horrors.
