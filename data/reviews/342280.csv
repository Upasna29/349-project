Time has evolved the game to include many different kinds of blocks, ones which move, or change, ones which interact with Manyland and ones which interact with the wider internet. All these blocks have allowed users to create the most amazing things.\n\nUsers have created worlds which are genuinely beautiful, games which are technically complex and adventures that spread for tens of thousands of blocks. The most important thing created however is the community; the Manyland community or Manyzens as they are styled are amazing. They are fiercly protective of their world, nurturing of new players and constantly feed back to the developpers new ideas and features - more often than not these are implimented into the game.\n\nI have never played a game where the developpers were so keen to listen to the userbase, interact with them in game, and learn from them to improve the user experience.\n\nCome and help as we create a whole universe together and build on a comminity of amazing people.","November 17, 2015","true","7.0"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","43","50","2","0"

Interested? I was too, and thankfully the game ended up being better than I expected.\n\nYou start off in one of the welcome areas, surrounded by random people without any clue of what to do next. But just like the games I mentioned, there are hundreds of rooms for us to choose. In Manyland they are all divided in categories, such as Art, Cinema, Chat, Adventure, Games, Quest, Music, Party, Horror, Casino, and the list goes on and on.\n\nThere is unlimited content thanks to the possibility of creating our own items and character models, and then using them to build something entirely new. Maybe a costume party, a giant pool with robots, minigames, a cinema that actually plays videos from YouTube. There is literally no limit but our imagination.\nWe can attach items to our body, such as weapons, furniture, vehicles or even wings. And we can swap our character model anytime we want, either by creating one by ourselves or using one that has been already created by another player. There are specific rooms for these items, and luckily we can use a stash/inventory on a side of the screen to save everything that we like and then use it in our room.\n\nWe can build a house from scratch, using different types of floor pieces, stairs, ladders, walls, blocks, doors, anything that we can imagine. The game benefits from the online community and we can find people 24/7.\n\nBeing able of creating pretty much anything we want it's one of the highlights of the game, and it's something that I haven't seen in a long time. It can be quite hard to understand it at first, but there are plenty of tutorials, both outside and inside the game.\n\nPlaying Manyland with a group of friends it's a really fun and addictive experience, and if you're looking for a game that let's you build mini games, items and entire rooms from scratch, this is a must buy. The community it's always helping to improve it, and the devs are very active.\n\nYou can try the free version of the game here:  Manyland Web[manyland.com]\n\nIf you liked this review you can find a lot more in our Curator Group: Original Curators Group","February 11","true","3.7"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

Everyone's experience with Manyland is guaranteed to be different - it is so open ended that nearly anything is possible.\n\nThere really is no aim to the game unless you give it one. Whether you want to create a messy workshop where other players have to match parts to broken robots, a sunny beach full of partying celebrities and seashell diving, lock your friends in a haunted mansion, an art museum, a cottage in the woods, a space walk, a funhouse... the tools are at your disposal, all you need is imagination. If you'd rather just explore other people's work, that's fine too!\n\nThis game is best played with friends, as the adult player base is a little shy - we mostly hide. If you're looking to make friends be sure to come out to Manyday on the 19th of every month.\n\nDespite having only 2 devs and no official moderators, the game is surprisingly well self-moderated and you have to go looking to find anything terribly inappropriate.\n\nIf you are looking for great places to explore - try manyunity.com, a user-made website (Azuros) cataloguing popular areas.","November 18, 2015","true","1.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","0"

These normally don't affect my reviews.\nManyland is weird, complicated, but so compelling. The tools provided in this unique sandbox are some of the most powerful and unwieldy things ever in these kind of games. But it also does a poor job at explaining them, and while I think the game is freaking awesome, it does come short in really being accessible.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=622726708\n\nThe game is playable for free at manyland.com I have played the web version of the game before but the review will not be judging the differences between the two, despite basically being the same in most cases.\nPros:The social interaction with friends and other players is basic but awesome. Got together with a few forum friends on here and it was fun. And weird.\nThe tools to create objects are very powerful. There's a lot of objects you can make, and there's a lot of potential to be had. You can make all sorts of games, visual objects, and content for the game.\nA large load of community-created content. Most of the items/objects in this game were made by other users, and that's pretty rad!\nThe community is pretty swell as well. Helpful developers, helpful players, and a world ripe of creativity.\nVersus Roblox, it's not a craptastic mess with it's business model. The game is mostly completely free, with some monetary items you can buy (like gifts and a subscription fee). The browser version is totally playable too.\nNitpicks:I wish the Steam version of the game could let you directly use links to send you to a world. Maybe embed it in the Paste?\nAdding objects in a area with a background tile is kind of problematic. You have to place the "Thing" objects in before placing the background objects. This could be remedied by allowing the player to tweak with multiple layers.\nCons:The game, despite providing a lot of tutorials, still manages to completely make mechanics go over my head. It doesn't properly explain them, and are very easy to miss.\nGame's UI often gets cluttered with too many menus.\nFriend's list is really unintuitive. I want to add my friends no matter where they are, but I can only do that when I'm in the same world as them.\nThe Review\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=622726682\n\nManyland isn't really a video game. It's a straight-up sandbox that lets players create objects and worlds. There's no real PVP or RPG mechanics, or survival; This is all about making things and showing it with other players. Perhaps you want to create a character skin? Or a mountable vehicle? Manyland has a lot of options for those kind of tools, but does put itself at a immense cost;\n\nIt's very, very difficult to learn. The game mechanics are explained in tutorials and a whole buncha texts/forum posts, but that's it. For a basic and new player, making things is about as daunting and scary as climbing a skyscraper. When I first played it, I had no idea what to do, because the game didn't boot me to a tutorial world. It gave me a welcome prompt and that was it. Game design wise, it'd be hella-lot more smart to place players in the isolated tutorial areas to start.\n\nMy other issue is that the friends list, while functional, didn't let me friend anybody directly. I had to first meet them in the same world in order to add them as a friend. I'd rather to directly add them via username, because I wouldn't want to force my friend online to add him if he wanted to be online later.\n\nThis issue can also go with the UI, which is while functional, hard to navigate. There's a ton of menus and buttons you have to click before you find certain maps to play, etc.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618999008\n\nBut otherwise, it's a pretty dandy game. I've been making cool, social worlds for friends to go on and hang out. Once you understand how everything works, creation makes a lot more sense. Placing and making objects are very intuitive and very efficent; There's a variety of tools to creating objects, and building worlds is as easy as dragging-and-dropping.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=622726564\n\nWhat about the community content in this game? It's actually very high in terms of quality. A lot of people have made awesome character skins that resemble pixel art from other games, a lot of the blocks, gamemodes, and objects are very well done. It's a fantastic community to interact with, and that's really the main highlight of this game. The game's hub worlds are filled with a lot of these items too, so it's hard not to explore the game, being amazed at the cool stuff you see. A lot of the folks on the forum are helpful as well, and the developers complement the community back by responding and answering to a user's many burning questions.\n\nWhat this all leads to is a sandbox that's not perfect, but definitely noteworthy. If you don't want to put the money on the game, you can play it free online, but otherwise, there isn't much to lose if you're really into these kind of games. I expect myself to easily put more hours in this then I originally thought I did.\n\nTL;DR - Although daunting to learn and play around with, Manyland is a game that delivers a sandbox that's as insane as it is unwieldy and dastardly sinister fun.\nRecommended, but not recommended for those who aren't a huge fan of social/sandbox-only games.\n\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","February 12","true","7.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The link is manyland.com (I usually play the web version, but if you love this game, feel free to help support it on steam!)\n\nThis is simply put; the BEST game I have ever played.\n\nManyland is an innovative game which allows players to create their own blocks. There are a variety of blocks you can create, and the only limit to what you can make is your imagination!\n\nHere are some examples of types there are:\n\nBody - Bodies can be used to create your skin. With custom animations, I'm able to be anything I want to be. You can make a skin as a baseball player, a girl with a dress, or even a dinosaur!\n\nDynamics - Dynamics are used to animate blocks frame-by-frame. You can use this to make cool animated objects - and much more! If you took the time, you could create a puppy to follow you around!\n\nInteractings - I use this type the most. With interactings, you can create your own games with special commands! If you want a player to get wood for cutting down a tree, you can do it! If you want to make an XP system to keep track of a player's level, you can do it! Interactings make many things possible.\n\nSolids & Backs - Do you just want to make a simple house, with windows? Just take another player's blocks, or create your own! You can custom-design wood for the walls, and create a log-cabin like style for your house's backgrounds! Add chairs, flowers, and windows to spice up your design.\n\n***\nSince all the blocks are drawn pixel-by-pixel, you don't have to worry about pre-sets. Everything in this game is hand drawn!\n\nPhillip is a very active and supportive developer which will frequently update and will help assist with most of your troubles. There are many friendly people in the community, and you can make a ton of friends.\n\n- Savant.\n(If you see me on Manyland, stop by and say hi to me! c:)","March 21","true","53.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Everything you see is customizable:\nYou may draw clothes, create mounts, guns, build houses, cities and even make your own robot... Using a simple programming language you may create a chat bot, or even an NPC for a mini game your designing. That's right, you may create your own mini game. It sure takes time, but that is entirely possible. And again, everything in the world is user made, the world itself is made of players' buildings.\n\nYou may try it for free before purchasing the game, check the end of the review for the link.\n\nNow let's talk about the gameplay\nLike I said earlier, your only goal is to create things, if you don't feel like using your creativity, just skip it, you're going to make use of your skills and draw stuff, show other people your creations, meet people, make friends, get mad at some, and repeat...\n\nWhen I said everything is costumizable I meant it, you draw what you're wearing with no restrictions, there isn't any control system, you may be offensive (and face your consequences later) because what you draw is what you get, it doesn't need to be accepted by the moderation team.\n\nIf you've seen some art like blocks, mounts, music, or even robots that other people made and you would like to have it in your place, just drag it to your collection! Nothing will stop you from making the most awesome buildings, even if this means using other people's art!\n\nControls\nControls are easy to get used to... it may be annoying when you're done chatting, because you need to hold w/a/s/d for a bit if you wish to move, otherwise you'll continue chatting as there is no chat window: when you're typing something, people can see what you're typing before you press send, so you may show them how fast you type :p\n\n\nChatting\nAgain, there are no restrictions, If you're over 13 and mature enough, you may experience several different kinds of converstation. I may say most of the players are those Redditors and 9gag guys, so expect dank memes all the time.\n\nGraphics\nThey're just ok, let's be honest, it's a 2d game, the art you're seeing is user created, it's not fantastic, but isn't ugly either. Sometimes you'll be amazed, sometimes it's nothing that you've never seen.\n\n\nPros+ Great variety of stuff\n+ Lots of costumization!\n+ Full sandbox experience\n+ Ok controls\n+ Ok community, depending on the areas you're visiting\n+ Cute OST, and background sounds\n+ You may do and build anything you want, there are almost no limits\n+ Nice art if you're into pixelized games\n+ Enjoyable experience, great to kill some time and have a nice conversation with a couple fellas.\n+ You may play it for free, thus the multiplayer isn't dead, you'll always find like 1k players online\n+ The object type "interaction" (a type of object you may create) allows you to make really awesome things, such as a talk bot, castlevania-ish levels, and many other mini games, adventures etc.\n\nOriginally posted by developer:The Interacting type lets you create dynamic livings or things of any sort! They can speak lines, accept things and give back in return, and have a bit of mind of their own!\nCons+ Ugly User Interface\n+ Every word is capitalized, just pretend people aren't screaming :p\n+ There are some vital features missing. For instance, if you draw a wearable item, you may not reposition it, you'll need to re-draw it again. The same doesn't happen to mounts, fortunately. - You actually can! Hold ctrl key and you can reposition it with the arrow keys, Thanks dev for clearing that out :)\n+ I think there should actually be a chat button, I like the idea of others seeing what you're typing, but it wouldn't hurt if you had to press enter to start typing. It makes wasd moving annoying.\n\nFinal thoughtsThe game is great if you're into social games and sandboxes. Have you played Habbo Hotel? I think I could say they're both the same genre, only you don't have to spend in real life money to get cool stuff.\nIf you're into sandboxes and feeling like drawing some pixel art, just get it. If you don't think it's your genre, you might be right, but better yet, why don't you see for yourself? You may play it for free here [manyland.com]. If you like it, I'm sure you'll pick it up :)","January 23","true","10.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordicco/recommended/342280/","lordicco","Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordicco/","203 products in account","Welcome to Manyland!\n\nI'll try to keep this short and sweet.\n\nMaryland is a cute little browser and Steam app game where you and your friends can meet up, build, roleplay, play games, and whatever else you can possibly imagine!\n\nI have quite a few more hours put into the browser version when a friend told me about Manyland originally. I personally like the ability to log in from your tablet, phone, browser, and have it pop up no issue. What I do wish about Manyland is the ability to log into your Steam account from browser, so I could do the exact same thing, pick it up wherever I may be, without needing to be specifically at my desktop to log in progress and hours for the Steam edition. There's almost no difference, other than the lack of small few second advertisements during loading a zone, and the fact that you're helping out these developers.\n\nOne thing I absolutely love is the fact that you can just drop in and without an account, can still interact, play, collect, etc. So I can send a non-Manyland playing friend a link to a world where I've built, and they can see it! That's so awesome. I've yet to interact with anybody apart from my own friends I've sent my world link to, so I can't comment on the community too much. Despite the "no dating" signs everywhere, the main area you spawn in, does feel a bit like 12 year olds trying to hook up.\n\nThere is a bit of alt-tabbing or browser tab-opening where you sit there (in my experience) trying to figure things out. There is a help town, but I wasn't placed there to start. There is an outer and inner ring, the difference, I'm still unsure of, but supposedly there's no features taken from you no matter your rank. You rank up by placing/deleting blocks and interacting, so it's a neat concept. Some of the game seems like trial and error, but I personally think that's what adds some fun to it.\n\nMy biggest qualm is that, once leaving main areas, no longer are places coherent and beautifully made, but instead, collected spammed blocks of memes and garbage. It's ashame to get 20 feet from the spawn, to be surrounded by Doge and Snoop Dogg gifs. If that doesn't bother you, and you can look past it for the cute little casual game beneath it, go for it. Just open your browser, you've got nothing to lose to try it out! My other qualm is finding worlds that are quality and innovative. I've seen some that I really enjoy, but I can count them on one hand. I hope to see some high quality worlds in the future. Or an easier way to find them.\n\nThere is a search in-game, but it seems to be done mostly by popularity, and popularity means cloneable bodies, blocks, etc. for you to collect! So that doesn't necessarily mean you'll get an action adventure game when you're looking for action adventure. Manyunity.com seems to weed out some of this confusion, but it's still hit or miss. Maybe I'm too picky.\n\nRight now I've spent a good 20 hours just running around, collecting assets and building freely, figuring out lighting. In time, I plan on making my own blocks. I've made my first body today, and that was very fun!\n\nManyland doesn't rely on you being creative in terms of artistic skill. If you lack that, some people are sweet enough to allow you to copy things into your inventory and build with them! All items are player-made, pixel by pixel, and a simple right click will show you who made the original block, as well as who placed or deleted it, so art theft should not be an issue unless copied pixel by pixel.\n\nAnyway, short list:\n\nPROS\n-Browser version can log in from phone, tablet, PC, without the requirement of creating an account. (Although logging in will save your items to and from these!)\n-You can simply send a link to someone on any device and they can jump right in, Manyland-user or not!\n-Wonderful to see an active community.\n-Every block/body/pet/etc. is player-made, pixel by pixel!\n-Very well monitored and you'd expect to see a whole big phallic world, but nope! Not a single phallic object in sight.\n-Able to place blocks made by other players (if they've given the rights to), so you don't need to be artistically inclined to play!\n-Able to "snapshot" areas and teleport back to them later!\n-Add your friends if they have an account and teleport to them! (Also free to make your location invisible.)\n-World permissions for editing/building.\n\nCONS\n-Community seems to be geared towards the dating scene, despite various signs everywhere that this is against ToS.\n-Have not seen anything questionable, including language. No bullying as of this post.\n-Spam, memes, etc trashed around the place in spam areas. World-wipes would feel unfair to those who have built with meaning, but the accumulation of spam, memes, unfinished work, half-deleted areas, etc. gives off a very littered feeling.\n-Most worlds I've entered are unfinished, or "littered"-feeling. I can only count on one hand the worlds I truly love at this moment.\n\nIt's a sweet little game to sink some hours into, and there's tons to explore. Hope to see some really creative content soon!","January 23","true","38.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The amount of designs can be counted in the thousands. With these, you can build your very own world.\n\nThe editor for designing items and objects is very easy-to-use and fluid, including features such as RGB and supports hexadecimal color codes for specific tones. Each type of creation has limits to how high and wide you can create it, however. When you've created something or you've found a creation you would like to put down, the simplicity and fluidity of placing these creations are very apparant and there's nothing complex about it.\n\nThe community are very polite and I have not come across any sour players yet. Simply sitting in the main hub world can find you meeting new people and having fun with the vast amount of items and bodies already created.\n\nI feel the need to also add that the servers are hosted in the United States (as far as I know), however latency is not really a problem at all.\n\nI recommend Manyland for all of these reasons, as well as the unbelievable possibility for countless future creations and interesting worlds. The only real reason to buy on Steam is to play ad-free, however it also comes with 100 free Boosts (visual and cosmetic effects that don't always last longer than 10-20 seconds). Other than that, going to the website itself and giving the game a try is not too bad of an idea. :)","December 19, 2015","true","0.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

People were very friendly and always tried to help me out when I was new to the game and lost.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this game is that you can try out new game theories and game designs you might have planned, and immediately deploy it for testing as people in the game at any time can visit your "game area", this makes it possible to try out new game design ideas LIVE, how many places can you do that?\n\nYou can even to a certain degree - code your own game elements if you don't find the existing game blocks to your satisfaction, there's even some Java script blocks were you can code your own spectacular special effects to add to your game, with the game engine already provided for you - this is an excellent way to try out your javascript stuff and let other people parttake and appreciate your work instantly.\n\nThere's a solid sense of community in Manyland, people often get to know each other very closely - young and old, but older people tend to stick to older people while the younger generation plays in their own worlds, sometimes when some great graphics artist come along to play in Manyland - everyone, either young or old can appreciate the work and go exploring trough awesome artwork from all over the world.\n\nThere are many community events in Manyland, mostly just created by the community members themselves - this could be weekly or monthly competitions where the prizes are basically just the honor and/or a pixel-pocal ornament with your name on it - maybe you'll get a place in the hall of honors?\n\nEven events similar to the Oscars have been held in Manyland (Called Moscars) where community members who have taken their free time to help newbies and other players, maybe done some outstanding service to the community get voted on by the community itself - everyone is free to parttake, at Manylands events - everyone is invited.\n\nTry it today, but beware - you might never return to the old reality again!","February 14","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And so far seeing the same issues most open games like this has. The game it self has no way to connect with other players that is easy to find. The board system to leave messages can be confusing and easy to miss if you just jump straight into the game. And there is no out side forums or reporting its all in game. And being that there is rampant abuse with people putting dongs and such up its not a place to be lacking info on reporting.\nNot saying its there just its hard to find wich leads into another problem nothing is easy to find info on in game and it has alot of convolted ways of putting out info. Games like trove make you do a tutorial with the basics laid out before you even step into the main game here they throw you into a welcome area with 20 other players and no help. and being theres 8 different welcome areas it is confusing. When using the game thrue steam you miss out on the basic info like how to do auto filling, had to find that in wiki. They got the info laid out if you use the browser version and just multi tab but it needs to be tied into the steam version in some way to. As it stands rite now can't recommend this game to most till they work out a better interface for the basics and clean up some of the welcome areas with the softcore porn put in some of the areas.\n\nEdit: After playing a while still think this game needs more work on it before it was released on steam. It comes with problems like legacy issues were some been playing for years already so main areas are spammed with junk so no place to build. Controls are still confusing and nothing on how to use the item editor got to youtube most info. And developer is gaming steam reviews by giving out keys to people and pushing people to change their negative review.","January 13","false","92.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","2"
