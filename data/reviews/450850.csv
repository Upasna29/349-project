I don't care for the graphical style, the animations are terrible, the controls are clunky and the game just isn't much fun. The game mechanics may improve, and if you like voxel and TD games this might be a game for you, but I'm not a fan.","March 30","false","5.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It was really funny.\nI think this game can be great, realizing my mistakes trought gameplay was fun.\nThe graphics bother me a little, but, nice tower defense game.","June 3","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know I'd do it again if I didn't feel like going to work in the morning. 1/1237","March 30","false","3.8"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","32","7","22","6","0"
