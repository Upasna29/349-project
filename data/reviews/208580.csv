"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GruesPrey/recommended/208580/","GruesPrey","GruesPrey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GruesPrey/","252 products in account","Ah, KOTOR II. Where to start? First, download The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod. I state this because the standard game is highly unpolished, is missing a lot of extra dialogue and has many bugs that will frustrate anybody, whether they are new to Star Wars or loved the first KOTOR.\n\nThis game shows mechanics that would later be implemented into Mass Effect. A definite meter to determine morality, the breaking down of gear into components (or "omni-gel" for you Spectres), combat that can be paused while issuing commands to you and your squad along with a focus on dialogue options between NPCs and your companions. Your choices in these dialogues could allow you to avoid a combat situation, help progress a quest, or give more information on your companions or your surroundings.\n\nThose familiar with some Star Wars lore (such as the movies or KOTOR I) are probably aware of the black-and-white morality shown. For example, KOTOR I gives you a situation where a woman is attempting to sell a hunters trophy belonging to her late husband. You can either buy the trophy from her (the light option), or convince the woman using the Force to give you the item (the dark option). KOTOR II blurs morality into tones of grey, where the Jedi are not seen entirely as the paragon of all that is good and where the ultimate "light" option is not always perceived as the most prudent one.\n\nPart of this blurring of the lines is due to Kreia, one of the companions accompanying you, the Jedi Exile. A mysterious woman whose becomes more cryptic with every word, her musings and personality have convinced me she is one of the most fleshed-out and well written characters in video game history. The strange thing is, not many of the other characters seem as interesting as Kreia in comparison. Actually, I'm somewhat wrong; HK-47 is a great companion as well. His mannerisms about murder, his copies and his past are worth listening to if you want to chuckle. Atton is somewhat interesting wisecracking pilot and the remaining characters aren't worth writing home about. They're not bad characters, just not great ones.\n\nI'm going to stop this review now before I type spoilers and just tell you to play it. If you enjoyed Mass Effect, if you played KOTOR 1, if you enjoy learning about the lore of Star Wars, or if you need an RPG fix sorted out, KOTOR II is a great option. Just make sure to get the Restored Content Mod. It's really necessary to have a good experience.","November 25, 2013","true","57.5"," 945 of 980 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","945","980","0","5"

There is no great revelation, no great secret. There is only you."\n\nThat is the culmination of Obsidian's Knights of the Old Republic II, a game which flips the entire Star Wars universe on its head via deep character interactions and a unique spin on established aspects of the franchise.\n\nMake no mistake - the original release of KOTOR II was a flawed, incomplete mess. Not only was it missing a large chunk of its ending (notably, what happened to the player's squadmates when they landed on the final planet), but it was buggy and prone to all sorts of glitches. Yet, despite all that, the game still remains a classic of the RPG genre for how often it defies standard conventions and plays with the series' established tropes.\n\nYou play the Exile, a former commander who committed a terrible sin to stop the Mandalorian Wars, and was exiled from the Jedi Order because of it. The game begins with the Exile waking up onboard the Peragus mining facility, alongside T3-M4 (a returning character from the first game) and an enigmatic woman named Kreia, who knows more than she lets on. Together with sprung prisoner (and ace pilot) Atton Rand, the quartet escapes the facility and discover that the Jedi have been driven to near-extinction. With the help of a cast of supporting squadmates, including a former Sith protegee named Visas, the fun-loving (well, as fun as a homicidal robot can be) assassin droid HK-47, a bounty hunter, the leader of the Mandalores and more, the Exile sets out to stop the Sith and rebuild the Jedi Order.\n\nThe biggest difference between this and KOTOR I is how linear this game is. Not that it diminishes the plot at all, but there's a definite rhythm to the way you approach areas and plot situations. Whereas the original game's only real goal was to activate the four pillars to find out the location of the Star Forge before assaulting it, II has you either aiding or working against a planet's internal war, taking part in a trial to exonerate a wrongfully-accused civilian, taking apart a crime syndicate and more. The plot is a lot tighter and focused than its predecessor.\n\nThe cast of characters is where the game really shines, though. Aside from Kreia (an enigmatic woman who stresses being neutral in all decisions), every character has some backstory that requires trust and increasing the "Force Bond" with them to access. I truly liked that you could upgrade various aspects of your teammates' abilities by either talking to them a lot or helping them with certain decisions.\n\nIt's pretty much a given that if you're going to play KOTOR II, you need the Restored Content Mod. Not only does it restore the bulk of the ending which was scrapped by Obsidian in their rush to finish the game for a Christmas deadline, but it also fixes a lot of the bugs and underlying coding issues found throughout the game. I used it the first time I played the game, and I can't imagine going without it. In the same vein, the M4-78 Enhancement Project fills in an unfinished questline and gives some great upgrades to your droid party members, along with some awesome consequences later in the game - I was so pumped to see the droid army helping me during a later encounter.\n\nIt's not all perfect, though. While the crafting system is very good (and has shades of Mass Effect, which came out three years later), it's far too easy to be stuck with a large amount of components and weapons that are unusable, and there's never any real need to upgrade your gear beyond a handful of weapons.\n\nLikewise, the ending (even with the Restored Content Mod) is a huge slog. There's a mid-mission quest with a robotic remote, which you are forced into, which is impossible to complete if you didn't clear out all the enemies from the map just prior to starting it. Likewise, the final fortress is a huge slog and is only passable through spamming Force powers or avoiding the majority of enemies.\n\nThat said, KOTOR II is well worth your time and money. The way it turns many of the elements of the Star Wars universe on its head and keeps up the energy and characterization through its runtime is still near-unmatched in this day and age, and I heartily recommend that every RPG fan check this game out at least once.","October 8, 2014","true","39.9"," 271 of 287 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","271","287","7","4"

This sequel was released in 2004 and is still a great game and remains extremely playable today. Even though Bioware developed the first KOTOR, they ended up handing the job over to Obsidian who, as always, did a fantastic job with their work.\n\nThe use of KOTOR II's Light Side/Dark Side system is a lot like the modern day systems of good/evil characters. When you as the  character does or says evil things then you grow more in tune with the dark side of the force. The contrast to this is of course, doing good deeds and saying not-so-evil stuff. This leads to the Light side of the force. In either case you will grow more powerful and influence those you travel with. This will also effect your force powers amongst many other things...\n\nThe Story\nThe single defining feature of KOTOR or KOTOR II is the story. Anyone who loves Star Wars must love a good mythos from the Star Wars world, especially one this early in the timeline of the Star Wars Universe.\nThis sequel begins when a stranger, oblivious to his past, wakes up in a Mining Station medical bay, only to notice no one is around. No one...except a mysterious elderly woman. Journey to several planets and cause havok or create order. Kill the weak or defend them. All the while, you search for the power to make you a Master of the Force.\n\nPros:\n- Great main storyline with various other mini-quests, all which act in canon with the Star Wars universe.\n- Open world that you would expect from an RPG\n- Choose what you say to someone carefully; You could end up in a fight or effect the story.\n- Choose light or dark side; Your actions will decide what you become.\n- Tons of lore from the Star Wars universe you can't find anywhere else!!\n\nCons:\n- Graphics are from the first Xbox generation, but it still holds today.\n- Some of the voice overs for alien species are simply repeated recordings on loop.\n- Occasionally, a glitch or two might happen\n- RARELY, but sometimes there are game breaking bugs. There are only two that I know of, and one of them ruined my first game. This requires the double save slow technique.\n\nVerdict? - 8.5/10 This is my favorite Star Wars game hands down. Many people also recognize this particular game to be LucasArts' crowing achievement. Obsidian does a great job with the sequel to Bioware's KOTOR and does Star Wars in general great justice.","June 3, 2015","true","27.0"," 240 of 254 people (94%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","94","240","254","14","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AuthorReborn/recommended/208580/","AuthorReborn","johnzavethefirst","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AuthorReborn/","48 products in account","You know, this game catches a lot of flack in comparision to the first KOTOR, which is widely heralded as a masterpiece of gaming. Flack which is well deserved, yet easily rectified. The main quarell most gamers hold to this particular game is that IT WASN'T RELEASED IN THE FULL AND COMPLETE FORM AND THAT THE STORY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.\nWhile there is some merit to this claim, you truly need to gaze deeper to fully understand this game. The game was fully intended to be just as perfect as its predecesor. However, Obsidian, the company in charge of the project was forced to play their hand before they were ready to release. The result was a patchwork project that can make a coherent game, and one that stands alone as one of my all time favorites. Was the game released in a complete form? Hell no. Can this be fixed? Now we're talking.\n\nYou see, others feel the same way as I do about this game. It *is* and excellent game and all it needs is a bit of dedication and elbow grease to get it to shine. A determined group of modders recovered numberable files that were scraped from the final release of the game and constructed a mod that fitted these files into the game. Lost items, recorded dislouge, and even an entire planet were restored and reborn through the crucible of modding. This mod is compatible with the Steam version of this game and I highly recommend you install it (http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/398-tslrcm-183/), as well as the sister mod which restores the droid planet M4-78 (http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/399-m4-78ep-patched/). Outside of these two mods, there are multiple others I recommend you try as they improve the overall game experience. The mods are now availible through the Steam workshop, but I'll just leave these links here anyway.\n\nBut about the game itself, unmodded, and purchased from Steam without the addition of a single moddification. This game is spectacular. Don't let my measly hours of play depicted by Steam deceive you, I played this game extensively on the original X-Box when the game first came out and I still have the disk to this day (although, admittedly, it is a bit worse for the wear at this point). Despite the cries and whines of the gaming community, this game is entirely playable without the restoration of lost elements. It simply takes a bit of digging into the story. On the XBOX version and as a child, I was able to understand the entirety of the story of the game quite easily. You might have to play through multiple times and see each coversation from a different angle, but you can do it. It's not the jagged mess many make it out to be. Inferences and an active imagination may be required to fill the gaps, however. Get ready to think and make connections between different characters and events. Just use your noggin and you'll be fine.\n\nHere's where I believe the true root of the problem is: people approach this game thinking that it will be a fun little game they can just jaunt through casually and there will be an exciting adventure story to acompany it. Spoilers: it's not. This game is exponentially darker than the original KOTOR, heck, three of the planets you explore are inhabited only by corpses by the time you arrive. This game was intended to have you question your morals, in fact, there are some parts where no matter which choice you make, dark or light, you are doing something terrible. It was intended to bring to light that in a conflict, there is no middle ground to take, but rather, by doing nothing you hurt one side and allow the other to  gain a leg up and by doing something, no matter the action, the end result is the same. You are full of all the powers of the Force, and yet, you are powerless. And when you can finally change the outcomes of events, the freedom is glorious and all the more worthwhile.\nWell, that was the intent, anyway.\nPortions on missing, so patches of this beautiful quilt of morality are missing. But the game is still supurb and well worth every hour I've logged. Go ahead, buy it, play with an open mind, mod it, and explore. And may the Force be with you.","December 26, 2014","true","73.7"," 133 of 137 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","133","137","3","0"

Why? Because the idea behind KOTOR 2 is to take all of the black and white in Star Wars, then break it down so you see past the blinded Jedi council and ambitious Sith. It's not your standard Star Wars movie.\n\nThe game turns Lucas' pure good/pure evil fantasy into moral playground that makes you question the very existence of the Force and the people who use it. That being said, though, this is an absolutely fantastic game for any cRPG/WRPG fan. It sticks by the standard D&D rules, just like the first game, but adds more feats, force powers, and items. However, after a certain point, the game gets extremely easy, especially if you have half an idea of what you're doing.\n\nUnlike the first game, it doesn't have a major twist (the biggest twist is a backstory for one of your companions), but instead slowly provides hints to the major plot. The game's setting is pretty dark, too. The universe is in disarray, and really feels like it. Settlements are run down, there's ruins on places that were bright in the previous game, and the Jedi order is nearly extinct. However, along the journey you run into several party members with interesting personalities and troublesome backstories. If you were expect any form of romance, it's not here. There's subtle hints, but no official romance options (which I really enjoy). That said, I suggest playing as a male simply due to the fact you get Handmaiden, who is a far more interesting character than the Disciple.\n\nOverall the story and setting make a very immersive game that will keep your attention, as long as you can force your way through the first two planets. The combat starts off fairly difficult, but becomes a breeze once you get going, then turns into EZ mode.

Then two things happened: 1. LA were greedy and patientless enough to demand the game be done by Christmas 2004; and 2. Obsidian were optimistic/desperate enough to agree to these terms without even seeing the first game. The end result was a glitchy half-cut but potentially great game.\n\nI used to hate it and left after ~5-8 hours into the first playthrough. It seemed boring and I got stuck on the very first planet… but then it got a new life on Steam, with high-res support, achievements, and the Cut Content mod already on Workshops. And I loved it. KOTOR 2 is worthy of the first game, adding a little more ambiguity to the classic light/dark dichotomy, and offering more action and independence to playable characters than the first game. The Exile story is probably not so personally dramatic as the one of the first game, but it's just different and delivers no less.","November 10, 2015","true","44.0"," 120 of 127 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","120","127","12","3"

It's old but it's amazing.\nI owned SWKOTOR 1 before I even knew steam existed. I loved it. When I saw SWKOTOR 2 years ago on steam I bought it so quick I didnt care at all the price.I honestly believe it was very well worth it. Now that it has steam workshop enabled I'd imagine it'll shine a bit more. But I'd gladly replay multiple time. I've heard it was riddled with bugs by some people but when I played it wasn't that bad at all. Honestly no matter what anyone says good or bad get the game anyway it's well worth it. There is a mod to change many things and make it how the developers wanted it to be however which I find amazing. I love RPG's and this one is by far one of my favorites. Even without any mods I rather enjoy it greatly. Although  I heard the restored content mod is extremely worth it and makes this game 100x better.

And why exactly would I say something?\n\nBioWare make great games, but their stories and lores are divided into good and bad. It's simple, faithful and hence; unrealistic. A deluded fairy-tale, trying to simplify fiction, so people who delude themselves in real life know what they up for, so they're not overchallenged by nuances.\n\nObsidian, on the other hand, did with The Sith Lords what they did with Fallout New Vegas; they put everything on a higher meta-level. They included realism in form of blurring the line of what is good and what is not, making it uneasy to decide between sides. Kreia is one of those prime examples, just by including her as an important character. I don't want to spoil anything, but you'll know what I mean when you play it. Those things are what makes this game far superior to the Bioware equivalent.\n\nObsidian are the best RPG makers, then, and especially now.","July 22, 2015","true","7.9"," 221 of 279 people (79%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","79","221","279","20","3"

As the Republic lies in shambles five years after the Dark Wars, a former Jedi who lost his connection to the force is pursued by a trio of dark jedi masters who roam the galaxy, seeking its destruction.\n\nPros: Darker story than the first Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic game with a lot of shades of grey. Alligning yourself with the light side of the force may cause death, while other times the dark side of the force may save innocent lives, and seeing the consequences of your actions makes much more of a moral struggle to determine what really is the right thing to do. You get to spend time and train some of your companions into jedi, and yourself get to upgrade your jedi class with a new selection of 3 jedi master classes. Crafting has also been enhanced, adding among other things the ability to disassemble existing items into parts and chemicals. There also are many winks to locations or characters from the previous game, without actually needing to have played it to understand everything.\n\nCons: As with the previous game, the graphics didn’t age too well (although the full-resolution update helped), and unfamiliarity with tabletop RPGs and the D20 system might confuse many who try to understand and optimize their character’s equipment. The game has multiple bugs due to problems in the development, making the story somewhat hard to follow: A cut scene might pop in but the playthrough that lead to that scene was missing, or maybe you were in your ship flying to a destination and the game suddenly jump to your cockpit with your ship having landed on a unknown planet you’re unsure how you got there.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next of your list!\n\nThis is a darker game using the same mechanics as the previous one. The bugs aren’t game breaking, and can be easily fixed with a Mod in the Steam Workshop. If you didn’t like the prequel, you won’t like this one either. But otherwise, I definitively recommend it!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","November 17, 2014","true","137.0"," 91 of 98 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","91","98","3","0"

It introduced advanced upgrading; a more fleshed out and expanded story; more force abilities and early game choices/customisations; and allies that you could get to know, gain influence with, and overal interact with, with much more depth.\nFrom the get go, you're flung into a mystery as you find your character recovering from being held within an abandoned mining facility. I won't spoil the story for you, but I will say that it it never gives in - also raising new questions, and spawning many branches which act not only as side missions, but also to add more detail to the main story.\nIn KOTOR2, you start the game as a jedi, as opposed to becoming one later in the game. There are more force options, and more feats that make each of the 3 classes really distinct. This, combined with the game's element of choice, and a light/darkside meter, you will find it is a unique experience for each player.\n\nSo, for those who enjoyed the original KOTOR, this game will serve as both an extension to the story, and the means to get back into this amazing experience.\nFor new players, however, this game will still be blast to play. It features an easy to understand character creator, and a solid tutorial in the beginning. I would recommend playing the original KOTOR first though, to really understand both the gameplay; and more importantly, the story.\n\nKotor 2 is a fantastic game, and one played through many times. Each experience is unique, and the characters and story are really engaging.\n\n\n*Also, on a side note. I recommend a mod called 'The Restored Content Mod', which will increase the amount of content in the game, as well as adding some 'lost' content that wasn't in the original game. It also fixes a bunch of bugs that really plague this game, due to it being released premature.","November 25, 2013","true","88.6"," 107 of 122 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","107","122","0","0"

The guys at Obsidian have managed to create a game that feels like Star Wars without any of the clichés associated with it. Where the first installment had a whiny Han Solo, a force using Leia and Chewie as carbon copies of their originals, this game puts multiple twists on most stereotypical Star Wars characters, fleshing them out so much more. Hell, even though all a certain Astromech droid "says" is random beeps, you know exactly what he wants to tell you, without anyone going "What's that, Lassie? There's  boy trapped in the well?". It's just that amazing.\nOn top of it all the game features the best wirtten female character in any video game ever, but it's hard to praise the writing without spoiling the story, so I might as well stop now. Just so much: The game covers a multitude of philosophical questions, especially when reading between the lines, so you should be prepared to think while playing.\n\nThe graphics are dated, RTwP combat with DnD rules isn't everyone's thing but the same thing can be said for Planescape:Torment and it still is widely regarded as a (the?) classic RPG.\n\nThings of note if you have played the predecessor:\nWhile the graphics, animations and UI have remained pretty much on the same level when compared to KotOR 1, the characters' build diversity has been greatly increased, making things like a gun wielding Jedi viable options.\nThe combat itself hasn't changed much, except for a few extra skills and powers or new enemies, of course.\nLoot is now randomly distributed and modding items as well as crafting them have been greatly expanded.\n\nThe story itself covers quite a few events that happened before KoTOR 1, although the game itself is set later. Due to this, I'd recommend playing the predecessor first (especially since its big twist would otherwise be spoilered). Otherwise, you might get lost, concerning the order in which things happened.\n\nAs so many others have already stated, the game's main issue is the fact that it's unfinished and unpolished but this can largely be fixed by downloading and installing the TSLRCM, a brilliant modification which restores a lot of cut content to the game, such as the great droid factory.","December 13, 2013","true","29.3"," 75 of 84 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","75","84","0","5"

A child.” - Kreia\n\nFive years after the events of KOTOR, the galaxy is recovering from the events from the Jedi Civil War. Both the Jedi and Sith have now fallen silent. You have been exiled from the Jedi Order as punishment for following Revan into war against the Mandolorians. You have also been completely cut off from the Force, but was this a part of your punishment, or the result of something much worse?\n\nThis review is written from a huge Star Wars fan and a fan of story driven RPGs in general.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND DESIGNIn terms of general gameplay and structure, KOTOR 2 is designed very similarly to the first game. It features the same turn-based D20 based combat system and character building as the first game and other old-school RPGs. This can be a quite daunting system to learn for those unfamiliar with these types of games, but fortunately the lower difficulty settings are forgiving enough for those without the patience or time to learn it. Combat is important, but arguably not as much as the stat and skill point distribution. Making sure you have characters with the appropriate skills determines being able to deal with obstacles in the world, conversation checks and crafting. The game does feature an automatic leveling up system which will do the leveling for you, which is fine in the late game after you have all the skills you need, but it may be worth doing some research in the early game for leveling up. The companions are all reasonably balanced and they level up with you, meaning that you can take anyone anywhere (at least from a gameplay perspective).\n\nThe game isn’t entirely open world by any means. It’s similar to KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins, in the sense that you travel between several fairly small focused areas rather than one continuous land mass. The areas are either mostly linear action packed levels or slower paced story driven quest hub areas. Crafting is important system to pay attention to as you can craft item modifications to create weapons more powerful than the ones you find. This is a fairly simple system that involves breaking down items you don’t need for materials, but it’s just a case of knowing what the stats actually mean. Of course, on lower difficulties you can get away with not paying much attention to gear and stats and still just about get by spamming the same attacks. You won’t find it very challenging, but more than adequate for just seeing the story (which in my opinion, is the main draw of the game).\n\nSTORY AND NARRATIVEIt’s never easy to develop a follow up on such a beloved game from a different developer, but Obsidian certainly delivered on delivering a sequel that is true to the original and yet unique in its own way. KOTORs story felt very much like a grand space adventure and it captured everything that the classic Star Wars story should be. KOTOR 2 differs from this slightly. It tells a more subtle story with a focus on different themes. In stark contrast to KOTORs overt villains, KOTOR 2s threat is a lot more sinister. The battles with the Sith are fought in the shadows and the themes are a lot darker. An example of the darker tone is a reoccurring idea in the game that to the galaxy’s Average Joe, Jedi and Sith are indistinguishable. They just people with too much power fighting over religion and getting everyone else caught in the middle. This is a really unique and interesting idea and caught me completely off guard. Another good theme was the idea of the absence of the Force and the advantages it has aside from the obvious disadvantages.\n\nThe conversation system is identical to KOTOR, with the standard light and dark alignment options and the opportunities to use skills (if you have the stats) in certain special situations. In my opinion, morality is much more interesting in KOTOR 2 than in the first one. Picking light or dark and sticking to it not only changes the ending, but the entire game. It shifts your characters goals for the whole game and also effects the gameplay. Dark and light side powers become easier/harder (but not impossible) to do if you are the opposite morality and it can result in some rather large deviations on the story line during some quests. It also affects your companions and over time you can even begin to influence their morality (e.g. enlightenment vs corruption). Overall, I’d say the game changes enough to warrant multiple playthroughs with different morality choices.\n\nOn the topic of companions, you can expect yet another colourful crew of heroes, villains, droids and miscreants. They are very varied from the original games selection, but just as interesting and unique. Gameplay wise, they still have classes that need to have their stats properly assigned and equipped with the right gear. However, pretty much any configuration of companions is viable to take anywhere, which is good for the story. It makes it feel like you travel with ALL of your companions rather than just bringing your favourites and leaving everyone else on the ship. Your actions also influence your companions, resulting in them liking or disliking you more depending on how you act. Having them like you opens up more story and has gameplay benefits I can’t elaborate on without light spoilers.\n\nA quick note on voice acting: personally I found a particular companions voice actor laughably bad (look out for the one-armed Iridonian), but he’s really the only one that stands out. The rest of the game is mostly either passable or excellent.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND PERFORMANCEAs is customary with Obsidian games, they are often not given enough time for playtesting and optimisation leaving them somewhat lacking in the performance department. I expect you won’t encounter many problems these days however, as unsurprisingly an 11 year old game runs at 60fps 100% of time and doesn’t look half bad for its age. I did get a crash or two here and there and more than a fair share of bugs, but fortunately nothing game breaking or huge. I didn’t run into any compatibility problems either (running Windows 8.1).\n\nFunnily enough, the game actually got a patch recently that fixed a lot of problems, added controller support, support for higher resolutions and some other fixes. The biggest change was the addition was the addition of Steam Workshop for the game, which allows the seamless installation of some mods that restores a whole bunch of content that was cut from the game. Look up The Sith Lords Restored Content mod if you get the game, but it should be the highest rated anyway.","November 18, 2015","true","58.8"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","37","39","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simsoyzeta/recommended/208580/","simsoyzeta","Slurmp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simsoyzeta/","305 products in account","With the Sith Lords Restored Content Mod in hand, this game becomes more complete than the original ever was. The original game was released far to early, even after Obsidian was promised an extra half year they were forced by LucasArts to ship the game before eveything was properly put into the game. However, most of this content was still left in the code. Brilliantly all the dialogue, cutscenes, levels and interactions that never made it further than code were debugged and added into the game with TSLRCM adding hours upon hours of new content.\n\nThe dialogue choices will make your mouth water. The difference between Bioware and Obsidian dialogue philosophies is this: Bioware believes in the three choices, good, neutral and bad. Obsidian believes in letting you choose many shades of gray, some obvious evil choices but no obvious good; you decide who your character becomes. The depth within your choices really lets you make your character who you want her or him to be.\n\nThe characters are incredible. Lines of dialouge are restored giving them so much depth. Your least favorite character within the game might have dozens of new lines restored making him or her your favorite. The crappy romance options have been restored, fleshed out. Obsidian really shows their strong character writing within this game, each character is intresting, and they all have secrets to tell you... so long as you dedicate yourself to talking with them and earning their favor. As you make choices they will approve of you more or less, so be careful for everything has concequences.\n\nThe combat is the same as it always is. The addition to lightsaber styles and tweaks makes the game more enjoyable than the first, but that is to be expected.\n\nBut be warned: this game is kind of hard to get running on Windows Vista/7/8. Really the only flaw of the game is that its one of the few that doesnt run on modern versions of windows all that well. If you can get this game running I guarnete if you download the mod you'll enjoy this more than the first however.","December 21, 2013","true","31.3"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","40","44","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCitizenErased/recommended/208580/","TheCitizenErased","CitizenErased","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCitizenErased/","112 products in account","Here's another incredibly long recommendation from me :D\nThis game isn't just one of my favorite games of all time - It's also one of the best RPGs I've played and also the first western RPG I've laid eyes on. Lastly, I find it to be much, much, much, muuuch better than the original Knights of the Old Republic from BioWare. It takes the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor and improves upon them to a greater extent. There's no ridiculous level cap from the first game anymore either. Much more open freedom to build your character with the introduction of the Advanced Classes. Lastly, the writing, story and characters are well-rounded and not drenched up in clichés like the first game. Knights of the Old Republic 2 throws the whole Light vs Dark concept into a bin and then dump it on the dark side of the moon.\nIn retrospect - The game basically views the Jedi & Sith from a broader perspective and then concludes "Hey, maybe they aren't so different after all". They both wear morning gowns for a living and carry wide coloured willie exstented swords as a means of defense or offense. Essentially, there is no good or evil in this game, just various shades of grey. This philosophy is something one would find in the game's characters, especially the enigmatic woman, Kreia. Most of the characters are incredibly complex, even the Han Solo-esque ones have a dark secret hiding in the closet. There's no suave, secret, paragon of the universe response that will unlock their hidden feelings and open up to you. There's an interesting approval system, which I do consider a bit flawed but in terms of role-playing, it works. Once you've finally gotten to the heart of their character you'll unlock new abilities for the said characters. The best part: Even when you've gotten that far it still feels like you don't quite know everything there is to know about these characters.\n\nI think it is best if I sum up the plot now -- The game takes place a few years after the events of the first game. In classic Star Wars tradition, the Republic is on the verge of collapse alongside the Jedi... AGAIN. There are some tropes that Star Wars can never truly escape from I suppose. You play as an exiled Jedi... Knight? Master? Janitor? Whatever, the game is kinda vague about your previous ranking within the order - You've just returned to the known galaxy and thus missed out on the party of the first game -- I suppose this makes sense given that Star Wars doesn't seem to be restricted to one galaxy, but how the Exile have managed to NOT hear about the whole escapade in the first game is beyond me.. Guess she spent her time in a cave or a remote planet or something, ala Ben Kenobi. For some reason you find yourself onboard the ship of the Ebon Hawke, which people who've played the first game will recognize, and it has been badly damaged, explains a questionably-soothingly-female-voiced-sentient-AI as the tutorial begins. You have the option of skipping this tutorial but it's probably best not to do it since it'll give you a better idea of what is going on and foreshadow danger to come. Not too long after your Exiled Jedi wakes up from her/his comatose sleep onboard an eerie space mining facility called Peragus. The whole place is mysteriously abandoned, and one of the only survivors seems to be an old woman named, Kreia. Like I mentioned she's an enigma and she seems to know a lot about you and the Force, so the next course of action is to figure out what has happened and get off the station. That pretty much sums up the beginning.\n\nOne of the other things I find that Kotor 2 does exceptionally well is that it allows the player to get easily integrated with the character of the Exile, despite her having an established background -- The well structured dialogue assignment paves way for role-playing a character who doesn't have a clue, as well as someone who's already familiar with the events of the first game. In addition to that - There's also the subtle choice of gender for the previous protagonist and selected occurences of the first game, without the use of an import system, in conversation with one of the characters. A smart way to build to connect both stories together as there'll be plenty of references.\n\nSo, I've talked a bit about what to expect from the characters, the story and gameplay -- Now I'd like to sum up some of the central themes. The game doesn't present itself as the "Save the world from the ancient evil" type of story. Instead, it sets itself up more as a personal story, about your protagonist and your followers. Every time you exit and enter your ship you'll usually find the party bantering with each other, alluding to a dark secret they are hiding or what have you. This is also brought to light in some of the story cutscenes, where Kreia will downright intimidate your crew by exposing their darkest secrets and have it consume them... Why? Because of The Exile. The Exile is unlike any Jedi or Sith and not because she drew the shortest stick, but because she did something in her past that none other could have done. Something that litterally draws the followers and Kreia alike, to the Exile, but one would have to play the game to understand. Most of the story is a lesson to the protagonist, and the player -- About the ideas of morality, and how being a nice & benevolent saint might not always be the right thing to do; Least of all being cruel and despicable. Relying heavily on the Force is brought up as a sign of weakness, and that true strength comes from not needing it. All of this is dictated through the enemies you fight, the choices you make, the characters you meet and certainly through the character of Kreia. It's a story of self-realization, different shades of morality, confronting the past and become stronger for it. Knights of the Old Republic 2 gets a strong recommendation from me, simply for being unlike any other Star Wars game and with the Restoration Mod -- A much better game than BioWare's original Knights of the Old Republic! :)","December 27, 2013","true","29.7"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","1"

It does have a few problems like glitches, weird twiching, and skipping cutscenes. However, I feel the gameplay pays for the glitchiness. Plus the glitches are sometimes hilarious. This game is also extremely long. Compared to some of today's games, this is like a 5 game trilogy all in one package of fun. They don't make games like these anymore. This game is great and lasts ages. This game is really good for something that came out in 2005. This game has great text-tree conversations too. While you can't even compare this to Telltales' dialogs, it is certainly much cheaper and provides much more time to enjoy the game. You can finish Telltale's episodes within 30 minutes. After that you wait another month for the next episode. I would say money wise, this is one of the best things you can buy on Steam. These days an hour of gameplay costs $60. This game is relatively cheap and has replay ability. This is definetly a good game for new RPG players. Lots of RPGs are intense and difficult to understand.

So I said to myself that "I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS" and let my physical copy collect dust without much research about it.\n\nIn some steam sale, I felt obligated to buy it again though.. and noticed that legends like Chris Avellone and Feargus Urquhart were responsible for it.

It’s similar to KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins, in the sense that you travel between several fairly small focused areas rather than one continuous land mass. The areas are either mostly linear action packed levels or slower paced story driven quest hub areas. Crafting is important system to pay attention to as you can craft item modifications to create weapons more powerful than the ones you find. This is a fairly simple system that involves breaking down items you don’t need for materials, but it’s just a case of knowing what the stats actually mean. Of course, on lower difficulties you can get away with not paying much attention to gear and stats and still just about get by spamming the same attacks. You won’t find it very challenging, but more than adequate for just seeing the story (which in my opinion, is the main draw of the game).\n\nSTORY AND NARRATIVE\nIt’s never easy to develop a follow up on such a beloved game from a different developer, but Obsidian certainly delivered on delivering a sequel that is true to the original and yet unique in its own way.

It tells a more subtle story with a focus on different themes. In stark contrast to KOTORs overt villains, KOTOR 2s threat is a lot more sinister. The battles with the Sith are fought in the shadows and the themes are a lot darker. An example of the darker tone is a reoccurring idea in the game that to the galaxy’s Average Joe, Jedi and Sith are indistinguishable. They just people with too much power fighting over religion and getting everyone else caught in the middle. This is a really unique and interesting idea and caught me completely off guard. Another good theme was the idea of the absence of the Force and the advantages it has aside from the obvious disadvantages.\n\nThe conversation system is identical to KOTOR, with the standard light and dark alignment options and the opportunities to use skills (if you have the stats) in certain special situations. In my opinion, morality is much more interesting in KOTOR 2 than in the first one. Picking light or dark and sticking to it not only changes the ending, but the entire game. It shifts your characters goals for the whole game and also effects the gameplay. Dark and light side powers become easier/harder (but not impossible) to do if you are the opposite morality and it can result in some rather large deviations on the story line during some quests. It also affects your companions and over time you can even begin to influence their morality (e.g. enlightenment vs corruption). Overall, I’d say the game changes enough to warrant multiple playthroughs with different morality choices.\n\nOn the topic of companions, you can expect yet another colourful crew of heroes, villains, droids and miscreants. They are very varied from the original games selection, but just as interesting and unique. Gameplay wise, they still have classes that need to have their stats properly assigned and equipped with the right gear. However, pretty much any configuration of companions is viable to take anywhere, which is good for the story. It makes it feel like you travel with ALL of your companions rather than just bringing your favourites and leaving everyone else on the ship. Your actions also influence your companions, resulting in them liking or disliking you more depending on how you act. Having them like you opens up more story and has gameplay benefits I can’t elaborate on without light spoilers.\n\nA quick note on voice acting: personally I found a particular companions voice actor laughably bad (look out for the one-armed Iridonian), but he’s really the only one that stands out. The rest of the game is mostly either passable or excellent.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND PERFORMANCE\nAs is customary with Obsidian games, they are often not given enough time for playtesting and optimisation leaving them somewhat lacking in the performance department. I expect you won’t encounter many problems these days however, as unsurprisingly an 11 year old game runs at 60fps 100% of time and doesn’t look half bad for its age. I did get a crash or two here and there and more than a fair share of bugs, but fortunately nothing game breaking or huge. I didn’t run into any compatibility problems either (running Windows 8.1).\n\nFunnily enough, the game actually got a patch recently that fixed a lot of problems, added controller support, support for higher resolutions and some other fixes. The biggest change was the addition was the addition of Steam Workshop for the game, which allows the seamless installation of some mods that restores a whole bunch of content that was cut from the game. Look up The Sith Lords Restored Content mod if you get the game, but it should be the highest rated anyway.","May 1","true","24.7"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","2"

It was the first real PC RPG that I was going to bite into as a kid, despite having toyed with Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale when they were the 'hot things' to hit the market.  From the first to the fourth disc, I was playing out some of the best scenarios I was convinced could ever have existed in a video game; it certainly helped that it was all being played out in the Star Wars universe, which, to any bright-eyed kid who loved the original trilogy, was something to behold.\nAnd then came KOTOR2.\nAs a bit of a set-up: I never had the chance to play KOTOR2 when it was originally released, but I was there to watch the bile and distaste that most gamers had for it.  Reviews from users on a variety of other gaming sites came in, deriding the story and claiming that it was a vastly inferior title compared to the stellar original.  It was incomplete, people had said: the story was unfinished, and for the most part, the game felt empty and had a plot unfitting for the Star Wars universe.\nThen comes 2014, where I finally had the time to do a bit more reading on the game, including the (now famous) content restoration mod.  I bought the game on sale, installed the mod, fired it up -\n- and was hooked for the next 30 something hours that I had it installed and played.  I loved the game so much, that it promptly was installed on my laptop, just so I could get a few hours in on the go during downtime.  It was fantastic.\nKOTOR2, for those unfamiliar and reading this review in hoping to tip the scales, is a Star Wars game, yes.  It takes place in the Star Wars universe.  It involves jedi, lightsabres, starships, the Sith, light versus darkness - except, not really, particularly the last bit.\nYou see, head writer Chris Avellone never really liked the Star Wars universe - or, parts of it's mythos, anyway.  The Light and Dark sides seemed too binary, too hilariously Machiavellan at turns to really allow him to write the stories he has become so well known for among PC RPG fans (Planescape: Torment being the elephant - or perhaps well-endowed titan - in the room).  He wanted to shake things up, narratively speaking, and it shows: the game is not so simply about the light versus the dark (as, arguably, the original trilogy of films and the first KOTOR are steadfast about), but instead, how such concepts do not work when we apply the idea of secondary belief to the universe at large.  (For some more insight into Avellone's thoughts on the universe, I suggest looking up Super Bunnyhop's interview with the man himself on YouTube).\nThe game features you as the Jedi Exile - a wounded warrior who had returned from the Mandalorian Wars to the Jedi Council, only to be banished (for reasons unknown) and to have their powers stripped from them.  As you awaken on a mining facility, with a case of amnesia and tremendously weakened from the ordeal, you come to realize that something is wrong with the force, and the Sith, no less, are behind it.  You set out on an adventure with a series of unlikely companions to determine just what happened to you, and what this new face of Sith appear to be up to.\nThe companions, a highlight of any BioWare style RPG, but particularly for Obsidian (the designers at the helm, here), feature some fantastic heroes.  Some cliches remain, to ensure you're playing in a game set within the universe you signed up for, of course: there's still the charming rogue who represents the Han Solo of the title, the sassy bounty hunter, the wise and mysterious Jedi Master.  But it's not the same.  Something feels 'off', in the most magnificent way possible as you spend time speaking with these characters.  They're thematically similar, yes, but the way they express and espouse their discomfort with the status quo of the Force and the Universe makes you realize how real humans living in the far corners of the galaxy might actually feel about how things work when you're facing space wizards and death-bent cultists.\nIt doesn't stop at the companions.  KOTOR1 had the bad habit of setting up encounters across its planets in a very blase pattern.  Find planet - fight through corridors - find friendly race - handle problems.  Oh, it's very high adventure and there are several key notes within the campaign.  But that's how it feels and how it ultimately handles for much of it.  KOTOR2 shines in this regard - at least, it does for a limited time, but we'll talk about that later.  One of the largest planets in the game has you splitting up your party, facing enemies alone as your companions in what seems like impossible odds, encountering foes in what you thought were the safest regions of the map, and having traps and battles sprung on you when you honestly least expected it.  There were several times where I found myself popping tinctures and med pacs just to stay alive, staving off death and improving party members in thoughtful ways to defend against some truly interesting scenarios.\nBut then we have the common problem - and the one that you will probably continue to see across all of the reviews that are written here - is that the game is unfinished.  There are far too many elements of it that are clearly missing, stripped down, or otherwise incomplete that make it lesser than the game it starts off (and is, in the perfect world, ideally meant to be).  Those creative scenarios?  They really only happen on one planet (Nar-Shaddah - and, take note, new players: head there first, if you can.)  Companions suddenly 'disappear' from the final encounter with no explanation as to why they are not with you.  Some character history lines seem to just drop dead.  As the game runs out of steam, the following planets ultimately feel a bit one-note and flat (and veer too close to KOTOR1's rather vanilla campaign).  The ending seems to have written itself in a corner and provides too little closure for what the game seems to be setting you up for.  What begins and ends with a bang, closes with a whimper.\nDoes that mean that KOTOR2 is a game not worth your time or money?  Of course not.  If you've ever enjoyed Avellone's writing, then it still comes through strong in this title, butchered and shortened as it is.  The characters are interesting and foster genuine curiosity about the world the Old Republic represents.  There are still some genius set encounters, particularly in the early and late game, that challenge what it means to have quests and how to experience a story in a western RPG.\nThe only problem is, when all is said and done, when you've put in your 30-something hours and you see the final cutscene, you leave with that bitter and sour taste as your final realization is this:\nWhat an RPG this truly could have been.","July 7, 2014","true","35.4"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

It is to Knights of the Old Republic what The Empire Strikes Back is to the original Star Wars. Its story is darker, more sinister. What The Sith Lords does to subvert our expectations, however, is considerably different. This is Star Wars deconstructed.\n\nThe role of the Jedi in that galaxy far, far away and the dichotomy of the Force are examined in a way that most other Star Wars media doesn't often attempt. Barring a few bits of dialogue and plotting that doesn't work, the story is well-written and features intriguing characters. The enigmatic Kreia, in particular, stands out as one of the most memorable Star Wars characters ever created.\n\nBecause of its darker strains, the story doesn't quite cater to the brand of escapism many associate with the Star Wars series. That shouldn't deter any fans from playing this game, though, because it ultimately provides a rich role-playing experience full of character and mystery. Anyone who enjoys a good RPG will likely find a lot to take away from The Sith Lords.","November 3, 2015","true","156.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Old memories came back and how I defeated enemies for the first time. I remember the first time when I played it and the emotion of being part of the Geroge Lucas universe. Feeling the Force with these characters, no matter the side you choose, light or dark.\n\nEvery member of your group,  every planet has a unique story and a continuity carefully created. The chance of gaining influence with your partners and unlock certain things you will discover during the game is being played is fantastic. One of the best ideas of Obsidian and Bioware could see in other games like Mass Effect for example.\n\nHere you play the Exile, a former Jedi knight who followed Revan during the Mandalorian wars finishing at the disaster of Malachor V. There's a lot of story about Malachor V and almost a taboo among survivors. Only 5 years passed during that terrible war where the Republic suffered a great peril. You wake up in a station called "Peragus" and something is not there. Your powers. And the quest for recovering your connection with the Force starts there. What you do will have great repercussions in the galaxy.\n\nThere are a lot of history background at the missions, and there is a big plot in the whole game and the main character is the center of this plot, and maybe others, who knows?\n\nGameplayYou can play a male or female character and depend on what you'll have different partners and romantic options. Also, the dark or light side will affect some of the decisions you'll take. You even can change the perspective in the middle of the game, I tried and worked. If I'm not mistaken, I played this game like 8 times. Yes, I'm a big fan.\nYou don't do Star Wars? No problem at all. No matter the knowledge of the Old or new Republic, the Force and those issues, this is one of the best roleplaying games. And you'll have to try it if you like RPGs.\n\nThe player has to think very carefully the decisions, you don't even know when you can gain dark or light side points. That will allow you to gain certain powers or not. Also gaining influence with the onboard characters could jeopardize these points or even influence with opposing members of the group.\n\nComparing with the award winner, Knights of the Old Republic I think this second part is even more polished than the first but the previous one seems to have more choices in travel options.\n\nThe skills and powers are well established. What I don't understand why a light side could use dark side powers. Of course, Force Storm is the best attack power, and there are some light side powers who will protect you from attacks.\n\nThey never fixed some glitches and bugs, there are one in a cave of Korriban where you can get a lot of experience, also, there's a bug. You find Kreia and after the scene if you don't have a telepathic communication with her you'll be trapped there.\n\nI have to mention something about music and graphics. comparing actual games graphics are not the coolest, but this is an AAA game, and had the best graphics in their time.\n\nThe soundtrack is one of the best I ever listened in my life. It's just precise and perfect for every moment. I'll make a special mention about the music in Malachor V, fantastic. Try to play that part in the dark and listen carefully. Amazing and a little bit creepy.\n\nPros+ Star Wars, I mean it.\n+ In my opinion, the best RPG made of the franchise\n+ The richness story of every companion\n+ The story of the main character is a great one, full of question and not always a proper answer\n+ A great soundtrack\n\nCons- They never fixed many glitches and bugs. I remember years ago costs me to start the game again. So, save!\n- There's a no return point if you had some extra quests to finish. Don't go to Dantooine Enclave after the mercenaries attack.\n- You'll have to replay the game and pay attention to complete all achievements\n\nFinal ThoughtsAs I said before I loved this game. Not only because is a Star wars game, is one of the best Roleplaying Games I ever played. It's quite immersive game, in a Republic at the point of disaster, you in the skin of someone who want answers. There are a lot to explore and you¡'ll have to play several times to know everything of your party members.\nPlay it. Maybe it's an old game but today we don't have this great plot and storytelling in a game.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nMay the Force be with you","April 10","true","30.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","23","28","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_Mike/recommended/208580/","T_Mike","Todd Michael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_Mike/","1161 products in account","Developer Obsidian Entertainment was born of former PC RPG giant Black Isle Studios’ closure, and with the name Chris Avellone affixed as lead designer/writer there was an expectation that we’d be seeing something transcending the low standard of video games—even if they were stuck using flippin’ Star Wars (of all things: Really?) as a starting point.\n\nWhat Obsidian’s crew ended up doing was to look at Star Wars, at all Lucas and BioWare and every EU author had accomplished to manipulate the monomythic structure in the creation of something palatable and brilliantly addictive, and just…wrench a knife somewhere in them there guts and twist, twist until everything that gives the Star Wars appeal is torn apart. Piece by piece, the Sith Lords subtly begins feeding you each and every tired expectation, and, as they come, what you feel is this growing sense of relief, this subconscious drive to be satiated on your own literary comfort food—but: There’s always that moment—and you come to expect that too, come to rely on it as the antithesis to your prior highs—there’s always that moment the game asks Why? Of this path so often repeated, what accomplishments do you imagine?\n\nA beggar family, torn apart both financially and physically by war, asks for your help--a paltry sacrifice on your part to ensure their safety; maybe, just maybe, nearby stands a man asking for the same outcome, but in place of your own personal sacrifice he offers great monetary gain. It’s either-or, here, and the tendency of players will be towards “good” over “evil," so the sacrifice is made, the family hobbles off pitifully to presumed safety and bright futures. You yourself positively reflect on the morality bonuses given for another day saved--and the game stops you dead in your tracks, voicing—almost exclusively through your mentor Kreia—its frustrations with the ignorance inherent in your actions.\n\nNo matter your in-game answer for Why?, the result is always the same; your choice, perceived as the moral high ground, was nothing but a wasteful performance of ignorant folly. Drawing parallels of your actions to vampirism, your acts of kindness, of Jedi charity, do nothing but steal what power the helpless may hold for your own use (i.e., the experience points gained by your choice, an idea reflected in Star Wars lore itself without any game-y statistics). No matter how buried motives are under the guise of self-sacrifice, helping the needy only serves to weaken them, altering their perceptions on universal modality and, in some cases, making them targets to others more desperate and lethally-driven towards the same goal.\n\nBy following the ‘goodness’ of the Jedi code—a lie fabricated for self-preservation and personal profit—it's suggested you just led an entire family to their death.\n\nThis deconstructive direction outside the realm of predictable comfort is what makes the Sith Lords such a massive improvement over BioWare’s excellent predecessor, and, really, the story is just too dang good for Star Wars; its goals far too high and self-aware, but also something the Star Wars brand has desperately needed for a long time.\n\nYet, while the writing of the Sith Lords is far stronger than its prequel, I rate both titles the same, and may, personally, even view the first as a better game. Achievements aside, the Sith Lords is riddled with bugs, moments of atrocious pacing issues and literally a quarter of the game unfinished. Many of these issues have been repaired by dedicated fans over the years since release, but that’s still not enough: The long intro segment and Nar Shadaa still feature pacing issues that stem from more than a rushed development cycle, but simply clumsy planning and writing.\n\nKreia’s continued domination over the players’ own emotional turmoils are what champion this game ahead of so many others, her words forever scarring views of Star Wars as fluffy entertainment. Amidst the wealth of coding error that would come to define Obsidian’s games, it’s that writing--that twisting of archetypal norms and the assumption of a moral compass built from her presence that make this journey so darn good. In the rush to finish this game under a holiday development schedule, she’s written out as Darth Traya, but despite the new name’s implications, despite the donning of black robes, she's never convincing as a villain. (It’s hard to buy her shadow mask when she’s always right, even if she is pushy and demanding. Her role as a mentor is far more believable.)\n\nIt’s long before she makes her name in betrayal that she raises the avatar and herself from the dead. Five years have passed since Revan redeemed herself and saved the galaxy (the pawn of a Star Wars cliche repeated almost by the decade), and the next galaxy-wide threat is already in full effect. It’s unfortunate that not many seem to know it. This behind-the-scenes orchestration of tragedy is defined by absence in TSL: The concentration of power so great, so abnormal even by Star Wars standards that it threatens itself strictly by persisting, every moment needed to devour the essence of this life that connects every living being. Sith Lords Sion and Nihilus, Kreia’s guiding hand, the avatar herself—exiled by choice from the Jedi Order for her own acceptance of rational, necessary darkness—are all representative of the ultimate consequence of the power sought by good and evil in Star Wars lore, each in their own way black holes eating away at what seems, on the surface, like a coherent system guided by a familiar mythos born long before ’77.\n\nThe rest of the supporting cast lends a helping hand in reinvent the Star Wars universe, too, with the best among them following the same route the game’s overall quest system takes. The first to join your cause is--of course--a clone of Han Solo even down to the predilection for familiar catch phrases, but as the story progresses his character is turned inside out, his snarky personality made merely a coping mechanism for his horrific past. Another is a twist on the now-stereotyped wookie: A psychopath tortured by his own culture, he adheres under a broken sense of honor to life debts--you know, that cultural norm handed down from his homeworld that would bind him to anyone who saves (or spares) his life--that also drives his psychopathy. He’ll fight alongside those owed such a debt, but not without the constant reminder that his only wish before dying is to gleefully dismember them.\n\nIt’s this team of equally-lost souls the avatar and Kreia influence and guide on their mission to remove the devouring endgame. Since the conclusion of BioWare’s epic, Revan’s vanished and the Jedi Council lie in ruins. Barely a handful of members still live, and that persisting, devouring force quietly ravaging the galaxy has them in hiding. It’s the Exile’s job to pull these hiding Jedi out of their inherent selfishness either by hunting them down or banding them together to Save the World.\n\nFantastic characterization and dialogue aside, story progression doesn’t bring the same joy or discovery BioWare gave players, due possibly to overcomplication or ridiculous ambition beyond TSL's budget. The series has since become an MMO, and the characters’ fates removed from the postmodern, deconstructive tone of TSL back into comfortable, anticlimactic Star Wars fare.\n\nUnfortunate.","December 31, 2014","true","53.2"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","1"

Start weak. Grow strong. Grow godly strong for some reason, as if it made sense. Did the world-building and story-telling always back up this formula? In my opinion, no.\n\nBut then there's Star Wars, and its conveniently mysterious "force." What an opportunity for an RPG! The first KOTOR was a standard RPG with a classic plot twist. It was a phenomenal game in the traditional sense.\n\nKOTOR II takes the RPG formula and turns it into an ethical dilemma on its own. The majority of the game dances around this theme. It paints no one who grows in power as much of a hero, but exposes them as a threat. Personally, I applaud this direction, despite the game's tone overall suffering from a depressing feeling.\n\nBe warned, KOTOR II isn't much of a happy game. It's a mature, thought-provoking game. It's a rare game that tells the real story of its own mechanics. You're getting stronger.

What hit me were the characters, and how I grew to care for them. I learned "pazaak" from Atton, sparred with the Handmaiden, shared the pain of a past war with a past ally, sat at the feet of of Kreia and absorbed her teachings, and in turn taught Visas the ways of the Force as Kreia had with me. All of these characters had interesting and involved backstories, but what I liked the most about them was that they were just as defined by their moments with you as they were by the exposition that you could eventually get out of them.\n\nAnother intriguing thing about the characters is that they all seem to have their own inner darkness, and the way you influence them is either by fostering that darkness or helping to redeem them of it. You can free one companion from their inner rage, or teach them to draw strength from it. Draw a naive student to the light side or shackle them to the darkness.\n\nAnd they're all HIDING something. Why is it that your wise teacher can't seem to read the thoughts of the scoundrel you picked up on a mining station? Why was your wise teacher seeking you out in the first place, and why does she seem to know so much about the Sith? What's hidden away in the memory banks of that backtalking T3 unit? What exactly /happened/ on Malachor V?\n\nSure, the game's got its issues. The combat might get too easy for those who figure out its tricks too early in the game. Some of the time it seems like the game was cut into pieces before its release - which it kind of was, unfortunately. Graphics might seem outdated. I mean, yeah, I'll admit, they ARE outdated, though they aren't unbearable.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is that, once you peel back all the issues on the surface, you've got something truly special. I don't know how to explain it - it's like this /feeling/ you get, when you're playing the game into the wee hours of the morning, and you have to get up early tomorrow but your thoughts are drowned out by the dim glow of your computer screen and the soft chuckle you let out at "Just because I saved her doesn't mean I want to charge up her loading ramp!"\n\nI don't actually know how to end this review.

My enjoyment is the story line, however, how many times can you run the story line before it's time to move on?\n\nWin 7 doesn't seem to like the game too well.

Minor fixes was to include all processors in the system manager, and set it's priority to high, Then make it compatable with Win 98/XP.\nFor the dark side run, will be attempting to drop some dlls for DirectX 9.0c with it, as that seems to smooth out other older games as well. The reason for this, is the game was indeed not meant to run on DX 11, so a few modifications will be needed, and I believe this to be one of them...\n\nAgain, a free roaming version of the game, that doesn't really end would be an awsome addition to the collection, for the modern systems.

I am not a fan of this type of combat system, where i'm just clicking hotkeys but I still found myself immensely enjoying the game, as well as (eventually) the combat once I figured it out halfway through the game. I played the game really lazily at first, just automatically levelling all my characters up. I actually played for ten hours as a light side Jedi before I got angry at Kreia and started over as the dark side. The first thing i noticed in playing it, is how similar the first Mass Effect is to it. I love Mass Effect so I appreciated playing its ancestor and there are a lot of similarities to appreciate. I loved the whole inventory system and how much loot you could find. The locations felt similar to mass effect and even the sound of passing space craft on the citadal station over telos sounds like they used the same sound in mass effect. Like I said, I played this game very lazily...i eventually figured out the levelling system and how everything worked after I decided to pay attention half way through. I spent most of the game trying to figure out ways to make Kreia angry, so I was rude to her every chance I could get. I had also started over after running into the jedi on Telos who irritated me so much with their haughty ways I decided to go full dark side. No regrets, even after selling a kid into slavery and convincing a guy to committ suicide within a few minutes of each other. There are obvious flaws to the game which everyone recognizes and I soon came to discover...its buggy, it seems unfinished, the ending (at least for the darkside) felt lacking. It is still a great game, however, primarily because of the story. I don't really need to go into much detail here...its an old game, everyone knows how great this story is. And by the end, I was laughing at myself for basically role-playing my dark jedi IRL by having all my actions decided by my irritation with Kreia and the Jedi. In short, if you haven't played this game yet, from one first-timer to another, seriously, play this game. Now I just have to play the first one.","May 3, 2014","true","36.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackHaloRose/recommended/208580/","BlackHaloRose","Mz. Hyde","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackHaloRose/","91 products in account","Because this game obviously needs more praise, I'll throw my two cents on it. Honestly, after having played many modern games these days, KOTOR2 was a great game to come back to. A lot of contemporary RPG games, even those by Bioware, have various issues these days, so I'm going throw out a bunch of points as to what made this game amazing, and even more so now that everyone can easily install and use the Restored Content mod. Because I tend to be wordy, I'll have a TLDR list below.\n\nThe DnD System: The DnD system implemented in the KOTOR games really does it a great service. Unlike real DND, you don't have to wait 10-15 minutes to hopefully hit something, it all happens quickly. You can even view the detailed rolls for previous combats in great detail, whether they be about enemy or friend. (So you happen to know if it's even possible for you to land a debuff on an enemy.) The movement controls could certainly be tightened up to feel more responsive, as there's a short delay when telling a character to attack, but the slower real time system is far more enjoyable for me than the super fast paced action RPGs that seem more common today. Because it runs at a slower pace, it's far easier to take in the battles, even when a lot is happening at once. There's far less flash and particle effects during the battles than most Action RPGs these days, but I think the game is better for it.\n\nCustomization Daydream: So much in this game can be tinkered to your liking. You want your wise Jedi Mentor to suddenly just be a sharpshooter? You can level her like that. Probably won't be as powerful, but can certainly be done. There's a wealth of items to make your character fit your style, weapons and armor that can be customized, plenty of feats and force powers. They also added the Seven Lightsaber forms (and Force forms) so you can further adapt to a situation or confine yourself to a certain style. Sad thing is the only real lack of customization is in the character appearance itself, but it also wasn't an industry standard back then.\n\nGray(t) Story: Excusing the awful pun, the story is excellent. It might be difficult to grasp the first time around, depending on your experience with the Expanded Universe or other Star Wars games, but there's a lot going on. Where many Star Wars games tend to play things pretty black and white, especially when it comes to Light Side and Dark Side, this game examines the major elements of Star Wars lore differently. Characters don't always scold you for an action they disagree with if you can back it up with solid reasoning. The choices in this game are wonderful and can lead you to some pretty interesting alternate solutions to getting through a part of the story. This is also one of the non-linear RPGs that I feel doesn't suffer from pacing issues. Games like Dragon Age 3 for example, let me go where I want as well, but I can sometimes just hit a point where what I'm doing doesn't feel as important, so I lose focus and interest. KOTOR2 however does good at keeping major objectives there at all times, large and small ones.\n\n\nPros\n-Fantastic Customization of characters and gear.\n-Wonderful writing featuring compelling characters and tight pacing.\n-Active-Time-Battle-like gameplay that is enhanced by the wonderful animations. Uses a DnD dice system for most things in the game.\n-High Replayability since many different builds and conversation choices can lead to some vastly different experiences.\n-Not your traditional save the galaxy story.\n\nCons\n-Clunky movement of character and camera. Will take some time to adjust if you're used to modern games.\n-The music isn't very memetic. The dynamic music the games tries to utilize doesn't flow very well in places.\n-Can be very difficult in places if you aren't properly prepared.\n-You'll begin to really loathe the first level if you replay the game a lot and don't mod it out.\n-Not your traditional save the galaxy story. (Not for you if you're looking to be the undisputed good guy who does no wrong.)\n\nSo that's KOTOR 2 to me. I would recommend this game certainly and highly recommend it with the Restored Content Mod. It might not be as fast and flashy, your character may not be voice acted, and it might be a little confusing at times. But if you're a fan of Star Wars, Bioware games, or are just looking for a story that isn't so traditional, KOTOR 2 will keep bringing you back to that galaxy far far away.","October 28, 2015","true","101.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

This game = SO MUCH WIN.\n\nThe review might be slightly drawn out and rambly but do try to read it through. Else, putting the TL: DR version here, Buy this game, right now. On any platform you prefer, STEAM, GoG, physical.\n\nFollow up to a critically acclaimed RPG by BIOWARE from over a decade back, the original release was severely cut down from the original vision that OBSIDIAN had in mind. Nevertheless the game was strong in its own right and deservedly so.\n\nIt picked up and iterated on almost every point that BIOWARE had explored in the original, the most obvious being,\n\n1) DIALOGUE: The game improves on this point the most, sure BIOWARE had put in decent dialogue and writing in the original KoTOR but OBSIDIAN's work is a class apart. There are more dialogue options informed by a range of variables apart from the Speech skill of your character. Your standing and influence with factions / characters can get them to divulge information without having to have a superior Speech / Persuade / Force Persuade roll.\n\n2) CHARACTERS: Having been treated to a basic Light Side, Dark Side struggle in the original KoTOR (with a single exception), the player is treated to a more nuanced fare of characters in the follow up game. Sure there are still the tropes but the depth of character play has certainly been explored better in KoTOR II. Your influence over party characters can not only open more character interaction options but confers certain benefits on them when they align with your world view.\n\n3) COMBAT: Something as simple as adding another set of weapon slots to make it easier to switch between melee and ranged support roles.\n\nA great game, released a decade ago and still a damn fine game especially with the Restoration MOD guys adding a lot of cut content back inside the title, you can find the content here, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937.\n\nWould highly recommend every RPG player to check out the title if just to see where the standards of role-playing were once and how far they have fallen, also, the dedication of a community to raise a flawed star to its fullest potential.","December 12, 2015","true","34.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Your character is also known as the Exile, your character is exiled from the Jedi Council because you went fighting with Revan for the Mandalorian Wars the rest of the backstory and all is up for you to find out, young padawan.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay is similiar to KOTOR, its the same pause and turn-based combat (if thats what it is). This time around KOTOR II is alot easier than KOTOR, such new gameplay elements include health regeneration which KOTOR I lacked in. You can still level the same attributes and feats and Force powers, however you like so each game through will be different considering the classes you choose and the choices you make.\n\nGraphics:\n\nDating back to 2003 for KOTOR I in comparison for KOTOR II, graphical-wise it isnt much of an improvement, but i will say it has improved and is still pretty decents depending on your point of view or perspective. I MUST SAY THE HUD THIS TIME AROUND IS ALOT BETTER THAN KOTOR I, in KOTOR I your HUDS were the size of the a mint, so the HUD improvement from KOTOR I is well appreciated.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\n(8/10)\n\nThough the story for KOTOR II is not as interesting to me as KOTOR I, KOTOR II holds a dear place in my heart and no doubt in a few weeks time , you will see me playing the game over and over again just to experience the story all over again :D. So basically if you want a cheap Star Wars RPG at this time and age you wanna get the KOTOR franchises, because their drive on story and decision-making is amazing at tijmes the voice-acting is pretty convicing it makes me feel bad for being a bad guy on some occasions , so put on your Jedi robes, arm your lightsabers and charge right in this game, young exile  and May the Force Be with You.","November 27, 2015","true","31.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/208580/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nKnights of the Old Republic II (KOTOR2) – The Sith Lords, was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released early 2005. KOTOR2 is a Star Wars RPG played from a third-person view, and a sequel to the original KOTOR game which was developed by Bioware and released in 2003.\nThere was an update on July 21, 2015 which dramatically improved the quality of the game, adding in steam achievements, steam cloud saves, native wide screen support, controller support, and best of all the Steam Workshop.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510696951\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: The events taking place in KOTOR2 take place five years after KOTOR1, the Sith are winning the war with the Republic. You play as “The Exile”, a former Jedi Knight who has lost his/her ability to use the Force.\nThroughout the story you are given chances to earn “light side” or “dark side” points based on the ethical decisions you make, you also grow closer to your various companions based on choices you are sometimes presented with.\nAll of this gives the game an extremely replayable atmosphere; because you can go back and choose different dialogue, experience a completely different story, and most importantly deal with the consequences for your choices.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510696907\n\nGameplay: Combat wise, the game is identical to the first KOTOR, you have the same types of weapons: lightsaber, Melee, Blaster weapons, Ion weapons, Mines, Grenades, etc.\nYou can (and should) pause the game before and during combat to plan out your strategy of engagement, will your companions lay down range fire while you rush to the front lines lightsaber blazing? Or is this a boss and you need to throw all your grenades? First use force lightning, flurry, auto attack, force drain, then power attack? There are countless strategies for combat within the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510696944\n\nThere are Mini games; Pazaak (Card game) and Swoop bike racing (Racing game). Learning the tricks of these mini games are very rewarding in the game, but a guide would be the appropriate place to learn about these mini games.\n\nAchievements: Once upon a time there were no achievements for KOTOR2... ...until the magical day of July 21, 2015! This is one the games I always wanted achievements to be available on, most achievements will be earned with playing through the game twice; Once choosing the Dark Side path, once choosing the Light Side path.\nThere are also several achievements for skill based side objectives, however it's safe to say that all of these achievements are very well achievable. You do need to be willing to go through the story several times to earn them all.\n\nPrice: KOTOR2 is priced at $9.99, my first play through was 47 hours. The quality of this game is excellent. Personally, I am guilty of being biased for star wars RPG's and playing the heck out of them, but even for a normal person you can easily squeeze out 20+ hours. (RPG's as a genre are designed to be lengthy and time consuming!)\n\nConclusion: To quickly recap, Story: Excellent, the story changes based on decisions you make throughout the game. Gameplay: identical combat rolling system to KOTOR1. Achievements: straight forward, you will need to beat the game twice and maybe three times (depends on if you missed any skill/trait based achievements). Price: Extremely fair, if you want an even better price just wait for a steam sale.\nI adore the Star Wars universe, and this is my favorite RPG series within that franchise. With the advent of J.J. Abrams, Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens (Because putting “Disney” before “star wars” is still too weird for me), the franchise will regain momentum.\n\nThanks for reading my review! Feel free to leave comments, accusations, appeals, or objections bellow.\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR 1)\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 02, 2015:\nSpell checked one word "Choose" not "chose".

This is my second time all the way through (first time on the xbox) back in 2004/2005.\n\nThe best thing about KOTOR 2 is the writing, and the characters. It is deeper, and definitely darker (but perhaps with more profound moments of light and redemption due to contrast), than the first KOTOR. As expected the game looks a little out of date, but the sound, voice acting, and as mentioned, excellent story carry things along very nicely. The presentation is really quite cinematic, with nice pacing, good use of dramatic pause, and a poignancy that is rare in computer games.\n\nIt is an excellent RPG to play driven by your own moral compass etc, intentionally selecting and ignoring the threads to form your character, and party relationships. This is a MASSIVE part of the game, and in many ways is far more interesting than the grinding and combat etc (which is fine, and quite entertaining). Some of the outcomes of choices are a little tired/naff/obvious. For example there are so many problems ultimately solved with violence etc, but hey it's star wars and a computer game... what can I really expect! On the whole the dialogue and outcomes are very enjoyable, especially as you come to understand the personas and motivations of the party members, and learn to pick the threads that yield the best reactions.\n\nI highly recommend installing the missing content patch, which is now very clean and tidy, and adds considerably to the experience and sense of completeness. That said it would be nice to see a clearer round up of what you acheived from your choices/acheivements in the wider universe (minor niggle).\n\nAn indellible experience, and I would love some more.","December 25, 2014","true","65.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Not only was it their first full undertaking, but also the sequel to an extremely memorable and enjoyable game in one of the most famous settings ever created. Sadly, the final product was a rushed production with a notorious amount of cut content, having had only 13 months of development before going gold thanks to LucasArts' infamous decision to hurry the game to market for the 2004 holiday season.\n\nI had never played The Sith Lords up until recently. I played Knights multiple times in the past, loving its story and gameplay, but never its sequel. And now having played it, I feel that there are tragic signs that the game never realizes its full potential, even with the restored cut content, but I also feel that it surpasses its predecessor in several ways.\n\nMechanics\n\nThe Sith Lords employs the Odyssey engine and d20 system from first game, effectively translating Dungeons & Dragons concepts to the setting of blasters and lightsabers. Combat is real time with pause and although there are a few oddities and annoyances, I always felt that the combat worked mostly well. The game's item crafting and upgrade system is decent, and thankfully so, as almost all the items you will find are randomly generated, including merchant stocks, and you will need to upgrade your gear to remain competitive.\n\nSpecial note needs to be given to the influence system. Depending on your actions, you can gain influence with your companions and thereby earn their respect, change their alignments, learn more about them, and even train some of them in the Force. The system has significant flaws, as it tends to encourage gamey tactics in order to maximize your influence points. It is also undermined by the fact that you cannot have more than two companions with you at a time, making it nearly impossible to influence everyone in any singular playthrough and restricting access to some parts of the story. However, watching your companions follow you to the Light Side or to the Dark Side is very cool.\n\nWhat is a Jedi without his lightsaber? Without his powers? Without the Force?\n\nThe background story of the The Sith Lords is far more ominous than its predecessor. Darth Revan has left the known galaxy for mysterious reasons. Civil war has crippled the Republic. And the Jedi, relentlessly hunted by a new wave of Sith assassins, are nearing extinction. Yet, your character, despite being a Jedi, has been divorced from these events right up until the game's beginning.\n\nYou are an exile from the Jedi Order, who condemned your actions in the Mandalorian Wars and ordered you to give up your lightsaber. Furthermore, you somehow lost your connection to the Force. However, it begins to return.\n\nThus you embark on not just a physical journey, but a spiritual and philosophical journey. Delightfully, you are given the opportunity to opine on the nature of the Force and are encouraged to decide for yourself whose teachings are right, whose are wrong, and if the Force has a destiny for everyone or if your fate is one of our own choosing. In many ways, this game is a successor to Planescape: Torment and it all but explicitly asks "What can change the nature of a man?"\n\nIt is not your typical Star Wars story. And here, that is fantastic.\n\nThe game has excellent dialogue and many times gives you a plethora of dialogue options. Overall strong voice acting and writing permeates this title and nearly every character has depth far surpassing their counterparts from the first game. Admittedly, the writing does have its share of inconsistencies and the story has its issues, including a series of somewhat unsatisfying retcons regarding Darth Revan's motivations and the "True Sith," which cheapens the value of The Sith Lords as a continuation of Knights.  But when the story and writing are at their best, it is wonderful and makes up for nearly every weakness this game has.\n\nDo you consider yourself a Jedi? A Sith? Or something else entirely?\n\nI was very charmed by the fact that you can play a character that adheres strongly to the Light Side, the Dark Side, or one that rejects both the Jedi and Sith orthodoxies and still arguably be justified in your choice. It is so much more interesting to have genuine motivations for your actions rather than a superficial veneer of rationalizations and this game succeeds at providing such motivations. The character I played prior to this review generally showed charity, courtesy, and hospitality to those around me, but I also decided to exterminate the remaining Jedi masters and constantly criticize the Jedi Order for its many hypocrisies. It was deliciously heretical.\n\nAlthough I love that this game readily permits, and sometimes encourages, toeing the line between Light and Dark, I was a bit disappointed at how it can lock you out of some content. While I could forsake the alignment specific prestige classes, I was far more annoyed that there was a level on Korriban that required a strong alignment commitment, thus prohibiting my only mildly Dark Side-aligned character's entry, and that the ending of the game is merely dependent on how devoted you are to the Light Side or Dark Side rather than on any given choice. I'll also note that I was stopped short of completely and utterly denouncing the usual conception of the Force as having specific Light and Dark natures rather than emphasizing the value of an individual's choices and actions, perhaps because there was still an expectation you would ultimately pick a side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this run and the game is very replayable.\n\nBeset by Unfinished Content, Blemished by a Weak Ending and Bugs\n\nAlthough almost any game will have its weakness, this game's are pretty prominent. One of the most noticeable was some wildly varying level design quality alongside a relative lack of content in some areas. For instance, Onderon had many sidequests, many locations, and an interesting plotline with many remarkable characters. But Nar Shaddaa and especially Malachor V have some lifeless and rather poorly designed environments. And Korriban was almost pathetically short. The ending of the game's story can also be disappointing, as it refocuses on the aforementioned retcons and takes away choice from you regarding what your character does next. While it was supposed provide a sequel hook, it feels cheap. In a way, it feels like some parts of this game were never fully finished.\n\nI also encountered some bugs, including graphical glitches on some of the player character models and some pathfinding oddities. There was also a bug where dialogue would start constantly skipping if I didn't close and reopen the program around every two hours. Massive praise must be given to the people behind the Restored Content Modification for crushing so many other bugs, but the presence of the ones I found still speaks of an abridged quality control effort due to the rush to get to market back in 2004.\n\nSumma Summarum\n\nFor all its problems and unrealized potential, I really liked this game. I liked it for its story, its characters, its willingness to confront some of the normally sacred concepts of the Star Wars setting, and most of all, its fantastic writing. So long as one enjoys RPGs, is cognizant of this game's flaws, and can appreciate its complexity and subtleties, I strongly recommend this game.","January 16","true","58.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

God damn it. As usual I will start with the bad stuff, and I will try to keep spoilers out of the way.\n\nThe first and biggest problem this game has going on it is the fact that it was never actually finished. And let me tell you, I LOVED THE FIRST ONE, and I bought the second one when it came out, years ago. I was confused as HELL with the ending, because it didn't make ANY SENSE AT ALL. However nowadays there's an actual fix for this situation: Last year the devs patched the game on Steam to add Achievements and Mod support, to thank the guys (some of the devs included) who took their sweet f#cking time to, after so many years, finish the game on a mod. You HAVE to play it with those mods, I'm serious. They add quite a ton of stuff, even if some of those new things still seem to be fairly unfinished.\n\nThe second thing are the bugs. After so many years there still are bugs running rampant through the game.  Granted it's nowhere as close as with other games, however I've managed to do stupid stuff at times and I don't even know how. A few examples are somehow teleporting to the top of a pillar and getting stuck there, forcing me to load a previous save, or having a character somehow bug out and ignore a current quest, not allowing me to finish it. Sometimes this can be fixed by loading previous saves, but not all of them.\n\nMy last issue with the game is the characters. Don't get me wrong, I like that they brought the playable characters from 9 to 12 or so, but not all of them seem actually interesting. G0-T0 deserves a f#cking special mention as I never actually gave 2 f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥ about him, while Kreia always looked and felt like a smartass who knew way too much.\n\nThat being said though, is the game good? Oh boy, you bet you ♥♥♥.\n\nTo begin with, the story itself (if you have the mods to play the actual entire story, of course) is seriously good, long and deep. It takes somewhere across 25 hours to complete, and that's only counting a Lighr or Dark playthrough, so there's another 25 hours waiting for you later on.\n\nThe characters, ignoring the two I said before, are REALLY INTERESTING, and you can learn their back-story and stuff about them as you play on, sharing adventures with them. The game also has a sort of system which tracks who are you being nice to and who are you being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to, which works perfectly, and characters trully react to your actions throughout the entire game.\n\nThe rather deep (and even a bit confusing at times) combat system from the original is back here at full force, with even more weapons, more armors, random items, and customization. There's also buttons to switch between two weapons, allowing ranged characters to quickly switch to melee weapons when needed. You can literally play most of the game your way, although using blasters against Jedis and Sith is f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the time.\n\nThe whole feel of the game changes deeply from the previous game, and it's good. While in the previous Kotor everything felt happy and colorful with the current truce, now everything is f#cked beyond repair. It helps inmerse the player into the current situation, and makes you explore and learn about what changed from one game to the other.\n\nOh, and this game has one of the best video-game characters to ever exist as a rather unlockable: HK-47. I'm not f#cking arround with you, he's totally worth the fetch-quest to unlock him.\n\nOverall, this title still stands arround other great RPG games, specially after the fans and old devs finished it together. Do I recommend it? Yes. But if you haven't played the first one, then you totally should, as the story follows in here. And obviously, you should play this one with the mods that fix it. Personally, the base price of the game is already fair enough, but you can wait for a sale if that makes you feel better. For 5€, it's a f#cking steal. You filthy meat-bag.\n\nEdit: Whoops, forgot to put the link to the Restored Content Mod. Remember though, there's an extra mod on the workshop that adds an unfinished planet to the game, I suggest getting that one too.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937","February 22","true","27.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

Not having played it at release way back, I decided to finish both KotORs in one fell swoop -  grabbed that content restoration mod and just wanted to get it done.\n\nAnd during the first hour or so, it is kinda like KotOR - when I somehow messed up the tutorial mission (ending up in a place that I shouldn't have been in, with a character that I was supposed to get later or some such) I encountered the black screen of showstopping death. Three hours in. No fail saves (dumb, I know - learned my lesson then) and THIS close to uninstall the damn thing and never touch it again. Good thing, I found a mod to skip the tutorial, buckled up and returned to galaxy far, far away. And I am actually glad, I did.\n\nGameplay was pretty much like KotOR - the interface is better, but still not too amazing. And the tech is just as outdated, visuals, particularly backgrounds are blocky, undetailed and look actually a lot worse than the pre-rendered stuff of the olden Black Isle-days. It's easy to dismiss KotOR 2 as being as outdated as KotOR was at this point - but soonish I realized a lot of stuff has changed for the better. For starters, the quest design, while still basic in it's structure -  is better laid out on the maps (a lot of the stuff is placed in a more convenient manner, with less running through empty areas and even encountering some fun and interesting diversions on the way). The quests themselves also feel more "believable". See, this is not the Dungeons & Dragons ♥♥♥♥ of KotOR - no looking for ancient artifacts of superpower, all of it feels a lot more connected to the world happening around you - political intrigue, murder-cases, shady business with shady characters. At the end of the day, a lot of it is still fetch quests - but they are embedded so much better that I was actually interested in following the events that would unfold and, more importantly, a lot of it felt like it was connected, feeding into more complex, greater events happening in the background and that would eventually be reveleaed to me in time.\n\nPersonal highlights of mine have been the assault on the royal palace in Onderon, the events on Citadel Station (which, funny enough, reminded me a lot of the Citadel from Mass Effect) and come to think of it all things going down on Nar Shadaa were pretty fun too. I don't know exactly when it happened or how, but KotOR 2 managed to pull me into this world and made me want to learn more about what is going on, through it's "quests" but also, and more importantly, through it's characters and overall storyline.\n\nSee, the original KotOR felt rather dumb - maybe I didn't look hard enough, but the characters and story there weren't very appealing to me. Too simplistic, too petty and too Saturday morning cartoon. KotOR 2 on the other hand has long stretches of really interesting stuff going on - maybe it is because the games themes are a lot darker than its predecessor or because it feels much less like there is only black and white to choose from. In fact, there are a lot of subtleties, lots of intrigue and scheming that I enjoyed very much - KotOR 2 kept surprising me and the narrative plays a major role in this. One could argue that the story is convoluted, maybe messy even (and cutting stuff to get it into shops without delay most likely didn't help) but maybe that is the reason I got so invested in it. It is cryptic, but I think that only adds to the whole atmosphere of uneasy alliances, the very real chances of betrayal and the themes of corruption and obtaining ultimate power over yourself, others and the force. The way the story is told is also less static and at times there are several layers of story happening at once, which adds the illusion of things being in motion, of events unfolding and several factions working towards favorable outcomes (for them).\n\nIt does also help that somebody actually was clever enough to make the world react to some degree to the things you are doing - several times my obvious corruption had been mentioned in conversations. Quite contrary to the original KotOR,  you embracing the dark side is no longer a single dialogue option in the last quarter of the game, but a process that other characters witness and react upon, thus helping to create a much better illusion of your decisions being meaningful and actually having some sort of relation to your crewmembers and the world surrounding you. It's far cry from being realistic or natural but the fact it gets acknowledged at all is more than I expect from games these days.\n\nThe characters of KotOR 2, like Kreia and Visas Marr and to a lesser degree Atris, the Handmaiden or Mandalore are amazing (HK-47 too, actually, make that all of the droids - though more for comedic reasons). Compared to the prequel, these characters don't feel like cardboard cutouts and actually have a lot of depth to them. Kreia in particular has become one of my favourite characters ever within the hours I spend with KotOR 2 - the way she constantly shifts from being your friend / someone you trust - to someone that gives you the creeps and that is expected to backstab you at any moment is masterfully done. Really impressed with that one. Also, a lot of the things that are reflected upon in KotOR 2 are borderline philosophic and might hold some value or truth outside of the game world - again, hats off to some amazing writing.\n\nIt's a real pity that such quality is marred by a ton of glitches and some inconsistencies (at times it is possible to meet characters before you meet them again in major events, them then being oblivious of your existence or the dealings you had before) and then there is some sort of buffer overflow happening during longer sessions where cutscenes would fast forward, which made me miss out on some critical cutscenes - so, save often and to different slots, like the game tells you to.\n\nMuch to my surprise, KotOR 2 managed to be genuinely engaging as well as entertaining and had me invested in it's world, story and characters quite quickly. Highly recommended to give this one a try.","November 30, 2015","true","20.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","3"

I've played Half-Life 2 (and its episodes) three times over because of how in love I fell with the story. While figuring out how to get this game to work with TSLRCM, I started playing Knights of the Old Republic again, as the opposite sex and alignment but found myself somewhat bored after Dantooine. So far, I have played Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords two full times in rapid succession and I'm roughly a third of the way through my third playthrough. To say I love this game is an understatement.\n\nThe gameplay is a step up from KOTOR 1 and though I find it very enjoyable, battles can be rather bland and a bit too easy at times. The real reason to play this game is the story. However, that itself is very divisive. The Sith Lords' story is a meticulous exploration of the very basis of the Star Wars mythos: the Force. It portrays the Jedi as flawed, the Sith as broken but ultimately human (or whatever species they are) and the very concept of morality as far more complex than any of the current Star Wars canon does (admittedly I'm rather unfamiliar with the old Expanded Universe outside of these two games). This can turn off Star Wars fans just looking for a Star Wars game like KOTOR 1 that captures what makes Star Wars great. On the other hand, the mouthpiece for all these criticisms and alternative points of view is a character called Kreia who, without delving into spoilers, is... rather questionable to say the least. Though you can't convince her to change her mind, you can declare yourself in disagreement and you can defy her as you wish, or agree with her as you wish. As a Star Wars fan, I found this deconstruction of the Force to be highly enjoyable and cast the movies in a different light for me.\n\nThe other characters in the game are hardly one dimensional, the weakest ones are two dimensional at worst. It's difficult to talk about what makes these characters great without delving into spoilers so I won't, but I will especially praise Atton as an example of everything a good anti-hero should be. There are a couple that return from KOTOR 1 and their presence is very welcome. Some, such as HK-47, are enjoyable as ever and developed further while others, like T3-M4, are an improvement over their KOTOR 1 incarnations.\n\nThe mechanics are integrated much better with differet aspects of the game this time around. Your attributes and skills play a role in conversations and the creation of items at workbenches, the latter being itself a huge improvement over its handling in KOTOR 1. Playing as different classes and alignments creates very different experiences outside of combat. As a male Jedi Guardian/Jedi Master I played very differently than as a female Jedi Consular/Sith Weapon Master and as a female Jedi Sentinel/Jedi Watchman, for example. Where in KOTOR 1 you can play Dark Side or Light Side but really only make meaningful decisions towards the end, you're put in a spot where you have to take decisions from the start. As a Light Side player, early in Telos do I refuse this monetary reward to earn Light Side points but risk having to sell my wares to not gain Dark Side points a bit down the line? As a Dark Side player, do I challenge the Jedi Masters early on and engage in difficult fights or save all but one of them for later when I'm more powerful but make the survivors gang up on me?\n\nIn conclusion, I tend to compare Episodes IV and V to KOTOR 1 and KOTOR 2. Episode IV and KOTOR 1 are the more basic Star Wars adventure. The dichotomy between good and evil is clear and doesn't really try anything new but is more easily digestible and is incredibly fun regardless. Episode V and KOTOR 2 are the more creative one but takes risks that might not be to everyone's liking. While this really isn't a good analogy as both Episode IV and V are rather easily digestible whereas KOTOR 2 is a lot harder to swallow, especially if you just come in for a sequel to KOTOR 1 in body and soul, I think it works as a comparison because one is the safer one while the other is the more daring one. Both are great on their own merits, though I personally consider the latter to be better. With this game you should come in with an open mind. If you do, I highly recommend giving it a whirl and seeing if you can get something out of it. Just please install TSLRCM and possibly M4-78EP from the Workshop, the game is incomplete without at least the former.","May 12","true","144.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eehee/recommended/208580/","Eehee","Eehee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eehee/","271 products in account","Star Wars: KotOR II - The Sith Lords is one of my favourite games of all time - in that way, it very much lives up to my love for its predecessor. The two tie for the #1 spot on my all-time favourite single-player game, and are cumulatively my favourite story ever, as far as I can say off the top of my head.\n(NOTE: TL;DR at bottom.)\nKotOR II is a third-person RPG game, with largely turn-based combat.\nWhilst I certainly have a few problems with it, I truly believe that this game (as well as KotOR) is a game that any die-hard Star Wars or RPG enthusiast need to experience.\nI'll break this review up into a few short segments based around the story in particular (as the most important part of this game is by far the story), and will be reviewing this from a largely biased position, as I've been a fan of this franchise for over a decade. I'm new to the whole reviewing thing too, so forgive any mistakes on my part. For those of you who are just looking for a TL;DR, here are the pros and cons:\n\nPROS -Carefully crafted story, one that manages to touch the heart of most die-hard SW fans in a very powerful way. It’s absolutely great in just about every aspect, and it does something no other game does – it paints in grey strokes about the nature of the Force, not just ‘good’ and ‘bad’.\n-Aesthetic and visuals hold up in the majority of places, considering its age. Just don’t look at the back of the Ebon Hawk, whatever you do. It’s certainly no stunner, however – if you’re cool with a lot of somewhat muddy textures you’ll be fine.\n-Fans of the first game won’t have their love for the first game cast into the dirt like a dead corpse. KotOR II respects the first game and doesn’t undermine it. On an unrelated note, the same isn’t the case with the MMO.\n-There’re some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hilarious and exceptional characters. HK-47 kicks ♥♥♥.\n-Combat is pretty damn neat, and becomes more satisfying as you progress through the game. Not everyone will love it, though.\n\n\nCONS-Throughout a lot of the game, you may find yourself doing busywork that takes far too long based almost always on where you have to go. A certain mission sends you back and forth through an entire city twice, which is infuriatingly needless. Additionally, any who were a fan of the “RETURN TO EBON HAWK” feature will have to do without this time around.\n-There are times when your goal is not clear. The mission overview page could rely a little less on my memory, as it often lists only what I’ve done and what *will* happen, but not what I need to do.\n-Not all will be a fan of the UI, or the aesthetic – though personally, I like them both. There are places where textures go beyond horrific, but thankfully the majority of the game is free from that.\n-Thanks to Disney, the game technically isn’t canon. The most we’ve gotten in terms of that is a reference to a planet in the original game, as far as I know. I don’t know why playing non-canon stuff would be an issue, but I imagine someone out there will have a problem with it in one way or another. “Ugh, I’ve tainted myself with “extended universe” filth!”\n- Music can bug out and become repetitive.\n- Audio can fluctuate at times, forcing you to rip off your headset and smash your ‘lower volume’ key with a clenched fist.\n-Voice acting noticeably varies in quality. At times certain characters will suddenly sound as though they’re a different person (because it *is* a different person behind the voice). It ruins my immersion, I tell you!\n-Some characters could use a little love. For example, Nihilus - the guy in the skull-y looking mask - has very little established story, though what story there about him is certainly engaging.\n\n\n---\nSTORY - (Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything.)\nThis is the jewel of the game - again, much like its predecessor. KotOR II has a story that tugs at my heart, in no small part due to KotOR. If you want to delve into a world that’s chock full of lore surrounding the Force as well as the Star Wars universe at large, then KotOR II is the world for you.\nNow, as a recommendation before I go any further, the story of KotOR II is hugely complemented by the first game. Whilst it isn’t necessarily crucial to play KotOR first and KotOR II is perfectly capable of standing on its own legs, there are quite a few references to characters and the plot that won’t quite make sense, which would be a travesty in my eyes. KotOR itself, though, certainly has a story that stands better by itself than KotOR II could, as KotOR II makes references that without the existence of KotOR would make far less sense and have barely any impact.\nIf you’re someone that takes a great interest in the Force, paying attention to key details in both games will go a long way.\n*Sorry for spamming “KotOR” there.\n\nThe intertwined stories of the two games intimidate me, as a wishfully aspiring author.\nNow, whilst this opinion is subjective, I genuinely believe that the story (including the first game) lives up to the movie saga itself – an opinion I’m sure I’m to receive a lot of flak for.\nHowever, there is absolutely no doubt that the lore of KotOR II is immense, and if coupled with lore from KotOR, they far surpass the lore in the saga – I suspect that nearly all who’ve taken their time with this game(s) will agree with me.\nThere is little I can say about the story without spoiling it, so I can really only recommend that you experience it for yourself. The ‘protagonist’ of the full story is to this day my favourite character in anything. Yes, I even like them more than the likes of Vader, Master Chief and Solid Snake. (to be fair I’ve only played a bit of Metal Gear.)\nPerhaps that’s because I was a lot younger when I first played KotOR, but I stand by my love for the protagonist.\n\n\nPLOT:\nThe plot of KotOR II keeps the pace going and cuts off loose ends from KotOR, resulting in a very tidy story, with a small few exceptions – important questions that the more curious players may have asked themselves in the first game have been answered in a very satisfying way. It doesn’t need to stand on KotOR’s plot - the story of the Exile is just as enthralling as that of the former game.\n\nCHARACTERS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT:\nThere are noticeable improvements on character development in this game. The characters that surround you on your journey are very in-depth, and less predictable than the previous game’s characters were.\nA few welcome faces from KotOR also join the mix, something that strummed my nostalgia-guitar to a mellow tune – if you were a fan of say, T3-M4 and HK-47, you’ll be pleased to know they’re back.\nThe only issue I can say I have with this is that you may not get a chance to interact fully with all the characters in one playthrough, especially if it’s your first time. Then again, that’s what replays are for, right?\n\nPACING\nThis comes down to the player, for the most part. The sooner you get into high gear, the sooner you can blitz through the story if you want that. Given that it’s a game full of stuff to loot, chances are the pacing will be right for you – whether you want to get it over and done with – running past loot – or if you want to take your time and soak in the world.\n\nCONCLUSIONBuy it. It’s seriously an incredible experience that no one should go without. Better yet, buy the original and play that first, then this. I’m always going to have memories of this game and the original, and will fondly take them to my grave.\nIf I were to assign it a rating (which I disagree with but some insist on having them in reviews) I’d give it a perfect ten, which is something I don’t think I’m going to do much in my life.","April 2","true","72.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","7"

Of course I recommend the Sith Lords! Why wouldn't I? It's one of the best Star Wars games ever made. It has fantastic characters, great dialogue, and an excellent story. Also it.......\n......\n...it broke my heart.\n\nSTAR WARS(R): Knights of the Old Republic(tm) II has bugs coming out of every exhaust port. I've had important conversations ruined by glitches, a blank screen during climatic battles, the Exile getting stuck for several seconds at a time unless I enable vsync(??). Worst of all, after 29+ hours, when I was at the doorstep of the finale, all of my saves stopped working. All I wanted to do was take a break to eat lunch. LUNCH! What's wrong with lunch? Does lunch lead to the dark side?! Hunger leads to crashing, crashing leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to...oh my gosh. It's true!\n\nI'm not saying it could happen to you, but it happened to me. I spent nearly 30 hours on this game, and I couldn't even finish it. What a piece of garbage.\n\n---KILL ALL THE STORM BEASTS---------\n-------SPOILERS AHEAD------------------\n\n\nNow that we've gotten the nasty business out of the way, let's discuss the actual game.\n\nPLOT: You are the Exile, a fallen Jedi seeking answers. Along the way you are mentored by the mysterious Kreia. Eventually you recruit the motliest of crews, attempt to restore the jedi order; while killing hundreds of alien creatures, space bandits, and Sith assassins.\n\nLet's look at the basic structure of the game. KOTOR2 is an RPG, which tends to involve exploration, stats, equipment, and an emphasis on story. The most important aspect is that you're playing an active role. As the Exile, you make numerous decisions, which can affect the storyline in various ways. Going further, the decisions you make influence your party-members. Do something they agree with, your influence over them grows, and eventually they'll answer your questions about their past. This is a relatively low-key game. At times it almost feels like detective work, and not the usual lightsabers & blasters extravaganza (though there is plenty of that).\n\nAlso, as with the previous entry, the decisions you make determine whether you think like a Jedi, or a Sith. What I like about this system is that it keeps you thinking. There's no silly "let homeless people eat" or "kill homeless people" decisions in this game. A jedi might carry a lightsaber, but not every situation requires one. Being selfless and using diplomacy can save lives. Even a few lies won't hurt your relationship to the light side. But don't let that stop you from threatening someone to give you a few extra credits, or force-persuading them to jump off a bridge. Giving in to the dark-side tends to be more rewarding, easier, and more entertaining. Getting light-side points requires sacrifice, which isn't something we're used to. I mean c'mon, RPGs tend to involve heroes raiding houses and stealing every last dime. How often are players going to say "No thank you. I don't need your reward money. I'm a good guy."? Playing an actual truly honorable person is difficult, and it involves saying things that will make players (and Kreia) really annoyed.\n\nKreia is one of the best-written characters in a videogame. First off, she presents a third dimension to the common tale of good vs evil (or light vs dark in the case of Star Wars). She implores the Exile (and the player) to look beyond the basics of the jedi code, and seek a greater purpose. I suppose her ideals are biased, but that adds depth to her character. As you attempt to influence your party members, she indulges in her own machinations. Secondly, her nature helps keep the rest of the cast on edge. While your party members can trust you, they tend to ignore or even outright hate each other. Kreia's role as a mentor is far from what we'd expect, as she shows little respect for her allies, and will control them to achieve her ends. Also, her betrayal is exceptionally well-written. She turns on you, but it's not "Haha! I'm a bad guy now!" This is something that has been hinted at numerous times, and Kreia even all but spells it out to the Exile at one point.\n\nThe rest of the cast, as I mentioned earlier, is fantastic. At first glance, everyone looks like a bunch of cliches. Atton Rand is the wise-cracking rogue, Bao-dur is the mechanic, HK-47 loves killing, and Han Harr is a wookie. However, everyone has lot of depth to them. This isn't to the point where it becomes overbearing. In the end, this is still the Exile's quest, but the extra care and attention given to the party-members makes them more than just "along for the ride". Their interjections fit their personalities, and give you something to think about when you're running from one adventure to the next.\n\nKOTOR2 gives you a lot of ideas to dwell on. This is important because the battle-system doesn't require much (if any) thought. You can put together your own party and outfit them however you want, but your strategy will rarely deviate from "use this force power to put everyone out of commision". The most difficult parts of the game tend to involve certain boss battles. The twi'lek twins can be a headache, unless you had the foresight to mine the cantina in Nar Shadarr before a certain event. You might also have trouble fighting Darth Sion in a rogue vs sith battle. Before long you realize that Sion is as dumb as he is ugly, and will gladly stand around while you plant a dozen mines for him to be lured into. An optimal player might've just made Atton a Jedi so they could awesome their way through these fights, but I messed up there.\n\nWhile this game focuses on its story and writing, there is a part of me that's disappointed in the lack of any real end-game or post-game content. We can "thank" Lucasarts for shipping KOTOR2 in such a poor state, and thank TSLRCM-group for restoring a lot of the cut content, but there's still a lack of...well...return on investments. I look at it like this, when I use a particular party-member, buy equipment for them, and raise their stats, I'm investing in them. I expect that eventually this investment will pay off. Usually the pay-off is in the form of help beating the game, defeating some super boss (like the weapons in Final Fantasy 7, the dragons in Baldur's Gate II, etc) or exploring some grand optional dungeon. When a party-member is killed off (via the story) all I'm thinking is "Why did I invest in this loser?" Unfortunately, there's no pay-off for investing in anyone in KOTOR2. I outfit them, invest my time by building a relationship with them, and I'm awarded nothing for my efforts. You can look at it as part of the storyline, or not important to the game, but I think it's an oversight. There were probably going to be 8 legendary Krayt Dragons for players to fight. Alas.\n\nAs far as necessary complaints go, I figure the level-design deserves to be knocked around. It's mostly bland and feature-less. Also it's spaced out to the point where there's a lot of running around. I skipped a few quests just because I was sick of huffing it from one end of the planet to the other. To add to this, there's a very clear sliding scale in terms of planetary content. Telos, Nar Shadarr, and Dantooine have the most, while Dxun, Onderon, and Korriban have the least. This can be attributed to -- you guessed it -- rushed development. There are other issues as well but let's just blame it all on Lucasarts.\n\nObsidian deserves a lot of credit. Even though this piece of junk failed on me at the worst possible time (my investments!), it's still one of the better CRPGs out there. The cut content is definitely worth checking out as well. However, you may want to be prepared for the worst. Even if you can manage to launch KOTOR2, you're never really out of the woods.

After throughly enjoying KOTOR, I honestly doubted if KOTOR II could live up to the first game, and hearing how it was rushed and incomplete-ish, I wasn't expecting that much out of it.  Boy was I wrong!!\n\nGameplay wise, there were a lot of small things that were improvements upon the first game (e.g. when you find a datapad it pops up right then so you can read it instead of having to search through all your belongings for it; your health points heal slowly when you're not in battle even without having to use a medpac, footlocked/corpse say whether they are empty if you've already looted them, no more really difficult to beat turret battles that you have to get through to continue the game!!!)\n\nThe storyline and characters are wonderful.  There are so many well-nuanced, non-traditional-trope-following characters.  Kreia and the Exile are awesome.  Darth Nihilus is one of the best-designed scariest-looking Sith from the Star Wars Universe ever.\n\nThe storyline (to me at least) felt rich and complete up until the final planet/boss showdown.  Even with the Restored Content Mod (which is essential, by the way), the last level did feel rushed, empty, and incomplete-ish.  However, to me it still was a fairly-satisfying conclusion to the game.\n\nI had a few small problems with bugs (namely on Nar Shaddaa and one at the beginning of Telos, so I recommend saving often and having save files available).\n\nAll-in-all, I really enjoyed this game and overall found it just as good if not better than the first KOTOR game.","March 6","true","181.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Obsidian, again working on a tight schedule(why does it happen to them all the time) still managed to put together one of the best story rpgs ever and now with the addition of the TSLRCM mod improves it to epic status. Its easily one of the best games i have ever played and the story and especially the characters are simply amazing from start to finish.\n\nIn the game you play as Jedi(duh) who has been exiled due to you following 2 rouge Jedi into the Mandalorin wars. This exile has made you forget/ lose(hello? Amnesia) the force and your journey is about regaining that knowledge whether it be for light, dark or not at all. While on your journey you will also be dodging and fighting the Sith who believe you are the last of the jedi and your death will bring them an ultimate victory of the galaxy. And of course you will also be doing all that awesome RPG stuff of crafting, leveling, building a team, and making choices.\n\nI probably consider Mass Effect 2 as the pinnacle when discussing character, story driven RPG's but after Kotor 2....damn its close. And i don't know which is better but thats a great argument to have among fans. The party you build in Kotor 2 is as mysterious, scary, lovable, funny and dark that, like in mass effect, i could not wait to talk to them. Not only are all conversations engaging, but they are brought to life by probably by the best group of voice actors assembled for a video game. I cant recall one voice who does not represent the character they portray nor a voice who was weak, or just plain bad. I can finally understand the appeal and praise for the assassin droid HK-47 who I will never forgot, or Kreia, Atton, Bau-Dor, Mandalore, Mira, and Visas. All memorable in their own unique way and lets not forget about their ship the Ebon Hawk which i will glady place along side the likes of the Millenium Falcon, Normandy and Enterprise.\n\nThe game play for Kotor 2 is real -time, pausable turn based combat. As you enter combat you can place 4 orders/ turns per character but you will be changing them constantly depending on enemies. In combat you can choose an active skill, buffs, combat stance which is very important and of course force powers. These powers and skills will all be rewarded as you level your character and progress through the story. The level up system is very deep for skills but the point system is i dont know how to explain but i always just hit "recommend" after the 3rd or 4 th level. Maybe too many points are given?\n\nOne of Obsidians staple for their games are choice and Kotor 2 does not disappoint. Of course you being a Jedi your choice is obvious light or dark but the the way it is presented in writing makes it clear. There are no shades of gray for your choice. Those choices carry through to the end as well as what party members you will be able to recruit. There is also a rewarding crafting system though its a lot to absorb at the start but becomes a little easier to understand after a few trial and errors. You will be able to craft equipment, weapons and medicine but because of the limited interface and ease to compare items i used it sparingly. The game is not difficult even on the hardest difficulty and loot is plentiful so crafting is really just an option and not necessity.\n\nThis is still a 10 year old game and not without noticeable game play staples of today. I would have given a left nut for fast travel, a better UI, and when crafting the ability to compare items and a simple who has what equipped. i dont actually know all the details of what the MOD fixed other than adding lost content, but graphically it looks sharp and the combat with some new added animations looked really cool.\n\nKotor 2 is another amazing title from Obsidian and with the help of dedicated fans has not only preserved it for another generation but polished it to the diamond status it deserves. I finished the game a few days ago and still thinking about choices, characters and the story. Awesome game.\n\nPositives:\nOne of the best Story, Character driven RPGs ever made and equals Mass Effect 2 in every way\nIt maybe the best voice acting(including robots) cast ever\nGraphics are dated but they still look sharp and the light saber battles look really good.\nRPG goodness everywhere\ni want to immediately restart and go down the other path\n\nNegatives\nThe UI needs updated. I would rather see an MMO type toolbar than what is in place.\nYou cant compare items and when crafting it just says "equipped" but doesnt say by who\nA lot of running back and forth and sometimes, where do i go?\nThe point distribution for leveling feels too rewarding?\nA little easy even on hard difficulty\nObsidian are not doing a complete remake or working on Kotor 3\n\nFew notes:\nI played the game on my laptop with mouse and k/b at 1080P with only the TSLRCM mod installed. I experienced 2 hard crashes and i lost my cloud save? once.  To me these are minor and non issue.\nSteam shows playtime around 63 hrs which i feel is accurate. I tried to do everything, i talked to everyone and even played Pazzak.\nI am huge RPG fan and Obsidian/Black Isle are my favorite RPG developers. I had held off from playing Kotor 2 because of the constant crashes and problems that seemed to plague the game on initial release.","September 10, 2015","true","65.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

About a year ago, I picked them up on Steam and played KOTOR 1 through again, and it was fun. But then I played KOTOR 2 again (this time with the Restored Content mod and the droid planet mod). And then I played it through again. And then a third time. And then a fourth.\n\nThis game's story is incredible, the options the player is given are many, and the companions you meet are interesting. This has quickly become one of my favorite games.\n\nI think the only way you will like this game is if you are a Star Wars lore fan, even if the story this game tells is not technically canon anymore. There was a recent update to this game on Steam, adding a Workshop for mods, including the Restored Content mod. If you are going to play this game, you MUST install that mod. It includes a lot of content that the developers were not able to get in the game by launch due to time restrictions given by LucasArts.\n\nSave often and in different slots.

You get different companions based on your force alignment and sex, and interacting with your companions will not only give you access to lots of personal background and general lore, but also lots of special unlocks - force powers, abilities, and new classes for your followers. The only downside to its vastness is probably that you never will be able to experience all of it in one go - you'll even need at least 2 runs to merely recruit all possible followers, and then probably some to reach maximum influence with all of them (or, use some of the various influence guides on the web).\nThe characters never fail to attract my interest, and draw me into their stories - almost everyone has more to them than meets the eye at first. There are also lots of scenes of banter between you companions aboard the player ship, some of which are hilarious while others are dark and sinister, which lets you experience many different facets of their personalities, and many of them are also based upon your influence with the different companions.\n\nThere are new force powers, as well as different fighting stances and 'force forms' which let you customize your style of play even more. For example: your a Jedi Master with nearly unlimited force use but a little squishy in hand to hand combat? Use a force form which makes your force attacks more powerful, at the cost of greater drain of your force points - of which you have more than enough anyway. Or you're a Sith Marauder who slays his enemies solely with his lightsaber? Adapt to every situation by employing stances which give you higher blaster deflection, increased defense against multiple melee fighters, or greater attack and defense against a single lightsaber-wielding opponent.\n\nCrafting is expanded and more useful, too. For example, lightsabers can be upgraded with 5 different components (2 crystals, energy cell, emitter, and focusing lens) instead of the 2 crystals only, as in KotOR. There are a lot more robes for Force users, with various boni to them, and they also look a lot better than those in KotOR.\n\nThe story is a bit of a divisive point - some feel its attempt at analyzing the eternal light side vs dark side struggle and putting some moral ambiguity into it strays too far from the star wars formula. Yet, like many people, I think it's the most interesting thing that has been done in a star wars story ever. Overall the story is quite dark and at times melancholy in its tone, which is also aided by the game's fantastic soundtrack. I still don't tire of the atmosphere and the stories of the game, even 10 years after I originally played this game (and countlessly replayed it since).\n\nThe 2015 update which brings support for widescreens and high definitions is the perfect excuse to finally play this game (again), and with steam workshop support it's easier than ever to experience what the game was meant to be, thanks to the incredibly great TSL restored content mod and the M4-78 enhancement project, which even adds a planet that missed completely in the original release of the game. I definitely recommend to get those mods, but I also loved the original, admittedly unfinished version. If you can't stand open endings, TSLRCM is an absolute MUST.","March 14","true","65.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsuichoi/recommended/208580/","tsuichoi","Tsuichoi the Preserver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsuichoi/","193 products in account","The Sith Lords proved an imperfect, incomplete and yet paradoxically fantastic epic for an era in RPGs. It can't be defined by what it did right, (the industry-standard that was the first game in the series could be summed-up in such terms) but by those exceptional moments it offers the player in a way no other game by my recollection, has replicated since.\n\nThe Sith Lords has a botched ending, dated graphics, and "bare-bones"/minimalistic gameplay by today's standards- falling short in total of anyone's most basic expectations. On paper, it's failure.\n\nAnd yet, despite what little Oblivion did to encite players, lacking the usual flashy bells and whistles that commcerials are made of, it somehow manages to introduce the subject of the story, to a universe which is rich in lore, life, and charm. From the very beginning, you are awoken, injured and alone, aboard what looks to be an abandoned mining facility. The first few moments you spend collecting yourself, is in a morgue with an old, creepy, cryptic women, who shares with you her thoughts on your predicament. From there, you traverse the empty, earie halls of the base in search of answers which are few and far between, encountering next to no one in the process- (Spoilers) save for a handful of murderous mining droids, and the last holo recordings of a crew not long for this world: a bleak outlook to say the least. The atmosphere here is palpable- permeating with a sense of emptiness, mysticism, and awe along the way,  setting the tone for much to come. The unknown is a key theme from beginning to end, as you embark on a journey of self-discovery, putting back toghether the peices of your past, which if you played the first game, should be a familar feature. As you unravel the secrets of the Jedi and Sith, who have more or less, droped-off the face of galaxy- adding to the strangeness of it all, especially for a Star Wars game- you begin to fall deeper and deeper into a thick plot which is all consuming, and from which there is no recourse. But i'd better leave it at that, and focus on a few features which make the game:\n\nDialogue: The voice acting here is par none -in both writing and cadance- with some of the most memorable lines of any game, that will leave you thinking long after you've played your first time through- and if you do pick it up, it will have you going back to pick apart what was meant here or there. Conversation drives the story, so careful attention to what is being conveyed is a must to make sense of whats going on, and from there, what choices to make.\n\nCharacters: Each is unique, and with all there is to find out about them, I found myself loving or hating them with no such feelings in between. Which is an unavoidable consiquence of the influence system: a game mechanic that just means favoring one character (in dialogue) tends to ♥♥♥♥ off other characters. This adds another dimension to your light/dark side options, and the closer you get to some characters, the more you will get to know them and vice versa (the less the rest will tell you.) Their own personal plots come with alot of baggage to swift through, and dark backrounds to confront, with reveals which are the highlight of the game.\n\nChoices: Don't be fooled by Mass Effect and it's ilk; Knights of the Old Republic practically invented player-driven progression, with but a handful of forebarers to draw from. If you do play it, I think you will find that the choices that are available in this game, far surpass those offered by others RPGs. What you say and do matters in this game, and you feel it both in the consiquences and rewards. The impact of each is immediate and meaningful, which, depending on your path, will pan out one way or another in the ending.\n\nFor every flaw you find in the Sith Lords, two great things pop up. My favorite game of all time, the Sith Lords is a must for story-loving RPG players- and I don't even hardly play or much like RPG's on the whole; I'm a strategy guy- But this story speaks to me and has left it's mark on how I see fiction, stretching the genre to the limit of it's creative ends, and leaving me with impossible expectations of what passes for a good plot on the market today.","January 7, 2015","true","65.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Explores the moral ramifcations of having the force in a way that no other Star Wars medium has. Worth playing for the story alone.\n\nGameplay is enjoyable if you can really figure it out, it's based on D+D and the combat is turn based, but it still feels pretty visceral. Being able to properly level your character and knowing where to properly spend points to get the character build you want is very important and very rewarding.\n\nThe recent update is great, it runs at modern resolutions excellently and the controller support is actually quite pleasant to use. It could be better though, there's no dedicated inventory, stealth or weapon switch buttons despite how important those features are and combat can be a bit finnicky, as the left and right d-pad buttons control both the usable items menu and the combat menu. It would probably benefit from a seperate, controller focused UI, but the controller support is otherwise rather good - there's nothing you can't do with the controller.\n\nDue to the nature of the game, there is no benefit to using keyboard and mouse over a controller, or vice versa. It's all personal preference, and since I've played through this game about 10 times using keyboard and mouse, I found it quite nice to be able to relax and play with controller.\n\nPerformance is a bit dodgy, I'd recommend turning off Frame Buffer Effects to maintain a solid 60fps. This removes some of the effects though, like the stealth effect, so bear that in mind. I found that I got about 25-30fps with the buffer effects on and 200fps+ with them off, so it's quite a difference. This is with an I5-3570k and two GTX 780s as well, so it's a bit ridiculous that I have to turn off any effects.\n\nThe game is a bit buggy, but far less buggy than it was prior to the recent update. The bugs I had before the update included suddenly being unable to move, which required quicksaving and then re-loading, and dialogue randomly skipping. The random dialogue skipping pretty much ruined the ending of the game for me, as it just skipped all the important dialogue and I didn't realise what was happening. This was prior to the update though, so I'm keen to know if that bug has been fixed.

Maybe I'm biased but I will break it down.\n\nStory:\nPros:\nRich story, plenty of fully voiced dialogue.\nAs always, choose your own ending/path.\nUpdated from KOTOR: Character influence/ability to convert companions to Jedi -- YES PLEASE!\nSo good at making the player character "special" or all-important, which is crucial to a good RPG imo.\nCons:\nTHE ENDING. There is now a mod to help this but overall the build up was 100x overhyped for the provided ending, at least there's a solid "first ending" where you finish the jedi master story arch.\nYou majorly have to choose which companions you want to be jedis and sacrifice influence with others in order to achieve this, there's no having your cake and eating it too.\nA lot of vague hints and questions, particularly involving Revan that will go unanswered forever.\n\n\nCombat:\nPros:\nMany more force powers available, and with 30 extra levels, a chance to get all the ones you want\nThough not as well-clarified as some games, the attributes you select will affect the combat immensely, thus your original build will affect how often you hit and how often enemies are "saved" when using force powers. You have the opportunity to really boost your combat in the area of your choice.\nCons:\nEIther boring or constant pausing and tweaking, you don't control the movements, only which attacks/items are used\nCombat is very basic, all roll based, your roll plus bonuses - their roll plus bonuses = hit/miss\nThe powers/medical supplies/feats are all in their own scroll menu in combat, MMO style key-binding & self-assigned options would've improved the flow of combat much more.\nIf you try to go for middle ground in your attribute choices, I find that you are all around mediocre in combat rather than balanced.\nClumsy combat queue, if you want to use a medi-pac immediately, you have to go into the inventory menu or cancel combat before you select it. Otherwise it will queue, and you or your injured party member will likely die before it is used. The idea is good, because you can switch to other characters and choose their next 3 actions but it wasn't smooth.\n\nGameplay:\nThe graphics are dated now, but still not terrible\nPlenty of character options available, and an added Jedi/Sith Master Class option at level 15\nWhile you can choose any order of planets, after your first playthrough, you'll know better. It is better to do specific orders for the characters you want to become jedi. Look up a guide if you're a One-go-Joe.\nMore lightsaber colors.\n\nOverall, it's well worth your time, I wish the original KOTOR had a lot of the elements that this one introduced. Every game has some glitches and now that there are a good number of fixes both on Steam workshop and Kotor II Nexus, this game has recovered from its disappointing brokenness to become the gem it always should have been.

What the game lost when LucasArts rushed it out the door for a Christmas release, it more than made up for itself due to a colorful cast, and (likely due to Chris Avellone's influence), a total disregard for the standard Star Wars fare of "Light and Jedi good, Dark and Sith bad." Grey heavily entered the equation, and this game attempts to honestly give you that sort of choice, as much as an offical Star Wars game can get. However, you must understand when playing this - this story isn't about Revan, per se, or the Jedi, or the Sith - it's about the Exile, and why you (the player, the Exile), went to war against the Mandolorians, why you chose to follow Revan and Malak - and why you came back. You chose your own ambitions, in far greater depth than KOTOR 1's typicaly "Light Side/Dark Side" choices. That isn't to say though that you should be any one specific thing on the sliding scale of morality in the game - far from it. This game is a million times more satisfying as any side of the Force though, compared to KOTOR 1, so instead of being a rather...comical imitation of a bad guy who electrocutes people in KOTOR 1, you can get deeper into the mental aspects of the dark side. The same is for the light, but the game (rather, Kreia and through her, totally Chris Avellone), WILL indeed slap you on the wrist for being either side than grey...Which is also a major thing.\n\nKOTOR 2 is a wonderful game, that clearly has inspired fans the world over to cling tightly to the runt of the two KOTOR games - but there's a damn good reason for that.\n\nAlso don't expect to get much romance, but it's not like KOTOR 1 had oodles of that either, so to each their own. HK makes up for it though.","October 29, 2015","true","42.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Parts feel unpolished and incomplete. The game is glitchy and places and some of the events that happen in the game happen for no discernible reason.\n\nThe first quarter of the game is pretty well done, but the instant you're able to travel to other planets, the game falls apart. The narrative is poor, most characters are poorly written and I don't think the game does a good job at providing you incentive to continue for the story's sake.\n\nThat said, the gameplay, when it works, is absolutely fantastic. If you've played the first KOTOR and enjoyed the gameplay, this one is on a whole new levels. More force powers, more feats, prestige classes, being able to get your companions to change classes if you have enough influence (which in itself is a weird system that feels very wonky, but still). Mechanically, this game is fantastic in terms of combat.\n\nAlso, though I've said most of the characters are poorly written, some of them are actually very well written. Kreia, Hanharr, and Atton being a few of my favorites. The characters never really say much, as their backstories could probably be contained to a two page document (with the exception being Kreia), but they still have good personalities.\n\nOverall, if you liked the first KOTOR for the story, I'd be wary. If you like the game for the gameplay as well, I'd definitely check this out, but make sure you have the restoration mod.","November 15, 2015","true","59.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

The game release back in 2004 was riddled with missing gaps, as the game was rushed out and lots of intentional game implementations never made it on release. Fortunately, the TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restoration Content Mod) brings back the missing spots, thanks to the fact most of the "cut content" was found in the game files.\n\nThis game came out on Steam not too long ago, and initially it got bad reviews for having a lack of up-to-date support on Steam, thus leaving people on their own to figure out how to run the game. Fortunately, eventually some developers came in and actually fixed the game with a nice patch. Aspyr Media, being the bros that they are; developed a Linux port for this game which I must say; is phenomenal. Not only did they port this game, but it runs fantastic; but there is no surprise there with a 11 year old game. Still, I am impressed they chose to take this older game and port it. With TSLRC Mod added through Steam Workshop, this game is even BETTER than it was when I first played it back in 2004.\n\nThe graphics show their age, but there are some mods around the corner that look like they are trying to upgrade the lower end graphics. I am simply blown away that this game was taken and given a nice update on steam as well as workshop integration featuring some really nice mods. The windows side works great too, but now I am playing it on Linux and I am loving it too on Linux! One simply does not play this game without including the TSLRCM, that completes it.\n\n8.5/10.0 - Amazing revitalization of a older game. The Ithorians who are restoring Telos would be proud. Now I would love to see the first Knights of the Old Republic ported over to Linux, with full workshop support!","August 22, 2015","true","30.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As usual you're treated to an immersive story where nothing is black and white, the characters aren't flat and the world of Star Wars becomes alot more dark and depressing than the childish movies ever made it to be. The visuals are notably better, even moreso because there are texture mods out there that revamp most of the world in HD. The level cap has been raised to an unattainable 50, feats and force powers have improved, crafting actually allows you to make diverse weapons and armour for your party and so so so many ways to play the game. However, without the TSLRCM and M478 patches, the game is only a shadow of what Obsidian intended it to be. You'll need those two to get the most out of the game, especially dialoguewise. 5 Star game, however...\n\nObsidian won't get any money from it, you're giving Lucasarts money. The frauds that cut Obsidians time with almost a year because of their greed. Now they go about touting loudly about how the TSLRCM and M478 patches are on Steam. It is *your* fault that they weren't in the base game.  5 stars corporate meddling.\n\nSo decide if you really want to give Lucasarts your money for bad behaviour, otherwise, if you want to support the devs that made this legendary RPG, go buy Pillars of Eternity.

Someone once described it as "Star Wars by people who don't like Star Wars," which is pretty apt, but make no mistake, this is a labor of love. However, the game's release date was moved radically forward without consultation of the Dev Team, leading to a lot of cut and incomplete content and a structure with a bloated beginning and rushed end. Overall, if a KotOR III is ever made, I would rather play as the Exile than Malak, as she is a more nuianced and interesting character than Revan's over the top OP Mary-Sueness. Of course, that ain't gonna happen because of garbage with the Old Republic MMO but bah, a man can dream, can't he?\n\nAnyway, I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants a solid RPG which deconstucts the Star Wars setting in an interesting way and has real choices and consequences, but warn that you are going to get a very flawed gem. Beyond the understandable problems stemming from corporate dickery, the game is not balanced at all and there are a few design decisions which are questionable. For example, the mechanics heavily incentivize going 100% Light Side or Dark Side, yet the game oozes an atmosphere of gritty moral ambiguity which I've heard describe as "noirish." This is a damn shame because it severely punishes role playing in a game filled with great roleplaying opprotunities. Those looking to be a badass Dirty Harry in space are better off trying Mass Effect 2. Also, the blackjack minigame "Pazaak" basically breaks the economy, which is kind of lame.\n\nTL;DR: Yeah, buy it. It's only ten bucks and you'll get far more value out of it than some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s shovelware "art" game for the same price.","December 20, 2015","true","70.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Parts feel unpolished and incomplete. The game is glitchy and places and some of the events that happen in the game happen for no discernible reason.\n\nThe first quarter of the game is pretty well done, but the instant you're able to travel to other planets, the game falls apart. The narrative is poor, most characters are poorly written and I don't think the game does a good job at providing you incentive to continue for the story's sake.\n\nThat said, the gameplay, when it works, is absolutely fantastic. If you've played the first KOTOR and enjoyed the gameplay, this one is on a whole new levels. More force powers, more feats, prestige classes, being able to get your companions to change classes if you have enough influence (which in itself is a weird system that feels very wonky, but still). Mechanically, this game is fantastic in terms of combat.\n\nAlso, though I've said most of the characters are poorly written, some of them are actually very well written. Kreia, Hanharr, and Atton being a few of my favorites. The characters never really say much, as their backstories could probably be contained to a two page document (with the exception being Kreia), but they still have good personalities.\n\nOverall, if you liked the first KOTOR for the story, I'd be wary. If you like the game for the gameplay as well, I'd definitely check this out, but make sure you have the restoration mod.","November 15, 2015","true","59.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

Maybe I'm biased but I will break it down.\n\nStory:\nPros:\nRich story, plenty of fully voiced dialogue.\nAs always, choose your own ending/path.\nUpdated from KOTOR: Character influence/ability to convert companions to Jedi -- YES PLEASE!\nSo good at making the player character "special" or all-important, which is crucial to a good RPG imo.\nCons:\nTHE ENDING. There is now a mod to help this but overall the build up was 100x overhyped for the provided ending, at least there's a solid "first ending" where you finish the jedi master story arch.\nYou majorly have to choose which companions you want to be jedis and sacrifice influence with others in order to achieve this, there's no having your cake and eating it too.\nA lot of vague hints and questions, particularly involving Revan that will go unanswered forever.\n\n\nCombat:\nPros:\nMany more force powers available, and with 30 extra levels, a chance to get all the ones you want\nThough not as well-clarified as some games, the attributes you select will affect the combat immensely, thus your original build will affect how often you hit and how often enemies are "saved" when using force powers. You have the opportunity to really boost your combat in the area of your choice.\nCons:\nEIther boring or constant pausing and tweaking, you don't control the movements, only which attacks/items are used\nCombat is very basic, all roll based, your roll plus bonuses - their roll plus bonuses = hit/miss\nThe powers/medical supplies/feats are all in their own scroll menu in combat, MMO style key-binding & self-assigned options would've improved the flow of combat much more.\nIf you try to go for middle ground in your attribute choices, I find that you are all around mediocre in combat rather than balanced.\nClumsy combat queue, if you want to use a medi-pac immediately, you have to go into the inventory menu or cancel combat before you select it. Otherwise it will queue, and you or your injured party member will likely die before it is used. The idea is good, because you can switch to other characters and choose their next 3 actions but it wasn't smooth.\n\nGameplay:\nThe graphics are dated now, but still not terrible\nPlenty of character options available, and an added Jedi/Sith Master Class option at level 15\nWhile you can choose any order of planets, after your first playthrough, you'll know better. It is better to do specific orders for the characters you want to become jedi. Look up a guide if you're a One-go-Joe.\nMore lightsaber colors.\n\nOverall, it's well worth your time, I wish the original KOTOR had a lot of the elements that this one introduced. Every game has some glitches and now that there are a good number of fixes both on Steam workshop and Kotor II Nexus, this game has recovered from its disappointing brokenness to become the gem it always should have been.

What the game lost when LucasArts rushed it out the door for a Christmas release, it more than made up for itself due to a colorful cast, and (likely due to Chris Avellone's influence), a total disregard for the standard Star Wars fare of "Light and Jedi good, Dark and Sith bad." Grey heavily entered the equation, and this game attempts to honestly give you that sort of choice, as much as an offical Star Wars game can get. However, you must understand when playing this - this story isn't about Revan, per se, or the Jedi, or the Sith - it's about the Exile, and why you (the player, the Exile), went to war against the Mandolorians, why you chose to follow Revan and Malak - and why you came back. You chose your own ambitions, in far greater depth than KOTOR 1's typicaly "Light Side/Dark Side" choices. That isn't to say though that you should be any one specific thing on the sliding scale of morality in the game - far from it. This game is a million times more satisfying as any side of the Force though, compared to KOTOR 1, so instead of being a rather...comical imitation of a bad guy who electrocutes people in KOTOR 1, you can get deeper into the mental aspects of the dark side. The same is for the light, but the game (rather, Kreia and through her, totally Chris Avellone), WILL indeed slap you on the wrist for being either side than grey...Which is also a major thing.\n\nKOTOR 2 is a wonderful game, that clearly has inspired fans the world over to cling tightly to the runt of the two KOTOR games - but there's a damn good reason for that.\n\nAlso don't expect to get much romance, but it's not like KOTOR 1 had oodles of that either, so to each their own. HK makes up for it though.","October 29, 2015","true","42.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Same RPG style. Same Combat system. Same adding more lore than needed. Same running around the bloody galaxy across a set number of planets in order to find a set number of plot devices. Since it's more of the same but more buggy (RCM disregarded) so you'd think that Kotor 1  would be the superior. However, what makes K2 in my eyes a much better game (and perhaps my favorite RPG) is two things:\n\n1) The story\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bioware has an excellent teams of writers and they've made some fantastic stories but the stories are always very simplistic. You are either the King of All Things Good or the World's Most Respected ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fighting against someone so evil (or more evil than you, if you choose to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) it would take a loon to say [obviously evil guy] isn't.  In other words, Kotor follows the Original Star Wars (and nearly every Hero story out there) to the letter. You answer the call to a quest. You mature and grow in strength. You go and defeat the obvious baddie as one of the two archtypes above and save the galaxy. Boom. Roll Credits. Kotor is a hero story with all your Star Wars tropes.\n\nKotor 2 however takes said tropes and subverts them, throws them into fire, beats them to a pulp, and dumps them off into the nearest sun. What is a jedi without the force? Are the jedi really as good and deaaring as they are made out to be be? Or are they a bunch of jackasses? What is really difference between Jedi and Sith other than one likes red and the other a variety of colors? Or are both ideologies silly and just trying to stamp rules on a force (bum dum tsh) that they can barely understand? These questions and more are asked and played in Kotor 2 and they tie in with the overarching plot.\n\nEven with the Binary Moral Choice system there is depth. It actually ties in with your character and companions other instead of being something to change the last 30 minutes of the game. You have incentive to what you do. You are a Jedi Exile returning to a galaxy that has (almost) entirely forgotten you. Are you angry at your former masters and wish to gather power to reap vengence upon every last one of them? Or have you accepted (what you consider) your wrongdoings and wish to redeem yourself and forget your past? This small context of backstory adds metric tons worth of depth to your character and growth.\n\nTL;DR Kotor 2 manages to create a complex and fullfilling narrative that ties in both gameplay and story.\n\n2) It has Heart\n\nNo really I'm serious. This is also a bit difficult to explain.\n\nAt first I though this "heart" was just nostalgia ,but I realized that Kotor 1 never had this "umph", and Kotor 1 was leagues ahead in nostalgia.\n\nKotor 2 is a game that really makes me care about the world, the characters, and the tale it is trying to tell. This is where Kotor 1 failed for me.\n\nYour companions have depth and personality beyond there aligned stereotypes. I can give a couple paragraphs about each of them without needing to describe their appearence. The personal interactions you have with each member of your crew gives volumes more impact and detail and emotion.\n\nThe main quests of each planet made me feel like I was actually having impact on the galaxy. I felt change. After each planet I felt that something was going to happen and I was apart of it.\n\nI think this "Heart" is Kotor 2 being a much more "local" story. You are not trying to uncover some grand mystery that decides the fate of the galaxy. That is just icing on the cake. Kotor 2 is a personal story of your character and a battle with their past demons. You learn more about the Exile as he/she learns more about him/herself. Everything is a lot more quiet and that is the brilliant part of it. A quiet personal story that deals with the remnants of events long past, all trying to push their ends on a galaxy that no longer cares for them. And you are one of them.\nI picked Kotor (and this game up) out of nostalgia and to see how my views change on the games I played years ago and see how I view them now.\n\nHad I been asked which game was better several years ago I would have said Kotor 1 without a second thought. But after some time and returning I have to switch that feeling. Kotor 2 is better. Much better. The RCM makes it fantastic. And I can't stress it enough.\n\nAs a small note I suggest you play this game with the Restored Content Mod, as it is more of a patch and less of a mod. and is the closest thing we'll (likely) get to a finished game that Obsidian wanted.","January 23","true","124.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When KOTOR 2 came out my friends told me it was the worst one. Glitchy, terrible graphics, subpar story etc.\n\nAfter a few years I decided to try them out for myself. I hated KOTOR 1 and fell in love with KOTOR 2. I don't think the first one is a bad game, it just didn't click with me. But the second one, is one of my all time favourites. Admittedly I played this with the Restoration Mod (you can find it free in the workshop along with many other mods), but the game is so good.\nThe combat is based on a D20 system reminiscent of D&D, the story is rich and wonderful, the characters have depth and have polarized the community (I think this is a testament to how brilliantly written the characters are), the game will take you to various places around the galaxy to explore and the game gives a Dragon Age:Origins vibe which of course an excellent feeling to the whole gameplay/character progression. To expand upon this point, the game features actions with consequences, lots of dialogue options (hello Fallout 4), companions with their own personalities and how the adapt to the PC actions and behaviours and of course excellent combat.\n\nIf you haven't played this yet, do yourself a favor and indulge yourself in one of the best games of the past decade.

It doesn't have a plot twist like KOTOR 1, and I was quick to deem it a wasted oppertunity.\n\nNow after replaying it a few years later, I've completely changed my mind.\n\nThis game is darker, more mature than KOTOR 1.  The characters have all suffered at the hands of the Force in one way or another, and the Jedi aren't just the good guys.  There's moral complexity in the plot.  Sadly this muddled morality doesn't really factor into gameplay, but the story is great.\n\nIt is carried almost completely through characters and their dialogue.  Everyone is flawed in some way, and it makes things a lot more interesting.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it just uses KOTOR's system with a few more upgrades and weapons.  Force powers make things more interesting.\n\nWhere KOTOR 2 really shines is with the graphic upgrades and score.  The game has aged really well, thanks in big part to the fantastic modding community now available with the Steam Workshop.\n\nThat being said, the game feels unfinished unless you install the Restored Content mod.  It's critical to letting this game pack the biggest punch.  It makes an incomplete game feel whole, and the extra battles are fantastic and a delight to returning players who felt short changed.\n\nOverall, I recommend KOTOR 2 to people who liked KOTOR 1, because things aren't so simply good and evil.  Everyone is in the middle to some degree.  It's just a shame that the moral choice system doesn't really factor that, as the influence system can make every character 100% good or evil while they're really not.","February 19","true","120.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In my opinion, you can't choose between the two games. They're both equally masterpieces and due to the short time period between releases, they practically have the same value in terms of gameplay and graphics. What it really comes down to is the story. Which one has the better story? SPOILERS: Is it the first game? The rise and redemption of Revan who has lost his memory and taken on a new life? Or the second game? The story of an exile whom returns to civilization to find out, once and for all, why she was exiled and who is trying to kill her? As I said before, I can't pick between the two. The games are so well done in terms of RPG mechanics, gameplay, story, voice acting (okay, maybe the voice acting wasn't that amazing) and animation in certain areas.\n\nThe RPG mechanics is pre whatever we have now. It's a mixture of real time and having the ability to pause the game to plan out your course of attack. The people who updated KoToR II managed to implement the Steam controller, which, in this case, works just like a 360 controller. So it was less of a point and click situation and more so scrolling through the enemies before un pausing the game to continue the attack, if that makes sense. The game ran perfectly, no issues in any areas. The graphics are from 2004 or something, so it's not exactly pretty. At least the levels were really diverse and nothing was repetitive at all. The audio design, of course, was stellar. From the soundtrack to the sound foliage, it's just really well done.\n\nProbably the greatest highlight in any Bioware (in this case, Obsidian) game are the characters. As I already pointed out, Obsidian did this one, but it's the sequel to a Bioware game. Bioware always sets a standard when gathering companions and what their perks are and how they interact with the player character during certain random events and whatnot. Each of the characters are unique and have their own unique sets of dialog in various situations, it's what's so remarkable about RPG games such as this. No other developer really goes that far and beyond to create such a wide and diverse set of characters that the player can bring along on their adventure.\n\nReally, a great game. A masterpiece. Brilliant ending, too. It really should have led the way for a third game, but instead, we got that MMO. Still waiting on KoToR III Bioware or Obsidian!\n\n10/10","February 23","true","46.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have only done one playthrough and it took me more than 65 hours to complete. It has all of the features of the original game and has added many new ones that seamlessly integrate with this second entry in the series. The story is rich and in-depth and the characters are memorable for the most part but feel a little flatter in this game than they did in the first. It also cleverly uses mechanics so that you can compete missions and fights in a variety of fashions and lots of your choices have very visible effects, but not all of them. Overall, this is a good game.\n\nHOWEVER, I played the first KOTOR on my smartphone and I must say I prefer that one easily over this one, though for mostly personal reasons. The story of the first one felt tighter and more polished whereas with this game it feels like they tried to stretch it out for no good reason. I felt plagued by unnecessarily long fights as a result of too many enemies and zones that are large but I couldn't see the reason why they had to be so large. I also am a completionist so I try to do every sidequest possible and so quickly became annoyed with the constant trecking and back-tracking all over every map. There is also the fact that the characters are there but feel flatter and less developed than they did in the first game; they also don't feel like they are crucial part of stroy like they did in the first game. Finally is the fact that this story just doesn't feel as good as the one from the first KOTOR. I felt like it left too many loose ends, the plot twists fell flat, and it just plain left me feeling unsatisfied as compared to the first entry there just isn't a sense of closure.\n\nNow, a lot of this has to do with personal taste and so someone else might completely disagree. As for bugginess I didn't encounter any bugs, glitches, etc. during my playthrough.\n\nIn conclusion: I would recommend the game, but I'm worried you'll feel less satisfied if you've already played the first KOTOR.","May 30","true","65.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Keep in mind though that it 'is' a 2005 game, so don't expect anything incredible. 8/10\n\nStory: Here is where TSL shines. I have quite honestly never played a Star wars game with such in depth writing. From the deep and well thought out exploration of the moral grey areas between the Light and Dark sides of the Force to the deviously intricate, and VERY well written main quest, KOTOR II's writing is nothing short of incredible. 10/10\n\nCharacterization: This of course ties in with the aforementioned excellent writing. The characters in this game feel more like living, breathing people, and less like the one dimensional caricatures of KOTOR 1. The addition of a good influence character influence system (you can't just give characters gifts to 'make' them like you ala Dragon age: Origins) that prevents you from pleasing everyone increses my score from what would have been a 9.5/10 to an outright 10/10\n\nCombat: Combat is greatly improved over KOTOR I's rather basic system. As you improve your combat feats, they don't just become more effective: they change visably as well, becoming more graceful, powerful, and masterful-looking all the time. 9.5/10\n\nGeneral overview: I probably should rate the game's overall sound quality, but i'm not very good at distinguishing good game audio from bad due to hearing issues. Sorry about that. Overall, i would rate this game a 9.5/10. Besides Battlefronts 1 and 2 and Star Wars Galaxies, KOTOR II is one of the best Star Wars experiences you will ever have (BE SURE to download the Restored Content mod, as it will unlock much of the content that Obsidian was forced to cut out due to LucasArts' unreasonably short Christmas Deadline).","May 12","true","71.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is BUGGY. I mean very very buggy. Before you go, install the latest version of The Sith Lord Content Restore Mod (TSLCRM). It fixed a lot of bugs and restored some content that was not presented in the game because Obsidian rushed the game to the market. Yet, the game still feels unpolished. SIde quests may be bugged out, your characters will be randomly stuck in odd locations, and the companion AI is very dumb.\nIf you can standl the bugged out quests in your journal and all the other weird bugs you may encounter, Kotor 2 is a very unique Star Wars and RPG experience. The story did not take the straightfoward good-defeat-evil cliche like in the first game, instead, it is very deep. I think it's probably one of the best Star Wars story out there. It also looks very cinematic. Some camera moves during cutscenes are very well done. The ending is left to be desired however.\nGameplaywise, the game is pretty much the same with the first one with some new skills and combat animation. You can mess around with almost all the items. If you played the first Kotor or other DND games like Dragon Age, you won't take too much time to get your hands on.\nTo be concluded, it's a very good game. Buggy, but still good.

The story follows a jedi exile, canonically a female, however a choice of male doesn't affect the storyline in any way besides dialogue options, and is a story of loss, betrayal, ardousness and above all redemption. From amazing scenery, to great weapons and an addictive turn based combat system with pause features, this game is one of the most enjoyable from bioware and an integral part of the star wars canon of the Old Republic days.

Large sections of the game were cut due to time constraints, a tragedy. This game is great without all the content, and I believe I speak for everyone who has played this game that it could have been so much greater had LucasArts given Obsidian the time required to complete it. Knights of the Old Republic III was eventually cancelled, leaving many fans wondering just exactly what happened. Later on, an MMO was made by BioWare in an attempt to complete the saga, to many fans distaste. A book titled Revan was written to bridge the gap between the MMO and this game, however it wasn't the KotOR 3 we asked for.\n\n"Also, in private, we will be mercifully free from the opinions of imbeciles and fools."\n\nKnights of the Old Republic II is a major improvement upon the first game. Don't get me wrong, the first is one of  if not the greatest RPG of all time, but the whole Good/Evil thing is overdone throughout Star Wars and Obsidian changed that a good bit with the sequel ("If you are to truly understand, then you will need the contrast, not adherence to a single idea.") . Rather than having the typical BioWare Good, Evil, and Neutral option, the game presents you with hard choices and makes you think. Perhaps by giving credits to the poor beggar, you have only made his life harder for him. Any who believe that BioWare should be making KotOR 3 and not Obsidian is sadly mistaken.\n\n"Find what you were looking for amongst the dead?"\n\nThis game despite it's age still has an active modding community, whether it be weapons, armor, or even some updated textures to make the game feel and look much newer than it is.

Known not only for the sequel to KotOR, but also the sequels to Fallout 3, and Neverwinter Nights, and also making the 3rd Dungeon Siege game. One thing we can learn from these guys track record is that while they will sometimes make a decent engine seem a lot more buggy, they have a good ability to craft an even better story than their predecessors (most of the time). And that is no different in KotOR 2.\n\nTaking the ball that Bioware handed off, and running full force with it, Obsidian brings players back to the world of the old Republic, and puts them back in the role of a Jedi, and his or her team as they battle the evil forces of the dark side, or ultimately succumb to it. More so in this game than its predecessor, you actually feel the changes in your choices having an impact on your entire team, and people you meet.  You can be the good jedi, following the righteous path and helping those in need. You can go straight evil, and fell those who get in your way despite being good natured. You can be sneaky and devious, neutral, or whatever you wish. Most dialogue paths have a good number of options to change the outcomes. Ultimately though, it either leads to a gain in light or dark side points, or nothing at all. So play it how you want!\n\nKotOR 2 is a team based RPG adventure game, with 3D visuals, and battles happening in real time, with a mix of turn based elements that use the age old 'dice rules' method for any moves you may choose to dish out to your foes in the heat of battle. You see enemies, you choose your moves. You can also switch between one of the 3 currently chosen party characters at will at any time, during and out of battle to strategize. And over the course of the game, you will find a number of teammates to accompany you on your adventure. Some required for the adventure, and some can tag along based on choices you make. Like in most RPGs, you can gain new skills and abilities by leveling up. Speaking of which, the level cap from KotOR 1 has not been rasied, but rather, removed!\n\nRather than taking place on 1 world, like in most RPGs, KotOR 2 will have you venturing across many different planets on your journey. Aside from a lengthy first few areas, the game opens up into something grand and open ended after about the 3 or 4 hour mark, with several planets to explore. You will travel from planet to planet on your ship, the Ebon Hawk, which is also where can converse with your entire team. Once on a planets surface, feel free to explore the locals. Shop, talk to people. Do side quests. And more! There are a few mini games even to be found in the game, including a card game, and a sort of pod racing mini game.\n\nWhile there is a lot to be said positvely about KotOR 2, it is not without its faults. The game is still a bit buggy, but not as much as when it first came out. Animations can be a little off when interacting with objects. Characters can get still get stuck. Sometimes characters will stand in odd places when conversing, and more. Also, there is little adjusting for graphical settings. You will pretty much need to mod the game if you want to play it at your monitors resolution. It can be a hassle, but it is easily done with the right tools, and very much worth it. Modded, KotOR 2 looks a helluva lot better than what I remembered playing many years ago.\n\nBottom line, if you are a Star Wars, or an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to pick up one of the games that helped pave the way for games like Mass Effect.

This adds a bunch of cut content back, including an entire planet worth of quests.  With the patches, the game is much more complete than the chopped up version Lucasarts released back in Dec 04.  They pushed an xmas release and robbed us of this great game at it's potential.  Obsidian wanted to push a patch, but Lucasarts nixed that idea.\n\nDespite any flaws from it's release, this is still an Obsidian game meets Star Wars.  The insane layered, subtle, nuanced writing of that team shines.  High Light Side alignment, quintessential Jedi, but still my choices make me..uncomfortable.  Is there even good and bad, or is it all based on perspective?  The influence meter was revolutionary back in 2004, and still used in Bioware games today.  Lots of uncomfortable dialogue choices that leave you wondering whether you truly made the correct decision or not.

And it is fun to play in 800x600 window (messes up your desktop, by the way, each time you launch the game), with the mouse escaping every time you move it and the top of the screen not showing. Well done, game developers, well done. ("Well, it's an Obsidian game" isn't excuse enough)\n\nHowever, is it worth it?\n\nHell yes. It is an enjoyable game (when it works). Until you get the ending, that is. You shove the evil space witch down the pit (Return of the Jedi, much?) and then... nothing. No ceremonies, no parties, no closure, nothing but the credit roll. Even Mass Effect 3 had better ending.\n\nDarth Nihilus (the coverboy, isn't even the main antagonist) is pretty pointless. Sure he looks badass as hell, but in the game he isn't established nearly enough until you already destroyed him alongside his flagship. Also he gives no dialogue to even introduce himself.\n\nSpeaking of which, most of the character intros were a bit short as well. As in: "The duck are you? Where did you come from? Well, you might as well stay, here's a bloody lightsaber." Though I have to say I enjoyed some characters more than their Kotor counterparts, and vice versa. (Zaalbaar over Hanharr, and Atton over Carth any day)\n\nAlso, was it intentional to forbid the Darth Maul -looking guy from wearing any kind of robes? Those work overalls aren't wizard at all.\n\nThe game is also plagued by the problems that were in the first game also, for example the Dragon Age control scheme is back. You can't aim your blaster rifle yourself. And the messing with game files I mentioned earlier. Only here it is much more complicated.\n\nOn the plus side, you could become a mercenary and sell your services to the highest bidder and it would show in the story, but there were less smuggling Gizkas and I think there wasn't any bounty hunting.\n\nThough despite all that it still was a fun ride, but I still like the first one better; the story and the characters are more fleshed out and makes you care more about them. And you can't import your save from the first game. I was a bit shocked to see Bastila again when I killed her in my playthrough.","February 24, 2015","true","30.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/208580/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Preface: I used the Restored Content Mod while playing this game.\n\nKotOR 2, this time brought to us by Obsidian Entertainment, at first glance appears to be its predecessor's hotter, younger cousin.  There are many fixes to complaints I had for the first game: better menu system (inventory management still needs work), cleaner, faster, better looking, containers show if they're empty, datapads are read automatically, even walking in spacesuits is faster (although it looks funny, seems they just upped the animation speed).  There are more force powers to use, cool special character abilities, and there's better rollplaying since there are a lot more options to what you can do.  For example if your level in Treat Injury is high then more dialogue options open up for you allowing you to truly play the game how you want!  Or...it actually doesn't.  This game was *extremely* aggravating at times.  Once again the designers felt like it was a good idea to throw you into 1v1 duels, so the belief that you could actually roleplay was a mere fantasy that is ripped from your fingers less than a quarter through the game.  To make it worse, there are sections where there are *unskippable cutscenes* right before duels.  This is the biggest pain ever, especially if you're already getting annoyed at the required 1v1 battles you go through.  I would highly recommend ignoring anything but force and battle prowess (melee too, blasters blow), not only for your main character, but for *all* of your characters.  That's right!  It wasn't bad enough making your main character duel, now a large portion of your companions have to do battles (or even entire segments of the game - ie long dungeons) by themselves.  The worst offender of this has to be the HK factory, where you're expected to use HK-47 against an army of droids.  It was terrible, I literally *could not* play through that section the way I built my HK-47.  It made me feel as if I was playing "wrong".  No game should have that effect, *especially* an RPG.  Luckily this game has a console that you can enable because that was the only way to struggle through that section of the game.  As if this complaint wasn't bad enough, the *most important* part of an RPG, the storytelling, wasn't very good.  I enjoyed the journey of the original much more than I did in KotOR 2.  Even *with* the rcm I felt like some of the character's backstories were done halfway through the game and the plot and storytelling was convoluted to put it lightly.  Your companions *attack* each other, seemingly without consequence at times.  It was confusing and distracting.  And the ending straight up sucked.  It was literally dialogue choices, and this is coming from a guy who didn't mind Deus Ex: HR's ending.\n\nThis game didn't just need a restored content mod, it needed a drastic overhaul, fix, and rewrite - that's the only reason I can recommend this game - the modding community.  It's really big, even to this day.  The RCM is the tip of the iceberg, and if you didn't like the way the game did something you can probably fix it.\n\nPros:\n\nMods\nUpgraded Engine\nT3-M4 has a personailty now!\n\n\nCons:\n\nStorytelling\nBuggy\nGameplay\nHK-47's personailty sucks now!\n\nThis game really disappointed me.  It had so much potential but fell flat on its face.  I recommend it if you like getting your hands dirty with mods as that's the only redeeming factor KotOR 2 has.  If you're looking for a good sci-fi RPG play the Mass Effect series instead - and I *like* Star Wars.

(Support for gamepads are from a new update, but don't do the game full service)\n\nHowever, the game seems to be rich in dialogue, characters, Star Wars lore, and filled with RPG elements and plenty of loot to make each step feel rewarding. It does a great job to make you feel like you are in a large Star Wars Universe filled with uncertanties and adventure. (controlling droids is actually pretty cool)\n\nThe combat system is... kind of dated. It's basically a real time action turn-based system where you select what attack you want to do, and your character will basically move for you and do the attack.  I kind of feel like this is where I was let down.  If there is ever a sequel, I'm hoping that it'll be more like an FPS or Third-Person with more user control.\n\nOverall, I feel like it's a good, but a bit dated. If you are a fan of RPGs, want some Star Wars lore, and are okay playing with some PS2 era graphics / gameplay, than I'd definitely reccomend this for $5 or so.","October 21, 2015","true","1.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","6"

Through no fault of their own they were forced to release an unfinished game, leaving us with some plotlines that didn't go anywhere and quite a few bugs. Although Obsidian were denied the chance to fix their game through patches by Lucasarts, modders went to work on restoring a lot of cut content and fixing bugs. I waited for a lot of years and saw a couple projects dissolve, but eventually one came out and it's pretty great.

Unfortunately, like its predecessor, KOTOR II's Steam version is incredibly broken. Like with the original game, to even get past the opening logos I had to disable the game's movies. The resolution problems the previous game has are here too. I managed to play the prologue and the first chapter, but attempting to travel to the next planet via the galaxy map caused the game to crash every time I tried. Even if there was a way to fix this issue I'm not sure I would bother, as my desire to play this game has been completely sapped thanks to the host of issues it has. What makes this even more annoying is that from what I've played it actually looks to be a very good game. The gameplay is very similar to the original, but with more polish. The animations are more numerous and better done, the UI and menus are much simpler, and the voice acting is considerably better. However, it doesn't matter how good this game is because you won't be able to get far enough to enjoy it. The old Star Wars games available on Steam seem to be broken more than often than not, and I'm afraid Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is no exception.\n\nSteam version: 2/10.\n\nDon't buy the Steam version of this game.

Although unfinished on release, the Restored Content Mod on Steam Workshop is easy to install and not only fixes many of the bugs but also adds "new" parts to the game that I hadn't seen before when I played. Like its predecessor, Knights of the Old Republic 2 has interesting party members and plenty of dialogue, with even more replay value. More items and upgrades, powers and classes, etc. Well worth the $10 and you can get much more out of it than that!","November 10, 2015","true","114.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thus, the plot has some noticeable gaps and seems choppy\n-Mild bugginess, but nothing game breaking\n\nOverall: First, it's worth mentioning that there is a Restored Content Mod that Obsidian took part in allowing.  This mod adds a lot of cut content, including an entire plot arc with HK-47, back into the game.  If you buy this, you should absolutely install that mod as well.\n\nThat said, Obsidian took up the reins and did the series justice.  It's unfortunate that they had to rush the game near the end, because the plot is fantastic and really deserved to have its day.  But the gameplay is still fun, immersive, and captivating, and the amount of customiztaion for your character has only increased from the first game.  It's a pleasure to play, and rarely does the game become tedious.  Instead it's just a fun ride from start to finish.\n\nBottom Line: Absolutely recommend","December 3, 2015","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To this day, after hundreds of games, it is still one of my absolute favorites. It has one of the best stories, a great combat system, gorgeous graphics (even by today's standards).\n\nUnlike most games being thrown at us with a big "BUY ME!" sign attached to it these days, this game actually makes you feel what you are doing. If you help that random person with a few credits, you feel like you actually matter in the universe. If you kill that person and steal the 3 cr. they had in their pocket, you actually feel terrible for it (unless you really are that cold heartless person that belongs with the Sith). You take note of your actions in this game, and every little detail and encounter/conversation is memorable.\n\nThat being said, there is one problem I have encountered. Just one. In order to make this game work in wide screen, and higher resolutions, you have to do a little work. But don't let this deter you from playing it, as this little set-back will not effect your gameplay experience at all, only your screen size is affected.\n\nI whole-heartedly guarantee that this game will become a favorite for you as well. There is no doubt about it, you will love this game, and may even fall in love with it's characters.","January 8, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everyone talks about how it was rushed, it's buggy, there's a lot of things unfinished, and honestly I can't really dispute those claims. BUT, this game, for me, is actually better than the first one.\n\nThe dialogue in this game surpasses KOTOR I's dialogue by leaps and bounds. Honestly, I have never, and probably never will, experience such incredible storytelling as Obsidian's writers managed to pull off. Your story of being the last Jedi, exiled from your rightful title after a horrible war, will drag you through the jungle moon of Dxun, the dry, evil sands of Korriban, and the gangster paradise of Nar Shaddaa, to name a few. The first character you meet, Kreia, shoud be forever considered one of the most interesting characters ever created in a video game. She is so mysterious and wise that you can't help but be influenced by her presence, and every dialogue tree with her makes you crave more after it's over.\n\nI love the dynamism of light side and dark side in this game. Being the last Jedi, you can choose to walk the path of redemption, reclaiming your rightful title as Jedi once more, or doom the galaxy to eternal pain and suffering, becoming an incredibly powerful Sith Lord. All the possible choices you have in certain scenarios give you Light Side or Dark Side points, and building your character to become an unstoppable force, slaughtering everyone in sight, is hilariously entertaining.\n\nI played the Xbox version previously before I bought it on the PC, and I can tell you, if you look up TSL Restoration Mod, the creators have done an AMAZING job bringing back all the things that Obsidian wasn't able to deliver on due to the rushed production. I think that many people think KOTOR II is inferior to I for this reason, but with the restoration, I don't think that there's any real argument that this game wouldn't have completely outshadowed KOTOR I in every way.","February 26, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's execution is very simple yet very effective, something games tend to miss these days; being too complex for the sake of complexity.\n\nThe storyline (while a little cliche) is extremely well written and thought out, revealing itself slowly to the character as they make their own choices through the game. Characters like Atton Rand and especially Kreia have very deep and rich backstories that not only add to the fantastic story and atmosphere to the game, but will also change depending on what you do in the game. Depending on the choices you make, some characters will favor you while others will not. For example, if you decide to execute a criminal, one character might applaud you for such an action while another will disapprove. All these choices affect how much information you can gather from them during your playtime.\n\nThe combat is simple, and if you've played the original Knights of the Old Republic, you know exactly what to expect. This is not a bad thing, however. If you enjoy pause/point-and-click combat, then you have nothing to worry about.\n\nKeep in mind, this game was released in 2005, so the graphics aren't going to be hyper-realistic and since the game was rushed during development constrictions, content WAS cut from the final release. That being said, there was a fan-made mod that actually restored all the lost content - You can find it with a simple google search: "KOTOR 2 TSLRCM"\n\nHad this game been given the time it deserved for development, it would have been WIDELY recognized as one of the best RPG's ever made. Nonetheless, Obsidian Entertainment did a fantastic job taking the reigns from Bioware, and formed a story that was ten-times more interesting and engaging than the first game, introducing rich characters - both fearsome and loving - and bringing moral choices that sculpt your very adventure.\n\nDo NOT miss this game - It's worth your time.\n\n9/10","January 3, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aspyr hasn't added any content to the game, but they have ported it and updated it to run on modern computers. This includes Windows 10, Mac, and even Linux.\n\nPlus Steam Workshop support has been added, though it should be used with caution. There's a crippling bug that causes the game to crash if you have more than 5 Workshop mods installed at once. This is easily circumvented, though, since there's still severeal KotOR2 mod sites still online with most of the same mods. I use Workshop for the Restored Content Mod and Skip Paragus. Everything else I install manually.\n\nGraphically, there's no escaping that this game was originally designed with the PS2 and original Xbox in mind. The models are as chunky as they come, and some of the textures are downright blurry. Oddly, some textures are amazingly sharp and crisp, while others are not, and there's some fairly advanced shader effects scattered around that seem unlikely to be from the original version. It feels like Aspyr is slowly improving the textures and other graphics, but I cannot prove that.\n\nAs for the quality of the game itself, it's one of my favorites. I played the living tar out of this on my Xbox back in the day. It's a great story with plenty to explore and a combat system that allows some complex strategy. If you like to min/max stats, this is a great game for you. There's thousands of items all with unique stats and effects, as well as the ability to customize many items with upgrades. Specialize your characters to create synergy in combat.\n\nGRIPES!\nThis is far from a perfect game.\nIn terms of Aspyr's changes, the game is much more playable than it was before, but there's still some problems. Workshop is only just working, as I've mentioned. Then there's an issue with the game minimizing every time there's a cutscene. It's only midly inconvenient, but it is worth mentioning. I like to think Aspyr's still working on these issues, though.\n\nThen there's the issues with the game as it was and always will be. The start of the story is slow. Like crazy slow. It isn't bad the first time playing though, but after a few replays it gets very tedious since there's not a lot of choice you can make that early in the game. Fortunately, there's a mod to fix that.","August 30, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whereas the first game has a very "New Hope" kind of feel to it; a very classic Star Wars type heroic tale of galatic grandeur, this game delves into the more personal and darker elements of the Star Wars universe.  Character development is extremely thorough and integral to the story, along with the tremendous focus on party member relations.  Improves on all fronts.  Easily a top five pick for me.

KotOR II is just as good as the first and continues to move onward with the story and events after KotOR I. Age hasn't been too kind to it, the graphics aren't the best and it's buggy at best on newer OS, but that doesn't stop it from being a true legendary classic. And look at that, a decade later and it gets updated to fix most problems and allow for us to return to KotOR II a few more times. Just because it got this big update don't think it's bug free, there's still plenty of them. For me I get achievements in weird locations for no reason - I got the Dancing Queen achievement when I left Peragus and didn't get the Peragus achievement until I got a little further into Telos. Not to mention the money achievement I randomly got when I made a small barter - but that's okay. There's no real game breaking bugs or anything and it's stable. It's a very good game and is usually set at a low price. If you love Star Wars or RPGs on a whole this is a must have along with KotOR I. I recommend starting with KotOR I first then moving on to two as you'll probably get pretty confused. The combat system is similar to an MMO, usually I'm not a fan of this combat system in single-player games but it actually works pretty good. Granted it could be better, but for a 2005 game there's nothing wrong with it.","November 27, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So they walked over to Obsidian entertainment and knocked on the door and formed an agreement to allow Obsidian to develop KoTor 2 for them. However, Bioware was impatient so they only had a year of development time to work on it.\n\nObsidian sat down and immediatley got to work, as the studio only had around 10-15 people working in it at the time, all the time they had was invaluable. Lots of time was spent making assests that were never put into the final game, thus, time was spent. Obsidians greatest strength was in the writing department, as they did not view moral choices just as a simple "black & white" dialogue option. No, to them it was all grey, as in you could save the princess but you had to let the dragon destroy the village choices. In Obsidian's characters, everybody has a personality that expressed what kind of person every character was, just through talking to the player. Obsidian were true nobles in this field.\n\nAs Obsidian got closer to the deadline, more and more assests were cut from the final game. Leaving the original vision a "Treasure in a deep sea of monsters." Many assests were cut and untested and unfiltered bugs were present due to the short QA testing period that was received. Distraught as they were at the final product, Obsidian regretted spending too much time developing certain assests of the game and too little time in other parts.\n\nWith fear of negative criticism from the press, fans, and of course Bioware, Obsidian took to the internet to see what the public was saying about KoToR 2. To their surprise, the fans loved it with negative criticism going toward the number of many bugs and glitches that were present, and postive criticism going toward everything included in the writing, especially the dialogue from party members like Kreia and Atton. Given the number of people working at Obsidian at the time and the amount of time they had, Obsidian managed to turn a Hardees into a Jack-in-the-box. Kreia even went on to win "Most Original character of the year" from Gamespy that year.\n\nObsidian learning from their first project, went on to make memorable game such as Alpha Protocol, Neverwinter Nights 2 + Expansions, Fallout: New Vegas (which suffered a similar experience), and soon to be South Park: The Stick of truth and Pillars of Eternity. If you like RPG's with great characters and grey morality, then Obsidian has it down.\n","February 26, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

This year the Episode III also came out, so it was a big year of Star Wars to me.\nAs a kid the Star Wars galaxy was a big part of me, and still is.\n\nWhy is this relevant to this review?\nBecause Kotor 2 made me a real diehard fan of star wars. It's awesome story, it's voice acting, dark post-jedi war atmosphere that you can feel in the game world all the time and through dialog, the path you take: dark side and light side both have a lot of cool influence to the story, also the benefits of the allignments are pretty cool. And the prestige classes are awesome, imagine being a jedi weapon master, or a bad ♥♥♥ Darth Maul like Sith Assassin with a spinning double-blade.\nThe game is a big part of me, even with it's flaws like the bugs and plotholes, but after saying this there is a one thing........\nAs most of the guys in the Kotor 2 community may or may not know, there is a mod called Restored Content mod, or TSLRCM, that brings a huge amount of cut content back to the game, fixes the biggest plotholes, fixes a ton of bugs and makes the game even more awesome. Seriously, after playing with tslrcm for 4 years, I can't imagine to play without it. The game is really in its finished state with the mod.

This reviewer think that said mod is a necessary part of the game at this point and can't be separated from the vanilla game itself]\nStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is a sequel to the original roleplaying game by BioWare by Obsidian Entertainment. Set once again centuries before the Star Wars' movies timeline, The Sith Lords' story picks up immediately where the story of the first game ended: the galactic Republic is now in disarray due to the Jedi civil war and Sith forces still run rampart through its planets, with the Jedi order in ruin and no Force practicioneers in sight. You take the role of a Jedi who has been exiled from his/her order before the civil war and your objective is to survive the dark forces coming after you and discover the true reasons behind your punishment and the origin of your peculiar connection to the Force.\nAs far the gameplay goes, the Sith Lords manages to be a better roleplaying game than its predecessor. Several gameplay elements have been overhauled or change to support different styles of play and to truly allow you to build a character following your tastes AND be able to overcome the game's challenges. While in the first Knights of the Old Republic the balance favored pure melee Jedi characters, now other specializations and characters have a chance too: enemies are less prone to resist Force powers, making them viable for pure damage or CC, and both melee weapons and blasters can now benefit from unique upgrades that really give lightsabers a run for their money. It's worth mentioning however that the Sith Lords' endgame somehow favors caster characters: by that point in the game the Force points (your mana, if you will) regen rateo has become gargantuan, allowing you to spam damaging spells or incapacitating effects ad nauseam (something that becomes really useful, since the last portion of the game are a series of straight fights against crowds of opponents).\nThe Sith Lords' main new gameplay gimmick is the influence system. The companions you travel with will react to your actions and choices, approving them or else following their own moral compass and objectives: therefore, your influence with them will increase or decrease accordingly. Having an high influence with a character means unlocking new conversation options and even the possibility to turn him/her into a Jedi. The main downside of the influence system is however that the parameter is increased mainly during world events, so you'll manage to get a good influence with the characters you'll use most only. Another gimmick the game likes to throw at you is the sudden playable characters changes: at many points during the game you will be forced to put aside your main character to play in the shoes of one or more companions. While these sequences are interesting in their own right and have their place in the main story, they can easily becomes frustrating if you are forced to play a character you are not familiar with or whom you neglected beforehead.\nKnights of the Old Republic II is also infamous for the somehow shifting quality of its levels. There are some levels that are universally loathed by the playerbase, with the two main examples being Peragus (which is quite long for being your first proper level after the tutorial prologue, with the story going on at a snail's pace) and Nar Shaddaa (which is another planet that takes far too long as far as the main quest goes, requires a lot of backtracking and has a brutal endgame). Also, the final area of the game, Malachor V, hasn't many fans around due to having been hit the worst by the rushed development cycle and consisting in a series of straight fights against several opponents with little to none interaction or exploration involved.\nStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords remains a very divisive game in pretty much ever aspect, even the story and the setting. Some people like the deconstruction the writers wanted to pull off on the Star Wars canon as a whole and the main morality system of the series, while others find it pretentious and too much shoehorned. Some people see the game as an incomplete, rushed mess, while others can somehow get past the blatantly missing part and enjoy what they got their hands on. Personally, while the Sith Lords could had been a far stronger sequel and a Star Wars RPG in its own right, I found myself enjoying it more often than not due to the high level of the writing, the refined and more custom gameplay and its central interesting themes","July 31, 2015","true","44.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still, a review isn't about what something could have been but rather, what something is.\n\nIf you liked KotOR 1, KotOR 2 is more of that but refined, enhanced, and... admittedly, yes, buggier. However, the bugs (in general) are rarely crippling and the more serious ones tend to be both not universally experienced, and tend to only occur in side missions (like swoop racing). As for gameplay, combat is streamlined while still providing plenty of options for variety what with blasters, lightsabers, Force powers, and special attacks. Feats, equipment and their myriad upgrades, and to a lesser degree skills allow for crazy amounts of customization while remaining simple enough to easily understand.\n\nThe story is really where KotOR 2 shines through, though. As mentioned before, the game was a rushed job and much had to get cut at the last moment, however aside from the final stretch most missing plot threads are in the minor side quests and are only missing the very end that some may not even notice. Dialogue is natural and is one of the few examples where dialogue trees actually work well. Very little exposition (if any at all) is given straight through endless monologues, but is woven in from bits and pieces grasped from various characters (including the main - no amnesiacs here) including some who outright lie (and well, might I add)! Every playable character is well characterized with great personalities and motivations that are believeable enough not to make us question why they hate everyone else on the ship stick to the main character regardless (except maybe Visas...)\nThis game is also much darker than it's predecessor. It's enough that whether you liked or were simply lukewarm towards the original Star Wars trilogy of movies while the new trilogy left you cold, you are practically guaranteed to appreciate this game. On the other hand, if you really liked all of the Star Wars movies you may find the departure from the standard too much for your tastes. Honestly, despite the lightsabers and Jedi, there are points when KotOR 2 almost doesn't even feel like Star Wars (which I actually liked, to be honest).\n\nOne last thing that is worth mentioning - while a significant portion of the game was unfinished at the time of its release, a group of fans have been digging up the not-quite-removed game files, finishing them up, and reconnecting them to the game. It is very well done (particularly for a group of fans digging through broken scraps), adds much to the game, and helps fill in most of the holes in the story. Just search for The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod.","February 3, 2013","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadPrez14/recommended/208580/","DeadPrez14","DeadPrez14","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadPrez14/","52 products in account","The Sequel to the Bioware masterpiece, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords, is another incredible gaming experience and an important addition to the Star Wars universe. This game has a much darker undertone than its predecessor and although the plot arc isn't quite as rewarding as the first game, it still manages to stay faithful to it with an interesting plot twist. The gameplay is enhanced from the original with more feats, powers, weapons, customization options, and levels available, as well as new Jedi and sith prestige classes. The squad you recruit changes depending on your gender, and your alignment with the force, and some can be trained to use the force and become Jedi. Squad members remain interesting characters and now change based on the player's interactions with them. Several characters from the first game return (though not all are playable characters) and the Ebon Hawk is still your personal starship. Your journey takes you to a handful of worlds in the Star Wars Universe, some are new and some you may remember visiting or hearing about from the first game.\nFor a more enjoyable and complete experience I would recommend all players download the TSL: RCM from the workshop or internet. The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification add in many things that the original game lacked due to time constraints in development. A community project which took many years to perfect, this mod adds a whole slew of new content to the game which big or small, makes the overall experience twice as enjoyable. For those who have only played the Xbox version of the game, or did not previously have the mod installed, you will find that this mod makes it a whole new experience.\n\nThe recent update that adds achievements and workshop support is the best thing to happen to this game in the last decade. Now that everyone can add mods to this game AND earn some achievements, this game has new life breathed into it. I give it a 9/10.","August 6, 2015","true","127.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the newest update adding widescreen support, that almost perfects the game for me.

Whereas the first game has a very "New Hope" kind of feel to it; a very classic Star Wars type heroic tale of galatic grandeur, this game delves into the more personal and darker elements of the Star Wars universe.  Character development is extremely thorough and integral to the story, along with the tremendous focus on party member relations.  Improves on all fronts.  Easily a top five pick for me.  Worth $10, but sometimes it goes on sale for as low as $5 or $2.50.

Aspyr hasn't added any content to the game, but they have ported it and updated it to run on modern computers. This includes Windows 10, Mac, and even Linux.\n\nPlus Steam Workshop support has been added, though it should be used with caution. There's a crippling bug that causes the game to crash if you have more than 5 Workshop mods installed at once. This is easily circumvented, though, since there's still severeal KotOR2 mod sites still online with most of the same mods. I use Workshop for the Restored Content Mod and Skip Paragus. Everything else I install manually.\n\nGraphically, there's no escaping that this game was originally designed with the PS2 and original Xbox in mind. The models are as chunky as they come, and some of the textures are downright blurry. Oddly, some textures are amazingly sharp and crisp, while others are not, and there's some fairly advanced shader effects scattered around that seem unlikely to be from the original version. It feels like Aspyr is slowly improving the textures and other graphics, but I cannot prove that.\n\nAs for the quality of the game itself, it's one of my favorites. I played the living tar out of this on my Xbox back in the day. It's a great story with plenty to explore and a combat system that allows some complex strategy. If you like to min/max stats, this is a great game for you. There's thousands of items all with unique stats and effects, as well as the ability to customize many items with upgrades. Specialize your characters to create synergy in combat.\n\nGRIPES!\nThis is far from a perfect game.\nIn terms of Aspyr's changes, the game is much more playable than it was before, but there's still some problems. Workshop is only just working, as I've mentioned. Then there's an issue with the game minimizing every time there's a cutscene. It's only midly inconvenient, but it is worth mentioning. I like to think Aspyr's still working on these issues, though.\n\nThen there's the issues with the game as it was and always will be. The start of the story is slow. Like crazy slow. It isn't bad the first time playing though, but after a few replays it gets very tedious since there's not a lot of choice you can make that early in the game. Fortunately, there's a mod to fix that.","August 30, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just to make sure you know: this wasn't the studio's fault - LucasArts gave them less than half the time they actually needed to finish the game. Still, a review isn't about what something could have been but rather, what something is.\n\nIf you liked KotOR 1, KotOR 2 is more of that but refined, enhanced, and... admittedly, yes, buggier. However, the bugs (in general) are rarely crippling and the more serious ones tend to be both not universally experienced, and tend to only occur in side missions (like swoop racing). As for gameplay, combat is streamlined while still providing plenty of options for variety what with blasters, lightsabers, Force powers, and special attacks. Feats, equipment and their myriad upgrades, and to a lesser degree skills allow for crazy amounts of customization while remaining simple enough to easily understand.\n\nThe story is really where KotOR 2 shines through, though. As mentioned before, the game was a rushed job and much had to get cut at the last moment, however aside from the final stretch most missing plot threads are in the minor side quests and are only missing the very end that some may not even notice. Dialogue is natural and is one of the few examples where dialogue trees actually work well. Very little exposition (if any at all) is given straight through endless monologues, but is woven in from bits and pieces grasped from various characters (including the main - no amnesiacs here) including some who outright lie (and well, might I add)! Every playable character is well characterized with great personalities and motivations that are believeable enough not to make us question why they hate everyone else on the ship stick to the main character regardless (except maybe Visas...)\nThis game is also much darker than it's predecessor. It's enough that whether you liked or were simply lukewarm towards the original Star Wars trilogy of movies while the new trilogy left you cold, you are practically guaranteed to appreciate this game. On the other hand, if you really liked all of the Star Wars movies you may find the departure from the standard too much for your tastes. Honestly, despite the lightsabers and Jedi, there are points when KotOR 2 almost doesn't even feel like Star Wars (which I actually liked, to be honest).\n\nOne last thing that is worth mentioning - while a significant portion of the game was unfinished at the time of its release, a group of fans have been digging up the not-quite-removed game files, finishing them up, and reconnecting them to the game. It is very well done (particularly for a group of fans digging through broken scraps), adds much to the game, and helps fill in most of the holes in the story.

It's Obsidian doing what they do best, setting lofty goals for their projects and just barely missing the mark because they bit off more than they could chew.\n\nThe Peragus mining facility goes on for far too long. It could have been cut in half or just cut entirely with you starting off on Telos. The fact Peragus/Telos is so long makes replaying the game unappealing solely because of how much time you have to sink into the game before you're finally allowed to explore the other planets. Many story arcs and companions are woefully underdone and stand in stark contrast to the ones that are well written and very fleshed out. Another minute complaint is that Handmaiden and Disciple are not very well balanced against themselves, they shouldn't have had identical stats and feats.\n\nAll that aside, I like the more somber tone this game has over it's predcessor. The few story arcs they did finish are interesting, the few companions they did flesh out are really well done. The skills are balanced against themselves, no one of them is so bad it should never be taken by the PC. The crafting was very well implemented. The amount of customization allowed for with your companions and the flexibility of the Exile leaves you for a lot of room to mix and match, something I really enjoy in games like this.\n\nWarts and all, I still think the positives of this outweigh the negatives. Look into the Restored Content fan patch, it adds a lot of interesting things and implements some of the content that had to be left on the cutting floor due to time and budget retraints.","October 3, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every game system is a refinement and extension of the first game; but more elegantly implemented and more polished.  The events and world of this story are natural outgrowths of the back-story or events of the first game;  but where the first game barely sketched the universe with stock characters, this game renders the fine details of the darkest days of the old republic with complex and compelling characters.\n\nThis is a game that tells the aftermath of the hero's journey. Depicted is a galaxy limping off and winding down after the great blows struck by the Mandalorian wars (in the back-story to the first game) and the Jedi civil war (the last half of which are the events of the first game).\n\nThe more complicated plot hides multiple interlocking stories, telling many tragedies. the characters are all richly developed, but there are no simple heroes or outright villains. the heroes are all tragic, with deep character flaws that drive them more then the events.  There are no clear villains because even the villains are tragedies in their own right, deftly interwoven with the larger narrative, and each a demonstration of their failures and a warning of the danger of their paths.\n\nYears of work by the community have restored the cut content and revealed the ambitious pattern of story threads lost to budget and time. Community fixes have corrected bugs and fixed issues, even to the point of hex editing and reverse engineering. Even the developers have gotten into the act, releasing a patch 10 years after publication (and subsequent commercial failure) adding support for high resolution wide screen monitors, steam achievements, and workshop mods.\n\nNow we have a game that approaches realization of the ambition of the developers, and delivers on that narrative with competence, provided you're willing to take the time and spend the effort to breath with it. Taken on it's own, it's fractious and oppressive world is a cautionary tale of hubris, but when combined with the original, it's a dark counterbalance to that bright tale, putting both into sharp relief. This truly is the “Empire” to the original KotOR's “New Hope”.\n\nThis is a deeply flawed game, but there is a genius beneath it's surface.","January 4","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's Obsidian doing what they do best, setting lofty goals for their projects and just barely missing the mark because they bit off more than they could chew.\n\nThe Peragus mining facility goes on for far too long. It could have been cut in half or just cut entirely with you starting off on Telos. The fact Peragus/Telos is so long makes replaying the game unappealing solely because of how much time you have to sink into the game before you're finally allowed to explore the other planets. Many story arcs and companions are woefully underdone and stand in stark contrast to the ones that are well written and very fleshed out. Another minute complaint is that Handmaiden and Disciple are not very well balanced against themselves, they shouldn't have had identical stats and feats.\n\nAll that aside, I like the more somber tone this game has over it's predcessor. The few story arcs they did finish are interesting, the few companions they did flesh out are really well done. The skills are balanced against themselves, no one of them is so bad it should never be taken by the PC. The crafting was very well implemented. The amount of customization allowed for with your companions and the flexibility of the Exile leaves you for a lot of room to mix and match, something I really enjoy in games like this.\n\nWarts and all, I still think the positives of this outweigh the negatives. Look into the Restored Content fan patch, it adds a lot of interesting things and implements some of the content that had to be left on the cutting floor due to time and budget retraints.","October 3, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Galaxy is picking up the pieces from the Jedi Civil War. Most of the Galaxy's surviving Jedi have either been killed or gone deep into hiding while a trio of Sith Lords, Darth Sion, Darth Nihilus, and a third unknown Sith Lord hunt down the Jedi with the intent of wiping them all out and finishing them off. Along the way, the Exile picks up allies such as the scoundrel and smuggler, Atton Rand, the mysterious blind woman Kreia, and Bao Dur the Iridonian technician. Some familiar faces come along for the ride as well such as T3-M4 and the fan favorite HK-47. Plus if you've played the original Knights of the Old Republic, you'll recognize the voice coming through the speakers of Mandalore's mask.\n\nIt's the first game I can think of where your character's gender and alignment detemines which allies you get. Males get the Handmaiden, an Echani woman who serves the Jedi yet isn't one due to an oath she and her sisters swore. Females get the Disciple, a researcher and historian looking into the Jedi and tries to determine their fate. Light Siders get Mira, a Bounty Huntress with a grenade/dart launcher on her wrist while Dark Siders get a deranged Wookiee with a bad attitude.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, KOTOR 2 takes the gameplay features of the original KOTOR and improves on it. Combat is virtually unchanged but other mechanics are improved such as the ability to equip two sets of weapons and swap between them as the need arises without having to go into the inventory screen to swap out blasters for a lightsaber. You also gain the ability to craft items such as blasters, simple armor sets, bladed weapons, and other items with a relatively simple crafting menu at workbenches and first aid stations. How you interact with your allies and other people determines how they react to you. Certain characters favor evil actions and become less willing to speak with you if you perform good actions. There are other characters who behave the opposite way and then there are characters like T3-M4 who is completely neutral and doesn't react either way.\n\nPrior to the "Great Canon Purge" after Disney acquired Lucasfilm and all of its associated properties, the Jedi Exile was recognized as a female named Meetra Surik who stayed true to the Light Side of the Force and the Jedi. However, you don't have to adhere to Canon and can play this game however you want.","November 21, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The more evil you are effect how good or evil your teammates are and how much they like you. if your team mates really like you they may awaken some new abilities.  look i could go on and on about this game but youve gotten this far into my "reveiw" and i can personally tell you as someone who spent countless hours playing this as a child and now 10 years later counless hours as a young adult just buy the game youll love it. and if you dont you can refund it and you can like internet crucify me (is that what the cool kids do i never know) but that wont happen i know you know and all the other reveiwers know\n\nadios amigos","November 28, 2015","true","90.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Thus, the plot has some noticeable gaps and seems choppy\n-Mild bugginess, but nothing game breaking\n\nOverall: First, it's worth mentioning that there is a Restored Content Mod that Obsidian took part in allowing.  This mod adds a lot of cut content, including an entire plot arc with HK-47, back into the game.  If you buy this, you should absolutely install that mod as well.\n\nThat said, Obsidian took up the reins and did the series justice.  It's unfortunate that they had to rush the game near the end, because the plot is fantastic and really deserved to have its day.  But the gameplay is still fun, immersive, and captivating, and the amount of customiztaion for your character has only increased from the first game.  It's a pleasure to play, and rarely does the game become tedious.  Instead it's just a fun ride from start to finish.\n\nBottom Line: Absolutely recommend","December 3, 2015","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's execution is very simple yet very effective, something games tend to miss these days; being too complex for the sake of complexity.\n\nThe storyline (while a little cliche) is extremely well written and thought out, revealing itself slowly to the character as they make their own choices through the game. Characters like Atton Rand and especially Kreia have very deep and rich backstories that not only add to the fantastic story and atmosphere to the game, but will also change depending on what you do in the game. Depending on the choices you make, some characters will favor you while others will not. For example, if you decide to execute a criminal, one character might applaud you for such an action while another will disapprove. All these choices affect how much information you can gather from them during your playtime.\n\nThe combat is simple, and if you've played the original Knights of the Old Republic, you know exactly what to expect. This is not a bad thing, however. If you enjoy pause/point-and-click combat, then you have nothing to worry about.\n\nKeep in mind, this game was released in 2005, so the graphics aren't going to be hyper-realistic and since the game was rushed during development constrictions, content WAS cut from the final release. That being said, there was a fan-made mod that actually restored all the lost content - You can find it with a simple google search: "KOTOR 2 TSLRCM"\n\nHad this game been given the time it deserved for development, it would have been WIDELY recognized as one of the best RPG's ever made. Nonetheless, Obsidian Entertainment did a fantastic job taking the reigns from Bioware, and formed a story that was ten-times more interesting and engaging than the first game, introducing rich characters - both fearsome and loving - and bringing moral choices that sculpt your very adventure.\n\nDo NOT miss this game - It's worth your time.\n\n9/10","January 3, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The inconclusive ending is probably the most controversial aspect of the game but with TSLRCMod (which you should install for your first playthrough) it raps things up a little better.  If you're looking for a lighthearted adventure and the feel of the first game this may not be for you.","May 14","true","107.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have a lot of great memories of this game right here. I've spent hundreds of hours and countless playthroughs on this title because of how well crafted the characters and the story are. The game picks up five years after the prequel, however the game doesn't require any previous knowledge of it's precursor to play, though it does have more than a few nods. Modding is now officially supported via the workshop, and several fixes to the games bugs and a few missing plot devices have been filled in, increasing the games already amazing plot.

I strongly disagree. So far, this one is BETTER than the original. In the following ways especially:\n- Allows you to CREATE items and not simply and only upgrade. Although you can do that to and the variety of upgrades are much larger too.\n- Walking around is much easier, A and D actually turn your character now.\n- The graphics are MUCH better should you adjust your settings accordingly.\n- Swoop racing is much more fun.\n- Combat mechanics have drastically improved.\n- Looting things is a lot nicer. It will tell you if something is empty on your screen so that you know you have been there already.\n- There are three options for hacking/slicing things. You can either slice, bash, or you can use an explosive which really simplifies things.\n- There are more but I do not want to take the time to list them.\n\nI have been very impressed with this game so far and look forward to progressing through it.","November 13, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They did work well on Steam (while the version I bought at a store and installed from a DVD required a ton of fiddling until they actually worked).

I was particularly overjoyed by the lightsaber forms as I felt Obsidian had paid close attention to the Star Wars lore and each form brought something new to the table and promoted a more strategic approach to fights.\n\nStory wise, I felt Obsidian made an impressive story but it did feel a little too cryptic and convoluted at times and I have to admit that the first game set the bar very high with the amazing twist which this game lacked. However, the characters were astounding and I loved the Handmaiden's backstory in particular and I could tell that Obsidian had invested a lot of thought and time to make these characters relatable and likeable.\n\nI felt that this game was less bug ridden than it's predecessor and it ran smoother altogether which is always nice even though it wasn't free of bugs entirely as at times some cutscenes skipped for whatever reason. Once again, the choices you make in the game heavily influence what kind of character you become and the interactions you have with your crew and Obsidian proves that KOTOR is one of the best titles when it comes to decision making.\n\nAnother triumph by Obsidian here and a more than worthy sequel and I expect more greatness from them in the future.","June 5","true","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Comparing it to the original, it keeps a lot of the good, and makes most of it better. Don't come into this game expecting an amazing story based on your character, however, because rather than that, it gives you an amazing (and in my opinion, better) story based on how your character's actions affect your companions and the galaxy as a whole.\n\nWhile this game's combat and mechanics are basically the same as the original KOTOR, several mechanics are much deeper than before. Upgrading is greatly expanded, giving many options for creating your ultimate weapons. Creating and Breaking Down items has been added, forcing you to decide on what to sell and what to break down into components, in order to create another weapon or item. And since this game focuses on companions, an influence mechanic has been implemented into your interactions with them.

You cannot rush a masterpiece.\n\nLet´s start with the bad stuff (Cons)\n* All in all game feels so unfinished and there´s so many places and parts in the game where you have to wonder "I bet this would have been great with one more year of time for developers"\n* There are some annoying bugs. E.g. after combat ends your characted gets stuck and even though there are tips that say you should turn off/on the V-sync they really don´t help in all cases (e.g. in my case). You can live with this bug as it is totally random and doesn´t happen all the time and when it does you just have to F4+F5 (quick save + quick load) after the battles.\n* Difficulty is so unbalanced and this most likely is due to lack of play testing. Some parts are almost impossible and some parts (most of the game) perhaps too easy. The difficult parts are the ones where you have to play without your main character and if you haven´t micromanaged and optimized the NPCs in your party really carefully. Also some skills are overbowered and some are underbowered. Same goes for items and weapons and well...just about everything\n* Ending...let´s just say the last place you go in your adventure takes you gets grindy and repetative. Not a worthy ending for otherwise solid story\n* Then there are small things which are kinda "90s" like the inventory management\n\nBut even with those all flaws I highly recommend this game. Story is great, the NPCs in your party are well written and there´s lots of humour and good dialogue in the game.

Plus, since it came out after 'Attack of the Clones', 'KOTOR' pretty much turned into the prequel that many of us wished we got instead. I remember playing the game for 48 hours straight this one time instead of studying for my finals. (It was this 48-hour gaming marathon that made me swear off epic gaming sessions for good.) That was more than a decade ago, and those good times still mean a lot to me.\n\nDespite being a big fan of 'KOTOR', I never played 'KOTOR II: The Sith Lords'. I strongly believed it then that Bioware should have made the sequel, and I refused to pay full price for a game that was buggy at launch, especially when they should have learned from 'KOTOR''s buggy launch that got fans upset. Learning that some game content were also cut in order for the developers to meet the release date made me even less interested in giving 'KOTOR II' a try.\n\nThanks to Aspyr and the hardworking modding community, 'KOTOR II' was patched up and had its cut content restored recently. Given that, I decided to finally give 'KOTOR II' a try. The game that I played was modded with the Restored Content Modification v.1.8.4. So how did 'KOTOR II' measure up over a decade later?\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about 'KOTOR II' is that some in-game and Force alignment decisions are neither clearly Light nor clearly Dark, resulting in more challenging decision making and requiring more self relfection. Furthermore, your character has the ability to influence other party members, leading to different ways characters can develop. Plus, the conversations that you can have with your party members, such as Kreia, Visas and Brianna, are some of the best bits of writing in 'Star Wars' lore I have seen to date.\n\nUnfortunately, the patched and modded version of 'KOTOR II' that I played was still very buggy. The game camera occasionally stuttered or spun around non-stop, pathfinding issues persisted, and an achievement was awarded even when I did not earn it (thanks though!). For some reason, the game's graphics looked more dated than that of 'KOTOR', and some character models looked weird with their bug-eyed appearance. Plus, I had issues with the game's pacing as it took an unnecessarily long time for it to get interesting. Why do I again need to play a Jedi who has to relearn the Force, and wait so long to pick up a lightsaber? I played 'KOTOR' already, just let me get to the good stuff!\n\nDatedness aside, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend 'KOTOR II' given how unpolished it is. Given how one needs to devote much time to truly take in all the rich content the game has to offer, I cannot even recommend curious gamers to give it a quick go to see if they'd like it, especially when it takes many hours before the game starts to get somewhat interesting. Fans of 'Star Wars' Legends (formerly Expanded Universe) may be able to overlook the unresolved bugs and antiquated graphics to enjoy 'KOTOR II'; sadly, I could not.","February 14","false","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am not among the general.\n\nThat said, TSL has some buggy stuff where suddenly you and all your people are Sith aligned. CTDs. The script language does not always make sense, and the paths forward are not always clear. The said, the scope here is almost as impressive as the philosophy.\n\nYou are again a mysterious stranger. You don't wait as long to find out who you are. Mentored by an old Jedi, once again you assemble a team and make choices. Some of these forward your relationship to gain character backstory. Some of these increase your leanings. Again, you decide how you want to play: Kill 'em all and let the force sort them out, be at peace with anything that doesn't aggro you, or meh.\n\nThe depth of the story, though, is impressive. There is betrayal, Jedi gone rogue, some dude who is literally falling apart after trying to kill his master, and a boss that consumes the force for sustenance. They all tie-in to the greater story explored in the novels of who is Revan, was he good or bad (or she, again, the canon is overthrown), and what force exists beyond what can be seen by the Jedi council that threatens all of Republic space? You can also help "rebuild" the Mandalorians, train your own Jedi/Sith team, and destroy a planet. It's really cool. Toss in the restored content and other mods (just like KoTOR), and you've got serious replayability.\n\nrecommended buy, but again, wait for a sale. It happens a lot.

Fixes below. You're all meatbags. All hail the Gizka's.\n\nAbsolutely one of my most favorite games of all time (and I play many games). This game is a gem of both RPG's and the star wars universe because of the amazing depth in storytelling and the way it engages me and allows me to make my own choices, something I've found lacking in games recently. Originally I owned both KOTORs on xbox (and shamelessly logged  hundreds  of hours into each) and rebought them on steam for the third time (original disk broke) just to play it again.\n\n---What you need to know---\nYes, the game is buggy. This was made for much earlier versions of windows and you're likely to suffer the odd glitch every now and then. HOWEVER there is, of course, a fix! A few of the catch-all fixes that I've used and have worked for the PC versions are as follows;\nThe  swconfig  file which can be found in your game folder installation directory. Open this and check 1) Enable Hardware Mouse and 2) Disable Movies. You miss a little disabling movies and so you may want to go back and uncheck it and see whether it works for you. Last resort you can watch them through the main menu or through the magic of the internet.\nEditing the "swkotor2" configuration file, found in the same directory. Should fullscreen not work out for you as it didnt for me then paste the following line below [Graphics Options] --> AllowWindowedMode=1\nThen change the "Fullscreen=1" to "Fullscreen=0" and you'll be playing in windowed mode.\nEnabling compatability mode. Not difficult to do, which compatability you use depends on your system.The internet is your friend! By no means is this a comprehensive list, just the major ones that I've confirmed to work for myself or others.\n\nTruly this is a fantastic game and easily worth its price. Also look out for the Restored Content mod, which flushes out the story to its true potential and adds so much great stuff to the game!

The ending. WTF?! So so so so many loose ends...\n-A decent number of weird bugs. However, quite a few can be corrected by workshop content\n-Space suit animation doe\n-It's not the prettiest game out there, but it'll do\n-Balacing issues, in turns of battle gameplay. It seems to roller coaster throughout the game\n\nI can't say I loved this game quite as much as the first KOTOR. I really wanted to like it as much as the first, but it fell short. I would recommend checking out the restored content mods in the workshop to make the game better overall, I wasn't aware that they existed until after I finished my playthrough, so before playing I would definitely install that.\n\nI would give it a 8/10 overall.

I am not among the general.\n\nThat said, TSL has some buggy stuff where suddenly you and all your people are Sith aligned. CTDs. The script language does not always make sense, and the paths forward are not always clear. The said, the scope here is almost as impressive as the philosophy.\n\nYou are again a mysterious stranger. You don't wait as long to find out who you are. Mentored by an old Jedi, once again you assemble a team and make choices. Some of these forward your relationship to gain character backstory. Some of these increase your leanings. Again, you decide how you want to play: Kill 'em all and let the force sort them out, be at peace with anything that doesn't aggro you, or meh.\n\nThe depth of the story, though, is impressive. There is betrayal, Jedi gone rogue, some dude who is literally falling apart after trying to kill his master, and a boss that consumes the force for sustenance. They all tie-in to the greater story explored in the novels of who is Revan, was he good or bad (or she, again, the canon is overthrown), and what force exists beyond what can be seen by the Jedi council that threatens all of Republic space? You can also help "rebuild" the Mandalorians, train your own Jedi/Sith team, and destroy a planet. It's really cool. Toss in the restored content and other mods (just like KoTOR), and you've got serious replayability.\n\nrecommended buy, but again, wait for a sale. It happens a lot. Save them dolladolla bills.","March 13","true","137.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fixes below. You're all meatbags. All hail the Gizka's.\n\nAbsolutely one of my most favorite games of all time (and I play many games). This game is a gem of both RPG's and the star wars universe because of the amazing depth in storytelling and the way it engages me and allows me to make my own choices, something I've found lacking in games recently. Originally I owned both KOTORs on xbox (and shamelessly logged  hundreds  of hours into each) and rebought them on steam for the third time (original disk broke) just to play it again.\n\n---What you need to know---\nYes, the game is buggy. This was made for much earlier versions of windows and you're likely to suffer the odd glitch every now and then. HOWEVER there is, of course, a fix! A few of the catch-all fixes that I've used and have worked for the PC versions are as follows;\nThe  swconfig  file which can be found in your game folder installation directory. Open this and check 1) Enable Hardware Mouse and 2) Disable Movies. You miss a little disabling movies and so you may want to go back and uncheck it and see whether it works for you. Last resort you can watch them through the main menu or through the magic of the internet.\nEditing the "swkotor2" configuration file, found in the same directory. Should fullscreen not work out for you as it didnt for me then paste the following line below [Graphics Options] --> AllowWindowedMode=1\nThen change the "Fullscreen=1" to "Fullscreen=0" and you'll be playing in windowed mode.\nEnabling compatability mode. Not difficult to do, which compatability you use depends on your system.The internet is your friend! By no means is this a comprehensive list, just the major ones that I've confirmed to work for myself or others.\n\nTruly this is a fantastic game and easily worth its price. Also look out for the Restored Content mod, which flushes out the story to its true potential and adds so much great stuff to the game! Now quit sitting around and buy the game already meatbags.","March 8","true","41.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was one of the first RPG's I ever played and help solidify my passion for Star Wars. If you played the orginal and enjoyed it than this game is for you. If not...its made some marginal improvements but it isn't drastically different than the first.\n\nPROS\nMore complicated morality system. Makes you question wheter your actions are truly good or evil.\n\nIntriguing story filled with twists and turns.\n\nLikable companions.\n\nA large variety of force powers and feats to choose from.\nCONS\nSomewhat glitchy.\n\nTerrible AI.\n\nSeverely limited unless The Siths Lord Restored Content Mod is installed.\nOverall I would reccomend this game to anyone who like the orginal KOTOR and any Star Wars fan. I would suggest downloading The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod from the workshop for the optimal experience. If either of these apply I would wholeheartily reccomend this addition to your library.\n\nOriginally posted by HK-47: Query: Is there someone you need killed, master?","March 3","true","92.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was particularly overjoyed by the lightsaber forms as I felt Obsidian had paid close attention to the Star Wars lore and each form brought something new to the table and promoted a more strategic approach to fights.\n\nStory wise, I felt Obsidian made an impressive story but it did feel a little too cryptic and convoluted at times and I have to admit that the first game set the bar very high with the amazing twist which this game lacked. However, the characters were astounding and I loved the Handmaiden's backstory in particular and I could tell that Obsidian had invested a lot of thought and time to make these characters relatable and likeable.\n\nI felt that this game was less bug ridden than it's predecessor and it ran smoother altogether which is always nice even though it wasn't free of bugs entirely as at times some cutscenes skipped for whatever reason. Once again, the choices you make in the game heavily influence what kind of character you become and the interactions you have with your crew and Obsidian proves that KOTOR is one of the best titles when it comes to decision making.\n\nAnother triumph by Obsidian here and a more than worthy sequel and I expect more greatness from them in the future.","June 5","true","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I knew every quest, every conversation, every inch of the Ebon Hawk. The irony is that I played this before the first game, so many of the easter eggs were lost on me.\n\nBut now? I played it again and while the graphics certainly haven't aged well, the story is as good as ever. I played with the Restored Content Mod and wow! This game is more alive than ever. The heart of this game lies not with the combat, but with the conversations you have, learning about the Force and the philosophy of the Jedi and Sith. This game accomplishes with a few talks with Kreia more than what Episodes 1-3 could in their combined runtimes.\n\nIf you play this game, it is a must to get the Restored Content Mod as it brings the game to its full potential. All the broken plot lines are fixed. The crew all have more flow to them. Most of the bugs are gone (I stress most).\n\nI played the game as a Jedi Master, and boy do you feel more like a Jedi than the ones you're looking for. I suspect the same could be said if you go dark side, which is what I plan to do after I finish my first playthrough. Yeah, I'm 50 hours in and still not done one playthrough. All of your crew have full storyarchs and backstories. You get to know all of them and have a hand in their future. Interestingly, I somehow managed to turn HK-47 into the pinnacle light side character despite his insistance on murdering the crew.\n\nThat said, remember when I stressed that MOST of the bugs were fixed? Currently I am unable to continue as I've encountered a bug that breaks the controls. Hopefully its just a one-time thing but I lost an hour because of it. You've been warned.\n\nAs for the combat, it's alright. It's not the worst thing ever, but it's nowhere near the best. Sure it looks pretty, and the combat moves are really varied, but it does feel clunky with the way it works.\n\nIf you're a Star Wars fan, this game and its original are a must-own. Together they form the backbone of the lore for Star Wars. There is a reason they are held in such high regard.","March 23","true","50.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although you can do that to and the variety of upgrades are much larger too.\n- Walking around is much easier, A and D actually turn your character now.\n- The graphics are MUCH better should you adjust your settings accordingly.\n- Swoop racing is much more fun.\n- Combat mechanics have drastically improved.\n- Looting things is a lot nicer. It will tell you if something is empty on your screen so that you know you have been there already.\n- There are three options for hacking/slicing things. You can either slice, bash, or you can use an explosive which really simplifies things.\n- There are more but I do not want to take the time to list them.\n\nI have been very impressed with this game so far and look forward to progressing through it.","November 13, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HYPEP/recommended/208580/","HYPEP","☣Hype☣","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HYPEP/","358 products in account","SW:KOTOR 2 is an RPG game Developed by Obsidian Entertainment. The game takes place  a few years after the events of KOTOR 1 after Revan defeated Malak and saved the galaxy. But now after departed deep into the outer rim of the galaxy, a bunch of Sith Lords, have appeared and have almost completly destoryed the Jedi order and the remaining Jedi Masters are into hiding. You play as a male or female Jedi Exile which you learn later into the game about why you were exiled from the Jedi Order. After escaping a Mine Fuel facuilty (Either by blowing it up and evading a sith ship) you head to a orbiting facilty above a planet called Telos. After being imprisoned and captured by them you find out the ship you traveled in, the Ebon Hawk has been stolen. After helping a light or dark side corporation and meeting a soldier that knows your character, you travel to many places into the planet until you get your ship back after finding out a Jedi Master lives in a acdemy in a polar region of the planet. After a companion gets the data base at the academy you find out why, your charcter was exiled and leaves you between two roads: Do you gather up the rest of the Masters to help you fight the sith, or do you join the sith and hunt down and kill the Jedi Masters?\n\nThe companions you meet are all cool and deep. They all have secrets behind them which you have to get them to trust you to find out. Some of them you may not enjoy (like a stupid robot that is a jerk), but alot of them are fun to talk too, a few of them were in KOTOR 1 that make a return like T3-M4 and HK-47.\n\nOne of the highlights of this game is the Light and Dark side paths. Through multiple parts of the game you sometimes given a choice such as kill an innocent by raiding his house then kill him as he returns (Dark Side) or saving someone from mercneary thugs (Light Side).\n\nThe gameplay is a turn base or real time action (Can be chosen through menu) game. The game has powers that are ran by a 1d20 system. I'm stupid so I don't know much about the system but if you know stuff from Dungeons & Dragons you might understand it. The level cap is to belive is 30 but that doesnt mean its easy and should be taken lightly. Like how Fallout 3 and NV take a while so does this. This also means you want to spend Attributes when making a character very carefully as messing up might make it harder to clear the game. For example: putting alot of points into Constitution and Intelligence might give alot of VP and skill points to use, but at the cost of FP (force points) which might make it harder for you to use force powers.\n\nOVerall KOTOR 2 is a fun game, with it just getting workshop, people can get the restored content mod and get the true and perhaps best parts of the game. Problem is sometimes that game can be difficult with what planets you decide to visit and there are some annoying puzzles. I find the 10$ to be worth it but if you would like try to get it during a sale...\n\nThis game gets a 9/10 - A fun and amazing game but with some minors problems.","August 10, 2015","true","40.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Need I say more?\n\n\n\nHonestly I enjoyed this game much more than the original.\n\nWith the Restored Content Mod (which is super easy to download in case anyone has trepidation over downloading something from another site to make your game better) I can honestly say this is my favorite game of all time.\n\nIn my opinion the reason why this game is so amazing is because all of the party members are so interesting and so well fleshed out that the only thing I can tell you without spoiling anything is if I had to make a top ten favorite video game characters of all time list, I know at least two characters from this game would be on it.\n\nOne reason why I like this game so much more than the first one is because, again, without spoiling anything, the main character of the original KOTOR doesn't feel like an actual "character" until around 80% into the game, until then you're kind of just a blank slate. In this game however, you're a broken jedi with borderline PTSD. How cool does that sound?\n\nIn this game your party members evolve and change personalities depending on how much influence you have with them. Its an amazing system that can change the core ideals of party members with whom you've curryed favor, and without spoiling anything, (getting kind of hard not to spoil this fantastic game haha), can lead some of these characters to become "something greater".\n\nOn top of this, It also has a fantastically ominous and foreboding atmosphere not unlike Dark Souls of all games.\n\nThis is a top notch game that checks all the right boxes to create a cinematic experience like no other. It opened my eyes and got me to think in a very different way that has pretty much effected the way I play all my games with morality systems to date: some times neither good nor evil are the way to go, its best to remain gray.","June 12, 2014","true","131.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is a huge improvement over the already impressive Knights of the Old Republic, and almost everything else feels like a decent upgrade.    If you're looking for a game like KOTOR, but have played KOTOR till it's become a bit boring, this is what you want.\n\nA brief note: I did use the fan mod, I don't know how much of an effect that had but it was highly reccomended.  The game has aged quite a bit graphically.  It's also probably *not* worth a second playthrough: my playtime notwithstanding (I suspect a lot of it is while the game was running but I was doing something else), most of your enjoyment of the story will be in its twists and turns.  Choosing radically different dialogue options will affect your character build and force powers, but it probably won't make playing the same thing again much more interesting.","June 3, 2014","true","83.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/208580/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","KOTOR 2 is one of the several tales of what could have been when it comes to video games getting rushed out by the publisher; but what we do have with the Restoration Mod is still good.\n\nKOTOR 2 is probably the most interesting Star Wars story; it takes everything about the series lore on the Force, the Jedi, and the Sith and breaks them down, satirizing the stark black and white morality that the series had fallen into because of those concepts. This idea is personified in one character and that character is probably one of the best characters in video games. KOTOR 2 also actually manages to have in-universe explanations for some of the gameplay elements and it’s really well done.\n\nKOTOR 2 is not without flaws however. I found the combat to be a horrendous slog so I actively cheated my way to get to the really good parts, the roleplaying and story. While one specific character is really interesting and likable, the rest of your party is mostly more flat and aren't as good as the party members in say Planescape or Nier. Regardless I'd say it’s still worth playing and at the very least you should check out a Let's Play because KOTOR 2 really is cool.","January 20, 2014","true","16.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Since Obsidian rushed KOTOR 2's release for the holiday season, they had to cut out parts of this game, most of which were pretty integral to the plot.)\n\nSynopsis: You, the player, are The Exile (canonically a woman named Meetra Surik). Like many of your fellow Jedi, you followed Revan to help the Republic during the Mandalorian Wars. Revan, who was impressed with your combat prowess, decided to appoint you as one of his top generals.\n\nThe final battle of the Mandalorian Wars took place near the Sith planet of Malachor V. Since the rest of the Republic's fleet could make it to the battle in time, you decide to utilize the Republic's ultimate weapon: The Mass Shadow Generator, designed by the Zabrak technician Bao-Dur. The Mass Shadow Generator activates, pulling the planet, the Mandalorian armada and the Republic fleet into a gravity field. The death of the planet and all parties involved was so great that it gave you a Wound in The Force, severing and deafening your connection to The Force.\n\nHowever, unlike the rest of your Jedi colleagues, you were the only one who did not fall to the Dark Side. When the war was over, you decided to return to the Jedi Council on Coruscant to face judgement. The Council, both butt furious over your insubordination and incredulous at your voluntary return unanimously chose to banhammer you from The Order. You were then exiled to wander the outer reaches of the Galaxy. Oh, and they took your lightsaber as well.\n-\n\nFast forward five years later. The war with Darth Malak and the Sith was so costly the Republic can barely defend itself. Strange, phantom-like Sith assassins have dogged the Jedi, hunting them down in an effort to completely destroy the Jedi Order. The crime syndicate known as "The Exchange" has put out a bounty for any live Jedi. Strange, durasteel droids have integrated themselves into the Republic government.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republic attempts to rebuild Telos IV, a planet bombarded to near destruction by the Sith Admiral Saul Karath. An unknown figure contacts Republic Admiral Carth Onasi, requesting that you be brought from the Outer Rim to act as a diplomat to Telos. Who made the request, and why, are a mystery to you, but other external forces have plans for you...","July 25, 2014","true","88.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also, don't use the automatic level system, is very crap. I'm giving him only 7 because it reminds me so much to D&D (Yeah, yeah, all the role games came from D&D, but the game literaly puts on the descripcions things like your damage is a "D6" or that you use "Will Saves", etc".

No, really.\n\nWell, maybe if you value things like 'not having bugs' or 'balanced gameplay' or 'not being rushed out the door for Christmas'. But, what classic CRPG (Bioware aside) isn't filled with these little character flaws? Frankly, it still feels more polished than Alpha Protocol, which, while remaining one of my favorite all-time games, doesn't have the 'rushed out' excuse so much.\n\nDespite being a licenced game and sequel, the story of the Jedi Exile and her companions (oh, did I mention the player character is canonically female?) manages to have the best narrative I've seen in any video game I've ever played, one which still sparks debate over its true messages and intent. Without giving too much away, you'll be touching on the nature of good and evil, the scars that remain from war, the struggle against objective morality and appointed fate, and the very real consequences that come from being a video game character. (No, really.)\n\nAlso, this game both stands up to repeat paythroughs and doesn't make you hate the vast majority of the supporting cast. (LOOKING AT YOU, BIOWARE)\n\nMore importantly, thanks to the good people at Aspyr and the dedicated mod community, the game has both the content it deserved to ship with and a slick control and graphical update for the modern gamer. Fully playable using a 360 controller, widescreen without stretching or patch hacks, and on whichever operating system you fancy most. (IN YOUR FACE, BIOWARE)\n\nStar Wars love not required, and perhaps detrimental! Being a person who hates Star Wars, I have to make the obvious admission that some fans of that saga might not like this game too much. That said, the depths of the story and its themes, and the ambiguity they bring, should make up for that...and to be sure, this game still packs a lot of love for the old hokey science-fantasy epic, all the same. (Also, I love other Star Wars games too, like the original Battlefront titles, so don't get too uppity.)\n\nTL;DR Made me a nihilist, Handmaiden best girl, 11/10.","November 14, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

To fix these issues, and add the content that was intented to be in the game, I reccomend downloading the TSLCRM mod and the M4-78 mod. Those are the only "mandatory mods", so after that you can get any other ones, provided they're compatible. This game picks up a bit after where the last one left off, so I'd reccomend playing that one first.\n\n\nSTORY (Minor spoilers)\n[Canonically, the protagonist is a human female named Meetra Surik]\n\nYou play as the Exile/Meetra Surik, a former Jedi who fought in the Mandalorian wars under Revan(The first game's protagonist). However, the Exile, like her name suggests, was exiled from the Jedi Order for going against them by leaving with Revan. This is just the Exile's backstory, as the game picks up on Telos, a space station that is barely functioning and soon going to explode. The Exile must escape the station and return to her ship with the help of 3 companions you find along the way. After that, depending on whether you want to play as a good little Jedi, or an evil Sith, you will try to find all of the leftover Jedi to get their help and find out why you were exiled, or to murder them all, with the help of 9 companions you find scattered around the galaxy.\n\nPros\n+ Interesting, suprising ending based on your choices in the game\n+Solid, tactical gameplay.\n+ Not just an open world, an OPEN GALAXY\n+ Each companion has a rich backstory and companions are actually very useful\n+ Detailed crafting and upgrading systems\n+ Great replayability\n+ Filled with great Star Wars lore\n+ Your actions affect the entire galaxy and many of the people in it, including your companions\n+ Prestige classes change things up early/mid-game\n+ YOU CAN TURN YOUR COMPANIONS INTO JEDI OR DARK JEDI!\n+ When you reach end-game, you will be god-like with your force powers; On my way to the final area, I was clearing rooms with just one shot of Force Storm.\nCons\n- Dated graphics\n- Game breaking glitches are present without proper fixes\n- Dialogue can be strange and confusing at times\n- In many cases your quests will fail to update or you'll be clueless on where to go\n- Some game-breaking glitches can be exploited and make the game too easy\n- Game rarely presents the player with a challenge\nMixed\n-/+ Forced to use certain companions at times\n\n\nFinal Rating\n\nThis game is a solid 9/10 for me. The game is NOT perfect because of the heavy amount of glitches present, yet the gameplay and story make up for it. I reccomend this game for ANY Star Wars fan or RPG fan.

However it does feel awfully detached from the original Xbox version of the game, of which this rerelease seemed to have been aimed to recreate.\n\nFirst off and foremost, the native widescreen resolution is, simply said, very nice. Being able to launch the game straight from Big Picture Mode with a controller while kicking your feet upon the coffee table and relaxing on the couch staring at your TV is somewhat reminiscent of what it was like to play it on console many years ago. However, with it being "native", there was a very large  lack of effort  on  Aspyre's  side of things, as it was simply just the widescreen modification that users could have done themselves on the older release of this game. What that entails is that the text on screen, on a TV, is relatively difficult to read without squinting your eyes until they turn red. Needless to say, they just added something that many have been able to do through WSGF for some time now.\n\nSecondly, the controller support. Pardon my barbaric comment on this specific topic, but WHO DESIGNED IT. Absolute RUBBISH. I still haven't figured out what the triggers are supposed to do, they added a mini pop up window. A POP UP WINDOW. With functions that were previously mapped to dedicated buttons in the original version of the game on the original Xbox. Furthermore, they excited everyone with the additional controller support, however, it seemed to have been a last minute after thought by those who were porting it. They had the tools to make it original, yet they still screwed it up.\n\nThirdly, the action bar will always, I say again, ALWAYS, appear on your character's head. Unlike the original that we have come to know and love, they butchered this unique, simple and useful feature by, I don't know... Attempting to "generalize" it for all scenarios? Whatever the reason is, they butchered it. It gets in your view during combat or when you simply want to see what you are hitting.\n\nQuadruply, they did not add a virtual keyboard into the game. I know many games don't have this capability, but guess what... It's 2015. People don't want to deal with the hassle of using a physical keyboard to type their name or save game title in if they are using a controller. They proved that controller support, once again, was an after thought.\n\nI'm giving this port a 0/5\nHowever, the game is receiving a 5/5, simply because it's KOTOR.\n\nFor any of those who don't want to deal with subpar garbage and wouldn't mind doing some simple set ups to get your BPM setup up and running with a controller and KOTOR widescreen that feels like the original, feel free to search for my controller support on YouTube by searching the following: SW:KOTOR [GAMEPAD UPDATE] [Dualshock 4 Support!]\n\nI proved that I could make a controller profile, for free, that had nearly 90% replication using digital red neck methods of creating my own controller support. In fact, I took the two seconds out of my life to grab the KOTOR 2 manual and replicate the controls of each button and add them into a functional control scheme. The amount of downloads that my controller schemes have acquired and the views my videos have earned merely prove the requirement of PROPER controller support in such games, especially games that were released approximately 10 years ago.","July 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

What I am trying to address is that TSL delivers an unforgettable, dark, mysterious experience. The story in Kotor 2 is just breathtaking and fascinating, it conveys us the most intriguing remarkable characters a video game can offer. This game really allows you to get attached to the extraudinary characters and adventures along the way of the story. Though the TSLRCM is a MUST have in order to get the full TSL experience. My personal oppinion is that Kotor 2 TSL definately exceeds the first game in almost every aspect, especially with the TSLRCM. Kotor 1 just simply did not have that eroding dark mysterious feel about it. In Kotor 2 the interaction with companions is also much more interesting; the way you can influence and decieve them into either learning the ways of jedi or sith. Kotor 2 TSL is simply a masterpeice.\n\nEven if you aren't into Star Wars you WILL be happy with this game.","August 4, 2015","true","280.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The Knights of the Old Republic series of games are the penultimate of Star Wars gaming nirvana.  Sure, there are other good Star Wars games to be played, but none of them will allow you the pure visceral experience of "being" a character in the Star Wars universe quite like this.  Flying between planets, fixing droids, shooting blasters, learning to use the force, earning your very own lightsaber, and mingling with the locals in cantinas.  Of course, it's an RPG.  Not everyone likes RPGs.  Those people are morons and we should feel sorry for them.\n\nThe Sith Lords picks up five years after the end of the last game.  The Mandalore wars are over, the Jedi are all but extinct, the Republic is on verge of collapse, and the Sith wait in the outer rim of the galaxy like a lion in the grass.  You play the role of an exile.  You were once a Jedi, but you have been cut off from the force and cast out of the Jedi order for disobeying them and following Revan and Malak to war.\n\nI could say that The Sith Lords is a better game than it's predecessor, which is true, but it wouldn't be completely fair to the first game which laid the essential groundwork.  What makes it better?  First, and foremost:  the story.  The story is top-notch.  I had come across some spoilers, I thought I had it figured out, and the game still pulled the rug out from under me with it's plot.  Then there is the moral ambiguity.  The first game let your choices in conversations with people affect your drifting to the Light side of the force or the Dark side of the force, and the conversation options for each were fairly obvious.  The Sith Lords is more complex in it's dialogues in that regard, and it adds Influence to the fold.  How you interact with your party members affects how they respond to you.  So, disagreeing with a party member might lose you influence with them.  Losing influence means they aren't going to divulge everything they know.  So, appeasing certain party members may create a moral dilemna and how you deal with it may affect both influence and whether you go Light side or Dark side.  Other factors affect it too.  Who doesn't remember the cave on Dagoba in The Empire Strikes Back?  Yoda warns Luke about the cave, but he dismisses him and ♥♥♥♥ happens that leaves everyone scratching their head asking: "what the hell just happend?".  Well, you get your very own cave of Force phantoms and the choices you make there also affect your Light and Dark side standing with the Force.  Better still, they make sense this time.\n\nOf course, the game builds on the sequel with more items, more powers, more aliens, more...  stuff.  It also pays great homage to the original.  You don't have to play the first game to thoroughly enjoy this one though.  The game goes to great lengths to explain what happened in the previous game.  Not only that, it allows you a chance (through dialogue) to decide what happened in the history of the previous game.  This affects how The Sith Lords unfolds it's story.  A bunch of the characters from the previous game make appearances, some only cameos, and it gives you a sense of what happened to the peripheral characters of the first game.\n\nThe game isn't all about you though, you narcissist.  The game will often switch to another party member for you control in their solo outings.  It's a nice change of pace to step into another character who has different specializations and motivations and such.  I thought it was brilliant and reminded me of the movies whenever characters split up and went on their own missions.\n\nI could go on...  but bottom line is this is a gem of a game.  And it only gets better with this very special mod that restores cut content to the game:  http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm\nThis mod fixes bugs, tightens up dialog and finishes/restores content that was cut in order for the game to meet it's publication deadline.  There is another mod that adds a droid planet that was planned for the game, but don't bother.  It's reputedly bad.\n\nAnyway, Padawan, you need to purchase this game and fulfill your destiny!  ...or something.\n\n\n","May 28, 2014","true","67.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

A lot of people will tell you how broken and buggy it is, but in all honesty, I blame Obsidian. They have a history of taking great games and copy/pasting them into a new game with some extra stuff and a ton of bugs (*cough cough* Fallout: New Vegas *cough cough*). Basically, that is what this game is. It plays just like the original, looks just like the original, and is just as great as the original. This is not what most want out of a sequel. I was disappointed at first by the lack of originality and lack of new looks and feels. It was more of a big expansion. The same game as the first.\n\nBut while I sit here and make the game sound awful, worry not! It actually is a fantastic game. The game's story takes you on a journey across a bunch of awesome planets (I <3 the Onderon/Dxun stuff) and the dialogue is extremely well written. Each character has a huge and deep past that you can figure out as you travel with them and watch them react to your actions. Mandalore might think you are a stupid runt that could never be as great as those damn Mandalorians for giving some credits to a beggar, but Visas might think that it is a noble and beautiful act. Maybe Atton, who used to hate when you were cruel to people, now relishes in every innocent victim you slaughter for no apparent reason (Yo, dawg, the Force has no power in Hell, so go Light Side or go home). Shaping the will of others is an incredible part of this game that you can make different each time you play it.\n\nAll in all, the game is incredible. If you can acually get the game to start up properly, actually avoid all of the grass block bugs on Dxun and Dantooine, and avoid the annoying dialogue skipping glitches (which can be avoided by taking a break from the game and booting it up after a walk in some sunlight), you are going to really enjoy yourself with this masterpiece of a game. You don't have to play the first one, but I recommend doing that because it also has a story and writing to die for. I'm a sucker for good video game dialogue.

You also can change the personalities of the people you travel with by just talking to them in a positive or negative fashion (reinforced by your alignment (Jedi or Sith)).\n\nThis game actually makes me feel more intelligent by Kreia's speaches and opinions.  She also reveals a great deal about backstory and possible future events at <removed due to spoilers>.\n\nThe gameplay itself is actually pretty nice.  It has a lot of combat options and things you can personalize.  Whether you want to fight with a lightsaber or not.  The armor you wear can compliment your characters abilities, and your companions aren't typical support characters.  They actually add some welcome and very real context to the game, as well as great combat efficiency.\n\nAs for the level designs they could be better, but they remain pleasing to look at.

I was deeply in love with the first game, but I never  could get into this game because of all it's bugs and glitches.. until now. I HIGHLY recommend playing the game with The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod, because it adds so, SO much more content to the game that should of made it to the final cut.\n\nThe characters, oh my god, the characters.. Intriguiging backgrounds, wonderful dialog. The places.. To see places previously seen, previously unknown, remastered and in some cases, made, is just.. wonderful. The main story is amazing, IMO, even though others seem to disagree. The choices truly make you feel like you are doing a good thing or a bad thing, and the music adds to that.

KOTOR 2, the sequel, was developed by Obsidian. The core differences here is that Obsidian still legitimately cares about making a good stat based RPG and not a shooter with romance options. I think I'm projecting modern Bioware shortcomings here but KOTOR 2 took everything that was wrong with the original and tried very hard to fix it. The game is by no means perfect, and you WILL need to download one of the Restoration Project mods to fix bugs and add content that was cut but as a role-playing game KOTOR 2 is still absolutely great.\n\nYour choices matter, the whole game is seeing how the consequences of your choices play out. This whole game is about choice. The characters are excellent, the writing is everything you would expect of an Obsidian title. The game almost starts out as a satire of Bioware cliches but quickly becomes its own animal, allowing you to explore a deeper aspect of the morality of the Star Wars universe that a lot of games never do.\n\nWhile this game certainly is not perfect, I find it better than the original in nearly every way. That said, I do recommend playing the original before you ever get started on this, the original game is still a good title and deserves the respect its earned. There are better RPG's out there, but you won't find a lot of them on Steam yet. For what it is this game is great and I love playing it.\n\n8/10 would play again.","December 22, 2012","true","46.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This one is the buggier one, God have mercy.\n\nBUT there are mods to help that and restore unfinished content that are quite easy to install.  Just make sure you only have one, maybe two, major bug fix mods.  In my experience they will start to conflict with each other.\n\nNow, bugs aside, this is some of the best Star Wars storytelling I've ever witnessed.  Better than KotOR 1 me thinks.  What I like most is that it focuses on the mysticism of the Force and character interaction.  While there is still the simple Light/Dark side meter from the first game, it almost seems to be more of a ploy than anything.  An action may net you Light Side points, but now your influence on your companions is a factor.\n\nIf you want to bring a teammate to the Light, you have to have influence.  But your goody two shoes actions might put them off, driving further towards whatever side you are not.  On top of that, the narrative will keep suggesting that the whole notion of Light/Dark is shallow and inaccurate to how the events of the game play out.  It doesn't try to throw out the notion of good and bad, but it tries to make you think twice about what is actually a good action and what is a bad action.","February 12, 2014","true","68.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I can't tell you how many times I played this game on that old black box with the giant X on it. I fell in love with the first game and was a little dissapointed with the initial release of the sequel. Something felt unfinished and I could never explain it until I read it was basically rushed out a year after the first one to get it out in time for Christmas. Pieces of the game were cut and unfinished just to cash in on Santa Clause. Even with its faults it was an extremely enjoyable game when it was released.\n\nI tried every build I could think of, saved before conversations to see every possible story ark, and completed the game as light, dark, and neutral. During the playing of both games in the series I must have filled up the old xbox hard drive several times a runthrough. It was just that good and the possiblities of the storylines seemed endless.\n\nFast forward to today and some beutiful people from the internet have created a patch that finishes the missing content of the game, and a second patch that adds in a planet that from what I understand had some minor pieces of data lodged somewhere in the game but is mostly filled in with the patch team's own storyline. I have to say I can't tell so far what is from the patch I installed and what is the original game, but it feels damn good to play through this story again. And I'm looking forward to seeing the finished content.\n\nThis game was a strong piece of the last years of my childhood and I can't tell you how much it means to me. While it is true the sequel to Bioware's KOTOR is made by Obsidian it feels very much like a Bioware game of its period.The game uses a modified version of the original Bioware engine and it is well documented that the two companies had done work together during this period. Maybe it's something to do with EA buying out Bioware, but it feels like Bioware is not the same company it used to be. Replaying KOTOR 1&2 and playing Jade Empire for the first time I can see some huge differences between what Bioware once was and the Bioware of today with its ME trilogy, DA series, and SWTOR. While the new Bioware games are very good in their own right I feel like the company has lost a little bit of something wonderful in its current lineup. Other than the Mass Effect trilogy I don't feel like I have the interest to finish games such as DA or SWTOR (Not that one can really ever finish an MMO); not to say that I don't like the newer work from the company I would just prefer they focus on a true sequel to KOTOR over milking the Dragon Age series for everything they can get.\n\nIf you have any interest in Bioware's current lineup do yourself a favor and give the Knights of the Old Republic series a chance. The series is definitely showing its age but it's still just as well made as anything from the magic Canadian elves who work at Bioware.","April 17, 2014","true","91.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

The Force is more present then ever.\n\nI have to say that I played with the Restored Content Mod through my playthrough and it can be downloaded here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm\n\nDespite the fixes the game crashed a couple of times, there were occasional glitches and bugs. Was it worth it?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJuZ3hZjxdI\n\nKnights of the Old Republic is often reffered to as simply KOTOR.\nThis is an often overlooked game because even after fixes it's still rather unstable and unpredictable. The possibility to see the world after KOTOR 1 though pays off in it's own way!\nEverything remained almost the same since the last game. The Bioware style of doing things persists and shows a deep understanding of RPG game mechanics. It is a solid experience in combat and common storytelling alike.\n\nIt's not by Bioware anymore...\n\nThe unique traits of an Obsidian title though show after getting more companions and interacting with them. Similar to Mass Effect, Dragon Age.\nYou posses influence over them, she politely refuses to share life stories until there is more trust between you (gained usually by expressing views similar to theirs). As you go along though, these stories are revealead simply through spending time together and showing what a charismatic individual you are.\n\nThe story told is worth of an entire essay on it's own.\nBy getting to the bottom of it - the proportions of it seem to always lead toward a gigantic revelation, one step ahead of a mystery, great conspiracy - respectively a fitting end.\nWithout spoiling anything I will say that I never expected Star Wars to go so deeply into the philosophy of the Force. Good and evil are simple. There are characters in this game however that twist it into a novel thing altogether.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKYVuMhxfMA&index\n\nMy feelings on the game are mixed. It definately feels rushed towards the end. The restored levels don't seem to be worth it from the mods. But despite that the journey is as they say, reward enough for that.\n\n\nShould you get it?\n\nPlay it for the great and cryptic introduction. Assuming that with imagination you can get past the long prologue.\nEnjoy it's detailed worlds, tours across a couple of planets, guides into ways to shape the Republic.\nReminisce on KOTOR 1 across 2 planets and with a couple of characters.\nFrom the beggining of KOTOR 2 there is a tone of urgency of some unseen threat. I had the impression the game ended at a cliffhanger that, hopefully was not the original intention.\nDespite that, the characters introduced were strong enough for this to be a game worth your money. It is an RPG shifting much closer towards the character and story driven decision-making seen often today.\n\nPlay KOTOR 1 and 2 for the full experience!","July 15, 2015","true","48.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

We now play as “The Exile”, a jedi cast out of the order for going to war without the councils permission. As luck would have it he/she is one of the last jedi after the Sith's successful purge and has a huge bounty on his/her head. The situation really shows in game as a good amount of people will try to kill you or deceive you for that huge bounty. It does become a tad tiresome when the same assassin droids show up time and time again spouting the same dialogue each time.  As for the game itself it plays it very safe and only improves upon a few things while keeping everything from the original intact. It is not made by the same developers as the original.\n\nCompanions are far improved in this game and now feature a influence system in which they either disprove of you or like you  depending on the actions you take.  This time around there is a much better balance between Light Side and Dark Side companions unlike the original where near everyone had a holier than thou attitude. You never trust any of them either which I found very neat as I half expected the people that have my back to turn on me any moment. Some will flat out refuse to talk to you ever again if you annoy them enough. I still would like the option to kick teammates out of my ship. Which brings me to the ship, it is the same exact ship from the first game. They reuse a lot of material from the first game including planets that are ruin down but the same exact places as the original and much smaller.\n\nThey really took a huge step back when it comes to environments. Where as the first game had huge unique environments this one has small gray corridor after small gray corridor. Your choices in the last game doesn't really make a lick of difference and they even get the gender of the 1st game's protagonist wrong and they will default to being female. Not a big deal at all but slightly annoying.  This sequel is far more prone to glitches and crashes. I actually had to cheat to get past a game breaking bug.  It has this incomplete feel as if they either rushed the game out or just didn't care.  It does have a few improvements like your teammate AI is much better at following you around, a small improvement to inventory menus though they are still awful and regenerating health which is neither a good or bad feature.\n\nGameplay is pretty much the same as the original but with a few different force powers. I don't think they reused any music and it sounds just as amazing as the first.  You now seem to level up much faster and when I was done with the tutorial I was already half the level of the lasts game's character which I had at level 20 by the end of the game. Same abilities, same skills  and same stats as the first, they didn't really do anything to enhance character building. Story is pretty cool and feels much more mysterious than the first. There is no clear good and evil side in this game which is a huge improvement from the first. You never receive a lightsaber either, you have to build it if you want one. Overall I enjoyed the story more than the originals even though I saw the ending coming from a mile away unlike the first.\n\nI mentioned the first a lot in this review but it cant be helped. This sequel is pretty much a carbon copy of the first with a new story and a few highly uninteresting new worlds. It felt like an unnecessary sequel since the last game ended so well and this  game does nothing to enhance the  last game's overall story or makes any improvements to gameplay. Though if you enjoyed the last game and wanted more then it is nearly guaranteed you will love this.  It is definitely more of the same but if that is what you want than this would be a great purchase.","February 23, 2015","true","31.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But the combat is still unchanged and as hilariously unbalanced as the first game.  I played through with a Jedi Consular and obliterated everything as soon as I had the Force Lightning tree available to me.  To boot, as a Dark Sider with Force Crush, all I had to for all the end game bosses was literally stand perfectly still and spam that power over and over again.  It deals ridiculous amounts of damage, disables the target and is irresistable, meaning you effectively stop them from responding so long as you have force points.  And you can get a looooooot of +Max force point and regeneration upgrades.\n\nAnd then, jarringly, there are some sections of the game that are stupidly difficult and for all the wrong reasons.  See, if you're like me, you won't spend time optimizing every single party member with the best gear and character builds.  You'll probably have a few favorites you take out.  A lot of the companions, mechanically, are simply redundant.  So when there are sections of the game that FORCE you to play as a SPECIFIC character that you have not paid any attention to, you're in for a terrible time.  At one point I had to beat two melee mini-bosses with Atton.  Atton, who's only real combat strengths involve creeping up and dealing sneak attack damage.  Of course, you don't get to creep up for this fight.  You just start with two Twi'lek bounty hunters breathing down your neck.  I had to cheese that section with mines.\n\nThis game is also a technical mess, even with the recent update.  With my card (AMD R9 200 series) and V-sync on I experienced egregiously distracting frame stutters.  But with V sync turned off, you encounter a bug where your character freezes after finishing combat unless you save/reload.  Thankfully this latter bug is only prevalent for the first few hours of the game for some reason, but it's still worth noting.  Other people have reported many other technical problems, and the game still crashes every so often.\n\nFinally, the story.  This is what you're really here for after all.  The narrative does deliver on most fronts; it's chock full of Star Wars lore and you basically get to experience several events that are considered canonical (although your choices may not be).  The characters are well written and there are a lot of choices to make.  My only gripe with the story was the ending.  Simply put, the ending felt rushed and unfinished.  This might be because I played with the Restored Content mod, but I can't imagine that not having that mod would do anything but make this problem worse.  There are certain cutscenes that are simply not followed upon.  A string of events happens near the last hour of the game and it's never really explained how or why.  I still don't know what happened to most of my companions by the time the credits rolled.  There was only some closure for a couple, with the rest seemingly forgotten about.  It was an underwhelming ending, and really, it just felt unfinished.  Both from a narrative standpoint and from a mechanical one (empty dull corridor after empty dull corridor full of bad guys to Force Storm.)\n\nKOTOR 2 is really the apposite Obsidian game to inform of the stereotype; flawed in just about every aspect, but with redeeming qualities in each, and still enjoyable as a whole.  At about 30-something mostly enjoyable hours for a playthrough, it's still worth a recommendation and the 10 dollar admission price.","August 26, 2015","true","31.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

I'd recommend this game to anyone that has an affinity for a good party based RPG that has some great dialog and story to it.  This game has the problem of being rushed to release though, most of these quirks were covered up by a restoration mod that I used, e.i. low resolution cut scenes, glitches, even adding back in a whole level, but other than those issues there is the problem of the ending still feeling flat and lacking the depth of the rest of the game.  The ending is the main thing to be suffered from being rushed to released but I don't think that should effect whether or not you buy the game.  If you have played the first Knights of the Old Republic the game play is generally the same but really stands out with great dialog and deep characters.

Well KOTOR 2 is like 1 a little too much for my taste. While this is a good game and i absolutley recommend this game take the following into concideration.\n\n1: It looks just like KOTOR 1 graphically wise almost as if they were unable to make any improvment, this isn't much of a problem but its just that KOTOR 1 was in 2003, this in 2005 you are really going to sit there and tell me you didn't have the ablilty to make it look any better than the one made 2 years ago? i know technology doesn't develop fast but the least they could do was give the character rounder noses so you didn't feel like you needed to wear saftey glasses while playing.\n\n2: Exact same battle system and control scheme.\n\n3: The story line does not feel very energetic to me, you are a ex-jedi running from the sith till you can build up enough strength to be able to storm in the capital ship singing "take on me" while slaughtering anything that even looks barely sentient.\n\nOther than that i really enjoy this game and highly recommend it to anyone getting into the star wars franchise 9/10","July 10, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought this game waaay back in 2005 when it was released on four disc format, but in true Obsidian form it was a total buggy mess and throughout the years I kept coming up against game breaking bugs, constant crashes, ever corrupting save files and just plain terrible porting. I decided to put the game on indefinate hiatus until I had some spare time to sit and try and figure it out. The time came and I'm pleased to report I actually finally finished this ♥♥♥♥ing thing. However I am rather disapointed, but I now understand why people see KotoR 1 as the better game, and I agree with them.\n\n- Story is a complete convoluted mess. It tries to be far too cryptic and often trips itself up and reveals things it was trying to keep a secret. The ending really doesn't answer anything and everything just sorta trails off and the credits roll...\n\n- Light and Dark side points are really wonky in the way you can gain or lose them, for example: I was playing as a Light Side Jedi, I rescued a child from being sold to spice miners as a slave and returned her to her mother and then declined a reward, that's worthy of Light Side points right? No. I netted NO Light Side points for that. Another example would be: I asked a simple question to one of my party members that seemed innocent enough, yet I earned a ton of Dark Side points for it and got a net Dark Side shift for my trouble.\n\n- Unless you really, really level and spec into ranged characters (blaster rifles / pistols), ranged characters are almost exclusively useless. Melee beats absoluely everything.\n\n+ "SYSTEMS FAILING MASTER".\n\n? Everything is super ♥♥♥♥ing cryptic and almost nothing makes sense. Very few of your party characters will open up to you even if you have crazy amouns of influence with them. This sorta makes most characters feel really shallow even if their personalities are different. Only person that really even talked to me was the Handmaiden and that took FOREVER.\n\n? Lots of the powers and feats are all backwards. A lot of them end up never getting used. I was granted Master Force Jump very early on, and I only ever saw it used 3 times in the ENTIRE play through.\n\n- Your party / characters get stuck in combat long after all threats have been destroyed.\n\n- Animations are full ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n- It has aged terribly.\n\n- Doesn't run in 1920x1080 or higher resolutions unless you do some .ini file tampering.\n\n- Crashes a lot.\n\n+ Lightsaber construction and general weapon / armor upgrading is pretty cool. Nice to be able to totally personalise a lightsaber to what you want to use it for.\n\n- The Jedi Masters are total ♥♥♥♥♥. Especially Vrook.\n\n+ The game doesn't hold your hand, you're largley left to explore things for yourself or consult your journal if you need finer details on what you need to do. However, it doesn't help you keep track of side quests very well and you lose a few in translation. But yeah, not having the Skyrim "X marks the spot QUEST IS HERE, DUMBASS" leaves a lot of the decisions down to the player and has them actively searching around the environment instead of just following the minimap with a big X on it.\n\nRecommended if you enjoy Star Wars and RPGs and you have the time to sit and play it. Not recomended if you're a new comer to RPGs or not a Star Wars fan. Since I'm a Star Wars fan and RPG veteran then I am going to recommend it.\n\nDespite all the negatives I've pointed out. Overall, KotoR 2 isn't bad, but it's not good either. It provides a good Star Wars RPG experience and a reasonable extention after the original KotoR. However, the original KotoR is the best of the two games. I love you Obsidian, I really do, but KotoR 2 just wasn't that hot, sorry.","June 1, 2014","true","57.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But the reason I love it so much is because of my best friend and the best 5 years of my life.\nIt all started on Christmas day 2008, I was an excited kid ready to open his gift, and guess what it was, an actual never-before opened copy of Star Wars Knights Of the Old Republic II. I was allowed to play the game afterwards and at first I found it quite confusing, but now it's like a third language to me. But now let's get into why this game is really special. Every weekend, if I was lucky, my best friend and I would have a sleep over at each others house. Every weekend we would play star wars knights of the old republic, we would always take turns, playing with our own and each others characters. but then in 2010 our dog rummaged through my games, and decided to destroy my copy of this game. It's needless to say that I was furious. But the thing is, that only cd3 and 4 broke, the other two were completely damaged. This meant that I could only play this at my friend's house, but we didn't mind. Me and my friend played it untill our very last year together, before I moved.\n\nI rate this game, and the memories that come with it 999999999999/10\n\nLive long Hornik Hayne","July 26, 2014","true","80.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

These will allow you to play the game as closely to how the Obsidian development team originally wanted the game to be played. This is easily my favorite Star Wars game to date, and it is also in my Top 5 favorite games of all-time. At the time of this review, I have only played 1 playthrough on Steam. I completely engulfed myself in the game and did not skip through any cutscenes or dialogue. I did skip through Peragus though (because I find it to be more of a tutorial level than anything) by using the Skip Peragus mod.\n\nPros:\n- The main questline is very elaborate and well thought out. There are also many sidequests to do along the way that will enhance your view of the galaxy.\n- The seemingly unimportant dialogue choices you make during the game can have significant effects down the road.\n- I felt that this game was much more visually appealing than the original KotOR. It also seemed to me that the game ran smoother as well, although that might just be me.\n- The characters that join you along the way have their own pasts and interesting stories.\n- Subpoint: Depending if you are Light Side or Dark Side or Male or Female, you get different allies along the way. You can also influence them more depending on which way you side.\n- Many unique and interesting force powers learned along the way.\n- There is a "prestige" system setup for later in the game. In the beginning you can choose what type of Jedi you will be (Guardian, Sentinel, or Consular), but around level 20 you are given the option to become a better version of one of those.\n\nCons:\n- The game does have its bugs (the TSLRCM should fix most of those problems though).\n- Gaining the influence of your allies is often difficult, or even impossible, if you are of a different force side as them (i.e if you are a Jedi, it'll be harder to gain influence from one of your allies who leans more towards the dark side).\n- I wish there was just a little bit more to the end of the game. *SPOILERS* I felt that after you defeat Darth Traya, you should be able to go back, see how your decisions affected the Republic, and then go off into the Unknown Regions in search of Revan.\n- There are places where I thought were just a bit too thin. Like could they have given us a little bit more?\n- Even though the game supposedly levels up as you do, you basically are able to just plow through everyone without even trying.\n\nConclusion: 9/10\nMay the Force be with You.","June 30, 2015","true","56.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Many people seem to consider this game a disappointment after KOTOR I, but I played KOTOR I first and still prefer KOTOR II by orders of magnitude.\n\nIn KOTOR II, you're playing as the Exile, a (you guessed it) exiled Jedi whose connection to the force was severed when he or she chose to walk away. As you progress, you slowly regain your character's former strength, and the main plot has you hunting down your former Jedi masters to either save or destroy them, depending on how you want to handle the situation.\n\nKOTOR II has excellent writing, first and foremost. Its moral choices are great, much better than those found in KOTOR I (which is a game I love dearly).  It has a better cast of villains that KOTOR I, which is something that can make or break a good story. The cast of party members is great, and your influence over them will affect their appearance, their demeanor, and even their skills. Many of the people who join your crew can be trained into Jedi (or Sith) if your influence over them is high enough, which is a great feature.\n\nA big difference between KOTOR I and KOTOR II is that in KOTOR II, you begin the game as a Jedi. It takes quite some time to be able to get your first lightsaber (although you can fast track the process by making the right choices), but starting out as a Jedi lets you build your character that way from the beginning, instead of KOTOR I's awkward pre-Jedi class system. Furthermore, when you reach a high enough level, you can choose a specialization for your character which grants new and unique abilities depending on your choice.\n\nIt's true that this game has a lot of cut content, but we live in the age of The Sith Lords Restored Content mod, which takes an already great game and makes it into an undeniably better game that its predecessor. I cannot recommend that mod enough. Way back when, Obsidian was forced to rush KOTOR II out the door. As a result, a lot of planned content was cut.

I still can't think of the Force the same way after playing this game. It's examination of what the Force is and what is means to connect to it, Jedi or Sith. There is a depth to the story that few books, games, movies, comics, or any other media can touch. There are hard choices and a hardness to the story that truly makes it stand out among it's peers. KoToR 1 was A New Hope, bright and hopeful, black and white, just touching on the edges of a deep and murky pool. KoToR 2 is Empire Strikes Back. The true depth of the universe is unveiled and it is a much more serious and grey, melancholy and doubt and revelation intertwined.\n\nThe combat is wonderful. Using a d20 based combat system the options are limitless and powerful. By the end of the game you truly feel like a seasoned Sith or Jedi Master, crushing armies with a gesture.\n\nThe recent update has made the game even better. Bugfixes and native widescreen support alongside the Steam Workshop. The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) in nearly required. It adds tons of content and story that was cut for reasons left unexplained.\n\nBuy it, play it, remember it in 10 years and wonder how you can change the galaxy the next time.","July 31, 2015","true","55.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the combat may be a bit boring (read MMO-esk), the writing of this game is superb. And while it takes time to get past some of the early stuff, it eventually hooks you and it makes you feel like you must see where the plot line will go. Companions are excellently written and while you may not agree with all of them from the beginning, it really feels that you are given ability to guide and teach them through dialogue and your actions. And most of the time it feels like you have options that actually reflect your set of mind for each situation with companions and quests. There are some fetch quest type of tasks that are a bit boring but most of the bigger quest lines are interesting and well written and feel meaningful.\n\nController support worked fine, if felt adequate for the game and I didn't miss mouse and keyboard for controlling the game. Workshop support was nice addition, it streamlined the installation of the mods.\n\nIf you are willing to set aside moderate amount of time, go through a bit plain beginning and somewhat dull combat, this game has some of the best writing I have ever encountered in gaming.","August 11, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Personally I think the sith lords is heavily underrrated compared to the first game in the series.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as the first games with a couple of tweaks but not much but needless to say it plays well for it's time.\n\nWhat really got to me was the story, it was downright dark and bleak compared to KOTOR 1's plot and that was something I loved about this. The story spared no punches and even parts of it's themes dissected the star wars universe and mythos allowing us to see it in new ways and ask some questions about it. The story was pretty deep and had some unique characters which is why the expanded universe retcon was such a heavy blow for fans like myself(but we have the clone wars etc we're good LOL111)\n\nBut snark aside this is a good game. If you enjoyed the first one then you will most likely enjoy this but I would say it's worth getting the lost content mod because it restores a lot of meat to the game. theres also a couple of other mods worth hunting down to polish things and add a few extras if that floats your boat.","May 7, 2015","true","31.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is HIGHLY recommended that you play with this mod as it fixes a lot of bugs/glitches as well as restore lost content. It brings the game closer to the original intentions of the developers\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ The game has a lot of robust options in how you build your character. You start by choosing between 3 classes: Guardian, Consular or Sentinel. Each class obviously focuses on different aspects of combat. Further in the game you can then further specialize your classes. You can fully customize your character how you wish between attributes, skills, feats and Jedi powers. All of this leads to many different options and replayability in how you design your character\n\n+ The core aspect of the game is that as you can either play as a Jedi that is good or evil. Saving people, being kind and choosing the peaceful solution leads you to the light side while doing the opposite leads you to the dark side. Doing so leads to certain bonuses to your Jedi Powers. Being good means Light side powers will use less mana and dark side powers cost more and vice versa. I find the system to be very effective because it ties morality choices into game play, a feature that seems to be very lacking in today's modern games.\n\n+ The second core aspect is how you respond and handle situations with your party members. You can gain or lose influence with them. If you gain enough influence with any particular party member, new dialogue options open up resulting in more background to the story, and/or stat increases for you or your party member. It is not mandatory as you can easily complete the game without gaining any influence with anybody but it adds a nice touch to the game and offers more options.\n\n+ The story, although confusing in the beginning because it throws so much at you does get increasingly better. The story is presented very well because of the great dialogue options and fantastic writing. Obsidian is easily one of the best in the industry regarding writing.\n\n+ If there is any company that can match or exceed Bioware in writing for npc characters its Obsidian. Every party member that joins you in your quest is well written and interesting. Every party member has alternative motives for joining you which makes things more exciting and not every party member gets along with each other. These ideas are explored the further you progress in the game.\n\n+ Every planet you visit feels different. The game throws a few twists in for good measure to keep things fresh.\n\n+ Well written Side Quests\n\n+ mods\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nSadly there was no improvement with combat. The combat in the game is really showing its age. I never particularly liked the combat because it's not very engaging.\n\nCertain force powers, skills, feats are game breaking while others are completely useless.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The UI especially navigating to find items in your inventory is a chore and frustrating. The inventory screen is a long list of your items. There are options to filter the list based on specific items but this doesn't fix the overall problem of a bad overall inventory management system.\n\n- The game forces you to do solo missions either as yourself or one of your party members. These sections are frustrating and awful only because the combat was never designed around solo play. This problem is further compounded if you auto-leveled up any of your party members. Playing a solo section with a party member that has all the wrong attributes/skills/feats is painful.\n\n- Last few areas have cut and paste environments. Obvious that development was rushed at the end.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nA worthy follow up to one of the best RPG's for its time. Obsidian once again shows that it is one of the best when it comes to writing a great story with great characters. It's sad that it takes a mod to fix a lot of the problems with the game. If you loved the first game then there is no reason not to love this one as well.\n","May 26, 2015","true","31.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are so many ways to complete quests and different dialogue choices that change the story. The combat can be unbalanced when you get your first lightsaber and you just spam master flurry attack. Once you get a lightsaber, there is no better weapon and you might as well duel-wield them rather than go two-handed as you do more damage overall. You actually don't get your first lightsaber until 7-10 hours into the game. Instead you have to build it by completing optional quests (make sure to look up the Nar Shadaa one, it is very easy to screw up the quest that gives you a part). The lightsaber is teased multiple times throughout the first two planets, but it isn't a let down when you get it. Instead, it opens up new unlockable moves such as using force jump to jump thirty feet and stab a guy and a dialogue tree to become a true Jedi or Sith, which unlocks more moves!\nTLDR: If you can get around the crashes and performance issues, you can find an experience akin to Bioware's Mass Effect series (they also made KoTR1) and Fallout New Vegas (which was also made by Obsidian).\n\nUpdate: Whelp, they updated the game. Now there aren't any bugs, crashes, or performance issues. Now you can also use a controller, which is awesome as I first played this on the original Xbox. The story is still pretty sweet and so is the combat, but it can be quite unforgiving if you don't pay attention and blaze through everything without reading (Hint: you may think force speed is trash, but it allows you to attack two extra times each turn you attack. Master flurry also gives you an extra attack with no downsides, so spend those rare upgrade points wisely!)","July 21, 2015","true","60.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I had it on my original Xbox as a kid and never realized how deep the story or the game is if you dive into it fully. It changes you, and changes with you. Sometimes, you just want to be a powerful badass who blows away every enemy in the universe. Other times, you want to spend the whole game just helping people down to the smallest tasks. That's the beauty of this game. If you have not played the original KOTOR, I would recommend them both highly. My only wish is that they should have allowed more of a "grey" side approach of neutrality, as things in the world are over all pretty dualistic. It's a beautiful game and I would highly recommend.","July 30, 2015","true","64.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Dust/recommended/208580/","_Dust","Homura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Dust/","184 products in account","This is an interesting take on Star Wars, the Old Republic timeline. KOTOR 1 was astronomically critically successful, so I'll assume familiarity with that. This sequel to that legendary RPG takes things further and is 100% worth your time.\n\nBioware's KOTOR 1 was about Good vs Evil, and was groundbreaking with its moral decisions and player agency. Obsidian's KOTOR 2 is a deconstruction of the more normal Good vs Evil themes - it goes deeper into questions of what makes right and what makes wrong. It's not just about choosing to be good or choosing to be bad - Obsidian put more effort into making the themes more nuanced than that, and often the player will second-guess their choices and think very carefully about such things as greater goods, or ends justifying means - moreso than in the more straight forward KOTOR 1, anyway.\n\nKOTOR 1 is a great game and one of my all-time favorite RPGs. KOTOR 2 one-ups it in narrative and maintains the same gameplay and structure that made KOTOR 1 great.\n\nBe sure to get the Sith Lords Restored mod that is on the Steam Workshop. KOTOR 2 was originally released in quite a rushed state (as Obsidian games unfortunately often are) but that mod "restores" much of the missing content and really improves the base game.\n\n","July 21, 2015","true","40.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Разработка длилась чуть больше года и на выходе мы получили нечто.\nВ плане технологий все осталось прежне, но в остальном произошли серьезные изменения: Obsidian, как всегда, погналась за "разнообразием и глубиной", пичкая игру совершенно ненужным контентом (Система крафта, миссии за напарников - летать дроидом перед финальной миссией по заезженным локациям и минировать чертовы корабли - бред же). В итоге, огромнейшее количество контента пришлось вырезать - отсюда последняя треть игры просто скомкана: что происходит, понять практически невозможно. Персонажи без каких-либо разговоров и мотивации разделяются, происходят какие-то невнятные вещи (Например, ГГ в одиночку  прорывается просто через армию ситхов к финальному боссу. И там, ВНИЗАПНА, узнается, что все напарники находятся в соседней с боссом комнате (WTH?? и почему бы изначально вместе туда не пойти?) и после битвы они улетают на корабле прочь с планеты... только минут 20 назад до битвы с боссом показывали, как корабль сорвался в расщелину и, вроде как, разбился...).\nАтмосфера. Вместо атмосферы космического приключения, как это было в оригинальном KotOR, мы получили атмосферу уныния и безысходности (Вобщем, темное рпг), что никак не соответствует серии Star Wars.\nТак что, Obsidian, вы облажались. Очевидно, что игра продалась только из-за названия, популярность которому успешно сделала Bioware.\nХотя, то что Obsidian пыталась учесть каноны первой части меня порадовало.","August 1, 2013","true","32.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And it's also got brilliant writing in general, intelligent gameplay, non-linearity, and it is so, so, much better than the original in every way possible. Be forewarned, you should download the Restored Content Mod and M4-78 to get the full experience, though.\n\n\nOh, and it's best to pretend The Old Republic doesn't exist if you want to enjoy the story.","June 27, 2014","true","127.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greywardenrogue/recommended/208580/","greywardenrogue","trivan_23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greywardenrogue/","204 products in account","In KotOR I, the underlying question was always "Are you good or evil?" In Obsidian's KotOR 2: The Sith Lords, the question quickly becomes "What is good? What is evil?"\n\nThis is the key difference between the two, because otherwise not much has changed. There are little improvements, such as being able to influence your companions in more meaningful ways, perhaps even in ways they don't agree with. But the main differences, which sets it apart from its predecessor by miles and miles, are the characters, the story, and its almost critical treatment of the Star Wars universe.\n\nKotOR I was an amazing game that faithfully translated the Star Wars Experience. You have a crew, you travel through space, you become a Jedi, you face the temptations of the dark side, and challenge an evil force in the galaxy. But for all its achievements, it was a very black/white experience with very little gray area. In fact, BioWare seemed to draw some novelty of the fact it introduced a "Gray Jedi" in the form of Jolee Bindo, who was neither good nor evil.\n\nFor Obsidian's outing, *everything* resides in that gray area, not just one character. Every decision you make will be called into question; your profound acts of charity will be deemed selfish and ignorant, while your outrageous acts of tyranny will be deemed weak and cowardly. If you go by the morality scale KotOR I favored, you will not be able to win, and that's really the point. There are no absolutes in life -- giving some credits to a beggar on Nar Shaddaa will get him beaten and robbed later on, and treating the same beggar with malice will encourage him to treat others in the same manner -- and the game's characters will encourage you to make informed decisions over choices made solely to improve your good/evil alignment.\n\nThis makes Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 - The Sith Lords a tremendously engaging experience as far as immersion, choice, and consequence, with memorable characters who strive to be more than the SW archetypes we've become familiar with, and a masterful story that dives into dark territory that few storytellers in the Expanded Universe have bothered to touch. It's a very unique experience and, in my opinion, boasts some of the finest writing in a video game, period.\n\nIt's an old game, but a great one -- and one that's stuck with me for nearly a decade. If you decide to take the leap, be sure and download the KotOR 2 Restoration Mod for the definitive experience.","June 27, 2014","true","26.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One of the most engaging stories of any RPG I've ever played and manages to stay fresh even after so many years. Dialogue and character development were impeccable, especially Kreia, being one of the deepest and profound characters I've encountered in any video game. The amount of ways you can play through the campaign is boggling, I've run through this game about 4 times and still I feel like there were things that I missed.\n\nThe Restored Content Mod is vital to anyone who's played this game before. It gives a more satisfying ending as well as some extra cutscenes.\n\nWouldn't recomment the M4-78 Mod though. Though enticing as the prospect of an extra planet is, the maps were horribly designed and badly paced. It physically pained me to play M4-78.\n\nPLAY. THIS.

Fortunately, you can play this one without having played the first one, because alot of the previous game's events are discussed at length. This game also features one of my favorite Star Wars universe characters OF ALL TIME, which is Kreia. She is a very mysterious character who you meet at the beginning of the game. Throughout the story, she is an extremely important figure who lives the grey area between Jedi and Sith and who serves as a mentor to your character. Pay ALOT of attention to everything she does and you'll see what I mean when I say she's one of the most interesting people in Star Wars lore. As for everything else, the turn-based combat is solidly constructed, the characters and dialogue are pretty well-written and the graphics aren't half bad for an old Xbox game. Be prepared to play through a few times to get all the dialogue trees for each character unlocked. Not one of them is a waste of time, as each can strengthen your allies and your own character as well. You can also train the majority of your party to become Force users, which is cool.","December 15, 2012","true","259.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is the same (fast turn-based) and is a true RPG but it doesn't bog you down with too much. The pause feature is also very helpful to plan combat, especially under a hard difficulty. The graphics are unfortunately a bit dated, so they have that early 2000s look. The music is wonderful and one of my favorite gaming soundtracks.\n\nThe characters in KOTOR 2 are unique and you can access their backstories through character influence. There is still a Karma Meter but the main theme of KOTOR 2 is questioning the light/dark or Jedi/Sith dichonomy. The story does have holes due to the unfornuate rush to finish the game. This can best be seen in the ending, However, I would highly recommend the Restored Content Mod, which fixes some plot holes, adds deleted lines and characters, adds cut ending details, and fixes TONS of bugs: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm\n\nDespite the existing holes, the game is great.

It fully captures the feeling from KOTOR and expands on many key features, such as force powers and weapon/armor upgrades. It added many new feats/powers which make your character more specialized or well rounded. You really begin to feel like you are actually interacting with the NPC's on planets and within your own party, due to new dialogue options and the new influence system. Even though it can be buggy and has its fair share of glitchs, it is still easy to pick up and is an amazing sequel. (SPOILERS START HERE->) I was really pleased with how you are able to convert certain members of your party into Jedi of various classes, and how you can acquire different companions based of your gender and elignment. I also enjoyed how HK-47 was in the game. The only issue i had was  at the end, when you meet with the Jedi masters on Dantooine. I felt like i never actually won out when playing light sided characters. I was always branded as a sith, or an enemy, despite my alignment and this really displeases me. I would have liked to be acknowledged for my ability to hear the force once again and rejoin the fight against the Sith, but it seemed that no matter what i did, i kept being branded a traitor and a dark sider. But other than that, the game was top notch, and i recommend it to everyone, especially fans of KOTOR and SWTOR.","July 2, 2014","true","117.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was a huge fan of the first one and fell in love with the second one. You can play this game without playing the first one, but you will miss some references and details. The gameplay is the same (fast turn-based) and is a true RPG but it doesn't bog you down with too much. The pause feature is also very helpful to plan combat, especially under a hard difficulty. The graphics are unfortunately a bit dated, so they have that early 2000s look. The music is wonderful and one of my favorite gaming soundtracks.\n\nThe characters in KOTOR 2 are unique and you can access their backstories through character influence. There is still a Karma Meter but the main theme of KOTOR 2 is questioning the light/dark or Jedi/Sith dichonomy. The story does have holes due to the unfornuate rush to finish the game. This can best be seen in the ending, However, I would highly recommend the Restored Content Mod, which fixes some plot holes, adds deleted lines and characters, adds cut ending details, and fixes TONS of bugs: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm\n\nDespite the existing holes, the game is great.

The game was rushed, and a lot of content cut, no debate, and as a result there is a huge amount of content missing, and a lot of, and when I say a lot of I MEAN A LOT OF BUGS, some which may even be game breaking, to a point where you are forced to restart or go a load way back to a earlier save. (trust me I had to play through this twice to even get half through the game)\n\nNow this can be fixed by installing the TLSCRM mod which, through amazing modders enabled players to play cut content with a lot less bugs, as well as fixed and missing dialogue and bug fixes in the game itself, honestly I can´t even think of how I would´ve gotten through the game without this mod.\n\nAnyway conlusively this game is definitly worth it for the story, the combat is meh, and is sadly bug ravaged, execpt with the TLSCRM mod, which is practially essential.","June 9, 2015","true","104.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While Kotor 1 is my favorite of the two, Kotor 2 is still a great game, with an original story and some of the most brilliant writing i have seen in a video game.\n\nThe reason that i think this game does not get as much credit as the first one, is because it has a much more darker story compared to the first one. While Kotor has the traditional Star Wars story, where it is Good Vs. Evil (which is delivered in an amazing way through it's characters), Kotor 2 instead has a much more philosophical perspective on the Force. They make you question both the Jedi and the Sith, and shows that the Force is more complex, instead of it being just black and white. However, most people seem to prefer the traditonal story instead, which is why this does not get as much attention.\n\nOf course, this game has one big flaw. It was rushed and was therefore released in a rather unfinished state. But this can be resolved by getting the Restored Content Mod, which restores a lot of the content that was cut from the game. And just like the First one, you can also download a lot of mods to the game, that makes it even more awesome.\n\nThis was kind of a crappy review, but i just wanted to shortly explain why this is a great game, and why you should get it.\nIf you do get it, it is a must to download the Restored Content Mod, because it makes the game more enjoyable.\n\nMy Verdict: 8.5/10 (vanilla version)\n9/10 (With Restored Content Mod)","February 27, 2014","true","57.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

See, I got it on release and remember the sheer, unfiltered hate that this game recieved.  This was pretty much all because it wasn't KOTOR 1 - a by-the-numbers RPG with a hot jedi lady and redeemed by a masterful plot twist.   Reading the hate was like visiting the COD forum, bland idiocy about how Atton wasn't Carth (Thank God for that, he's one of the most boring characters ever) - or how there wasn't an easy surrogate for Bastilla in this game (OMFG NO WAIFU?!?! what am I gonna dooooooO!)\n\nIn fact this pretty mucy sums up Kotor2 in a nutshell.  It has a far darker, more complex story than the first with fewer cliches and cop outs - and of course Kreia, one of the best characters ever in a game.\n\nAlthough the cut content in the original did give the second half of the game a very appropriate feeling of desolate emptiness, the restoration patch greatly improves the overall quality of the game and, though the barren finale somehow made sense to me in vanilla (how appropriate, given what we know about the exile?), it's far superior with the restored content.\n\nMaybe finally people will wake up and realize that this game is better than the original.","July 24, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I enjoyed it much more than I did its prequel.\n\nThe primary reason for this is Kreia, who is by far my favorite [spoiler alert] villain in the Star Wars canon. She is definitely one of the most evil. Her obsession with the Exile resolves into being a hatred of the Force. To her, it forcefully imposes direction on an aimless and pointless reality. Even more glaring is when the Force leaves one who is accustomed to its presence. Having seen existence through the underlying fabric that connects all life, only to be betrayed by it: one is deserted and worse than blind. The Exile is a hole in the Force, beautiful to her. But more than this, the Exile herself abandoned the Force.\n\nKreia's ultimate plan is to achieve by the means of the Exile what was accomplished at Malachor V at the close of the Mandalorian Wars, but on a larger scale: to create a ripple in the Force that would never cease, deafening all of life to the Force's presence by further opening the wound in it. In the end, it seemed to me that Kreia was not much of the Sith that she worked under the pretense of being.\n\nThere are more worthwhile elements to the game, but Kreia was by far my favorite. As far as characters go, though, HK-47 was a close second. It is worth getting him as early as possible just to work your way through all of his dialogue. A few of them come to mind.\n\n"Consolation: But I would not worry, Master, I imagine it will not be long before their murderous hands try to seize you by the throat. Twi'lek Metaphor: It seems like they are attracted to you like krek beetles during the Bright Land seasons."\n\n"Statement: Oh, I am aware of that, Master. I simply use it to give you the illusion of control and obedience. Humans often need such comforts until the end comes." To which you can reply, "What do you mean, 'the end?'"\n\n"Conclusion: You have just shown me your soft, meatbag-like underbellies, and said, 'HK-47, please shoot me repeatedly there until I die.'"\n\nOne final note: some people have said that this game is difficult. This is not exactly true if you know what you're doing. If you don't, then yes this game can be very difficult. Having a little background in the game mechanics goes a very long way. I've found that all you really need in order to very easily beat the game on the hardest difficulty is to have spent most of your attribute points in dexterity along with getting Master Speed, Master Flurry, and Lightsaber Finesse. You don't need these things, but I did and I faced all of the major bosses in my starting clothing as a Sentinel; I was basically untouchable. Really, if you understand the game mechanics, then you can play the game hundreds of different ways and still get through it without too much struggle on your part.\n\nIn spite of this, there are some extremely difficult parts where the game forces you to play as another member of your party. Here are some tips to make it much easier:\n\n1. As you will have too many credits to spend near the end, breakdown a lot of your things rather than selling them and make the best plasma mines. Make sure Atton and Mira have good skill levels in demoltions so that you can defeat Darth Sion and Hanharr, respectively, by simply running away and setting mines.\n\n2. The HK-47 mission can be difficult, so make sure that you have saved all of the droid shields you've collected throughout the game. You're going to need them. It would also be good to have made a lot of construction kits up to this point.\n\n3. When you first defeat Hanharr with Mira (use plasma mines), you will have to fight a lot of Ubese. Save yourself the trouble and run away from them, going to the door that triggers switching back to the Exile. I cannot remember how to get to this door, but if you look up a walkthrough, it will tell you better than I could.\n\n4. The one part that was difficult for me while playing as the Exile was leaving Nar Shaddaa after having talked with the Jedi there. You face tons of HK-50's. If you haven't gone to Dantooine yet, then you won't have a lightsaber. Blaster bolt deflection is a must-have, otherwise these HK-50's are extremely difficult.\n\n5. Save yourself the pain of playing through Peragus for the first time and just use a walkthrough. The first turn-off most people have is how long and boring Peragus is. If you know what to do, though, it is not so long and, actually, not so boring as most people say.\n\nMaybe I've dumbed this down too much. In any case, I don't have anything else to say.

I would rate this port for Steam 9/10 from the original's rating i would give (10/10) because it took me about 5-10 minutes of research to get it to play on newer OS systems. Which to get it to run wasn't to much of a hassel (honestly a couple clicks of a button thanks to help from two other Steam clients) The game seems to run like it's CD counter part and i haven't experienced any glitches yet, which in all respect no game is perfect. There's always flaws and exspecially with and older game expect many fun and heart breaking glitches. This game should be for any RPG gamer or Star Wars fan. Which i am of both. The graphics maybe a bit out dated but they're tolerable,and if you're like me you actually prefer the older graphics ( i know i'm weird) but older graphics don't seem to bother me. BUT if you're the type of gamer who can't stand old,out dated graphics then i'm sure somewheres you can find a mod for this game because any PC gamer needs to and should play this.

Which to get it to run wasn't to much of a hassel (honestly a couple clicks of a button thanks to help from two other Steam clients) The game seems to run like it's CD counter part and i haven't experienced any glitches yet, which in all respect no game is perfect. There's always flaws and exspecially with and older game expect many fun and heart breaking glitches. This game should be for any RPG gamer or Star Wars fan. Which i am of both. The graphics maybe a bit out dated but they're tolerable,and if you're like me you actually prefer the older graphics ( i know i'm weird) but older graphics don't seem to bother me. BUT if you're the type of gamer who can't stand old,out dated graphics then i'm sure somewheres you can find a mod for this game because any PC gamer needs to and should play this. Willl update review when more hours get put into this game but for now this is my Review via 4 hours into it.

If you're looking for more KOTOR, then you must play this(get the restored content mod, otherwise I hear this game is pretty awful, this and a few other force power mods made my playthrough really fun). If you weren't a fan of the original, then you definitely won't be liking this one. Story is worse and some of the characters aren't very interesting. A few cast members from the first game show up, and the few new characters seem pretty much like new versions of old ones. Still, I'd definitely recommend it for any RPG fan, and a must play for a huge KOTOR fan like myself.","March 10, 2015","true","57.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfire242/recommended/208580/","coldfire242","Cold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfire242/","44 products in account","[UPDATE: THIS GAME NOW HAS ACHIEVEMENTS AND FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT.]\nTen years after it's initial release in 2005 this game released an update that supports achievements and higher resolutions. I know this is a timeless classic but for a developer to care about this game after so long is astonishing to me, and should be congratulated and praised for the effort put into bringing these amazing games to a new generation.\n\nA long time ago, LucasArts actually made quality titles like Battlefront and Republic Commando. Leading the troop was the Knights of the Old Republic franchise. Now before you play this game, I strongly recommend purchasing the first KotOR game.\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is an amazing game. You don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to enjoy this title. It has everything you would expect from an RPG, and also everything you would expect from a Star Wars game. Unlike other games under the Star Wars name that have you blasting and swinging your lightsaber around an area of helpless battle droids and such, KotOR II is somewhat unique in a sense of accomplishment. There are many times where instead of activating your lightsaber and cutting everyone down, you'll have to find your way out of sticky situations with reason or wit. The key to being a good KotOR player is judging when to engage a firefight or when to think things through. Do you attack that Rancor head-on or do you sneak over and poison it's food?\n\nThis doesn't mean you'll never see combat. In Knights of the Old Republic II you start off choosing what JEDI class you want to be, (which includes Sentinel, Consular, or Guardian) rather than picking if you want to be a Soldier, Scout, or Scoundrel. This means that right from the get-go of the game you'll have the ability to start stacking up on Force Powers you're going to need in the future. Depending on what you pick, your play style will change.\n\nGuardians focus on swordfighting and combat rather than force powers and skills.\n\nSentinels mediate between the two, balancing out between swordplay and sorcery.\n\nConsulars are extremely powerful in the force.\n\nJust like the original KotOR, you will start picking skills and feats that allow you to perform various actions. If you put a lot of skill points into Persuasion, you can talk your way out of scenarios before it breaks out into a battlefield. Spend a lot of points on Computer Use or Repair, you can slice into control consoles or reactivate droids to get leverage on your enemies. Then there are skills like Treat Injury and such that allow you to heal wounds faster and give you more HP.\n\nKotOR 2 brings a new feature to the franchise, and allows you to use components and chemicals to create / breakdown items. You can break down a Vibrosword and turn it into components, and then use the broken down components to build a Frag Grenade or Mine.\n\nIn summary, KotOR II is not only a great Star Wars game but one of the best RPG's ever created. The story and cast will keep you interested, and the gorgeous worlds from the jungle moon of Dxun to the Czerka Starport of Telos offer tons of chances to explore.\n\n(Plus, be sure to download the Restored Content mod if you plan on purchasing this game, as it adds in TONS of content that was deleted by Obisidan due to time contraints.)","March 24, 2014","true","71.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well KOTOR 2 is like 1 a little too much for my taste. While this is a good game and i absolutley recommend this game take the following into concideration.\n\n1: It looks just like KOTOR 1 graphically wise almost as if they were unable to make any improvment, this isn't much of a problem but its just that KOTOR 1 was in 2003, this in 2005 you are really going to sit there and tell me you didn't have the ablilty to make it look any better than the one made 2 years ago? i know technology doesn't develop fast but the least they could do was give the character rounder noses so you didn't feel like you needed to wear saftey glasses while playing.\n\n2: Exact same battle system and control scheme.\n\n3: The story line does not feel very energetic to me, you are a ex-jedi running from the sith till you can build up enough strength to be able to storm in the capital ship singing "take on me" while slaughtering anything that even looks barely sentient.\n\nOther than that i really enjoy this game and highly recommend it to anyone getting into the star wars franchise 9/10","July 10, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought this game waaay back in 2005 when it was released on four disc format, but in true Obsidian form it was a total buggy mess and throughout the years I kept coming up against game breaking bugs, constant crashes, ever corrupting save files and just plain terrible porting. I decided to put the game on indefinate hiatus until I had some spare time to sit and try and figure it out. The time came and I'm pleased to report I actually finally finished this ♥♥♥♥ing thing. However I am rather disapointed, but I now understand why people see KotoR 1 as the better game, and I agree with them.\n\n- Story is a complete convoluted mess. It tries to be far too cryptic and often trips itself up and reveals things it was trying to keep a secret. The ending really doesn't answer anything and everything just sorta trails off and the credits roll...\n\n- Light and Dark side points are really wonky in the way you can gain or lose them, for example: I was playing as a Light Side Jedi, I rescued a child from being sold to spice miners as a slave and returned her to her mother and then declined a reward, that's worthy of Light Side points right? No. I netted NO Light Side points for that. Another example would be: I asked a simple question to one of my party members that seemed innocent enough, yet I earned a ton of Dark Side points for it and got a net Dark Side shift for my trouble.\n\n- Unless you really, really level and spec into ranged characters (blaster rifles / pistols), ranged characters are almost exclusively useless. Melee beats absoluely everything.\n\n+ "SYSTEMS FAILING MASTER".\n\n? Everything is super ♥♥♥♥ing cryptic and almost nothing makes sense. Very few of your party characters will open up to you even if you have crazy amouns of influence with them. This sorta makes most characters feel really shallow even if their personalities are different. Only person that really even talked to me was the Handmaiden and that took FOREVER.\n\n? Lots of the powers and feats are all backwards. A lot of them end up never getting used. I was granted Master Force Jump very early on, and I only ever saw it used 3 times in the ENTIRE play through.\n\n- Your party / characters get stuck in combat long after all threats have been destroyed.\n\n- Animations are full ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n- It has aged terribly.\n\n- Doesn't run in 1920x1080 or higher resolutions unless you do some .ini file tampering.\n\n- Crashes a lot.\n\n+ Lightsaber construction and general weapon / armor upgrading is pretty cool. Nice to be able to totally personalise a lightsaber to what you want to use it for.\n\n- The Jedi Masters are total ♥♥♥♥♥. Especially Vrook.\n\n+ The game doesn't hold your hand, you're largley left to explore things for yourself or consult your journal if you need finer details on what you need to do. However, it doesn't help you keep track of side quests very well and you lose a few in translation. But yeah, not having the Skyrim "X marks the spot QUEST IS HERE, DUMBASS" leaves a lot of the decisions down to the player and has them actively searching around the environment instead of just following the minimap with a big X on it.\n\nRecommended if you enjoy Star Wars and RPGs and you have the time to sit and play it. Not recomended if you're a new comer to RPGs or not a Star Wars fan. Since I'm a Star Wars fan and RPG veteran then I am going to recommend it.\n\nDespite all the negatives I've pointed out. Overall, KotoR 2 isn't bad, but it's not good either. It provides a good Star Wars RPG experience and a reasonable extention after the original KotoR. However, the original KotoR is the best of the two games. I love you Obsidian, I really do, but KotoR 2 just wasn't that hot, sorry.","June 1, 2014","true","57.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nar Sadarr is full of wasted space and bugs glore despite the fixes. A lot of times I asked myself: "Seriously? That's the answer." Or I say, "Why aren't you attacking me? . . . OK -- NOW you attack me."\n2. Combat is becomes boring once you level up too high.\n3. The main character becomes god-like on the normal level.\n4. Because good item drops aren't very common, you have to buy new equipment to fight with other party members. It seems almost like the game punishes you for choosing to adventure with different characters. They don't really interact well with the world. Even during events where you'd expect them to say something, they say nothing.\n5.

It was cheaper than a PC, and my roomate had gotten me hooked. It was one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I'd had. Now that I'm back on a PC, I decided to pick up KOTOR 1 & 2 on a Steam sale. Boy, am I ever glad that I did.\n\nThis game, in particular, really caught the struggle of a Jedi trying to do what's right, despite the over-bearing Council and their antiquated view of having white vs. black ideals. It is a study in what it means to be Jedi or Sith, showing an overwhelming need for thinking more skewed towards the gray. It was once said that only Sith deal in absolutes, but this duo of games prove that is not the case. It is as much the harbingers of the Light as those of the Dark that are to blame for the state of things in the galaxy; the death, suffering, and loss included.\n\nEach side seeks to eliminate the other to bring about balance. Absolutes of Light and Dark, by their very nature, forbid balance. Balance can only be achieved if both exist... or neither.\n\nThis story is worth your $10.\n\nMastered the Light Side and stopped the death of the Force, 11/10 will play ad nauseum.","April 30, 2015","true","51.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This makes it easier to recommend, since the patch allows you to play in higher screen resolutions, has a neat selection of achievements and most imprortantly allows the Steam version to install the famous Restored Content Mod. This replaces a significant amount of the cut scenes and dialogue, thus improving the story a great deal.\n\nn.b. - neither the patch nor the mod fixes the litany of bugs that plague KotOR 2 (some of which can be game breaking). 'The Sith Lords' remains an unfinished game and something of a chore to run - but what works is still very high quality, and now there is more of it.\n\n\n====\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n====\n\nKnights of the Old Republic 2 had an extremely hard act to follow (Bioware's original is damn near perfect) and very little time to do it in. That a game this good was written and put together in only a year speaks volumes about Obsidian's skill with role-playing and story.\n\nGameplay, graphics, sound and pesentation are near identical to KotOR. Though little improvements have been added everywhere from the voice acting to the design of the Jedi robes, it almost feels like a very compehensive mod more than a game of its own. But KotOR's strength is the immersive, rich adventure it adds to the Star Wars mythology, and this sequel wisely puts all of its effort into the same area, with impressive results.\n\nThe plot follows immediately from the original (playing the sequel first is not recommended) and follows a similar structure and creates a similar lead character, but the much darker, more thoughtful tone becomes apparent immediately and just keeps growing. The great strength of KotOR 2 is its cast of characters - especially your mysterious mentor Kreia and sidekick-with-a-past Atton. These two (and a few others) are written and played with a subtlety and depth that the first game lacks even in its best moments, and manage to create a rivalry between the two games. KotOR is consistently fantastic, but KotOR 2 has moments of something better. It's a more cerebral, more thematic, sober affair than almost any other Star Wars story out there, and all the better for it. Where the first game apes the films to a fault, the sequel is compellingly unique.\n\nIt can't be denied that the game is buggy, inconsistent in its difficulty, tone and plot, very linear in places and has a very flawed ending (developers have admitted having to cut large sections to meet unreasonable deadlines) to the point of its last hour being barely compehensible. The first 90% of the game is solid, but newcomers should expect some headscratching during the endgame. It's not a gamebreaker, but it does marr (ha) the overall product.\n\nIts confusing cliffhanger ending was eventually resolved in a disappointing novel from Del Rey, but the game itself may leave you frustrated. That said, the not-quite-finished product is packed with exceptional characters, moments of brilliant dialogue and world-building, and the overall gameplay remains great fun. The game experiments a little too, helping to develop the Bioware-style RPG model: you are able to train followers to become Jedi knights, for example, strongly effecting their character arc and role in gameplay. Some missions require you to play without your party, or without your player character. Puzzles often require creativity and thought and can have multiple outcomes.\n\nFor fans of quality RPG writing and those looking for a darker, more pensive Star Wars - and especially for those who enjoyed KotOR - it's an easy recommend.\nExpect broken rooms, missing voice files and a deeply confusing plot. But for a year's work, it's amazing.","May 10, 2015","true","99.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Otherwise not only will you be missing some very cool dialogue that I wished was there normally, but less bugs will ruin your day. Without the mod the game would be an 8/10.

Thanks to Lucasfilm wanting Christmas money this game was rushed, and a lot of the story had to be cut, even the the audio lines for most of the game were already made. Obsidian was smart and kept those audio files and some of the incomplete areas in some game files. Some modders were able to recreate and add this content over the years, and thanks to the recent Steam workshop support, it is even easier to download these two mods. With the restoration mod, the game is transformed into one of the most well written and thought provoking games that I have ever played. While the first one serves as an excellent homage to the original movies, Kotor II takes the Star Wars formula and flips it over and asks questions morality never seen in a Star Wars game, or any other meda.
